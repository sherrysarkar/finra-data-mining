THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r\n\n          The  administration   of  childhood   vaccines,  though\r\n\ncritically important  to public  health, \"is  not always  without\r\n\nrisk.\"  Committee to Review the Adverse Consequences of Pertussis\r\n\nand Rubella Vaccines,  Institute of Medicine, Adverse  Effects of\r                                                                           \r\n\nPertussis  and  Rubella Vaccines  1 (1991)  (IOM Report).   Since\r                                          \r\n\nvaccines  generally  contain  either dead  bacteria  or  live but\r\n\nweakened viruses, it  is not surprising that they  are capable of\r\n\ncausing  serious   adverse  effects.    See  id.     Despite  the\r                                                          \r\n\ninfrequency  of  such  episodes, Congress  feared  that  the long\r\n\nshadow of tort  liability cast by vaccine-related  injuries would\r\n\ndrive up prices and eventually force vaccine suppliers out of the\r\n\nmarket.  See  H.R. Rep. No. 908,  99th Cong., 2d Sess.  1, 4, 6-7\r                      \r\n\n(1986),  reprinted  in  1986 U.S.C.C.A.N.  6344,  6345,  6347-48.\r                                \r\n\nCongress  also worried that  the vagaries of  litigation, coupled\r\n\nwith the  cost, might  leave many deserving  victims of  vaccine-\r\n\nrelated injuries undercompensated.  See id.\r                                                     \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          To  protect the supply of vaccines while ensuring fair,\r\n\ntimely  compensation  for  victims, Congress  departed  from  the\r\n\ntraditional  tort system and wrote the National Childhood Vaccine\r\n\nInjury Act  (the Act),  Pub. L. No.  99-660, tit. III,  100 Stat.\r\n\n3755 (1986).   Among other things, the Act  established a special\r\n\ntribunal  (the Vaccine  Court),  and moved  vaccine-injury  cases\r\n\npartly  outside the  customary tort  framework.   See  Schafer v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAmerican Cyanamid Co.,  20 F.3d 1, 2 (1st  Cir. 1994) (explaining\r                               \r\n\nthe mechanics of the  Act).1  In respect to  cases brought before\r\n\nthis tribunal, Congress  eased the complainants' burdens  both by\r\n\ndispensing  with the  requirement of  proving  negligence and  by\r\n\ngreatly simplifying  the requisite  proof of  causation.  See  42\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.    300aa-11.  Of course, there are tradeoffs; for example,\r\n\nCongress  limited the  damages  that a  victim  could obtain  for\r\n\nvaccine-related injuries.  See id.   300aa-15.\r                                            \r\n\n          In  aid  of  the neoteric  regulatory  regime,  the Act\r\n\nprovides, in tabular format, a listing of vaccines and a parallel\r\n\nlisting of medical conditions commonly associated with the use of\r\n\neach  vaccine.   See id.    300aa-14(a).   These  listings, known\r                                  \r\n\ncollectively  as  the  Vaccine  Injury  Table  (the  Table),  are\r\n\naccompanied  by,   and  are   to  be  read   in  light   of,  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  Act  does  not   entirely  supplant  traditional  tort\r\nremedies.   An injured person is required  to repair first to the\r\nVaccine Court,  but if she is  not satisfied with the  result she\r\nmay  reject the judgment  and proceed to litigate  her claim in a\r\nmore  conventional  forum  subject  to  certain  substantive  and\r\nprocedural  limitations established by the  Act.  See Schafer, 20\r                                                                       \r\nF.3d at  2-3 (discussing interplay  between the Act and  the tort\r\nsystem).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nQualifications and  Aids to Interpretation  (QAI).  The QAI  is a\r\n\nseparate subsection  that provides  definitions and  explanations\r\n\nfor  the terms  used in the  Table.   See id.    300aa-14(b).  To\r                                                       \r\n\nreceive compensation for  a vaccine-related  injury, a  recipient\r\n\nmust simply  petition the Vaccine  Court and show that,  within a\r\n\nprescribed time span,  she suffered one or more  of the disorders\r\n\nlisted in  the Table  as associated with  the particular  vaccine\r\n\nthat she received.  Thus, the  content of the Table (a sample  of\r\n\nwhich is excerpted in the Appendix) is critical:  it is only when\r\n\na vaccinated child  suffers a listed condition  within applicable\r\n\ntemporal parameters that compensation will be forthcoming without\r\n\nthe time, expense,  proof requirements, and uncertainty  of full-\r\n\nblown litigation.\r\n\n          The Table is not intended to be static.   Congress gave\r\n\nthe Secretary express  power to promulgate regulations  adding to\r\n\nor  subtracting from the tabular list of conditions, and changing\r\n\nthe delineated  time periods.   See  42 U.S.C.    300aa-14(c)(3).\r                                             \r\n\nThis  is  a  rather  odd  approach  because  it  authorizes   the\r\n\nSecretary, in effect,  to amend the statutorily  enacted Table by\r\n\nway of administrative rulemaking.2  This grant of  power probably\r\n\nreflected a congressional  consensus that the first  iteration of\r\n\nthe Table was not  perfect.  Driven by a sense  of urgency to put\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2As such, the Act may  raise questions under the Presentment\r\nClause, which  requires that all  federal laws must be  passed by\r\nboth  houses of Congress  and signed by the  President.  See U.S.\r                                                                      \r\nConst. art.  1,   7;  see also INS  v. Chadha, 462 U.S.  919, 954\r                                                       \r\n(1983)  (\"Amendment  and   repeal  of  statutes,  no   less  than\r\nenactment, must conform with Art[icle] I.\").  Since this issue is\r\nnot raised in the instant petition, we take no view of it.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsomething into place,  the solons knowingly used  incomplete data\r\n\nwhen forging  the causal  links between  vaccines and  associated\r\n\nmedical conditions.   Mindful of its haste, Congress directed the\r\n\nSecretary to have the Institute of Medicine (IOM)   an arm of the\r\n\nNational Academy of Science    conduct an extensive review of all\r\n\navailable  information  bearing   on  the  relationship   between\r\n\nvaccines  and  medical  conditions,  and  thereafter  to  publish\r\n\nfindings  and revise the  Table based  on the  IOM's study.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nVaccine Act   312, 100 Stat. at 3779.\r\n\n          To assist the Secretary in updating the Table, Congress\r\n\ncreated the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV)    a\r\n\nbody composed of  a cross-section of health  professionals, legal\r\n\nexperts,  interested citizens (including  two who are  parents of\r\n\nchildren  victimized by  vaccine-related  injuries), and  federal\r\n\nofficials.   See  42 U.S.C.    300aa-19.   Congress  directed the\r                          \r\n\nSecretary to  provide the ACCV  with a copy of  each contemplated\r\n\nregulation before  formally proposing it,  and then to  await the\r\n\nexpiration  of a ninety-day comment period before moving forward.\r\n\nSee id.   300aa-14(d).\r                 \r\n\nII.  THE COURSE OF EVENTS\r          II.  THE COURSE OF EVENTS\r\n\n          In 1991, the IOM completed its study and, on August 27,\r\n\nissued the IOM  Report.  Among the many  conclusions contained in\r\n\nthis  tome   the  IOM  found   a  causal  relation   between  DPT\r\n\n(diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) vaccine,  on one  hand, and  acute\r\n\nencephalopathy and hypotonic, hyporesponse episodes (HHE), on the\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nother hand.3  See IOM Report at 118, 177.  However, the IOM found\r                           \r\n\ninsufficient evidence  to indicate a causal  relationship between\r\n\nDPT  vaccine and residual  seizure disorders (such  as epilepsy).\r\n\nSee id. at 118  n.3.  The project  director gave the ACCV  a full\r                 \r\n\nbriefing on the IOM Report in September of 1991.\r\n\n          In  anticipation  of  receiving  the  IOM  Report,  the\r\n\nSecretary formed a Public Health  Service Task Force as a vehicle\r\n\nfor revising the Table.   She also enlisted yet another helpmate,\r\n\nthe National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC).  Unlike the ACCV,\r\n\nwhich by statute counsels the  Secretary in respect to the injury\r\n\ncompensation  program, see  42  U.S.C.     300aa-19,  the  NVAC's\r                                    \r\n\nstatutory  responsibility  is  to  advise  the  director  of  the\r\n\nseparate national  program for developing  and administering  the\r\n\npublic health  aspects of immunization policy, see id.   300aa-5.\r                                                                \r\n\nThe Secretary transmitted the IOM Report to the Task Force, which\r\n\nthen recommended a number of  changes to the Table (including the\r\n\nremoval of encephalopathy, HHE, and residual seizure disorders as\r\n\nassociated medical conditions  vis-a-vis DPT vaccination).4   The\r\n\nNVAC concurred in these recommendations.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Encephalopathy  is a  general  term  that  refers  to  \"any\r\ndisease of  the brain.\"   Stedman's Medical Dictionary  508 (25th\r                                                                \r\ned. 1990).  HHE, also known as shock, shock-like  state, or shock\r\ncollapse, refers  to \"an unusual reaction consisting  of an acute\r\ndiminution  in   sensory  awareness  or  loss   of  consciousness\r\naccompanied by pallor and muscle hypotonicity [reduced tension].\"\r\nIOM Report at 171-72.\r\n\n     4Even  though  the  IOM Report  verified  a  causal relation\r\nbetween the first two conditions (encephalopathy and HHE) and DPT\r\nvaccinations, the Task Force did  not believe the study disclosed\r\ncredible evidence of prolonged neurological damage.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          Despite the  fact that  the ACCV  had not  yet formally\r\n\nreceived the Task Force's or the NVAC's recommendations,  it took\r\n\nup the substance  of the proposed revisions at  its December 1991\r\n\nmeeting.  In lieu of the  literal text of the suggested  changes,\r\n\nthe ACCV members received what has been referred to as a \"matrix\"\r\n\n  essentially,  a table comparing  a synthesis of Task  Force and\r\n\nNVAC recommendations and  summarizing the rationales  advanced by\r\n\nthose bodies.  The ACCV discussed these recommendations at length\r\n\nand   approved  all   but  the   one   that  suggested   dropping\r\n\nencephalopathy from the  Table.  As a  counter-proposal, the ACCV\r\n\nencouraged   the  Secretary  to  modify  the  QAI  definition  of\r\n\nencephalopathy in a way that  would restrict its meaning to acute\r\n\nor  chronic  episodes  of  a   type  more  likely  to  result  in\r\n\nsignificant harm.\r\n\n          In  due season,  the Secretary  published  a Notice  of\r\n\nProposed  Rulemaking  (the Notice).    See  57  Fed. Reg.  36,878\r                                                    \r\n\n(proposed  Aug. 14,  1992).   The  Notice  included the  required\r\n\nscientific  findings and set forth regulations designed to revise\r\n\nthe  Table  accordingly.   These  covered  all the  Task  Force's\r\n\nrecommendations save only for the dropping of encephalopathy.  On\r\n\nthat point  the  Secretary  acquiesced in  the  ACCV's  view  and\r\n\nproposed  a  new  definition  of the  condition  similar  in most\r\n\nrespects to  the definition discussed at the ACCV's December 1991\r\n\nmeeting.  See id. at 36,880.  A comment period and public hearing\r                           \r\n\nensued.\r\n\n          In  1993, the  results  of a  ten-year  study of  acute\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nchildhood neurologic illnesses became available.  Recognizing the\r\n\npotential importance of the study, the Secretary stayed  her hand\r\n\nand requested the IOM to review the newly compiled material.   In\r\n\nMarch 1994, the  IOM concluded that the \"balance  of the evidence\r\n\nis consistent with a causal relationship\" between DPT vaccination\r\n\nand  certain forms of chronic nervous system dysfunction suffered\r\n\nby  children who experience  an acute neurologic  illness shortly\r\n\nafter vaccination.

On March 24,  1994, the\r                                      \r\n\nSecretary  reopened  the  comment  period  for  a  limited  time,\r\n\nrestricting discussion  to  the question  whether the  previously\r\n\nproposed  revisions   should  be   modified  in   light  of   the\r\n\nsupplemental report.\r\n\n          At its June  1994 meeting  the ACCV  discussed the  new\r\n\ninformation   as  it   concerned  the   proposed  definition   of\r\n\nencephalopathy.  This time, the ACCV did not achieve consensus on\r\n\nthe subject, and simply transmitted the minutes of its meeting to\r\n\nthe Secretary.  On February  8, 1995, the Secretary promulgated a\r\n\nfinal rule (under attack in this proceeding) that removed HHE and\r\n\nresidual  seizure  disorders  from  the  Table  and  changed  the\r\n\ndefinition  of encephalopathy in  a manner very  similar (but not\r\n\nidentical)  to the  manner originally  suggested by the  ACCV and\r\n\nproposed in the Notice.

THE PETITIONERS' CHALLENGE\r          III.  THE PETITIONERS' CHALLENGE\r\n\n          The   petitioners  raise   three   objections  to   the\r\n\nSecretary's action.  First,  the petitioners assert that the  Act\r\n\ndoes not empower the Secretary to change the definitions included\r\n\nin the QAI, but, rather, only authorizes the Secretary to add and\r\n\nsubtract   entries  (i.e.,   vaccines   and  associated   medical\r\n\nconditions)  and change  time  periods  specified  in  the  Table\r\n\nproper.    Second, the  petitioners  contend  that, even  if  the\r\n\nSecretary  otherwise  had authority  to effectuate  the contested\r\n\nchange, she failed to follow  the procedures mandated by the Act.\r\n\nFinally, the  petitioners  insist that  a  decision to  remove  a\r\n\nmedical condition  from the  Table must  be  based on  definitive\r\n\nevidence  refuting the existence of a causal relationship between\r\n\nthe vaccine in question and the condition, and that the Secretary\r\n\neliminated  HHE and  residual seizure  disorders  from the  Table\r\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of such an evidentiary predicate.  We\r\n\naddress each remonstrance separately.\r\n\n                 A.  Authority to Revise the QAI.\r                           A.  Authority to Revise the QAI.\r                                                          \r\n\n          The petitioners argue  that the Secretary's  attempt to\r\n\nchange  the definition of  encephalopathy provided in  the QAI is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5When queried at oral argument  as to his clients' standing,\r\nthe petitioners' attorney explained that Kelliann had suffered an\r\nadverse  reaction after vaccination that would have been included\r\nwithin  the  original tabular  definition  of  encephalopathy but\r\nwhich fell outside  the revised definition.   The Secretary  does\r\nnot challenge  this recital,  and we  therefore accept  counsel's\r\nexplanation at face value.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nimpuissant  because it  surpasses the  authority  granted to  the\r\n\nSecretary by the Act.  The Act states:\r\n\n          A modification  of the  Vaccine Injury  Table\r\n          under   paragraph   (1)    [authorizing   the\r\n          Secretary  to   \"promulgate  regulations   to\r\n          modify\"  the  Table]  may add  to,  or delete\r                                                                 \r\n          from,  the  list of  injuries,  disabilities,\r                                    \r\n          illnesses, conditions, and  deaths, for which\r\n          compensation may  be provided  or may  change\r                                                                 \r\n          the  time periods  for the  first symptom  or\r                                     \r\n          manifestation of the onset or the significant\r\n          aggravation of  any such  injury, disability,\r\n          illness, condition, or death.\r\n\n42  U.S.C.      300aa-14(c)(3)  (emphasis  supplied).     In  the\r\n\npetitioners' view, the underscored  phrases limit the Secretary's\r\n\npowers of  alteration, and hence,  because the  QAI provision  is\r\n\ndistinct   from  the  Table   proper,  the  Secretary's  revisory\r\n\nauthority does not  extend to it.  Ergo,  changing the definition\r\n\nof  encephalopathy contained in the QAI oversteps the Secretary's\r\n\nbounds.  The Secretary debunks  this argument.  She construes the\r\n\nstatute more  broadly,  urging that  it  gives her  authority  to\r\n\nrewrite the QAI.\r\n\n          1.  Chevron  Deference.  Before choosing  between these\r                    1.  Chevron  Deference.\r                                          \r\n\ncompeting  views,  we must  address  a  preliminary issue.    The\r\n\nSecretary, correctly observing that courts ordinarily defer to an\r\n\nagency's  plausible construction of a silent or ambiguous statute\r\n\nas  long as Congress has committed  the statute to the agency for\r\n\npurposes  of administration, see  Chevron U.S.A. Inc.  v. Natural\r                                                                           \r\n\nResources Defense  Council, Inc.,  467 U.S.  837, 842-43  (1984);\r                                          \r\n\nStrickland  v. Commissioner, Me.  Dep't of Human  Servs., 48 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n12, 16 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 145 (1995), asks that\r                                         \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nwe defer to her construction of   300aa-14(c).  There may be more\r\n\nto this request  than meets the eye.   The petitioners' objection\r\n\nis arguably not directed at a regulation that purports to apply a\r\n\nparticular statutory directive which the  Secretary is concededly\r\n\nempowered to implement, but instead  at a regulation that lies in\r\n\nan area as to which, the petitioners say, the statute grants  the\r\n\nSecretary no rulemaking  authority at all.  In  the current state\r                                                   \r\n\nof the law, it is  unclear whether deference is appropriate under\r\n\nsuch circumstances.6\r\n\n          Discretion  is  sometimes  the better  part  of  valor.\r\n\nBecause   we  decide,   as  a   matter   of  original   statutory\r\n\nconstruction,  that the  Act grants  the  Secretary authority  to\r\n\nrevise the  QAI provision,  see infra, we  leave the  question of\r                                               \r\n\ndeference unanswered.\r\n\n          2.   Interpreting  the Statute.    We turn  now to  the\r                    2.   Interpreting  the Statute.\r                                                  \r\n\ndisputed statute.  While   one can focus with Cyclopean intensity\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The Supreme  Court has  never taken  a clear  institutional\r\nstand  on the  question.   In Mississippi  Power &amp;  Light Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\nMississippi, 487 U.S. 354 (1988),  the Court affirmed an agency's\r                     \r\ninterpretation  of a  statute  in  a  comparable  situation,  but\r\nwithout  relying  on  Chevron-type  deference.    Justice Scalia,\r                                       \r\nwriting  separately,   argued  for  deference  even   though  the\r\ninterpretive  question  involved   the  scope  of   the  agency's\r\nauthority  under   the  statute.     Id.  at  381   (Scalia,  J.,\r                                                  \r\nconcurring).  Justice Brennan, writing for himself  and two other\r\nJustices, expressed  the  view that  deference was  inappropriate\r\nbecause the scope  of an administrative agency's  jurisdiction is\r\nnot a  decision that  Congress normally  entrusts to  the agency.\r\nId. at 387 (Brennan, J., concurring).  The problem is complicated\r             \r\nby a  realization that almost  any administrative  action can  be\r\ndescribed  by  a  challenger  as  either  exceeding  an  agency's\r\nauthority or  overstepping the  authorized application of  agency\r\nauthority.  See  generally Thomas W. Merrill,  Judicial Deference\r                                                                           \r\nto Executive Precedent, 101 Yale L.J. 969, 997-98 (1992).\r                                \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\non the words singled out by the petitioners and perhaps construct\r\n\na coherent  argument that  those words  restrict the  Secretary's\r\n\nrevisory  authority  to the  Table  proper, courts  are  bound to\r\n\nafford  statutes a practical,  commonsense reading.   See King v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSt.  Vincent's Hosp.,  502  U.S.  215, 221  (1991).   Instead  of\r                              \r\n\nculling selected words from a statute's  text and inspecting them\r\n\nin an antiseptic laboratory setting,  a court engaged in the task\r\n\nof statutory interpretation must examine  the statute as a whole,\r\n\ngiving due weight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to\r\n\naggregate language.  See National  R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston\r                                                                           \r\n\n&amp;  Me.  Corp.,   503  U.S.  407,  417  (1992);   Dole  v.

Reading the statute  as a\r\n\nwhole,   we  are  satisfied  that  Congress  gave  the  Secretary\r\n\nauthority to revise the  QAI.  In the  absence of such  authority\r\n\nthe system  for updating  the Act is  virtually unworkable.   For\r\n\ninstance,  when the Secretary  exercises her undeniable  power to\r\n\ninclude an emergent  condition in the Table, she must  be able to\r\n\namend  the QAI to reflect the  addition.  Surely Congress did not\r\n\nintend either  to leave added conditions unexplained or itself to\r\n\nedit the QAI every time the Secretary saw fit to alter the Table.\r\n\nIn short,  the power to revise the QAI  is a necessary adjunct of\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nthe power  to revise  the Table itself.7   Elsewise,  the tension\r\n\nthat would  be created within the  structure of the Act  would be\r\n\nintolerable  and would  contravene  the  salutary principle  that\r\n\nstatutes should, whenever  possible, be construed sensibly.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmerican Tobacco Co. v.

If  the\r\n\nSecretary  could  not  change  the definition  of  encephalopathy\r\n\ndirectly,   she  could  certainly   accomplish  the  same  result\r\n\nindirectly.    She  need simply  delete  encephalopathy  from the\r\n\nTable,   thus  rendering   its  definition  nugatory,   and  then\r\n\nimmediately add encephalopathy, redefined, to the Table.\r\n\n          This reality  is lethal  to the  petitioners' position.\r\n\nWe cannot imagine  that Congress intended to  force the Secretary\r\n\nto go round  and round the mulberry  bush in order to  revise the\r\n\nTable and its  accompanying explanations.  The  shortest distance\r\n\nbetween  two points is a  straight line, and  we will not lightly\r\n\npresume that Congress  lost sight of so abecedarian a principle.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7In their  reply  brief, the  petitioners seemingly  concede\r\nthat this is so, but  suggest that the Secretary may  only revise\r\nthe QAI when she is in the process of modifying the Table itself.\r\nThe suggestion is  meritless.  Nothing in either the  text or the\r\nhistory of the statute supports such an artificial construction.\r\n\n     8Congress  had a  golden opportunity  to  express an  intent\r\ncontrary to the Secretary's view  that she possesses the power to\r\nrevise the  QAI, but it chose not to do  so.  Originally, the Act\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nSee  Singer,  supra,    45.12,  at  61 (advocating  the  baseline\r                             \r\n\nassumption  that  an  enacted  statute  should  be  construed  to\r\n\n\"achieve[]  an  effective  and  operative  result\").    To  cinch\r\n\nmatters,  we note  that the  statutory grant  of a  greater power\r\n\ntypically includes the grant of a lesser power, see, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

We hold  that the\r\n\nAct   grants  the   Secretary  the   authority   to  revise   the\r\n\nQualifications  and  Aids  to Interpretation  that  accompany the\r\n\nVaccine  Injury Table.

In\r\n1993,  Congress amended  the law  to allow  the Secretary  to add\r\nvaccines without specific congressional  authorization.  See Pub.\r                                                                      \r\nL.

The accusation is unfounded.\r\n\n          The relevant statute provides:\r\n\n          Except   with   respect   to   a   regulation\r\n          recommended by the [ACCV], the Secretary  may\r\n          not propose a regulation under subsection (c)\r\n          of  this  section  or  any revision  thereof,\r\n          unless the  Secretary has  first provided  to\r\n          the [ACCV] a copy  of the proposed regulation\r\n          or  revision,  requested  recommendations and\r\n          comments by  the  [ACCV],  and  afforded  the\r\n          [ACCV]  at  least   90  days  to   make  such\r\n          recommendations.\r\n\n42  U.S.C.     300aa-14(d).   The  petitioners  contend  that the\r\n\nSecretary neglected  to follow  these procedures  twice over,  by\r\n\nfailing to provide the ACCV with (1)  a copy of the Notice before\r\n\npublishing it, and (2)  a copy of  the final rule before  issuing\r\n\nit.  We examine each contention.\r\n\n          1.  The Proposed Rule.  We rehearse the relevant facts.\r                    1.  The Proposed Rule.\r                                         \r\n\nShortly after publication of the  IOM Report, the Task Force made\r\n\nits initial  recommendations for changing  the Table.   The  NVAC\r\n\nsubstantially   concurred   in   those   recommendations.     The\r\n\nSecretary's proposal was  then circulated at the  ACCV's December\r\n\n1991  meeting in  the  form  of a  matrix  detailing the  various\r\n\nrecommendations.   During the  ensuing discussion,  the principal\r\n\nobjection  was  to  the Secretary's  proposal,  reflected  in the\r\n\nmatrix, for  removing encephalopathy  from the  Table.   The ACCV\r\n\nurged instead that encephalopathy should be retained in the Table\r\n\nbut  that its  definition should  be modified  in the  QAI.   The\r\n\nSecretary  accepted the  ACCV's unanimous recommendation  and, in\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nAugust   1992,   published   a  Notice   that   implemented  this\r\n\nrecommendation.9   See  57  Fed. Reg.  at 36,880  (accepting ACCV\r                                \r\n\nrecommendation  to retain encephalopathy in  the Table with a new\r\n\ndefinition).\r\n\n          The  petitioners   argue  that   the  rule   ultimately\r\n\npromulgated  is  invalid  because  the  matrix  distributed   and\r\n\ndiscussed in December of  1991 was not literally  a \"copy of  the\r\n\nproposed regulation\" as required by    300aa-14(d).  Although the\r\n\nmatrix may  not have been  produced in the  typical format for  a\r\n\nproposed administrative regulation, we think that for all intents\r\n\nand purposes it was a \"copy\" of the regulation that the Secretary\r\n\nplanned to  propose.  The  matrix contained the substance  of all\r\n\nthe  proposed changes  to the  Table.   The only  real difference\r\n\nappears  to have  been in  manner of  presentation.   The statute\r\n\nrequires the Secretary  to deliver all the meat of a planned rule\r\n\nto the Secretary  without regard  to how  it is  arranged on  the\r\n\nplatter.   Thus, as  long as the  Secretary transmits  the entire\r\n\nsubstance  of  her  proposed  regulation  to  the  ACCV  in   the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9Though  there appears  to have  been substantial  consensus\r\namong  ACCV members about the definition  they would recommend to\r\nthe   Secretary,  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  ACCV  members\r\nirrevocably  agreed on  an exact  definition.   This  uncertainty\r\narises  because, while  no  formal vote  was  taken, the  members\r\napproved  in  principle  a specific  definition  proposed  by Dr.\r\nGerald Fenichel.   The members also agreed  that some refinements\r\nto  Dr. Fenichel's  proposed definition  might  be necessary  and\r\napparently agreed  to a  mechanism for  expediting action  on any\r\nsuch  refinements.    The administrative  record  (including  the\r\nminutes approved at the next ACCV meeting) reveals  no objections\r\nto  Dr. Fenichel's  final proposed  definition  and discloses  no\r\nsuggested  refinements  to it.    The Secretary  included  in the\r\nproposed  rule   a   definition  of   encephalopathy   that   was\r\nsubstantially the same as this definition.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nappropriate  time  frame,   the  form  of  the   transmission  is\r\n\nimmaterial.   This principle possesses particular force where, as\r\n\nhere,  the unorthodox  format  does  not  obfuscate  or  mislead.\r\n\nIndeed, the matrix's  tabular format  increased comprehension  by\r\n\nallowing  the  ACCV  to   discuss  the  revisions  in  a   manner\r\n\ncorresponding to the format  of the Vaccine Injury  Table itself.\r\n\nWe  hold, therefore, that  the Secretary fulfilled  her statutory\r\n\npre-publication duty in regard to the proposed regulation.\r\n\n          If there were any room  for doubt about the adequacy of\r\n\nthe transmittal    and  we do  not believe  that there  is    the\r\n\nACCV's actions would dispel it.  We are particularly impressed by\r\n\ntwo things.   First, the  transcript of the ACCV's  December 1991\r\n\nmeeting makes  very  clear that  ACCV members  thought they  were\r\n\ndiscussing the  Secretary's  proposed  revisions  to  the  Table.\r\n\nSecond, after  the Secretary  published the proposed  regulation,\r\n\nthe ACCV did  not cry \"foul\"  or otherwise  complain that it  had\r\n\nbeen bypassed.  These facts plainly show that the ACCV understood\r\n\nthe matrix to be  a \"copy of the  proposed regulation\" and  acted\r\n\nupon it as such.\r\n\n          2.   The Final Rule.   The Secretary's issuance  of the\r                    2.   The Final Rule.\r                                       \r\n\nfinal  rule  poses a  somewhat  closer question.    The Secretary\r\n\nopenly admits that she did not provide the ACCV with the  text of\r\n\nthe final rule  prior to its promulgation.   She argues, however,\r\n\nthat the Act does  not oblige her to do so, or  that, if it does,\r\n\nshe substantially complied with that obligation.\r\n\n          Section 300aa-14(d) provides in material part that \"the\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nSecretary may  not propose  a regulation  . . .  or any  revision\r\n\nthereof\" without  first furnishing the  ACCV with a copy  of \"the\r\n\nregulation or revision,\" requesting comment, and marking time for\r\n\nninety days.  This aspect  of the controversy between the parties\r\n\narises from the phrase \"any  revision thereof.\"  In context, this\r\n\nphrase is susceptible to at least two reasonable meanings.  Under\r\n\none interpretation, favored  by the Secretary, the  phrase refers\r\n\nto a revision of a  regulation, so that, while the Secretary  may\r\n\nnot  propose either a new regulation or a revision to an existing\r\n\nregulation without advance notice to the ACCV, she may proceed to\r\n\nrevise a proposed regulation without resubmitting it to the ACCV.\r\n\nUnder  the second interpretation, favored by the petitioners, the\r\n\nphrase  \"any revision thereof\" refers to proposed regulations, so\r\n\nthat the Secretary  may propose neither a new  regulation nor any\r\n\nlater  revision  to  that   proposed  regulation  without   first\r\n\ninforming the ACCV.\r\n\n          Once  again  our analysis  begins  with  a nod  in  the\r\n\ndirection  of Chevron.    The  rule  of  deference  traditionally\r                               \r\n\napplies  when  the  agency's  interpretation  is  a  \"product  of\r\n\ndelegated authority  for rulemaking,\" Stinson  v. United  States,\r                                                                          \r\n\n113   S.  Ct.  1913,  1918   (1993),  a  sphere  that  ordinarily\r\n\nencompasses legislative  rules and  agency adjudications.   Here,\r\n\nthe Secretary's  interpretation of the  law is not embodied  in a\r\n\nlegislative rule  or an adjudication.   The evidence of  her view\r\n\nabout  how   300aa-14(d) is supposed to operate comes exclusively\r\n\nfrom two sources:   the refusal of  her subordinates to  send the\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nACCV a pre-publication  copy of the final rule,  and the tactical\r\n\nposition adopted by her counsel.\r\n\n          As  for the  first source,  agency  positions that  are\r\n\npieced together from offhand conduct  of bureaucratic fussbudgets\r\n\nare entitled  to little  weight on  judicial review,  principally\r\n\nbecause they do  not reflect the kind of  delegated authority for\r\n\npolicymaking that  underlies  the  Chevron  presumption.10    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nStinson, 113 S. Ct. at 1918;  Martin v. OSHRC, 499 U.S. 144,  157\r                                                       \r\n\n(1991);  Public Citizen  v.

As for  the second  source, courts\r\n\ncustomarily withhold Chevron deference from agencies'  litigating\r                                      \r\n\npositions.  See, e.g., Bowen  v.

Hosp., 488 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n204, 212 (1988); United States v. 29  Cartons of * * * an Article\r                                                                           \r\n\nof Food, 987 F.2d 33, 38  n.6 (1st Cir. 1993); Director, OWCP  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corp., 980 F.2d 74, 79  (1st Cir. 1992).  We see\r                                \r\n\nno  reason  to  take a  different  tack  in  this  instance.   We\r\n\ntherefore decline to  defer to the Secretary's  construction of  \r\n\n300aa-14(d).\r\n\n          Approaching   the   statutory  question   without   the\r\n\nSecretary's thumb  on the scale,  we believe that  both suggested\r\n\ninterpretations  are  plausible   but  imperfect  renditions   of\r\n\nproblematic language.  The petitioners' interpretation means that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10In   point  of  fact,   the  record  indicates   that  the\r\nSecretary's  minions were not even attempting  to parse the Act's\r\nrequirements, but, rather,  were simply enunciating \"a  matter of\r\nprocedure  and policy\" within the  agency not to distribute final\r\nrules prematurely.   Quite obviously,  this affords no  basis for\r\ndeference.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nevery alteration to  the text of a  proposed rule   even  a minor\r\n\ntechnical  or grammatical alteration   would  have to be rerouted\r\n\nthrough the ACCV,  subject to a fresh  notice-and-comment period.\r\n\nThis  extra  step  would  be necessary  even  when  the Secretary\r\n\nchanges  a  proposed  regulation in  accordance  with  the ACCV's\r                                                                           \r\n\nannounced  wishes or  to correct  a  syntactical bevue.   Such  a\r                           \r\n\nconstruction would create  a nearly endless circle  and attenuate\r\n\nthe  rulemaking  process  without  achieving  any   corresponding\r\n\nbenefit.   Because  it  is  difficult  to believe  that  Congress\r\n\nintended  to  prolong  the  revisory  process  by  directing  the\r\n\nSecretary to engage in a  mindless minuet, the prospect of wasted\r\n\nmotion cuts against the petitioners' interpretation.  See Alabama\r                                                                           \r\n\nPower Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d  323, 360 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (stating\r                             \r\n\nthe  obvious proposition  that  courts  should  be  reluctant  to\r\n\ninterpret   the  terms  of   a  statute  \"to   mandate  pointless\r\n\nexpenditures of effort\").\r\n\n          The  Secretary's   construction  likewise   presents  a\r\n\nproblem in that  it may render the phrase  \"any revision thereof\"\r\n\nsuperfluous to  some extent.   Since the Secretary would  have to\r\n\nissue a new regulation in order to change an existing one, see 42\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   300aa-14(c),  Congress probably did not need  to add the\r\n\nrequirement  that a revision  to an  existing regulation  must be\r\n\nreviewed by the ACCV.   Because courts usually presume that every\r\n\nword and phrase in a statute is pregnant with meaning, see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited States v.  Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741,  751-52 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1985),  the prospect of  redundancy cuts against  the Secretary's\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\ninterpretation.\r\n\n          Faced with no  ideal choice, we conclude  that Congress\r\n\nmore  likely intended  the statute  to be  read as  the Secretary\r\n\nurges.  This interpretation is  more plausible and better  serves\r\n\nthe ends that  the legislature sought to  achieve.  Though it  is\r\n\npossible  that  Congress  could  have  accomplished  its  purpose\r                  \r\n\nwithout adding the  disputed phrase (\"any revision  thereof\"), it\r\n\nis not certain that it could  have done so.  A wily  lawyer could\r\n\nperhaps  have argued  that  the  unembellished word  \"regulation\"\r\n\nreferred only  to brand-new  regulations, not  to adjustments  of\r\n\npreexisting  regulations.  Cf. Public Serv.  Co. v. United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nEPA, 682  F.2d 626, 633 (7th  Cir. 1982), cert.  denied, 459 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n1127 (1983).  Even more  likely, Congress might have thought that\r\n\nthe Secretary would be able to style a revision to  a preexisting\r\n\nregulation as something other than a new regulation (perhaps as a\r\n\nclarification), and thereby evade the statutory safeguards.  See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne,g., Detroit Edison Co. v.

Moreover,  a belt-and-suspenders  approach is  not\r\n\nuncommon  when the Legislative  Branch cedes rulemaking  power to\r\n\nthe Executive Branch.   Indeed, Congress has  frequently employed\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nthe  phrase \"revision  thereof\" to  confirm  that its  procedural\r\n\nmandates  apply both to original regulations and future revisions\r\n\nof  such regulations.   See,  e.g.,  15 U.S.C.    2934(f)(1);  16\r                                            \r\n\nU.S.C.     410cc-32(e);  33  U.S.C.     1314(c);   42  U.S.C.    \r\n\n4916(a)(3)-(4), 7521(a)(2), 7571(b).\r\n\n          Here,  the  Secretary's  interpretation   not  only  is\r\n\nconsistent  with common  congressional statute-drafting  practice\r\n\nbut also  ensures the  ACCV's input  into the  rulemaking process\r\n\nwithout inviting  the wasteful  circularity of  proposal, notice,\r\n\ncomment, changed proposal, re-notice,  additional comment, and so\r\n\non and  so  forth,  ad  infinitum.   The  petitioners'  suggested\r\n\nalternative, on the other hand, creates a perverse incentive.  If\r\n\nthe  Secretary is forced  to recommit  a proposed  regulation and\r\n\ntwiddle her thumbs for an  additional three months every time she\r\n\nresponds  agreeably  to  an  ACCV  suggestion, she  may  be  less\r\n\ninclined   to  acquiesce  in   the  first  place.     Hence,  the\r\n\ninterpretation that  we adopt  actually may  increase the  chance\r\n\nthat  the Secretary  will pay  attention  to, and  act upon,  the\r\n\nACCV's advice.\r\n\n          In reaching the  conclusion that the statute  refers to\r\n\nregulations  and revisions  thereof  (and  not  to  revisions  of\r\n\nproposed regulations), we necessarily override two other concerns\r\n\nanent  the ACCV's  place in  the scheme  of  things.   First, the\r\n\npetitioners  boast that the ACCV's statutorily prescribed part in\r\n\nthe  process of revising the Table evinces Congress's distrust of\r\n\nthe  Secretary and  proves that  the reference  to \"any  revision\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nthereof\" is intended  to give the ACCV a  more prominent presence\r\n\nin the rulemaking process.  This distorts the statutory alignment\r\n\nby grossly underestimating the  Secretary's role and aggrandizing\r\n\nthe ACCV's importance.  In  crafting the Act, Congress  delegated\r\n\nunusually great authority  to the Secretary, including  the power\r\n\nto  rewrite  the  statute   by  updating  one  of   its  hallmark\r\n\nprovisions.   In contrast,  Congress assigned the  ACCV a  purely\r\n\nadvisory function.  See 42 U.S.C.   300aa-19;  see also H.R. Rep.\r                                                                 \r\n\nNo.  908, supra,  1986  U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 6365.    Thus, far  from\r                         \r\n\nbolstering  the petitioners' case,  a comparison of  the relative\r\n\nresponsibilities that Congress entrusted to the Secretary and the\r\n\nACCV, respectively, undermines the petitioners' argument.\r\n\n          Second,  the Secretary's  construction  of the  statute\r\n\ndoes not permit  her effectively to bypass the  ACCV by proposing\r\n\none  regulation and then issuing something radically different as\r\n\na final rule.  The Administrative Procedure Act applies here, and\r\n\nit is  axiomatic under that  regime that a  final rule must  be a\r\n\nlineal descendant of, and in character with, the earlier proposed\r\n\nrule.   See, e.g.,  Kooritzky v. Reich, 17  F.3d 1509, 1513 (D.C.\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1994);  American Medical Ass'n  v.

Put  another way, changes  must flow\r\n\nlogically  from the prescribed  notice and comment.   See Natural\r                                                                           \r\n\nResources Defense  Council, Inc. v.  United States EPA,  824 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1258,  1283  (1st  Cir.  1987).    If  the  final  rule  deviates\r\n\nsubstantially from  the  proposed  rule,  it  amounts  to  a  new\r\n\nproposal and must run the  regulatory gauntlet afresh.  Thus, the\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nACCV's right  to be consulted is not stunted  by the reading of  \r\n\n300aa-14(d) that we adopt today.\r\n\n          To  recapitulate,  we   believe  that  Congress   might\r\n\nreasonably have  inserted the  phrase \"any  revision thereof\"  to\r\n\nclose what it suspected  were potential loopholes.  We  therefore\r\n\naccept  the  Secretary's  thesis that  the  phrase  \"any revision\r\n\nthereof,\"  as  used  in     300aa-14(d),  refers  exclusively  to\r\n\nrevisions of existing  regulations (not to revisions  of proposed\r\n\nregulations).  On this understanding, we hold that the  Secretary\r\n\ncomplied  with the  statutory  notice-and-comment requirement  by\r\n\nproviding  a pre-publication copy  of her proposed  regulation to\r\n\nthe ACCV in December of 1991.\r\n\n          C.

Adding and Subtracting Medical Conditions.\r                                                                 \r\n\n          The petitioners' final  shot injects a new  notion into\r\n\nthe case:  the idea that the Act does not authorize the Secretary\r\n\nto remove  HHE and residual  seizure disorders from the  Table in\r\n\nthe absence of \"definitive information\"  attesting to the lack of\r\n\nany  causal  link  between  DPT  vaccination  and  these  medical\r\n\nconditions.  Since  both the IOM and the  Secretary herself found\r\n\nonly  that there was \"insufficient evidence  to indicate a causal\r\n\nrelation\"   between  vaccination   and  the  kind   of  permanent\r\n\nneurological  damage   reflected  in  HHE  and  residual  seizure\r\n\ndisorders over  time, see IOM Report at 118; Notice, 57 Fed. Reg.\r                                   \r\n\nat 36,879, they tell us that the deletions cannot survive.\r\n\n          The Secretary accepts  the petitioners'  premise    the\r\n\navailable evidence does not flatly disprove the causal relation  \r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nbut she vigorously disputes the  petitioners' conclusion.  In her\r\n\nview, the criteria  for revising the Table simply  do not include\r\n\nthe requirement  that the petitioners  seek to impose.   We agree\r\n\nwith the Secretary.\r\n\n          We need not  tarry.   Nothing in  the text  of the  Act\r\n\nprohibits the  Secretary from  eliminating a  condition from  the\r\n\nTable  if  the evidence  of  a  causal  relationship between  the\r\n\nvaccination and that  condition is equivocal.   The only explicit\r\n\nconstraints  on  the Secretary  are  procedural.   See,  e.g., 42\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.      300aa-14(c)  (requiring   notice-and-comment  period,\r\n\nincluding public hearing); id.    300aa-14(d) (mandating referral\r                                        \r\n\nto  the ACCV).    While  some other  constraints  may be  readily\r\n\ninferred from the terms, structure, and history of the Act, there\r\n\nis  no  principled  basis  for  the  added  constraint  that  the\r\n\npetitioners would have us infer.\r\n\n          The petitioners' construct rests solely on a suggestion\r\n\nin the committee  report accompanying the Act to  the effect that\r\n\nthe   Secretary  may  revise  the  Table  when  \"more  definitive\r\n\ninformation\" is  available.   They read  this terse  reference as\r\n\nsuperimposing on the  text of the statute a  requirement that the\r\n\nSecretary  must  have  definitive  evidence  rejecting  a  causal\r\n\nrelation between vaccination  and a medical condition  before she\r\n\nmay delete the condition from the Table.\r\n\n          The petitioners read the committee report through rose-\r\n\ncolored glasses.  The passage on which they rely is reproduced in\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nits entirety in  the margin.11  The  passage as a whole  makes it\r\n\nabundantly clear that, though Congress, struggling with a lack of\r\n\ninformation,  itself   used  an  initial  presumption   that  the\r\n\nconditions listed in the Table were caused by vaccination so long\r\n\nas  they  occurred  within the  specified  time  period following\r\n\nvaccination, it did  not intend  to carve  this presumption  into\r\n\nstone.   To the  precise contrary, the  authors of  the committee\r\n\nreport  explicitly  recognized  that  the  Table,  as  originally\r\n\ndevised,  might in  some  cases go  too  far, and  relied  on the\r\n\nSecretary to  reconstitute it  in light  of the  \"more definitive\r\n\ninformation\"  that would  be  available as  a consequence  of the\r                                                                           \r\n\nreview, in order  to reflect more accurately the causal relations\r                \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11The passage reads:\r\n\n          The Committee recognizes that there is public\r\n          debate over  the incidence of  illnesses that\r\n          coincidentally occur within  a short time  of\r\n          vaccination.       The   Committee    further\r\n          recognizes  that  the   deeming  of  vaccine-\r\n          relatedness  adopted   [in  the   Table]  may\r\n          provide compensation  to some  children whose\r\n          illness  is  not, in  fact,  vaccine-related.\r\n          The Committee  anticipates that  the research\r\n          on vaccine  injury  and  vaccine  safety  now\r\n          ongoing and mandated by this legislation will\r\n          soon  provide  more   definitive  information\r\n          about  the incidence  of  vaccine injury  and\r\n          that, when such information is available, the\r\n          Secretary or the [ACCV] may propose to revise\r\n          the Table . . .  .  Until such time, however,\r\n          the   Committee   has   chosen   to   provide\r\n          compensation  to all  persons whose  injuries\r\n          meet the requirements of the petition and the\r\n          Table   and   whose    injuries   cannot   be\r\n          demonstrated to be caused by other factors.\r\n\nH.R.

It\r\n\nsaid nothing of the sort.   What is did say is that the Secretary\r\n\nshould update  the Table in  light of new and  better information\r\n\nabout  causation.  The Secretary, in pursuance of this directive,\r\n\ndecided inter alia  to remove HHE and  residual seizure disorders\r                            \r\n\nfrom the Table because the medical evidence failed to establish a\r\n\ncausal  connection  between  DPT vaccines  and  these  disorders.\r\n\nSince  there  is nothing  in  the  record  to suggest  that  this\r\n\ndecision is arbitrary  or capricious, it must stand.

When all is said and done, we deny the petition and leave the rule intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administration of childhood vaccines, though critically important to public health, \"is not always without risk.\"   Committee to Review the Adverse Consequences of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines, Institute of Medicine, Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines 1 (1991) (IOM Report).   Since vaccines generally contain either dead bacteria or live but weakened viruses, it is not surprising that they are capable of causing serious adverse effects.   See id.   Despite the infrequency of such episodes, Congress feared that the long shadow of tort liability cast by vaccine-related injuries would drive up prices and eventually force vaccine suppliers out of the market.   See H.R.Rep. No. 908, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 4, 6-7 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6287, 6344, 6345, 6347-48.   Congress also worried that the vagaries of litigation, coupled with the cost, might leave many deserving victims of vaccine-related injuries undercompensated.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To protect the supply of vaccines while ensuring fair, timely compensation for victims, Congress departed from the traditional tort system and wrote the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (the Act), Pub.L. No. 99-660, tit.  III, 100 Stat. 3755 (1986).   Among other things, the Act established a special tribunal (the Vaccine Court), and moved vaccine-injury cases partly outside the customary tort framework.   See Schafer v. American Cyanamid Co., 20 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining the mechanics of the Act).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In respect to cases brought before this tribunal, Congress eased the complainants' burdens both by dispensing with the requirement of proving negligence and by greatly simplifying the requisite proof of causation.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 300aa-11.   Of course, there are tradeoffs;  for example, Congress limited the damages that a victim could obtain for vaccine-related injuries.   See id. &#167; 300aa-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In aid of the neoteric regulatory regime, the Act provides, in tabular format, a listing of vaccines and a parallel listing of medical conditions commonly associated with the use of each vaccine.   See id. &#167; 300aa-14(a).   These listings, known collectively as the Vaccine Injury Table (the Table), are accompanied by, and are to be read in light of, the Qualifications and Aids to Interpretation (QAI).   The QAI is a separate subsection that provides definitions and explanations for the terms used in the Table.   See id. &#167; 300aa-14(b).   To receive compensation for a vaccine-related injury, a recipient must simply petition the Vaccine Court and show that, within a prescribed time span, she suffered one or more of the disorders listed in the Table as associated with the particular vaccine that she received.   Thus, the content of the Table (a sample of which is excerpted in the Appendix) is critical:  it is only when a vaccinated child suffers a listed condition within applicable temporal parameters that compensation will be forthcoming without the time, expense, proof requirements, and uncertainty of full-blown litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Table is not intended to be static.   Congress gave the Secretary express power to promulgate regulations adding to or subtracting from the tabular list of conditions, and changing the delineated time periods.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c)(3).   This is a rather odd approach because it authorizes the Secretary, in effect, to amend the statutorily enacted Table by way of administrative rulemaking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This grant of power probably reflected a congressional consensus that the first iteration of the Table was not perfect.   Driven by a sense of urgency to put something into place, the solons knowingly used incomplete data when forging the causal links between vaccines and associated medical conditions.   Mindful of its haste, Congress directed the Secretary to have the Institute of Medicine (IOM)--an arm of the National Academy of Science--conduct an extensive review of all available information bearing on the relationship between vaccines and medical conditions, and thereafter to publish findings and revise the Table based on the IOM's study.   See Vaccine Act &#167; 312, 100 Stat. at 3779.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To assist the Secretary in updating the Table, Congress created the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV)--a body composed of a cross-section of health professionals, legal experts, interested citizens (including two who are parents of children victimized by vaccine-related injuries), and federal officials.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-19.   Congress directed the Secretary to provide the ACCV with a copy of each contemplated regulation before formally proposing it, and then to await the expiration of a ninety-day comment period before moving forward.   See id. &#167; 300aa-14(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COURSE OF EVENTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, the IOM completed its study and, on August 27, issued the IOM Report.   Among the many conclusions contained in this tome the IOM found a causal relation between DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) vaccine, on one hand, and acute encephalopathy and hypotonic, hyporesponse episodes (HHE), on the other hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See IOM Report at 118, 177.   However, the IOM found insufficient evidence to indicate a causal relationship between DPT vaccine and residual seizure disorders (such as epilepsy).   See id. at 118 n. 3.   The project director gave the ACCV a full briefing on the IOM Report in September of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In anticipation of receiving the IOM Report, the Secretary formed a Public Health Service Task Force as a vehicle for revising the Table.   She also enlisted yet another helpmate, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC).   Unlike the ACCV, which by statute counsels the Secretary in respect to the injury compensation program, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-19, the NVAC's statutory responsibility is to advise the director of the separate national program for developing and administering the public health aspects of immunization policy, see id. &#167; 300aa-5.   The Secretary transmitted the IOM Report to the Task Force, which then recommended a number of changes to the Table (including the removal of encephalopathy, HHE, and residual seizure disorders as associated medical conditions vis-a-vis DPT vaccination).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The NVAC concurred in these recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that the ACCV had not yet formally received the Task Force's or the NVAC's recommendations, it took up the substance of the proposed revisions at its December 1991 meeting.   In lieu of the literal text of the suggested changes, the ACCV members received what has been referred to as a \"matrix\"--essentially, a table comparing a synthesis of Task Force and NVAC recommendations and summarizing the rationales advanced by those bodies.   The ACCV discussed these recommendations at length and approved all but the one that suggested dropping encephalopathy from the Table.   As a counter-proposal, the ACCV encouraged the Secretary to modify the QAI definition of encephalopathy in a way that would restrict its meaning to acute or chronic episodes of a type more likely to result in significant harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the Secretary published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the Notice).   See 57 Fed.Reg. 36,878 (proposed Aug. 14, 1992).   The Notice included the required scientific findings and set forth regulations designed to revise the Table accordingly.   These covered all the Task Force's recommendations save only for the dropping of encephalopathy.   On that point the Secretary acquiesced in the ACCV's view and proposed a new definition of the condition similar in most respects to the definition discussed at the ACCV's December 1991 meeting.   See id. at 36,880.   A comment period and public hearing ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, the results of a ten-year study of acute childhood neurologic illnesses became available.   Recognizing the potential importance of the study, the Secretary stayed her hand and requested the IOM to review the newly compiled material.   In March 1994, the IOM concluded that the \"balance of the evidence is consistent with a causal relationship\" between DPT vaccination and certain forms of chronic nervous system dysfunction suffered by children who experience an acute neurologic illness shortly after vaccination.   Committee to Study New Research on Vaccines, Institute of Medicine, DPT Vaccine and Chronic Nervous System Dysfunction:  A New Analysis 2-3 (1994).   On March 24, 1994, the Secretary reopened the comment period for a limited time, restricting discussion to the question whether the previously proposed revisions should be modified in light of the supplemental report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its June 1994 meeting the ACCV discussed the new information as it concerned the proposed definition of encephalopathy.   This time, the ACCV did not achieve consensus on the subject, and simply transmitted the minutes of its meeting to the Secretary.   On February 8, 1995, the Secretary promulgated a final rule (under attack in this proceeding) that removed HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table and changed the definition of encephalopathy in a manner very similar (but not identical) to the manner originally suggested by the ACCV and proposed in the Notice.   See 60 Fed.Reg. 7678 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Francis and Lisa O'Connell (parents and legal representatives of Kelliann O'Connell), joined by a parents' advocacy group, now seek judicial review and vacatur of the final rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE PETITIONERS' CHALLENGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners raise three objections to the Secretary's action.   First, the petitioners assert that the Act does not empower the Secretary to change the definitions included in the QAI, but, rather, only authorizes the Secretary to add and subtract entries (i.e., vaccines and associated medical conditions) and change time periods specified in the Table proper.   Second, the petitioners contend that, even if the Secretary otherwise had authority to effectuate the contested change, she failed to follow the procedures mandated by the Act.   Finally, the petitioners insist that a decision to remove a medical condition from the Table must be based on definitive evidence refuting the existence of a causal relationship between the vaccine in question and the condition, and that the Secretary eliminated HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table notwithstanding the absence of such an evidentiary predicate.   We address each remonstrance separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A. Authority to Revise the QAI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners argue that the Secretary's attempt to change the definition of encephalopathy provided in the QAI is impuissant because it surpasses the authority granted to the Secretary by the Act.   The Act states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A modification of the Vaccine Injury Table under paragraph (1) [authorizing the Secretary to \"promulgate regulations to modify\" the Table] may add to, or delete from, the list of injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths, for which compensation may be provided or may change the time periods for the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or the significant aggravation of any such injury, disability, illness, condition, or death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c)(3) (emphasis supplied).   In the petitioners' view, the underscored phrases limit the Secretary's powers of alteration, and hence, because the QAI provision is distinct from the Table proper, the Secretary's revisory authority does not extend to it.   Ergo, changing the definition of encephalopathy contained in the QAI oversteps the Secretary's bounds.   The Secretary debunks this argument.   She construes the statute more broadly, urging that it gives her authority to rewrite the QAI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Chevron Deference.   Before choosing between these competing views, we must address a preliminary issue.   The Secretary, correctly observing that courts ordinarily defer to an agency's plausible construction of a silent or ambiguous statute as long as Congress has committed the statute to the agency for purposes of administration, see Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984);  Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  Dep't of Human Servs., 48 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 145, 133 L.Ed.2d 91 (1995), asks that we defer to her construction of &#167; 300aa-14(c).   There may be more to this request than meets the eye.   The petitioners' objection is arguably not directed at a regulation that purports to apply a particular statutory directive which the Secretary is concededly empowered to implement, but instead at a regulation that lies in an area as to which, the petitioners say, the statute grants the Secretary no rulemaking authority at all.   In the current state of the law, it is unclear whether deference is appropriate under such circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discretion is sometimes the better part of valor.   Because we decide, as a matter of original statutory construction, that the Act grants the Secretary authority to revise the QAI provision, see infra, we leave the question of deference unanswered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Interpreting the Statute.   We turn now to the disputed statute.   While one can focus with Cyclopean intensity on the words singled out by the petitioners and perhaps construct a coherent argument that those words restrict the Secretary's revisory authority to the Table proper, courts are bound to afford statutes a practical, commonsense reading.   See King v. St. Vincent's Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 574, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991).   Instead of culling selected words from a statute's text and inspecting them in an antiseptic laboratory setting, a court engaged in the task of statutory interpretation must examine the statute as a whole, giving due weight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to aggregate language.   See National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston &amp; Me.  Corp., 503 U.S. 407, 417, 112 S.Ct. 1394, 1401-02, 118 L.Ed.2d 52 (1992);  Dole v. United Steelworkers of Am., 494 U.S. 26, 36, 110 S.Ct. 929, 934-35, 108 L.Ed.2d 23 (1990);  K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 1817-18, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988);  Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners' reading of the Act cannot survive the application of this global standard.   Reading the statute as a whole, we are satisfied that Congress gave the Secretary authority to revise the QAI.   In the absence of such authority the system for updating the Act is virtually unworkable.   For instance, when the Secretary exercises her undeniable power to include an emergent condition in the Table, she must be able to amend the QAI to reflect the addition.   Surely Congress did not intend either to leave added conditions unexplained or itself to edit the QAI every time the Secretary saw fit to alter the Table.   In short, the power to revise the QAI is a necessary adjunct of the power to revise the Table itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Elsewise, the tension that would be created within the structure of the Act would be intolerable and would contravene the salutary principle that statutes should, whenever possible, be construed sensibly.   See American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 71, 102 S.Ct. 1534, 1538-39, 71 L.Ed.2d 748 (1982);  Riva, 61 F.3d at 1008;  United States v. Meyer, 808 F.2d 912, 919 (1st Cir.1987);  see also Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction &#167; 45.12, at 61 (5th ed. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the petitioners' proffered reading of the statute is excessively formalistic.   If the Secretary could not change the definition of encephalopathy directly, she could certainly accomplish the same result indirectly.   She need simply delete encephalopathy from the Table, thus rendering its definition nugatory, and then immediately add encephalopathy, redefined, to the Table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reality is lethal to the petitioners' position.   We cannot imagine that Congress intended to force the Secretary to go round and round the mulberry bush in order to revise the Table and its accompanying explanations.   The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and we will not lightly presume that Congress lost sight of so abecedarian a principle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See Singer, supra, &#167; 45.12, at 61 (advocating the baseline assumption that an enacted statute should be construed to \"achieve[ ] an effective and operative result\").   To cinch matters, we note that the statutory grant of a greater power typically includes the grant of a lesser power, see, e.g., United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 296 (1st Cir.1993) (describing this principle as \"a bit of common sense that has been recognized in virtually every legal code from time immemorial\"), and the overall structure of the Vaccine Act confirms its applicability here:  the brute power to subtract listed medical conditions from the Table encompasses the more modest power to trim the definitions associated with listed medical conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.   We hold that the Act grants the Secretary the authority to revise the Qualifications and Aids to Interpretation that accompany the Vaccine Injury Table.   Consequently, the petitioners' initial remonstrance fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>B. Notification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners accuse the Secretary of failing to observe the required notification procedures when she promulgated the regulation.   The accusation is unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The relevant statute provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Except with respect to a regulation recommended by the [ACCV], the Secretary may not propose a regulation under subsection (c) of this section or any revision thereof, unless the Secretary has first provided to the [ACCV] a copy of the proposed regulation or revision, requested recommendations and comments by the [ACCV], and afforded the [ACCV] at least 90 days to make such recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(d).   The petitioners contend that the Secretary neglected to follow these procedures twice over, by failing to provide the ACCV with (1) a copy of the Notice before publishing it, and (2) a copy of the final rule before issuing it.   We examine each contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Proposed Rule.   We rehearse the relevant facts.   Shortly after publication of the IOM Report, the Task Force made its initial recommendations for changing the Table.   The NVAC substantially concurred in those recommendations.   The Secretary's proposal was then circulated at the ACCV's December 1991 meeting in the form of a matrix detailing the various recommendations.   During the ensuing discussion, the principal objection was to the Secretary's proposal, reflected in the matrix, for removing encephalopathy from the Table.   The ACCV urged instead that encephalopathy should be retained in the Table but that its definition should be modified in the QAI.   The Secretary accepted the ACCV's unanimous recommendation and, in August 1992, published a Notice that implemented this recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See 57 Fed.Reg. at 36,880 (accepting ACCV recommendation to retain encephalopathy in the Table with a new definition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners argue that the rule ultimately promulgated is invalid because the matrix distributed and discussed in December of 1991 was not literally a \"copy of the proposed regulation\" as required by &#167; 300aa-14(d).   Although the matrix may not have been produced in the typical format for a proposed administrative regulation, we think that for all intents and purposes it was a \"copy\" of the regulation that the Secretary planned to propose.   The matrix contained the substance of all the proposed changes to the Table.   The only real difference appears to have been in manner of presentation.   The statute requires the Secretary to deliver all the meat of a planned rule to the Secretary without regard to how it is arranged on the platter.   Thus, as long as the Secretary transmits the entire substance of her proposed regulation to the ACCV in the appropriate time frame, the form of the transmission is immaterial.   This principle possesses particular force where, as here, the unorthodox format does not obfuscate or mislead.   Indeed, the matrix's tabular format increased comprehension by allowing the ACCV to discuss the revisions in a manner corresponding to the format of the Vaccine Injury Table itself.   We hold, therefore, that the Secretary fulfilled her statutory pre-publication duty in regard to the proposed regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there were any room for doubt about the adequacy of the transmittal--and we do not believe that there is--the ACCV's actions would dispel it.   We are particularly impressed by two things.   First, the transcript of the ACCV's December 1991 meeting makes very clear that ACCV members thought they were discussing the Secretary's proposed revisions to the Table.   Second, after the Secretary published the proposed regulation, the ACCV did not cry \"foul\" or otherwise complain that it had been bypassed.   These facts plainly show that the ACCV understood the matrix to be a \"copy of the proposed regulation\" and acted upon it as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Final Rule.   The Secretary's issuance of the final rule poses a somewhat closer question.   The Secretary openly admits that she did not provide the ACCV with the text of the final rule prior to its promulgation.   She argues, however, that the Act does not oblige her to do so, or that, if it does, she substantially complied with that obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 300aa-14(d) provides in material part that \"the Secretary may not propose a regulation ... or any revision thereof\" without first furnishing the ACCV with a copy of \"the regulation or revision,\" requesting comment, and marking time for ninety days.   This aspect of the controversy between the parties arises from the phrase \"any revision thereof.\"   In context, this phrase is susceptible to at least two reasonable meanings.   Under one interpretation, favored by the Secretary, the phrase refers to a revision of a regulation, so that, while the Secretary may not propose either a new regulation or a revision to an existing regulation without advance notice to the ACCV, she may proceed to revise a proposed regulation without resubmitting it to the ACCV.   Under the second interpretation, favored by the petitioners, the phrase \"any revision thereof\" refers to proposed regulations, so that the Secretary may propose neither a new regulation nor any later revision to that proposed regulation without first informing the ACCV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again our analysis begins with a nod in the direction of Chevron.   The rule of deference traditionally applies when the agency's interpretation is a \"product of delegated authority for rulemaking,\" Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 43-44, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1918, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993), a sphere that ordinarily encompasses legislative rules and agency adjudications.   Here, the Secretary's interpretation of the law is not embodied in a legislative rule or an adjudication.   The evidence of her view about how &#167; 300aa-14(d) is supposed to operate comes exclusively from two sources:  the refusal of her subordinates to send the ACCV a pre-publication copy of the final rule, and the tactical position adopted by her counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the first source, agency positions that are pieced together from offhand conduct of bureaucratic fussbudgets are entitled to little weight on judicial review, principally because they do not reflect the kind of delegated authority for policymaking that underlies the Chevron presumption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Stinson, 508 U.S. at 43-44, 113 S.Ct. at 1918;  Martin v. OSHRC, 499 U.S. 144, 157, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 1179, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991);  Public Citizen v. United States Dep't of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 463 n. 12, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 2571, n. 12, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989).   As for the second source, courts customarily withhold Chevron deference from agencies' litigating positions.   See, e.g., Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.  Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 212, 109 S.Ct. 468, 473-74, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988);  United States v. 29 Cartons of * * * an Article of Food, 987 F.2d 33, 38 n. 6 (1st Cir.1993);  Director, OWCP v. General Dynamics Corp., 980 F.2d 74, 79 (1st Cir.1992).   We see no reason to take a different tack in this instance.   We therefore decline to defer to the Secretary's construction of &#167; 300aa-14(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approaching the statutory question without the Secretary's thumb on the scale, we believe that both suggested interpretations are plausible but imperfect renditions of problematic language.   The petitioners' interpretation means that every alteration to the text of a proposed rule--even a minor technical or grammatical alteration--would have to be rerouted through the ACCV, subject to a fresh notice-and-comment period.   This extra step would be necessary even when the Secretary changes a proposed regulation in accordance with the ACCV's announced wishes or to correct a syntactical bevue.   Such a construction would create a nearly endless circle and attenuate the rulemaking process without achieving any corresponding benefit.   Because it is difficult to believe that Congress intended to prolong the revisory process by directing the Secretary to engage in a mindless minuet, the prospect of wasted motion cuts against the petitioners' interpretation.   See Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d 323, 360 (D.C.Cir.1980) (stating the obvious proposition that courts should be reluctant to interpret the terms of a statute \"to mandate pointless expenditures of effort\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's construction likewise presents a problem in that it may render the phrase \"any revision thereof\" superfluous to some extent.   Since the Secretary would have to issue a new regulation in order to change an existing one, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c), Congress probably did not need to add the requirement that a revision to an existing regulation must be reviewed by the ACCV.   Because courts usually presume that every word and phrase in a statute is pregnant with meaning, see, e.g., United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985), the prospect of redundancy cuts against the Secretary's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with no ideal choice, we conclude that Congress more likely intended the statute to be read as the Secretary urges.   This interpretation is more plausible and better serves the ends that the legislature sought to achieve.   Though it is possible that Congress could have accomplished its purpose without adding the disputed phrase (\"any revision thereof\"), it is not certain that it could have done so.   A wily lawyer could perhaps have argued that the unembellished word \"regulation\" referred only to brand-new regulations, not to adjustments of preexisting regulations.   Cf. Public Serv.  Co. v. United States EPA, 682 F.2d 626, 633 (7th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1127, 103 S.Ct. 762, 74 L.Ed.2d 977 (1983).   Even more likely, Congress might have thought that the Secretary would be able to style a revision to a preexisting regulation as something other than a new regulation (perhaps as a clarification), and thereby evade the statutory safeguards.   See, e.g., Detroit Edison Co. v. United States EPA, 496 F.2d 244, 249 (6th Cir.1974) (rejecting EPA's attempt to characterize agency action as mere \"clarification\" of regulation as opposed to revision);  cf. United States v. LaBonte, 70 F.3d 1396, 1411 n. 13 (1st Cir.1995) (noting Sentencing Commission's practice of styling certain pronouncements affecting the interpretation of extant sentencing guidelines as \"clarifications\" rather than amendments).   Moreover, a belt-and-suspenders approach is not uncommon when the Legislative Branch cedes rulemaking power to the Executive Branch.   Indeed, Congress has frequently employed the phrase \"revision thereof\" to confirm that its procedural mandates apply both to original regulations and future revisions of such regulations.   See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2934(f);  16 U.S.C. &#167; 410cc-32(e);  33 U.S.C. &#167; 1314(c);  42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4916(a)(3)-(4), 7521(a)(2), 7571(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary's interpretation not only is consistent with common congressional statute-drafting practice but also ensures the ACCV's input into the rulemaking process without inviting the wasteful circularity of proposal, notice, comment, changed proposal, re-notice, additional comment, and so on and so forth, ad infinitum.   The petitioners' suggested alternative, on the other hand, creates a perverse incentive.   If the Secretary is forced to recommit a proposed regulation and twiddle her thumbs for an additional three months every time she responds agreeably to an ACCV suggestion, she may be less inclined to acquiesce in the first place.   Hence, the interpretation that we adopt actually may increase the chance that the Secretary will pay attention to, and act upon, the ACCV's advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the conclusion that the statute refers to regulations and revisions thereof (and not to revisions of proposed regulations), we necessarily override two other concerns anent the ACCV's place in the scheme of things.   First, the petitioners boast that the ACCV's statutorily prescribed part in the process of revising the Table evinces Congress's distrust of the Secretary and proves that the reference to \"any revision thereof\" is intended to give the ACCV a more prominent presence in the rulemaking process.   This distorts the statutory alignment by grossly underestimating the Secretary's role and aggrandizing the ACCV's importance.   In crafting the Act, Congress delegated unusually great authority to the Secretary, including the power to rewrite the statute by updating one of its hallmark provisions.   In contrast, Congress assigned the ACCV a purely advisory function.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-19;  see also H.R.Rep. No. 908, supra, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6365.   Thus, far from bolstering the petitioners' case, a comparison of the relative responsibilities that Congress entrusted to the Secretary and the ACCV, respectively, undermines the petitioners' argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Secretary's construction of the statute does not permit her effectively to bypass the ACCV by proposing one regulation and then issuing something radically different as a final rule.   The Administrative Procedure Act applies here, and it is axiomatic under that regime that a final rule must be a lineal descendant of, and in character with, the earlier proposed rule.   See, e.g., Kooritzky v. Reich, 17 F.3d 1509, 1513 (D.C.Cir.1994);  American Medical Ass'n v. United States, 887 F.2d 760, 767 (7th Cir.1989).   Put another way, changes must flow logically from the prescribed notice and comment.   See Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. United States EPA, 824 F.2d 1258, 1283 (1st Cir.1987).   If the final rule deviates substantially from the proposed rule, it amounts to a new proposal and must run the regulatory gauntlet afresh.   Thus, the ACCV's right to be consulted is not stunted by the reading of &#167; 300aa-14(d) that we adopt today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we believe that Congress might reasonably have inserted the phrase \"any revision thereof\" to close what it suspected were potential loopholes.   We therefore accept the Secretary's thesis that the phrase \"any revision thereof,\" as used in &#167; 300aa-14(d), refers exclusively to revisions of existing regulations (not to revisions of proposed regulations).   On this understanding, we hold that the Secretary complied with the statutory notice-and-comment requirement by providing a pre-publication copy of her proposed regulation to the ACCV in December of 1991.C. Adding and Subtracting Medical Conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners' final shot injects a new notion into the case:  the idea that the Act does not authorize the Secretary to remove HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table in the absence of \"definitive information\" attesting to the lack of any causal link between DPT vaccination and these medical conditions.   Since both the IOM and the Secretary herself found only that there was \"insufficient evidence to indicate a causal relation\" between vaccination and the kind of permanent neurological damage reflected in HHE and residual seizure disorders over time, see IOM Report at 118;  Notice, 57 Fed.Reg. at 36,879, they tell us that the deletions cannot survive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary accepts the petitioners' premise--the available evidence does not flatly disprove the causal relation--but she vigorously disputes the petitioners' conclusion.   In her view, the criteria for revising the Table simply do not include the requirement that the petitioners seek to impose.   We agree with the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.   Nothing in the text of the Act prohibits the Secretary from eliminating a condition from the Table if the evidence of a causal relationship between the vaccination and that condition is equivocal.   The only explicit constraints on the Secretary are procedural.   See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c) (requiring notice-and-comment period, including public hearing);  id. &#167; 300aa-14(d) (mandating referral to the ACCV).   While some other constraints may be readily inferred from the terms, structure, and history of the Act, there is no principled basis for the added constraint that the petitioners would have us infer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners' construct rests solely on a suggestion in the committee report accompanying the Act to the effect that the Secretary may revise the Table when \"more definitive information\" is available.   They read this terse reference as superimposing on the text of the statute a requirement that the Secretary must have definitive evidence rejecting a causal relation between vaccination and a medical condition before she may delete the condition from the Table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners read the committee report through rose-colored glasses.   The passage on which they rely is reproduced in its entirety in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The passage as a whole makes it abundantly clear that, though Congress, struggling with a lack of information, itself used an initial presumption that the conditions listed in the Table were caused by vaccination so long as they occurred within the specified time period following vaccination, it did not intend to carve this presumption into stone.   To the precise contrary, the authors of the committee report explicitly recognized that the Table, as originally devised, might in some cases go too far, and relied on the Secretary to reconstitute it in light of the \"more definitive information\" that would be available as a consequence of the review, in order to reflect more accurately the causal relations between vaccines and allegedly associated medical conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Congress intended the Secretary to revise the Table by removing a medical condition only after a causal link was definitely disproven, it could quite easily have said so.   It said nothing of the sort.   What it did say is that the Secretary should update the Table in light of new and better information about causation.   The Secretary, in pursuance of this directive, decided inter alia to remove HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table because the medical evidence failed to establish a causal connection between DPT vaccines and these disorders.   Since there is nothing in the record to suggest that this decision is arbitrary or capricious, it must stand.   See, e.g., Strickland, 48 F.3d at 17-18;  United States v.

In Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi, 487 U.S. 354, 108 S.Ct. 2428, 101 L.Ed.2d 322 (1988), the Court affirmed an agency's interpretation of a statute in a comparable situation, but without relying on Chevron-type deference.   Justice Scalia, writing separately, argued for deference even though the interpretive question involved the scope of the agency's authority under the statute.  Id. at 381, 108 S.Ct. at 2444 (Scalia, J., concurring).   Justice Brennan, writing for himself and two other Justices, expressed the view that deference was inappropriate because the scope of an administrative agency's jurisdiction is not a decision that Congress normally entrusts to the agency.  Id. at 387, 108 S.Ct. at 2447 (Brennan, J., concurring).   The problem is complicated by a realization that almost any administrative action can be described by a challenger as either exceeding an agency's authority or overstepping the authorized application of agency authority.   See generally Thomas W. Merrill, Judicial Deference to Executive Precedent, 101 Yale L.J. 969, 997-98 (1992)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In their reply brief, the petitioners seemingly concede that this is so, but suggest that the Secretary may only revise the QAI when she is in the process of modifying the Table itself.   The suggestion is meritless.   Nothing in either the text or the history of the statute supports such an artificial construction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Congress had a golden opportunity to express an intent contrary to the Secretary's view that she possesses the power to revise the QAI, but it chose not to do so.   Originally, the Act did not permit the Secretary to add vaccines to the Table.   In 1993, Congress amended the law to allow the Secretary to add vaccines without specific congressional authorization.   See Pub.L. No. 103-66, &#167; 13632(a)(2), 107 Stat. 312, 645-46 (1993).   Congress made this important modification almost a year after the Secretary published the Notice (in which she proposed to alter the QAI) and after a number of loud voices had been raised during the comment period in strong opposition to the proposed action.   Despite this public clamor, Congress did not prohibit the Secretary from altering the QAI</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Though there appears to have been substantial consensus among ACCV members about the definition they would recommend to the Secretary, it is not clear whether the ACCV members irrevocably agreed on an exact definition.   This uncertainty arises because, while no formal vote was taken, the members approved in principle a specific definition proposed by Dr. Gerald Fenichel.   The members also agreed that some refinements to Dr. Fenichel's proposed definition might be necessary and apparently agreed to a mechanism for expediting action on any such refinements.   The administrative record (including the minutes approved at the next ACCV meeting) reveals no objections to Dr. Fenichel's final proposed definition and discloses no suggested refinements to it.   The Secretary included in the proposed rule a definition of encephalopathy that was substantially the same as this definition</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, the record indicates that the Secretary's minions were not even attempting to parse the Act's requirements, but, rather, were simply enunciating \"a matter of procedure and policy\" within the agency not to distribute final rules prematurely.   Quite obviously, this affords no basis for deference</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The passage reads:</p>\n        <p>The Committee recognizes that there is public debate over the incidence of illnesses that coincidentally occur within a short time of vaccination.   The Committee further recognizes that the deeming of vaccine-relatedness adopted [in the Table] may provide compensation to some children whose illness is not, in fact, vaccine-related.   The Committee anticipates that the research on vaccine injury and vaccine safety now ongoing and mandated by this legislation will soon provide more definitive information about the incidence of vaccine injury and that, when such information is available, the Secretary or the [ACCV] may propose to revise the Table....  Until such time, however, the Committee has chosen to provide compensation to all persons whose injuries meet the requirements of the petition and the Table and whose injuries cannot be demonstrated to be caused by other factors.</p>\n        <p>H.R.Rep.

THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administration of childhood vaccines, though critically important to public health, \"is not always without risk.\"   Committee to Review the Adverse Consequences of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines, Institute of Medicine, Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines 1 (1991) (IOM Report).   Since vaccines generally contain either dead bacteria or live but weakened viruses, it is not surprising that they are capable of causing serious adverse effects.   See id.   Despite the infrequency of such episodes, Congress feared that the long shadow of tort liability cast by vaccine-related injuries would drive up prices and eventually force vaccine suppliers out of the market.   See H.R.Rep. No. 908, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 4, 6-7 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6287, 6344, 6345, 6347-48.   Congress also worried that the vagaries of litigation, coupled with the cost, might leave many deserving victims of vaccine-related injuries undercompensated.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To protect the supply of vaccines while ensuring fair, timely compensation for victims, Congress departed from the traditional tort system and wrote the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (the Act), Pub.L. No. 99-660, tit.  III, 100 Stat. 3755 (1986).   Among other things, the Act established a special tribunal (the Vaccine Court), and moved vaccine-injury cases partly outside the customary tort framework.   See Schafer v. American Cyanamid Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666564\"><a href=\"/opinion/666564/mark-schafer-and-melissa-schafer-a-minor-by-and-through-mark-schafer/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining the mechanics of the Act).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In respect to cases brought before this tribunal, Congress eased the complainants' burdens both by dispensing with the requirement of proving negligence and by greatly simplifying the requisite proof of causation.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 300aa-11.   Of course, there are tradeoffs;  for example, Congress limited the damages that a victim could obtain for vaccine-related injuries.   See id. &#167; 300aa-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In aid of the neoteric regulatory regime, the Act provides, in tabular format, a listing of vaccines and a parallel listing of medical conditions commonly associated with the use of each vaccine.   See id. &#167; 300aa-14(a).   These listings, known collectively as the Vaccine Injury Table (the Table), are accompanied by, and are to be read in light of, the Qualifications and Aids to Interpretation (QAI).   The QAI is a separate subsection that provides definitions and explanations for the terms used in the Table.   See id. &#167; 300aa-14(b).   To receive compensation for a vaccine-related injury, a recipient must simply petition the Vaccine Court and show that, within a prescribed time span, she suffered one or more of the disorders listed in the Table as associated with the particular vaccine that she received.   Thus, the content of the Table (a sample of which is excerpted in the Appendix) is critical:  it is only when a vaccinated child suffers a listed condition within applicable temporal parameters that compensation will be forthcoming without the time, expense, proof requirements, and uncertainty of full-blown litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Table is not intended to be static.   Congress gave the Secretary express power to promulgate regulations adding to or subtracting from the tabular list of conditions, and changing the delineated time periods.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c)(3).   This is a rather odd approach because it authorizes the Secretary, in effect, to amend the statutorily enacted Table by way of administrative rulemaking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This grant of power probably reflected a congressional consensus that the first iteration of the Table was not perfect.   Driven by a sense of urgency to put something into place, the solons knowingly used incomplete data when forging the causal links between vaccines and associated medical conditions.   Mindful of its haste, Congress directed the Secretary to have the Institute of Medicine (IOM)--an arm of the National Academy of Science--conduct an extensive review of all available information bearing on the relationship between vaccines and medical conditions, and thereafter to publish findings and revise the Table based on the IOM's study.   See Vaccine Act &#167; 312, 100 Stat. at 3779.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To assist the Secretary in updating the Table, Congress created the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV)--a body composed of a cross-section of health professionals, legal experts, interested citizens (including two who are parents of children victimized by vaccine-related injuries), and federal officials.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-19.   Congress directed the Secretary to provide the ACCV with a copy of each contemplated regulation before formally proposing it, and then to await the expiration of a ninety-day comment period before moving forward.   See id. &#167; 300aa-14(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COURSE OF EVENTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, the IOM completed its study and, on August 27, issued the IOM Report.   Among the many conclusions contained in this tome the IOM found a causal relation between DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) vaccine, on one hand, and acute encephalopathy and hypotonic, hyporesponse episodes (HHE), on the other hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See IOM Report at 118, 177.   However, the IOM found insufficient evidence to indicate a causal relationship between DPT vaccine and residual seizure disorders (such as epilepsy).   See id. at 118 n. 3.   The project director gave the ACCV a full briefing on the IOM Report in September of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In anticipation of receiving the IOM Report, the Secretary formed a Public Health Service Task Force as a vehicle for revising the Table.   She also enlisted yet another helpmate, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC).   Unlike the ACCV, which by statute counsels the Secretary in respect to the injury compensation program, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-19, the NVAC's statutory responsibility is to advise the director of the separate national program for developing and administering the public health aspects of immunization policy, see id. &#167; 300aa-5.   The Secretary transmitted the IOM Report to the Task Force, which then recommended a number of changes to the Table (including the removal of encephalopathy, HHE, and residual seizure disorders as associated medical conditions vis-a-vis DPT vaccination).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The NVAC concurred in these recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that the ACCV had not yet formally received the Task Force's or the NVAC's recommendations, it took up the substance of the proposed revisions at its December 1991 meeting.   In lieu of the literal text of the suggested changes, the ACCV members received what has been referred to as a \"matrix\"--essentially, a table comparing a synthesis of Task Force and NVAC recommendations and summarizing the rationales advanced by those bodies.   The ACCV discussed these recommendations at length and approved all but the one that suggested dropping encephalopathy from the Table.   As a counter-proposal, the ACCV encouraged the Secretary to modify the QAI definition of encephalopathy in a way that would restrict its meaning to acute or chronic episodes of a type more likely to result in significant harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the Secretary published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the Notice).   See 57 Fed.Reg. 36,878 (proposed Aug. 14, 1992).   The Notice included the required scientific findings and set forth regulations designed to revise the Table accordingly.   These covered all the Task Force's recommendations save only for the dropping of encephalopathy.   On that point the Secretary acquiesced in the ACCV's view and proposed a new definition of the condition similar in most respects to the definition discussed at the ACCV's December 1991 meeting.   See id. at 36,880.   A comment period and public hearing ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, the results of a ten-year study of acute childhood neurologic illnesses became available.   Recognizing the potential importance of the study, the Secretary stayed her hand and requested the IOM to review the newly compiled material.   In March 1994, the IOM concluded that the \"balance of the evidence is consistent with a causal relationship\" between DPT vaccination and certain forms of chronic nervous system dysfunction suffered by children who experience an acute neurologic illness shortly after vaccination.   Committee to Study New Research on Vaccines, Institute of Medicine, DPT Vaccine and Chronic Nervous System Dysfunction:  A New Analysis 2-3 (1994).   On March 24, 1994, the Secretary reopened the comment period for a limited time, restricting discussion to the question whether the previously proposed revisions should be modified in light of the supplemental report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its June 1994 meeting the ACCV discussed the new information as it concerned the proposed definition of encephalopathy.   This time, the ACCV did not achieve consensus on the subject, and simply transmitted the minutes of its meeting to the Secretary.   On February 8, 1995, the Secretary promulgated a final rule (under attack in this proceeding) that removed HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table and changed the definition of encephalopathy in a manner very similar (but not identical) to the manner originally suggested by the ACCV and proposed in the Notice.   See 60 Fed.Reg. 7678 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Francis and Lisa O'Connell (parents and legal representatives of Kelliann O'Connell), joined by a parents' advocacy group, now seek judicial review and vacatur of the final rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE PETITIONERS' CHALLENGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners raise three objections to the Secretary's action.   First, the petitioners assert that the Act does not empower the Secretary to change the definitions included in the QAI, but, rather, only authorizes the Secretary to add and subtract entries (i.e., vaccines and associated medical conditions) and change time periods specified in the Table proper.   Second, the petitioners contend that, even if the Secretary otherwise had authority to effectuate the contested change, she failed to follow the procedures mandated by the Act.   Finally, the petitioners insist that a decision to remove a medical condition from the Table must be based on definitive evidence refuting the existence of a causal relationship between the vaccine in question and the condition, and that the Secretary eliminated HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table notwithstanding the absence of such an evidentiary predicate.   We address each remonstrance separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A. Authority to Revise the QAI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners argue that the Secretary's attempt to change the definition of encephalopathy provided in the QAI is impuissant because it surpasses the authority granted to the Secretary by the Act.   The Act states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A modification of the Vaccine Injury Table under paragraph (1) [authorizing the Secretary to \"promulgate regulations to modify\" the Table] may add to, or delete from, the list of injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths, for which compensation may be provided or may change the time periods for the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or the significant aggravation of any such injury, disability, illness, condition, or death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c)(3) (emphasis supplied).   In the petitioners' view, the underscored phrases limit the Secretary's powers of alteration, and hence, because the QAI provision is distinct from the Table proper, the Secretary's revisory authority does not extend to it.   Ergo, changing the definition of encephalopathy contained in the QAI oversteps the Secretary's bounds.   The Secretary debunks this argument.   She construes the statute more broadly, urging that it gives her authority to rewrite the QAI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Chevron Deference.   Before choosing between these competing views, we must address a preliminary issue.   The Secretary, correctly observing that courts ordinarily defer to an agency's plausible construction of a silent or ambiguous statute as long as Congress has committed the statute to the agency for purposes of administration, see Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 842-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The petitioners' objection is arguably not directed at a regulation that purports to apply a particular statutory directive which the Secretary is concededly empowered to implement, but instead at a regulation that lies in an area as to which, the petitioners say, the statute grants the Secretary no rulemaking authority at all.   In the current state of the law, it is unclear whether deference is appropriate under such circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discretion is sometimes the better part of valor.

Interpreting the Statute.   We turn now to the disputed statute.   While one can focus with Cyclopean intensity on the words singled out by the petitioners and perhaps construct a coherent argument that those words restrict the Secretary's revisory authority to the Table proper, courts are bound to afford statutes a practical, commonsense reading.   See King v. St. Vincent's Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112670\"><a href=\"/opinion/112670/king-v-st-vincents-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 221, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112670\"><a href=\"/opinion/112670/king-v-st-vincents-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instead of culling selected words from a statute's text and inspecting them in an antiseptic laboratory setting, a court engaged in the task of statutory interpretation must examine the statute as a whole, giving due weight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to aggregate language.

Reading the statute as a whole, we are satisfied that Congress gave the Secretary authority to revise the QAI.   In the absence of such authority the system for updating the Act is virtually unworkable.   For instance, when the Secretary exercises her undeniable power to include an emergent condition in the Table, she must be able to amend the QAI to reflect the addition.   Surely Congress did not intend either to leave added conditions unexplained or itself to edit the QAI every time the Secretary saw fit to alter the Table.   In short, the power to revise the QAI is a necessary adjunct of the power to revise the Table itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Elsewise, the tension that would be created within the structure of the Act would be intolerable and would contravene the salutary principle that statutes should, whenever possible, be construed sensibly.

If the Secretary could not change the definition of encephalopathy directly, she could certainly accomplish the same result indirectly.   She need simply delete encephalopathy from the Table, thus rendering its definition nugatory, and then immediately add encephalopathy, redefined, to the Table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reality is lethal to the petitioners' position.   We cannot imagine that Congress intended to force the Secretary to go round and round the mulberry bush in order to revise the Table and its accompanying explanations.   The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and we will not lightly presume that Congress lost sight of so abecedarian a principle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See Singer, supra, &#167; 45.12, at 61 (advocating the baseline assumption that an enacted statute should be construed to \"achieve[ ] an effective and operative result\").   To cinch matters, we note that the statutory grant of a greater power typically includes the grant of a lesser power, see, e.g., United States v. O'Neil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658542\"><a href=\"/opinion/658542/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 296 (1st Cir.1993) (describing this principle as \"a bit of common sense that has been recognized in virtually every legal code from time immemorial\"), and the overall structure of the Vaccine Act confirms its applicability here:  the brute power to subtract listed medical conditions from the Table encompasses the more modest power to trim the definitions associated with listed medical conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.

Notification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners accuse the Secretary of failing to observe the required notification procedures when she promulgated the regulation.   The accusation is unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The relevant statute provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Except with respect to a regulation recommended by the [ACCV], the Secretary may not propose a regulation under subsection (c) of this section or any revision thereof, unless the Secretary has first provided to the [ACCV] a copy of the proposed regulation or revision, requested recommendations and comments by the [ACCV], and afforded the [ACCV] at least 90 days to make such recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(d).   The petitioners contend that the Secretary neglected to follow these procedures twice over, by failing to provide the ACCV with (1) a copy of the Notice before publishing it, and (2) a copy of the final rule before issuing it.   We examine each contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Proposed Rule.   We rehearse the relevant facts.   Shortly after publication of the IOM Report, the Task Force made its initial recommendations for changing the Table.   The NVAC substantially concurred in those recommendations.   The Secretary's proposal was then circulated at the ACCV's December 1991 meeting in the form of a matrix detailing the various recommendations.   During the ensuing discussion, the principal objection was to the Secretary's proposal, reflected in the matrix, for removing encephalopathy from the Table.   The ACCV urged instead that encephalopathy should be retained in the Table but that its definition should be modified in the QAI.   The Secretary accepted the ACCV's unanimous recommendation and, in August 1992, published a Notice that implemented this recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See 57 Fed.Reg. at 36,880 (accepting ACCV recommendation to retain encephalopathy in the Table with a new definition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners argue that the rule ultimately promulgated is invalid because the matrix distributed and discussed in December of 1991 was not literally a \"copy of the proposed regulation\" as required by &#167; 300aa-14(d).   Although the matrix may not have been produced in the typical format for a proposed administrative regulation, we think that for all intents and purposes it was a \"copy\" of the regulation that the Secretary planned to propose.   The matrix contained the substance of all the proposed changes to the Table.   The only real difference appears to have been in manner of presentation.   The statute requires the Secretary to deliver all the meat of a planned rule to the Secretary without regard to how it is arranged on the platter.   Thus, as long as the Secretary transmits the entire substance of her proposed regulation to the ACCV in the appropriate time frame, the form of the transmission is immaterial.   This principle possesses particular force where, as here, the unorthodox format does not obfuscate or mislead.   Indeed, the matrix's tabular format increased comprehension by allowing the ACCV to discuss the revisions in a manner corresponding to the format of the Vaccine Injury Table itself.   We hold, therefore, that the Secretary fulfilled her statutory pre-publication duty in regard to the proposed regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there were any room for doubt about the adequacy of the transmittal--and we do not believe that there is--the ACCV's actions would dispel it.   We are particularly impressed by two things.   First, the transcript of the ACCV's December 1991 meeting makes very clear that ACCV members thought they were discussing the Secretary's proposed revisions to the Table.   Second, after the Secretary published the proposed regulation, the ACCV did not cry \"foul\" or otherwise complain that it had been bypassed.   These facts plainly show that the ACCV understood the matrix to be a \"copy of the proposed regulation\" and acted upon it as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Final Rule.   The Secretary's issuance of the final rule poses a somewhat closer question.   The Secretary openly admits that she did not provide the ACCV with the text of the final rule prior to its promulgation.   She argues, however, that the Act does not oblige her to do so, or that, if it does, she substantially complied with that obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 300aa-14(d) provides in material part that \"the Secretary may not propose a regulation ... or any revision thereof\" without first furnishing the ACCV with a copy of \"the regulation or revision,\" requesting comment, and marking time for ninety days.   This aspect of the controversy between the parties arises from the phrase \"any revision thereof.\"   In context, this phrase is susceptible to at least two reasonable meanings.   Under one interpretation, favored by the Secretary, the phrase refers to a revision of a regulation, so that, while the Secretary may not propose either a new regulation or a revision to an existing regulation without advance notice to the ACCV, she may proceed to revise a proposed regulation without resubmitting it to the ACCV.   Under the second interpretation, favored by the petitioners, the phrase \"any revision thereof\" refers to proposed regulations, so that the Secretary may propose neither a new regulation nor any later revision to that proposed regulation without first informing the ACCV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again our analysis begins with a nod in the direction of Chevron.   The rule of deference traditionally applies when the agency's interpretation is a \"product of delegated authority for rulemaking,\" Stinson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 43-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (1993), a sphere that ordinarily encompasses legislative rules and agency adjudications.   Here, the Secretary's interpretation of the law is not embodied in a legislative rule or an adjudication.   The evidence of her view about how &#167; 300aa-14(d) is supposed to operate comes exclusively from two sources:  the refusal of her subordinates to send the ACCV a pre-publication copy of the final rule, and the tactical position adopted by her counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the first source, agency positions that are pieced together from offhand conduct of bureaucratic fussbudgets are entitled to little weight on judicial review, principally because they do not reflect the kind of delegated authority for policymaking that underlies the Chevron presumption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Stinson, 508 U.S. at 43-44, 113 S.Ct. at 1918;  Martin v.

We see no reason to take a different tack in this instance.   We therefore decline to defer to the Secretary's construction of &#167; 300aa-14(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approaching the statutory question without the Secretary's thumb on the scale, we believe that both suggested interpretations are plausible but imperfect renditions of problematic language.   The petitioners' interpretation means that every alteration to the text of a proposed rule--even a minor technical or grammatical alteration--would have to be rerouted through the ACCV, subject to a fresh notice-and-comment period.   This extra step would be necessary even when the Secretary changes a proposed regulation in accordance with the ACCV's announced wishes or to correct a syntactical bevue.   Such a construction would create a nearly endless circle and attenuate the rulemaking process without achieving any corresponding benefit.   Because it is difficult to believe that Congress intended to prolong the revisory process by directing the Secretary to engage in a mindless minuet, the prospect of wasted motion cuts against the petitioners' interpretation.   See Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384927\"><a href=\"/opinion/384927/alabama-power-company-v-douglas-m-costle-as-administrator-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 360 (D.C.Cir.1980) (stating the obvious proposition that courts should be reluctant to interpret the terms of a statute \"to mandate pointless expenditures of effort\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's construction likewise presents a problem in that it may render the phrase \"any revision thereof\" superfluous to some extent.   Since the Secretary would have to issue a new regulation in order to change an existing one, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c), Congress probably did not need to add the requirement that a revision to an existing regulation must be reviewed by the ACCV.   Because courts usually presume that every word and phrase in a statute is pregnant with meaning, see, e.g., United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450368\"><a href=\"/opinion/450368/united-states-v-ven-fuel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985), the prospect of redundancy cuts against the Secretary's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with no ideal choice, we conclude that Congress more likely intended the statute to be read as the Secretary urges.   This interpretation is more plausible and better serves the ends that the legislature sought to achieve.   Though it is possible that Congress could have accomplished its purpose without adding the disputed phrase (\"any revision thereof\"), it is not certain that it could have done so.   A wily lawyer could perhaps have argued that the unembellished word \"regulation\" referred only to brand-new regulations, not to adjustments of preexisting regulations.   Cf. Public Serv.  Co. v. United States EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406106\"><a href=\"/opinion/406106/public-service-company-of-indiana-inc-v-united-states-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 633 (7th Cir.1982), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></span> (1983).   Even more likely, Congress might have thought that the Secretary would be able to style a revision to a preexisting regulation as something other than a new regulation (perhaps as a clarification), and thereby evade the statutory safeguards.   See, e.g., Detroit Edison Co. v. United States EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318996\"><a href=\"/opinion/318996/the-detroit-edison-company-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 249 (6th Cir.1974) (rejecting EPA's attempt to characterize agency action as mere \"clarification\" of regulation as opposed to revision);  cf. United States v. LaBonte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709025\"><a href=\"/opinion/709025/united-states-v-george-labonte-united-states-of-america-v-david-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1396</span></a></span>, 1411 n. 13 (1st Cir.1995) (noting Sentencing Commission's practice of styling certain pronouncements affecting the interpretation of extant sentencing guidelines as \"clarifications\" rather than amendments).   Moreover, a belt-and-suspenders approach is not uncommon when the Legislative Branch cedes rulemaking power to the Executive Branch.   Indeed, Congress has frequently employed the phrase \"revision thereof\" to confirm that its procedural mandates apply both to original regulations and future revisions of such regulations.   See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. &#167; 2934(f);  16 U.S.C. &#167; 410cc-32(e);  33 U.S.C. &#167; 1314(c);  42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4916(a)(3)-(4), 7521(a)(2), 7571(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary's interpretation not only is consistent with common congressional statute-drafting practice but also ensures the ACCV's input into the rulemaking process without inviting the wasteful circularity of proposal, notice, comment, changed proposal, re-notice, additional comment, and so on and so forth, ad infinitum.   The petitioners' suggested alternative, on the other hand, creates a perverse incentive.   If the Secretary is forced to recommit a proposed regulation and twiddle her thumbs for an additional three months every time she responds agreeably to an ACCV suggestion, she may be less inclined to acquiesce in the first place.   Hence, the interpretation that we adopt actually may increase the chance that the Secretary will pay attention to, and act upon, the ACCV's advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the conclusion that the statute refers to regulations and revisions thereof (and not to revisions of proposed regulations), we necessarily override two other concerns anent the ACCV's place in the scheme of things.   First, the petitioners boast that the ACCV's statutorily prescribed part in the process of revising the Table evinces Congress's distrust of the Secretary and proves that the reference to \"any revision thereof\" is intended to give the ACCV a more prominent presence in the rulemaking process.   This distorts the statutory alignment by grossly underestimating the Secretary's role and aggrandizing the ACCV's importance.   In crafting the Act, Congress delegated unusually great authority to the Secretary, including the power to rewrite the statute by updating one of its hallmark provisions.   In contrast, Congress assigned the ACCV a purely advisory function.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-19;  see also H.R.Rep. No. 908, supra, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6365.   Thus, far from bolstering the petitioners' case, a comparison of the relative responsibilities that Congress entrusted to the Secretary and the ACCV, respectively, undermines the petitioners' argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Secretary's construction of the statute does not permit her effectively to bypass the ACCV by proposing one regulation and then issuing something radically different as a final rule.   The Administrative Procedure Act applies here, and it is axiomatic under that regime that a final rule must be a lineal descendant of, and in character with, the earlier proposed rule.   See, e.g., Kooritzky v. Reich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664617\"><a href=\"/opinion/664617/samuel-g-kooritzky-v-robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1509</span></a></span>, 1513 (D.C.Cir.1994);  American Medical Ass'n v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530602\"><a href=\"/opinion/530602/american-medical-association-cross-appellant-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, 767 (7th Cir.1989).   Put another way, changes must flow logically from the prescribed notice and comment.   See Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. United States EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492030\"><a href=\"/opinion/492030/natural-resources-defense-council-inc-conservation-law-foundation-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span>, 1283 (1st Cir.1987).   If the final rule deviates substantially from the proposed rule, it amounts to a new proposal and must run the regulatory gauntlet afresh.   Thus, the ACCV's right to be consulted is not stunted by the reading of &#167; 300aa-14(d) that we adopt today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we believe that Congress might reasonably have inserted the phrase \"any revision thereof\" to close what it suspected were potential loopholes.   We therefore accept the Secretary's thesis that the phrase \"any revision thereof,\" as used in &#167; 300aa-14(d), refers exclusively to revisions of existing regulations (not to revisions of proposed regulations).   On this understanding, we hold that the Secretary complied with the statutory notice-and-comment requirement by providing a pre-publication copy of her proposed regulation to the ACCV in December of 1991.C. Adding and Subtracting Medical Conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners' final shot injects a new notion into the case:  the idea that the Act does not authorize the Secretary to remove HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table in the absence of \"definitive information\" attesting to the lack of any causal link between DPT vaccination and these medical conditions.   Since both the IOM and the Secretary herself found only that there was \"insufficient evidence to indicate a causal relation\" between vaccination and the kind of permanent neurological damage reflected in HHE and residual seizure disorders over time, see IOM Report at 118;  Notice, 57 Fed.Reg. at 36,879, they tell us that the deletions cannot survive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary accepts the petitioners' premise--the available evidence does not flatly disprove the causal relation--but she vigorously disputes the petitioners' conclusion.   In her view, the criteria for revising the Table simply do not include the requirement that the petitioners seek to impose.   We agree with the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.   Nothing in the text of the Act prohibits the Secretary from eliminating a condition from the Table if the evidence of a causal relationship between the vaccination and that condition is equivocal.   The only explicit constraints on the Secretary are procedural.   See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300aa-14(c) (requiring notice-and-comment period, including public hearing);  id. &#167; 300aa-14(d) (mandating referral to the ACCV).   While some other constraints may be readily inferred from the terms, structure, and history of the Act, there is no principled basis for the added constraint that the petitioners would have us infer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners' construct rests solely on a suggestion in the committee report accompanying the Act to the effect that the Secretary may revise the Table when \"more definitive information\" is available.   They read this terse reference as superimposing on the text of the statute a requirement that the Secretary must have definitive evidence rejecting a causal relation between vaccination and a medical condition before she may delete the condition from the Table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners read the committee report through rose-colored glasses.   The passage on which they rely is reproduced in its entirety in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The passage as a whole makes it abundantly clear that, though Congress, struggling with a lack of information, itself used an initial presumption that the conditions listed in the Table were caused by vaccination so long as they occurred within the specified time period following vaccination, it did not intend to carve this presumption into stone.   To the precise contrary, the authors of the committee report explicitly recognized that the Table, as originally devised, might in some cases go too far, and relied on the Secretary to reconstitute it in light of the \"more definitive information\" that would be available as a consequence of the review, in order to reflect more accurately the causal relations between vaccines and allegedly associated medical conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Congress intended the Secretary to revise the Table by removing a medical condition only after a causal link was definitely disproven, it could quite easily have said so.   It said nothing of the sort.   What it did say is that the Secretary should update the Table in light of new and better information about causation.   The Secretary, in pursuance of this directive, decided inter alia to remove HHE and residual seizure disorders from the Table because the medical evidence failed to establish a causal connection between DPT vaccines and these disorders.   Since there is nothing in the record to suggest that this decision is arbitrary or capricious, it must stand.   See, e.g., Strickland, 48 F.3d at 17-18;  United States v. Members of the Estate of Luis Boothby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195199\"><a href=\"/opinion/195199/united-states-v-boothby-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1994);  see also 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Justice Scalia, writing separately, argued for deference even though the interpretive question involved the scope of the agency's authority under the statute.  Id. at 381, 108 S.Ct. at 2444 (Scalia, J., concurring).   Justice Brennan, writing for himself and two other Justices, expressed the view that deference was inappropriate because the scope of an administrative agency's jurisdiction is not a decision that Congress normally entrusts to the agency.  Id. at 387, 108 S.Ct. at 2447 (Brennan, J., concurring).   The problem is complicated by a realization that almost any administrative action can be described by a challenger as either exceeding an agency's authority or overstepping the authorized application of agency authority.   See generally Thomas W. Merrill, Judicial Deference to Executive Precedent, 101 Yale L.J. 969, 997-98 (1992)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In their reply brief, the petitioners seemingly concede that this is so, but suggest that the Secretary may only revise the QAI when she is in the process of modifying the Table itself.   The suggestion is meritless.   Nothing in either the text or the history of the statute supports such an artificial construction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Congress had a golden opportunity to express an intent contrary to the Secretary's view that she possesses the power to revise the QAI, but it chose not to do so.   Originally, the Act did not permit the Secretary to add vaccines to the Table.   In 1993, Congress amended the law to allow the Secretary to add vaccines without specific congressional authorization.   See Pub.L. No. 103-66, &#167; 13632(a)(2), 107 Stat. 312, 645-46 (1993).   Congress made this important modification almost a year after the Secretary published the Notice (in which she proposed to alter the QAI) and after a number of loud voices had been raised during the comment period in strong opposition to the proposed action.   Despite this public clamor, Congress did not prohibit the Secretary from altering the QAI</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Though there appears to have been substantial consensus among ACCV members about the definition they would recommend to the Secretary, it is not clear whether the ACCV members irrevocably agreed on an exact definition.   This uncertainty arises because, while no formal vote was taken, the members approved in principle a specific definition proposed by Dr. Gerald Fenichel.   The members also agreed that some refinements to Dr. Fenichel's proposed definition might be necessary and apparently agreed to a mechanism for expediting action on any such refinements.   The administrative record (including the minutes approved at the next ACCV meeting) reveals no objections to Dr. Fenichel's final proposed definition and discloses no suggested refinements to it.   The Secretary included in the proposed rule a definition of encephalopathy that was substantially the same as this definition</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, the record indicates that the Secretary's minions were not even attempting to parse the Act's requirements, but, rather, were simply enunciating \"a matter of procedure and policy\" within the agency not to distribute final rules prematurely.
