George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                     \r\n\n  Arnold P. Cohen on brief for appellants.\r\nDonald K. Stern, U.S. Attorney, and Nadine Pellegrini,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.     \r\n\n                                     \r\n\n                    June 25, 1998\r\n                     \r\n\nPer Curiam.  Assenati Viera and Sebastiao de Souza appeal\r\nfrom sentences imposed following guilty pleas to six counts related\r\nto a conspiracy to produce and sell false Social Security and\r\n\"green\" cards.  They admitted to completing the cards with\r\nphotographs, seals, numbers, names and signatures, and to selling\r\nthem.  Their sole argument on appeal is that the district court\r\nerred in increasing their base offense level by six levels under\r\nU.S.S.G.  2L2.1(b)(2)(C) (1995).  That increase was based on a\r\nfinding that the offenses to which they pled guilty \"involved\" one\r\nhundred or more documents, within the meaning of the guidelines. \r\nDefendants maintain that the evidence did not support a finding\r\nthat one hundred or more counterfeit documents were actually\r\nproduced during the conspiracy.  But \"involved\" does not mean\r\n\"produced.\"  Nor are the standards of what needs to be proved for\r\nconviction the same as those which may be considered for\r\nsentencing.  We affirm.\r\nSection 2L2.1 of the Guidelines is titled in relevant\r\npart: \"Trafficking in a Document Relating to Naturalization,\r\nCitizenship, or Legal Resident Status.\"  It  provides in relevant\r\npart:\r\n(2) If the offense involved six or more\r\ndocuments or passports, increase as follows:\r\n\n   Number of            \r\n   Documents/Passports     Increase in Level\r\n\n(A)  6-24                    add 2\r\n(B)  25-99                   add 4\r\n(C)  100 or more             add 6.\r\nU.S.S.G.  2L2.1(b)(2) (1995).   Defendants argue that federal\r\nagents obtained only six or seven completed counterfeit documents\r\nduring their investigation, and that only a two level increase\r\nshould have been imposed.  We reject the notion that the term\r\n\"involved\" refers only to completed documents.  Rather, applying a\r\nmore ordinary definition, we read \"involved\" as referring to items\r\n\"draw[n] in,\" \"implicated\" or \"entangled.\"  Webster's Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary 1993 at 1191. \r\nHere, there was evidence that defendants had produced and\r\ntrafficked, or intended to produce and traffic, hundreds of\r\ncounterfeit documents.  Analysis of typewriter ribbons seized from\r\ndefendants' apartment showed the imprint of over 400 names and\r\nSocial Security numbers.  In addition, over 600 blank Social\r\nSecurity cards were seized from a third co-conspirator's apartment. \r\nThe district court properly considered this evidence in its\r\ndetermination of how many documents were \"involved\" in defendants'\r\ncounterfeiting scheme.  See United States v. Salazar, 70 F.3d 351,\r\n352 (5th Cir. 1995) (blank documents with which defendant intended\r\nto make forgeries were \"involved\" in crime for sentencing purposes\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  2L2.1(b)(2)).  Like the Fifth Circuit, for\r\nsentencing purposes, \"[w]e see no reason to distinguish between\r\ncompleted and uncompleted documents,\"  Salazar, 70 F.3d at 352,\r\nwhen determining whether documents are \"involved\" in a crime.\r\nAt sentencing, the government need only prove facts by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Jackson, 3\r\nF.3d 506, 509 (1st Cir. 1993).  This court will set aside a factual\r\nfinding of the district court only for clear error.  Id. at 508. \r\nGiven the evidence, it was not clear error for the district court\r\nto find that the offenses to which defendants pled guilty more\r\nlikely than not \"involved\" 100 or more documents under U.S.S.G. \r\n2L2.1(b)(2). \r\nEach defendant's sentence is affirmed.\r\n",
