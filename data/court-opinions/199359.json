After carefully considering the briefs\n\nand    record    on    appeal,     we    affirm   substantially          for   the\n\nreasons developed in the district court.                       We add only the\n\nfollowing.\n\n             Mr. Emanuel argues on appeal that the district\n\ncourt improperly dismissed Quality’s claim for breach of a\n\nduty    to   foreclose     in    a    commercially       reasonable      manner.\n\nAlthough we express no opinion about the existence of such\n\na cause of action, since we have already dismissed the\n\ncorporation’s appeal, the claim is not before us.\n\n             The appellant also argues that the court erred in\n\nrefusing to allow him to represent Quality, and may intend\n\nto suggest that the court erred in dismissing a claim he\n\nheld as guarantor.              Below, Appellant raised the issues\n\nbelatedly and the court finally dismissed the action for\n\nfailure to prosecute without considering them.                         The court\n\nfound that, despite numerous extensions and warnings, the\n\nappellant repeatedly failed to meet deadlines.                    The case was\n\nnearly three years old, but presented no discernable claim.\n\nUnder    the    circumstances,          the    court     did   not     abuse   its\n\nconsiderable          discretion        in    dismissing,      nor     does    the\n\nappellant       present    any       argument     that    it    did.      John’s\n\fInsulation, Inc. v. L. Addison and Associates, Inc., 156\n\nF.3d 101 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n         Appellant raises no other issue on appeal that was\n\nproperly presented below.    Hernandez-Hernandez v.   United\n\nStates, 904 F.2d 758, 763 (1st Cir. 1990)(arguments may not\n\nbe presented for the first time on appeal).\n\n         Affirmed.   Loc.
