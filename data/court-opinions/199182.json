Plaintiffs,     James   Nollet,    James\n\n Carroll, and Earl Sholley, appeal the district court's grant\n\n of a motion to dismiss in favor of defendants.1          See Nollet\n\n v. Justices of Trial Courts of Comm. of Mass., 83 F. Supp.\n\n 2d 204 (D. Mass. 2000).      We review, de novo, the grant of a\n\n motion    to   dismiss.     See   Tag/ICIB   Serv.,   Inc.,     v.   Pan\n\n American Grain Co., Inc., 215 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n Upon review of the parties' briefs and the record on appeal,\n\n we affirm.\n\n             The plaintiffs' equal protection claim was properly\n\n dismissed because it sought injunctive relief barred by §\n\n 1983, as amended by the Federal Courts Improvement Act of\n\n 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-317, Title III, § 309(c), 110 Stat.\n\n 3853.     See Nollet v. Justices of Trial Courts of Com. of\n\n Mass., 83 F. Supp. 2d at 210.         As for the plaintiffs' due\n\n process    claim,   we    disagree   with    the   district   court's\n\n assertion that an action taken by a state judge in his\n\n adjudicatory role does not constitute state action.                  See\n\n\n    1 In view of our disposition, we need not decide whether a\npro se may represent The Fatherhood Coalition/CPF, which alleges\nthat it is \"a voluntary association representing the interests\nof the fathers in domestic relations matters.\" The motion for\nleave to represent this association filed by non-lawyer John M.\nFlaherty is therefore denied as moot.\n\fNollet v. Justices of Trial Courts of Comm. of Mass., 83 F.\n\nSupp.    2d    at   211.     A       judge   acting      in   his    adjudicatory\n\ncapacity is a state actor acting under color of state law,\n\nalthough he may be immune from liability under § 1983.                           See\n\nDennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 28 n.5 (1980).                            We agree,\n\nhowever, with the district court's ultimate conclusion in\n\nthis    case    that   the       §    1983       due   process      claim   is   not\n\nactionable      against    a     state       judge     acting    purely     in   his\n\nadjudicative capacity because he is not a proper party in a\n\n§ 1983 action challenging the constitutionality of a state\n\nstatute.       See In re Justices of Supreme Court of Puerto\n\nRico, 695 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1982).                      Finally, we find that\n\nplaintiffs have waived argument on their Second Amendment\n\nclaim.     See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir.) (reciting that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory\n\nmanner,       unaccompanied           by     some      effort       at   developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S.\n\n1082 (1990).\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f",
