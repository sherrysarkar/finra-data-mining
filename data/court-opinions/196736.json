Su rez-Maya (\"Su rez-Maya\"),  and Ra l Troche-\r\n\nMatos (\"Troche-Matos\") appeal their firearm convictions  under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   924(c)(1).  A previous  panel of this court affirmed the\r\n\nconvictions of Ram rez-Ferrer and Su rez-Maya for using a firearm\r\n\nin  relation  to  a  drug  trafficking offense,  but  reversed  a\r\n\ncorresponding conviction of Troche-Matos.   However, the original\r\n\npanel's opinion was withdrawn  when the government's petition for\r\n\nan  en banc  was granted.    The government  has  decided not  to\r                     \r\n\ncontest   the   original   panel's   reversal   of  Troche-Matos'\r\n\nconviction.  As a result, we reiterate that holding; our focus is\r\n\non the appeals of Ram rez-Ferrer and Su rez-Maya.\r\n\n          Although  the  firearm  convictions  were  also  to  be\r\n\nreconsidered en banc, after  the en banc oral argument  was heard\r                                                  \r\n\nbut  before the  en banc  opinion was  issued, the  Supreme Court\r                                  \r\n\nrendered  its opinion in Bailey  v. United States,      U.S.    ,\r                                                           \r\n\n   ,  116 S.  Ct.  501, 505  (1995),  clarifying the  meaning  of\r\n\nsection  924(c)(1).    In light  of  Bailey,  the  en banc  court\r                                                                    \r\n\nremanded the firearm  convictions for the  panel's consideration.\r\n\nWe  today affirm  the convictions  of Ram rez-Ferrer  and Su rez-\r\n\nMaya.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The evidence,  taken in the light most favorable to the\r\n\ngovernment,  United  States v.  Abreu, 952  F.2d 1458,  1460 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 503  U.S. 994 (1992), permitted the  jury to\r                             \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfind  the  facts  that follow.    Because  the  en banc  decision\r                                                                 \r\n\naffirmed related  drug possession  convictions and  reversed drug\r\n\nimportation  convictions  for  all  three  defendants,  the  sole\r\n\nremaining issue is  the validity of  the firearm convictions  for\r\n\nusing or  carrying a  firearm during  and in  relation to  a drug\r\n\ntrafficking  crime  pursuant  to  section 924(c)(1).    Thus,  we\r\n\nemphasize the facts pertinent to the firearms charge.\r\n\n          On March 13,  1993, the Police of Puerto  Rico (\"POPR\")\r\n\nreceived an  anonymous telephone call.   The caller  informed the\r\n\nPOPR  that  defendant  Su rez-Maya  and three  other  individuals\r\n\nplanned to bring a load of cocaine by boat to the main island  of\r\n\nPuerto  Rico.   Using  a helicopter,  the  United States  Customs\r\n\nService (USCS) and POPR located the subject boat and Su rez-Maya,\r\n\naccompanied  by three  other  men as  described.   The  boat  was\r\n\ninterdicted about  one mile  off the  southwest  coast of  Puerto\r\n\nRico.\r\n\n          After  the boat was seized, it was found to be carrying\r\n\nabout  16 kilograms of cocaine.  A subsequent inventory search of\r\n\nthe  boat turned  up a  firearm.   The seized  firearm, a  loaded\r\n\nrevolver,  was  found covered  by  a  T-shirt, behind  a  storage\r\n\ncompartment  near the  location  where  Ram rez-Ferrer  had  been\r\n\nseated at the time of the interdiction.  The search also revealed\r\n\nevidence linking the vessel to a relative of Su rez-Maya.\r\n\n          On March  31, 1993, a grand jury indicted defendants on\r\n\ncharges of possessing  and carrying  a firearm in  relation to  a\r\n\ndrug trafficking crime  (count 3), 18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1) (1994).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nOn September 28, 1993,  a jury convicted all three  defendants on\r\n\nthis  count.   On count  1, later  upheld by  the en  banc court,\r                                                                    \r\n\nrelating to possession  and importation  of cocaine,  Su rez-Maya\r\n\nwas  sentenced to life imprisonment,  Ram rez-Ferrer to a term of\r\n\n240  months, and  Troche-Matos to  a term  of 120  months.1   The\r\n\nsentences of Su rez-Maya  and Ram rez-Ferrer were  enhanced under\r\n\n21 U.S.C.    841(b) and  960(b) on account of prior  drug crimes.\r\n\nOn count 3, the firearm count,  each appellant was sentenced to a\r\n\nmandatory minimum term  of 60 months to  be served consecutively,\r\n\nas required by the statute.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Count 3 of the  indictment charged that \"the defendants\r\n\nherein, aiding and abetting  each other, did knowingly, willfully\r\n\nand  intentionally possess and carry a .32 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson\r\n\nrevolver during and in  relation to a drug trafficking  crime\" in\r\n\nviolation  of 18  U.S.C.    924(c)(1).    In the  original  panel\r\n\nopinion,  we held that there was insufficient evidence for a jury\r\n\nto infer that defendant Troche-Matos  was guilty of violating the\r\n\nstatute or  aiding and abetting in  its violation.  There  was no\r\n\nevidence  that Troche-Matos actually  or constructively possessed\r\n\nthe  gun;  nor  was  there  evidence that  he  was  aware  of its\r\n\nexistence.  In view  of the circumstances, we held that  the only\r\n\nway a jury could  link Troche-Matos to  the gun would be  through\r\n\nsheer speculation  and conjecture.   As  the  government did  not\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  As noted, supra, the convictions of each appellant on count 2,\r                            \r\nfor importation of  a controlled substance, were reversed  by the\r\nen banc court.\r                 \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nchallenge these holding in its petition for rehearing en banc, we\r                                                                       \r\n\nreiterate that Troche-Matos' conviction on  the gun count must be\r\n\nreversed for lack of sufficient evidence.\r\n\n          As for Su rez-Maya and Ram rez-Ferrer, the scope of our\r\n\npresent review was established by the en banc opinion, which held\r                                                       \r\n\nthat  \"defendants' conviction  for 'use'  should be  vacated, and\r\n\nthey should face only  reconsideration of their convictions under\r\n\nthe carry prong.\"  Ram rez-Ferrer, slip op. at 10 (citing Bailey,\r                                                                          \r\n\n    U.S. at    , 116 S. Ct.  at 508-09).  The en banc panel based\r                                                               \r\n\nits  holding on its understanding of Bailey as having limited the\r                                                     \r\n\nword 'use' to the extent that it cannot apply in the instant case\r\n\nand  having emphasized that \"'carry' has  meanings not covered by\r\n\n'use.'\"  Id., slip op. at 10.\r                      \r\n\n          Although the  defendants continue to style their appeal\r\n\nas  an objection to sufficiency of the evidence, it is clear that\r\n\nthe Supreme Court's  decision in Bailey  requires us to  consider\r                                                 \r\n\nwhether the convictions on the gun count can be sustained despite\r\n\nthe erroneous instruction of  the district court.  When  we wrote\r\n\nthe original panel opinion,  the district court's instruction was\r\n\nan accurate  account of the law  of the circuit; but  in light of\r\n\nBailey,  it  is plainly  incorrect in  regard  to the  meaning of\r                \r\n\n\"use.\"\r\n\n          The  district   court  gave  the  jury   the  following\r\n\ninstruction on the elements of 18 U.S.C.   942(c)(1):\r\n\n            [T]he Government is not required to prove\r\n            that the defendant or defendants actually\r\n            fired the  weapon or brandished it  . . .\r\n            at someone in order to prove use, as that\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n            term  used  [sic] in  these instructions.\r\n            However, you  must be convinced  beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt that the  firearm played\r\n            a  role in or facilitating the commission\r\n            of the drug offense, in  other words, you\r\n            must   find  that  the   firearm  was  an\r\n            integral part of the offense charged.\r\n\n            Now, to prove that a defendant carried  a\r\n            firearm,  the  Government  does not  only\r\n            have  to prove that a defendant carried a\r\n            firearm, the Government  need only  prove\r\n            that  a firearm was accessible during and\r\n            in relation to a drug offense.\r\n\nThe  district  court's instruction,  which  could be  heard  by a\r\n\nreasonable  jury to  endorse  the \"fortress  theory\" rejected  by\r\n\nBailey, was  (in hindsight)  erroneous.  However,  the defendants\r                \r\n\ndid not  object to it;  we therefore review  only under  a \"plain\r\n\nerror\"  standard.  This standard requires not only that the error\r\n\nbe plain -- which in light of Bailey this probably is -- but also\r                                              \r\n\nthat affirmance  would result in a \"miscarriage  of justice,\" one\r\n\nthat would jeopardize  public confidence in the  integrity of the\r\n\njudicial process.

We take our lead from United States v. Manning, No.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n95-1199, slip op. (1st Cir.

The  discussion in  Manning\r                                                                           \r\nproceeds as though  \"move\" were  transitive.  Because  we do  not\r\nbelieve it alters our analysis, we continue with this assumption,\r\nwithout deciding the question.  From the evidence, the jury could\r\nreasonably  infer both that the firearm moved and that defendants\r\nmoved it (by having it aboard a moving boat).\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n34822 at *3,      F.3d at      (concluding that  \"in order for  a\r\n\ndefendant to be  convicted of  'carrying' a gun  in violation  of\r\n\nsection  924(c)(1),  the  defendant  must  have  transported  the\r                                                                      \r\n\nfirearm  on  or about  his  or  her  person\")  (emphasis  added).\r\n\nFurthermore,  we  must  bear  in mind  that  the  government must\r\n\npresent  evidence from  which a  reasonable juror  could conclude\r\n\nthat this transportive function was \"during\" and \"in relation to\"\r\n\nthe  crime of possession with intent to distribute.  See Manning,\r                                                                          \r\n\nslip op. at 7 (quoting   924(c)(1)).\r\n\n          However, unlike the court in Manning, we have no record\r                                                        \r\n\nevidence from  which a  jury could  reasonably infer  that either\r\n\nSu rez-Maya   or   Ram rez-Ferrer   moved   the   firearm   while\r\n\n\"supporting\"   it  \"in   [their]  hands   or  arms.\"     However,\r\n\ntransporting a firearm on a boat would certainly implicate moving\r\n\nit \"an appreciable distance  without dragging\" it or bringing  it\r\n\n\"along to another place.\"  As a result, we are forced move beyond\r\n\nManning  and  map the  contours  of  \"carry\"  in further  detail.\r                 \r\n\nSpecifically, we  must decide whether there  exists some required\r\n\ndegree of  proximity in conjunction with  this drug crime-related\r\n\ntransportation,   which  demands  delving   into  a  line-drawing\r\n\nproblem.  At one extreme, \"carry\" could be defined so narrowly as\r\n\nto  only allow  convictions where  a factfinder  could reasonably\r\n\nconclude  that  the  defendant  moved  while  maintaining  actual\r\n\nphysical contact with a  firearm.  At the other  extreme, \"carry\"\r\n\nmight be so loosely construed that a defendant could be deemed to\r\n\n\"carry\"  the  firearm when  he or  she  merely had  transported a\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nfirearm  without touching  it  or  having  it accessible  --  for\r\n\nexample, in  a car  trunk or  in some  hard-to-reach recess of  a\r\n\nboat.  We must  address this question because while  evidence was\r\n\npresented  from which  the jury  could have  reasonably inferred:\r\n\n(a) that the firearm was transported  (on the boat) during and in\r\n\nrelation  to the drug crime in  question and (b) that the firearm\r\n\nwas within  easy reach  of defendant Ram rez-Ferrer,  no evidence\r\n\nwas  proffered to  justify a  reasonable  inference (c)  that any\r\n\ndefendant  had any degree of physical contact with the weapon, or\r\n\nhad otherwise \"support[ed]\" it, as \"in one's hands or arms.\"\r\n\n          Since   Bailey,  was  decided,   a  few  circuits  have\r                                  \r\n\naddressed  the scope  of the  \"carry\" prong.   In  Hern ndez, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nNinth Circuit confronted a  situation in which a gun was found in\r\n\na  locked toolbox  together  with cocaine  in defendant's  garage\r\n\nafter defendant was arrested during a controlled buy.  Hern ndez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n1996  WL 34822 at *1-2.  The  Ninth Circuit concluded that, for a\r\n\n\"carrying\" conviction  under  section 924(c)(1),  \"the  defendant\r\n\nmust  have  transported the  firearm  on  or about  his  person,\"\r\n\nmeaning that  \"the firearm  must have been  immediately available\r\n\nfor use  by the defendant.\"  Id.  at *3.  As  a result, the Ninth\r                                          \r\n\nCircuit  refused to find that the defendant carried a firearm for\r\n\nthe purposes of section 924(c)(1).\r\n\n          Two  circuits  have  specifically addressed  situations\r\n\ninvolving  the presence  of guns  and drugs  in automobiles.   In\r\n\nUnited  States  v. Riascos-Su rez,  73  F.3d 616,  623  (6th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1996), the  Sixth Circuit found a  defendant's conduct sufficient\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nfor  conviction under the \"carry\" prong where the defendant had a\r\n\ngun on the driver's side  of the dashboard console of a  car that\r\n\nalso contained drugs.   The  court there stated  that it  \"h[e]ld\r\n\nthat  [defendant]  carried the  weapon  for  purposes of  section\r\n\n924(c)(1) because  the firearm  was within reach  and immediately\r\n\navailable for use.\"  Id. at 623.  The Sixth Circuit clarified its\r                                  \r\n\ndefinition of \"carry\" in United States v. Moore, 76 F.3d 111, 113\r                                                         \r\n\n(6th Cir. 1996).  There,  the court remanded a case in  which the\r\n\ndefendant  also  had guns  within easy  reach.   Id.  at 113-114.\r                                                              \r\n\nHowever, the court distinguished the conduct of the defendant  in\r\n\nMoore from  that of the  defendant in Riascos-Su rez  because the\r                                                              \r\n\ndefendant in Moore did not bring the drugs with him in the course\r                            \r\n\nof his drug trade.  Id. at  113.  The court noted that \"immediate\r                                 \r\n\navailability is [] a  necessary, but not sufficient determinant.\"\r\n\nId.\r             \r\n\n          The Eleventh Circuit has also addressed the carry prong\r\n\nin  an  automotive context.   United  States  v. Farris,  1996 WL\r                                                                 \r\n\n82490,  *1-3 (11th Cir. 1996).   In Farris,  the Eleventh Circuit\r                                                    \r\n\nconfronted a situation  where a  firearm was found  in the  glove\r\n\ncompartment of  a co-conspirator's car used  to transport illegal\r\n\ndrugs  to the controlled buy at which defendant was arrested, and\r\n\nwhich  contained drugs.  Id.   Though it  upheld conviction under\r                                      \r\n\nthe \"carrying\"  prong,  the Eleventh  Circuit did  not state  its\r\n\nopinion  as to  the government's  broader argument in  that case,\r\n\nunqualified by any requirement of \"accessibility,\"  that \"section\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n924(c)  applies when a defendant  carries a firearm  in a vehicle\r\n\nthat is being used as a base for drug distribution.\"  Id. at *3.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          Defendants  here do  not  dispute that  the weapon  was\r\n\naboard   a  moving  boat,  and  the  en  banc  court  has  upheld\r                                                       \r\n\ndefendants' possession convictions.   Thus, they do not challenge\r\n\nthe  proposition  that  they  physically  caused  the  weapon  in\r                                                  \r\n\nquestion  to  be transported  and  that  this transportation  was\r\n\nduring -- in the sense of  contemporaneous with -- their crime of\r\n\npossession with intent to distribute illegal drugs.  The evidence\r\n\nhere,  including  diagrams  of  the  boat  with  the  position of\r\n\ndefendants and the weapon clearly indicated, was sufficient for a\r\n\nreasonable  jury to  infer that  the loaded  gun was  within easy\r\n\nreach of  defendant Ram rez-Ferrer.   Given the  above persuasive\r\n\nauthority emphasizing accessibility and  transport and given  the\r                                                 \r\n\nfacts of  the instant case, we hold that Ram rez-Ferrer's conduct\r\n\nsuffices for conviction under an ordinary  and natural meaning of\r\n\nthe word \"carry.\"  We express no opinion, however,  on the theory\r\n\nthat a  conviction for \"carrying\" may be upheld whenever a gun is\r\n\nmerely present  on a  boat or  other vehicle  employed in  a drug\r\n\npossession crime, regardless of accessibility.   Ram rez-Ferrer's\r\n\nproximity  also suffices  for  a jury  reasonably  to infer  that\r\n\nSu rez-Maya, as captain  of the boat and the defendant apparently\r\n\nresponsible for the particular boat  (it allegedly belonged to  a\r\n\nrelation  of  his), aided  and abetted  Ram rez-Ferrer's conduct.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., United States  v. Price, 1996  WL 67398,  *4 (3d Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1996) (upholding conviction of  defendant for aiding and abetting\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nco-defendant's  924(c)(1)  violation,   since  jury  could   have\r\n\nconcluded,  from   ample  evidence, that  defendant  knew of  and\r\n\nbenefitted from co-defendant's  gun-related conduct).   Thus,  we\r\n\nuphold  both  defendants' convictions  under  section 924(c)(1)'s\r\n\n\"carry\" prong.\r\n\n          Ram rez-Ferrer  and Su rez-Maya also argue that even if\r\n\nthey \"carried\" the gun \"during\" their drug crime, they did not do\r\n\nso \"in relation\" to  their drug crime.  Specifically,  they argue\r\n\nthat they  did not know the  gun was there, pointing  out that it\r\n\nwas rusty and  that the boat  did not belong  to either of  them.\r\n\nBut the  defendants do not allege that there was any error in the\r\n\njury instructions in this regard.  Therefore, the short answer to\r\n\nthis  objection  is  that we  affirm  a  jury's  conviction if  a\r\n\nrational  trier of fact  could have  found the  defendants guilty\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  See  Farris at *3.  The evidence need\r                                                 \r\n\nnot exclude every  hypothesis of innocence.  Id.   The jury could\r                                                          \r\n\nreasonably have  attributed knowledge and intent  to benefit from\r\n\nthe  gun  to  both  Ram rez-Ferrer and  Su rez-Maya,  the  boat's\r\n\ncaptain and the self-admitted principal with respect to the  drug\r\n\npossession offense.   Thus, the evidence is  sufficient to uphold\r\n\nboth defendants' convictions under section 924(c)(1).\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          As a  result  of the  foregoing,  the judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is reversed in part and affirmed in part.\r                            reversed in part     affirmed in part\r                                                                 \r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n",

Suarez-Maya (\"Suarez-Maya\"), and Raul Troche-Matos (\"Troche-Matos\") appeal their firearm convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).   A previous panel of this court affirmed the convictions of Ramirez-Ferrer and Suarez-Maya for using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense, but reversed a corresponding conviction of Troche-Matos.   However, the original panel's opinion was withdrawn when the government's petition for an en banc was granted.   The government has decided not to contest the original panel's reversal of Troche-Matos' conviction.   As a result, we reiterate that holding;  our focus is on the appeals of Ramirez-Ferrer and Suarez-Maya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the firearm convictions were also to be reconsidered en banc, after the en banc oral argument was heard but before the en banc opinion was issued, the Supreme Court rendered its opinion in Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 501, 505, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), clarifying the meaning of section 924(c)(1).   In light of Bailey, the en banc court remanded the firearm convictions for the panel's consideration.   We today affirm the convictions of Ramirez-Ferrer and Suarez-Maya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government, United States v. Abreu, 952 F.2d 1458, 1460 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 994, 112 S.Ct. 1695, 118 L.Ed.2d 406 (1992), permitted the jury to find the facts that follow.   Because the en banc decision affirmed related drug possession convictions and reversed drug importation convictions for all three defendants, the sole remaining issue is the validity of the firearm convictions for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime pursuant to section 924(c)(1).   Thus, we emphasize the facts pertinent to the firearms charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 13, 1993, the Police of Puerto Rico (\"POPR\") received an anonymous telephone call.   The caller informed the POPR that defendant Suarez-Maya and three other individuals planned to bring a load of cocaine by boat to the main island of Puerto Rico.   Using a helicopter, the United States Customs Service (USCS) and POPR located the subject boat and Suarez-Maya, accompanied by three other men as described.   The boat was interdicted about one mile off the southwest coast of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the boat was seized, it was found to be carrying about 16 kilograms of cocaine.   A subsequent inventory search of the boat turned up a firearm.   The seized firearm, a loaded revolver, was found covered by a T-shirt, behind a storage compartment near the location where Ramirez-Ferrer had been seated at the time of the interdiction.   The search also revealed evidence linking the vessel to a relative of Suarez-Maya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 1993, a grand jury indicted defendants on charges of possessing and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime (count 3), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) (1994).   On September 28, 1993, a jury convicted all three defendants on this count.   On count 1, later upheld by the en banc court, relating to possession and importation of cocaine, Suarez-Maya was sentenced to life imprisonment, Ramirez-Ferrer to a term of 240 months, and Troche-Matos to a term of 120 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The sentences of Suarez-Maya and Ramirez-Ferrer were enhanced under 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b) and 960(b) on account of prior drug crimes.   On count 3, the firearm count, each appellant was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 60 months to be served consecutively, as required by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 3 of the indictment charged that \"the defendants herein, aiding and abetting each other, did knowingly, willfully and intentionally possess and carry a .32 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).   In the original panel opinion, we held that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to infer that defendant Troche-Matos was guilty of violating the statute or aiding and abetting in its violation.   There was no evidence that Troche-Matos actually or constructively possessed the gun;  nor was there evidence that he was aware of its existence.   In view of the circumstances, we held that the only way a jury could link Troche-Matos to the gun would be through sheer speculation and conjecture.   As the government did not challenge these holding in its petition for rehearing en banc, we reiterate that Troche-Matos' conviction on the gun count must be reversed for lack of sufficient evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Suarez-Maya and Ramirez-Ferrer, the scope of our present review was established by the en banc opinion, which held that \"defendants' conviction for 'use' should be vacated, and they should face only reconsideration of their convictions under the carry prong.\"  Ramirez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d at 1135 (citing Bailey, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 508-09).   The en banc panel based its holding on its understanding of Bailey as having limited the word \"use\" to the extent that it cannot apply in the instant case and having emphasized that \" 'carry' has meanings not covered by 'use.' \"  Id., 82 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defendants continue to style their appeal as an objection to sufficiency of the evidence, it is clear that the Supreme Court's decision in Bailey requires us to consider whether the convictions on the gun count can be sustained despite the erroneous instruction of the district court.   When we wrote the original panel opinion, the district court's instruction was an accurate account of the law of the circuit;  but in light of Bailey, it is plainly incorrect in regard to the meaning of \"use.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court gave the jury the following instruction on the elements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[T]he Government is not required to prove that the defendant or defendants actually fired the weapon or brandished it ... at someone in order to prove use, as that term used [sic] in these instructions.   However, you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm played a role in or facilitating the commission of the drug offense, in other words, you must find that the firearm was an integral part of the offense charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Now, to prove that a defendant carried a firearm, the Government does not only have to prove that a defendant carried a firearm, the Government need only prove that a firearm was accessible during and in relation to a drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instruction, which could be heard by a reasonable jury to endorse the \"fortress theory\" rejected by Bailey, was (in hindsight) erroneous.   However, the defendants did not object to it;  we therefore review only under a \"plain error\" standard.   This standard requires not only that the error be plain--which in light of Bailey this probably is--but also that affirmance would result in a \"miscarriage of justice,\" one that would jeopardize public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);  United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 632 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the standard would require reversal of Suarez-Maya's and Ramirez-Ferrer's convictions only if we have substantial doubt about the certainty of the defendants' guilt.   In making this determination, we consider both the evidence presented by the government and what we can infer from the verdict that the jury did in fact decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by defining \"carry\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).   We take our lead from United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212 (1st Cir.1996), in which we affirmed a district court's denial of a motion for acquittal on 924(c)(1) charges based on Bailey 's treatment of \"use,\" because even though \"use\" no longer could cover defendant's actions, those actions met \"any reasonable construction\" of \"carry.\"  Id., 79 F.3d at 216.   In Manning, detectives ordered a defendant to stop while defendant was holding a briefcase, which later was found to contain illegal drugs and a loaded handgun.  Id., at 216.   We note in passing that either defendant may be convicted as \"aiding and abetting\" if one defendant is found to have carried a firearm in violation of section 924(c)(1), and if the evidence is sufficient for a jury to infer that the other defendant aided and abetted this conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in Manning, which was decided after the en banc oral argument was heard and after Bailey, but before the en banc opinion was issued, \"[b]y narrowing the interpretation of 'use' to instances of active employment, the Bailey court recognized that the 'carry' prong would take on a new significance.\"  Id., 79 F.3d at 216.   Although in Manning, the court found that it did not have to delineate the \"precise contours\" of the \"carry\" prong, id., at 216, it noted that \"the word 'carry' is variously defined as 'to move while supporting (as ... in one's hands or arms),' 'to move an appreciable distance without dragging,' and 'to bring along to another place,' \" id., at 216 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 343 (1986)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This focus on dictionary meanings follows naturally from Bailey 's reliance on the \"ordinary and natural\" meanings in construing the term \"use\" in section 924(c)(1).   See Bailey, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 506 (discussing definitions taken from Webster's New International Dictionary of English Language and Black's Law Dictionary ).   In Manning, the court concluded that the defendant's \"alleged actions readily me[t] all of the[ ] definitions\" of \"carry\" taken from Webster's.  Manning, 79 F.3d at 216;  see also United States v. Hernandez, 80 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting Webster's and Black's ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Manning limits the construction of \"carry\" to situations in which the \"firearm\" has been \"moved\" or \"brought along to another place,\" since all three parts of the definition adopted there contain this element of transportation.  See also United States v. Murrietta-Nunez, 1996 WL 65240, * 5 (9th Cir.1996) (rejecting the possibility of a \"carry\" prong-based conviction where a firearm was found under a bed near a bundle of marijuana, noting that \"storing the gun for possible, later use\" does not constitute \"carrying\" under Bailey );  Hernandez, 80 F.3d at 1257 (concluding that \"in order for a defendant to be convicted of 'carrying' a gun in violation of section 924(c)(1), the defendant must have transported the firearm on or about his or her person\") (emphasis added).   Furthermore, we must bear in mind that the government must present evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that this transportive function was \"during\" and \"in relation to\" the crime of possession with intent to distribute.   See Manning, 79 F.3d at 216 (quoting &#167; 924(c)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, unlike the court in Manning, we have no record evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that either Suarez-Maya or Ramirez-Ferrer moved the firearm while \"supporting\" it \"in [their] hands or arms.\"   However, transporting a firearm on a boat would certainly implicate moving it \"an appreciable distance without dragging\" it or bringing it \"along to another place.\"   As a result, we are forced move beyond Manning and map the contours of \"carry\" in further detail.   Specifically, we must decide whether there exists some required degree of proximity in conjunction with this drug crime-related transportation, which demands delving into a line-drawing problem.   At one extreme, \"carry\" could be defined so narrowly as to only allow convictions where a factfinder could reasonably conclude that the defendant moved while maintaining actual physical contact with a firearm.   At the other extreme, \"carry\" might be so loosely construed that a defendant could be deemed to \"carry\" the firearm when he or she merely had transported a firearm without touching it or having it accessible--for example, in a car trunk or in some hard-to-reach recess of a boat.   We must address this question because while evidence was presented from which the jury could have reasonably inferred:  (a) that the firearm was transported (on the boat) during and in relation to the drug crime in question and (b) that the firearm was within easy reach of defendant Ramirez-Ferrer, no evidence was proffered to justify a reasonable inference (c) that any defendant had any degree of physical contact with the weapon, or had otherwise \"support[ed]\" it, as \"in one's hands or arms.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Bailey, was decided, a few circuits have addressed the scope of the \"carry\" prong.   In Hernandez, the Ninth Circuit confronted a situation in which a gun was found in a locked toolbox together with cocaine in defendant's garage after defendant was arrested during a controlled buy.  Hernandez, 80 F.3d at 1256-57.   The Ninth Circuit concluded that, for a \"carrying\" conviction under section 924(c)(1), \"the defendant must have transported the firearm on or about his person,\" meaning that \"the firearm must have been immediately available for use by the defendant.\"  Id. at 1258.   As a result, the Ninth Circuit refused to find that the defendant carried a firearm for the purposes of section 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuits have specifically addressed situations involving the presence of guns and drugs in automobiles.   In United States v. Riascos-Suarez, 73 F.3d 616, 623 (6th Cir.1996), the Sixth Circuit found a defendant's conduct sufficient for conviction under the \"carry\" prong where the defendant had a gun on the driver's side of the dashboard console of a car that also contained drugs.   The court there stated that it \"h[e]ld that [defendant] carried the weapon for purposes of section 924(c)(1) because the firearm was within reach and immediately available for use.\"  Id. at 623.   The Sixth Circuit clarified its definition of \"carry\" in United States v. Moore, 76 F.3d 111, 113 (6th Cir.1996).   There, the court remanded a case in which the defendant also had guns within easy reach.  Id. at 113-114.   However, the court distinguished the conduct of the defendant in Moore from that of the defendant in Riascos-Suarez because the defendant in Moore did not bring the drugs with him in the course of his drug trade.  Id. at 113.   The court noted that \"immediate availability is [ ] a necessary, but not sufficient determinant.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit has also addressed the carry prong in an automotive context.  United States v. Farris, 77 F.3d 391, 393-96 (11th Cir.1996).   In Farris, the Eleventh Circuit confronted a situation where a firearm was found in the glove compartment of a co-conspirator's car used to transport illegal drugs to the controlled buy at which defendant was arrested, and which contained drugs.  Id.  Though it upheld conviction under the \"carrying\" prong, the Eleventh Circuit did not state its opinion as to the government's broader argument in that case, unqualified by any requirement of \"accessibility,\" that \"section 924(c) applies when a defendant carries a firearm in a vehicle that is being used as a base for drug distribution.\"  Id. at 395.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants here do not dispute that the weapon was aboard a moving boat, and the en banc court has upheld defendants' possession convictions.   Thus, they do not challenge the proposition that they physically caused the weapon in question to be transported and that this transportation was during--in the sense of contemporaneous with--their crime of possession with intent to distribute illegal drugs.   The evidence here, including diagrams of the boat with the position of defendants and the weapon clearly indicated, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer that the loaded gun was within easy reach of defendant Ramirez-Ferrer.   Given the above persuasive authority emphasizing accessibility and transport and given the facts of the instant case, we hold that Ramirez-Ferrer's conduct suffices for conviction under an ordinary and natural meaning of the word \"carry.\"   We express no opinion, however, on the theory that a conviction for \"carrying\" may be upheld whenever a gun is merely present on a boat or other vehicle employed in a drug possession crime, regardless of accessibility.   Ramirez-Ferrer's proximity also suffices for a jury reasonably to infer that Suarez-Maya, as captain of the boat and the defendant apparently responsible for the particular boat (it allegedly belonged to a relation of his), aided and abetted Ramirez-Ferrer's conduct.   See, e.g., United States v. Price, 76 F.3d 526, 529-30 (3d Cir.1996) (upholding conviction of defendant for aiding and abetting co-defendant's 924(c)(1) violation, since jury could have concluded, from ample evidence, that defendant knew of and benefitted from co-defendant's gun-related conduct).   Thus, we uphold both defendants' convictions under section 924(c)(1)'s \"carry\" prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez-Ferrer and Suarez-Maya also argue that even if they \"carried\" the gun \"during\" their drug crime, they did not do so \"in relation\" to their drug crime.   Specifically, they argue that they did not know the gun was there, pointing out that it was rusty and that the boat did not belong to either of them.   But the defendants do not allege that there was any error in the jury instructions in this regard.   Therefore, the short answer to this objection is that we affirm a jury's conviction if a rational trier of fact could have found the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   See Farris, 77 F.3d at 395-96.   The evidence need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence.  Id.  The jury could reasonably have attributed knowledge and intent to benefit from the gun to both Ramirez-Ferrer and Suarez-Maya, the boat's captain and the self-admitted principal with respect to the drug possession offense.   Thus, the evidence is sufficient to uphold both defendants' convictions under section 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As noted, supra, the convictions of each appellant on count 2, for importation of a controlled substance, were reversed by the en banc court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> With the first two of the three parts of the definition of \"carry\" relied on by the court in Manning, there is a seeming ambiguity as to whether the subject of \"to move\" is the actor or the firearm--that is, whether \"move\" is used here as a transitive or intransitive verb.   The discussion in Manning proceeds as though \"move\" were transitive.   Because we do not believe it alters our analysis, we continue with this assumption, without deciding the question.   From the evidence, the jury could reasonably infer both that the firearm moved and that defendants moved it (by having it aboard a moving boat)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Because the en banc decision affirmed related drug possession convictions and reversed drug importation convictions for all three defendants, the sole remaining issue is the validity of the firearm convictions for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime pursuant to section 924(c)(1).   Thus, we emphasize the facts pertinent to the firearms charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 13, 1993, the Police of Puerto Rico (\"POPR\") received an anonymous telephone call.   The caller informed the POPR that defendant Suarez-Maya and three other individuals planned to bring a load of cocaine by boat to the main island of Puerto Rico.   Using a helicopter, the United States Customs Service (USCS) and POPR located the subject boat and Suarez-Maya, accompanied by three other men as described.   The boat was interdicted about one mile off the southwest coast of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the boat was seized, it was found to be carrying about 16 kilograms of cocaine.   A subsequent inventory search of the boat turned up a firearm.   The seized firearm, a loaded revolver, was found covered by a T-shirt, behind a storage compartment near the location where Ramirez-Ferrer had been seated at the time of the interdiction.   The search also revealed evidence linking the vessel to a relative of Suarez-Maya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 1993, a grand jury indicted defendants on charges of possessing and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime (count 3), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) (1994).   On September 28, 1993, a jury convicted all three defendants on this count.   On count 1, later upheld by the en banc court, relating to possession and importation of cocaine, Suarez-Maya was sentenced to life imprisonment, Ramirez-Ferrer to a term of 240 months, and Troche-Matos to a term of 120 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The sentences of Suarez-Maya and Ramirez-Ferrer were enhanced under 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b) and 960(b) on account of prior drug crimes.   On count 3, the firearm count, each appellant was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 60 months to be served consecutively, as required by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 3 of the indictment charged that \"the defendants herein, aiding and abetting each other, did knowingly, willfully and intentionally possess and carry a .32 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).   In the original panel opinion, we held that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to infer that defendant Troche-Matos was guilty of violating the statute or aiding and abetting in its violation.   There was no evidence that Troche-Matos actually or constructively possessed the gun;  nor was there evidence that he was aware of its existence.   In view of the circumstances, we held that the only way a jury could link Troche-Matos to the gun would be through sheer speculation and conjecture.   As the government did not challenge these holding in its petition for rehearing en banc, we reiterate that Troche-Matos' conviction on the gun count must be reversed for lack of sufficient evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Suarez-Maya and Ramirez-Ferrer, the scope of our present review was established by the en banc opinion, which held that \"defendants' conviction for 'use' should be vacated, and they should face only reconsideration of their convictions under the carry prong.\"  Ramirez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d at 1135 (citing Bailey, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 508-09).   The en banc panel based its holding on its understanding of Bailey as having limited the word \"use\" to the extent that it cannot apply in the instant case and having emphasized that \" 'carry' has meanings not covered by 'use.' \"  Id., 82 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defendants continue to style their appeal as an objection to sufficiency of the evidence, it is clear that the Supreme Court's decision in Bailey requires us to consider whether the convictions on the gun count can be sustained despite the erroneous instruction of the district court.   When we wrote the original panel opinion, the district court's instruction was an accurate account of the law of the circuit;  but in light of Bailey, it is plainly incorrect in regard to the meaning of \"use.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court gave the jury the following instruction on the elements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[T]he Government is not required to prove that the defendant or defendants actually fired the weapon or brandished it ... at someone in order to prove use, as that term used [sic] in these instructions.   However, you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm played a role in or facilitating the commission of the drug offense, in other words, you must find that the firearm was an integral part of the offense charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Now, to prove that a defendant carried a firearm, the Government does not only have to prove that a defendant carried a firearm, the Government need only prove that a firearm was accessible during and in relation to a drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instruction, which could be heard by a reasonable jury to endorse the \"fortress theory\" rejected by Bailey, was (in hindsight) erroneous.   However, the defendants did not object to it;  we therefore review only under a \"plain error\" standard.   This standard requires not only that the error be plain--which in light of Bailey this probably is--but also that affirmance would result in a \"miscarriage of justice,\" one that would jeopardize public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process.

In making this determination, we consider both the evidence presented by the government and what we can infer from the verdict that the jury did in fact decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by defining \"carry\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).   We take our lead from United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196640\"><a href=\"/opinion/196640/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), in which we affirmed a district court's denial of a motion for acquittal on 924(c)(1) charges based on Bailey 's treatment of \"use,\" because even though \"use\" no longer could cover defendant's actions, those actions met \"any reasonable construction\" of \"carry.\"  Id., 79 F.3d at 216.   In Manning, detectives ordered a defendant to stop while defendant was holding a briefcase, which later was found to contain illegal drugs and a loaded handgun.  Id., at 216.   We note in passing that either defendant may be convicted as \"aiding and abetting\" if one defendant is found to have carried a firearm in violation of section 924(c)(1), and if the evidence is sufficient for a jury to infer that the other defendant aided and abetted this conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in Manning, which was decided after the en banc oral argument was heard and after Bailey, but before the en banc opinion was issued, \"[b]y narrowing the interpretation of 'use' to instances of active employment, the Bailey court recognized that the 'carry' prong would take on a new significance.\"  Id., 79 F.3d at 216.   Although in Manning, the court found that it did not have to delineate the \"precise contours\" of the \"carry\" prong, id., at 216, it noted that \"the word 'carry' is variously defined as 'to move while supporting (as ... in one's hands or arms),' 'to move an appreciable distance without dragging,' and 'to bring along to another place,' \" id., at 216 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 343 (1986)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This focus on dictionary meanings follows naturally from Bailey 's reliance on the \"ordinary and natural\" meanings in construing the term \"use\" in section 924(c)(1).   See Bailey, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 506 (discussing definitions taken from Webster's New International Dictionary of English Language and Black's Law Dictionary ).   In Manning, the court concluded that the defendant's \"alleged actions readily me[t] all of the[ ] definitions\" of \"carry\" taken from Webster's.  Manning, 79 F.3d at 216;  see also United States v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715823\"><a href=\"/opinion/715823/96-cal-daily-op-serv-677-96-daily-journal-dar-1013-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1253</span></a></span>, 1257-58 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting Webster's and Black's ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Manning limits the construction of \"carry\" to situations in which the \"firearm\" has been \"moved\" or \"brought along to another place,\" since all three parts of the definition adopted there contain this element of transportation.  See also United States v. Murrietta-Nunez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">65240</span></span>, * 5 (9th Cir.1996) (rejecting the possibility of a \"carry\" prong-based conviction where a firearm was found under a bed near a bundle of marijuana, noting that \"storing the gun for possible, later use\" does not constitute \"carrying\" under Bailey );  Hernandez, 80 F.3d at 1257 (concluding that \"in order for a defendant to be convicted of 'carrying' a gun in violation of section 924(c)(1), the defendant must have transported the firearm on or about his or her person\") (emphasis added).   Furthermore, we must bear in mind that the government must present evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that this transportive function was \"during\" and \"in relation to\" the crime of possession with intent to distribute.   See Manning, 79 F.3d at 216 (quoting &#167; 924(c)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, unlike the court in Manning, we have no record evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that either Suarez-Maya or Ramirez-Ferrer moved the firearm while \"supporting\" it \"in [their] hands or arms.\"   However, transporting a firearm on a boat would certainly implicate moving it \"an appreciable distance without dragging\" it or bringing it \"along to another place.\"   As a result, we are forced move beyond Manning and map the contours of \"carry\" in further detail.   Specifically, we must decide whether there exists some required degree of proximity in conjunction with this drug crime-related transportation, which demands delving into a line-drawing problem.   At one extreme, \"carry\" could be defined so narrowly as to only allow convictions where a factfinder could reasonably conclude that the defendant moved while maintaining actual physical contact with a firearm.   At the other extreme, \"carry\" might be so loosely construed that a defendant could be deemed to \"carry\" the firearm when he or she merely had transported a firearm without touching it or having it accessible--for example, in a car trunk or in some hard-to-reach recess of a boat.   We must address this question because while evidence was presented from which the jury could have reasonably inferred:  (a) that the firearm was transported (on the boat) during and in relation to the drug crime in question and (b) that the firearm was within easy reach of defendant Ramirez-Ferrer, no evidence was proffered to justify a reasonable inference (c) that any defendant had any degree of physical contact with the weapon, or had otherwise \"support[ed]\" it, as \"in one's hands or arms.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Bailey, was decided, a few circuits have addressed the scope of the \"carry\" prong.   In Hernandez, the Ninth Circuit confronted a situation in which a gun was found in a locked toolbox together with cocaine in defendant's garage after defendant was arrested during a controlled buy.  Hernandez, 80 F.3d at 1256-57.   The Ninth Circuit concluded that, for a \"carrying\" conviction under section 924(c)(1), \"the defendant must have transported the firearm on or about his person,\" meaning that \"the firearm must have been immediately available for use by the defendant.\"  Id. at 1258.   As a result, the Ninth Circuit refused to find that the defendant carried a firearm for the purposes of section 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuits have specifically addressed situations involving the presence of guns and drugs in automobiles.   In United States v. Riascos-Suarez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></span>, 623 (6th Cir.1996), the Sixth Circuit found a defendant's conduct sufficient for conviction under the \"carry\" prong where the defendant had a gun on the driver's side of the dashboard console of a car that also contained drugs.   The court there stated that it \"h[e]ld that [defendant] carried the weapon for purposes of section 924(c)(1) because the firearm was within reach and immediately available for use.\"  Id. at 623.   The Sixth Circuit clarified its definition of \"carry\" in United States v. Moore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712263\"><a href=\"/opinion/712263/united-states-v-kenneth-r-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 113 (6th Cir.1996).   There, the court remanded a case in which the defendant also had guns within easy reach.  Id. at 113-114.   However, the court distinguished the conduct of the defendant in Moore from that of the defendant in Riascos-Suarez because the defendant in Moore did not bring the drugs with him in the course of his drug trade.  Id. at 113.   The court noted that \"immediate availability is [ ] a necessary, but not sufficient determinant.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit has also addressed the carry prong in an automotive context.  United States v. Farris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713108\"><a href=\"/opinion/713108/united-states-v-jb-farris-united-states-of-america-v-jeffrey-bernard/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 393-96 (11th Cir.1996).   In Farris, the Eleventh Circuit confronted a situation where a firearm was found in the glove compartment of a co-conspirator's car used to transport illegal drugs to the controlled buy at which defendant was arrested, and which contained drugs.  Id.  Though it upheld conviction under the \"carrying\" prong, the Eleventh Circuit did not state its opinion as to the government's broader argument in that case, unqualified by any requirement of \"accessibility,\" that \"section 924(c) applies when a defendant carries a firearm in a vehicle that is being used as a base for drug distribution.\"  Id. at 395.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants here do not dispute that the weapon was aboard a moving boat, and the en banc court has upheld defendants' possession convictions.   Thus, they do not challenge the proposition that they physically caused the weapon in question to be transported and that this transportation was during--in the sense of contemporaneous with--their crime of possession with intent to distribute illegal drugs.   The evidence here, including diagrams of the boat with the position of defendants and the weapon clearly indicated, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer that the loaded gun was within easy reach of defendant Ramirez-Ferrer.   Given the above persuasive authority emphasizing accessibility and transport and given the facts of the instant case, we hold that Ramirez-Ferrer's conduct suffices for conviction under an ordinary and natural meaning of the word \"carry.\"   We express no opinion, however, on the theory that a conviction for \"carrying\" may be upheld whenever a gun is merely present on a boat or other vehicle employed in a drug possession crime, regardless of accessibility.   Ramirez-Ferrer's proximity also suffices for a jury reasonably to infer that Suarez-Maya, as captain of the boat and the defendant apparently responsible for the particular boat (it allegedly belonged to a relation of his), aided and abetted Ramirez-Ferrer's conduct.   See, e.g., United States v. Price, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712916\"><a href=\"/opinion/712916/united-states-v-thomas-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 529-30 (3d Cir.1996) (upholding conviction of defendant for aiding and abetting co-defendant's 924(c)(1) violation, since jury could have concluded, from ample evidence, that defendant knew of and benefitted from co-defendant's gun-related conduct).   Thus, we uphold both defendants' convictions under section 924(c)(1)'s \"carry\" prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramirez-Ferrer and Suarez-Maya also argue that even if they \"carried\" the gun \"during\" their drug crime, they did not do so \"in relation\" to their drug crime.   Specifically, they argue that they did not know the gun was there, pointing out that it was rusty and that the boat did not belong to either of them.   But the defendants do not allege that there was any error in the jury instructions in this regard.   Therefore, the short answer to this objection is that we affirm a jury's conviction if a rational trier of fact could have found the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   See Farris, 77 F.3d at 395-96.   The evidence need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence.  Id.  The jury could reasonably have attributed knowledge and intent to benefit from the gun to both Ramirez-Ferrer and Suarez-Maya, the boat's captain and the self-admitted principal with respect to the drug possession offense.   Thus, the evidence is sufficient to uphold both defendants' convictions under section 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As noted, supra, the convictions of each appellant on count 2, for importation of a controlled substance, were reversed by the en banc court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> With the first two of the three parts of the definition of \"carry\" relied on by the court in Manning, there is a seeming ambiguity as to whether the subject of \"to move\" is the actor or the firearm--that is, whether \"move\" is used here as a transitive or intransitive verb.   The discussion in Manning proceeds as though \"move\" were transitive.   Because we do not believe it alters our analysis, we continue with this assumption, without deciding the question.   From the evidence, the jury could reasonably infer both that the firearm moved and that defendants moved it (by having it aboard a moving boat)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
