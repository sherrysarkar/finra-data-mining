This case concerns an attempt by\r                                      \r\n\nthe  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology to  assert  the\r\n\nattorney-client  privilege   and  work-product   doctrine  in\r\n\nresponse  to a  document  request  by  the  Internal  Revenue\r\n\nService.  The most important issue presented is whether MIT's\r\n\ndisclosure  of certain of the documents to another government\r\n\nagency caused it to lose the privilege.  The background facts\r\n\nare essentially undisputed.\r\n\n     MIT  is a famous university with tax-exempt status under\r\n\n26  U.S.C.    501(c)(3).    In  1993,  the IRS  conducted  an\r\n\nexamination of MIT's  records to determine whether  MIT still\r\n\nqualified for  exempt status and to determine  whether it was\r\n\ncomplying with  provisions relating  to employment taxes  and\r\n\nthe reporting of  unrelated business income.  In  aid of this\r\n\nexamination, the IRS requested from MIT copies of the billing\r\n\nstatements of law firms that had represented  MIT and minutes\r\n\nof  the  MIT  Corporation  and  its  executive  and  auditing\r\n\ncommittees.\r\n\n     In  response, MIT  supplied the documents  requested but\r\n\nredacted information claimed  to be covered by  the attorney-\r\n\nclient privilege or  the work-product doctrine  or both.   In\r\n\nmid-1994 the IRS  requested that the redacted  information be\r\n\nsupplied, and MIT declined.  At this point the IRS sought  to\r\n\nobtain the same documents in unredacted form from the Defense\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nContract  Audit Agency (\"the audit agency\"), the auditing arm\r\n\nof the Department of Defense.\r\n\n     It appears that the same billing statements and possibly\r\n\nsome or all of the minutes sought by the IRS had earlier been\r\n\nprovided  to the audit  agency pursuant to  contracts between\r\n\nMIT and components  of the Department of Defense.   The audit\r\n\nagency helps  entities in  the Department  of Defense  review\r\n\ncontract performance  to be sure  that the government  is not\r\n\novercharged for services.  Not surprisingly, the audit agency\r\n\noften reviews the private contractor's books and records.  \r\n\n     In November 1994, the audit  agency advised the IRS that\r\n\nit would not turn  over the documents  provided to it by  MIT\r\n\nwithout the  latter's consent,  which MIT  declines to  give.\r\n\nThe audit  agency had made  no unconditional promise  to keep\r\n\nthe  documents  secret,  but its  regulations  and  practices\r\n\noffered  MIT  some   reason  to  think  that   indiscriminate\r\n\ndisclosure   was  unlikely.     The   IRS   then  served   an\r\n\nadministrative  summons  on  MIT  in  December  1994  seeking\r\n\nspecific  unredacted  minutes  of nine  meetings  of  the MIT\r\n\nCorporation and auditing and executive committees in 1990 and\r\n\n1991,  and attorneys' billing statements for almost all legal\r\n\nexpenses paid or  incurred by MIT from July  1, 1990, through\r\n\nJune 30, 1991.  26 U.S.C.    7402(b), 7604(a).\r\n\n     When  MIT  declined to  comply,  the IRS  in  early 1996\r\n\npetitioned  the district court  to enforce the  summons.  The\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\ndistrict   court  obtained   briefs,   heard  arguments   and\r\n\nconsidered the matter  without an evidentiary hearing  on the\r\n\nbasis of  the declaration filed  by the IRS and  an affidavit\r\n\nsubmitted by MIT.  In January 1997, the district court issued\r\n\na memorandum  and  order  enforcing  the  IRS  administrative\r\n\nsummons  as to the unredacted  legal bills and the unredacted\r\n\nversions of most of the minutes sought by the IRS.\r\n\n     The district court held that the disclosure of the legal\r\n\nbills  to  the  audit  agency forfeited  the  attorney-client\r\n\nprivilege.  As  to the minutes, the district  court said that\r\n\nthe privilege  remained available because  the government had\r\n\nnot proved that  the minutes had been disclosed  to the audit\r\n\nagency.   After reviewing  the minutes  in camera,  the court\r                                                             \r\n\nfound that  three contained  privileged material  and ordered\r\n\nMIT to  turn over the  others as unprivileged or  because MIT\r\n\nhad  lost the privilege  by disclosing  the substance  of the\r\n\nminutes in its now unprivileged legal bills. \r\n\n     The  district   court  followed  a   different  path  in\r\n\nresolving  MIT's work product objection.  The court held that\r\n\nneither the  legal bills  nor the  minutes were  \"prepared in\r\n\nanticipation of  litigation or for  trial.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n26(b)(3).  It ruled that  they were therefore discoverable as\r\n\nordinary  business records.   Accordingly, the court  did not\r\n\ndiscuss  whether  work  product  protection  was   waived  by\r\n\ndisclosure to the audit agency.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     MIT  now appeals, arguing that disclosure of the billing\r\n\nstatements  to  the  audit  agency  should  not  forfeit  the\r\n\nprivilege; MIT no  longer claims work product  protection for\r\n\nthe billing  statements.  The  government has  cross-appealed\r\n\nfrom the district court's refusal to order production  of the\r\n\nthree remaining minutes;  it says that the burden  was on MIT\r\n\nto prove that the minutes had not been disclosed to the audit\r\n\nagency.  MIT responds that  the privilege was not waived even\r\n\nif the minutes  were disclosed to the audit  agency, and that\r\n\nthe minutes remain protected by the work product doctrine.\r\n\n     On  an appeal respecting a privilege claim, the standard\r\n\nof  review depends  on the  issue.   Rulings by  the district\r\n\ncourt on  issues of law  are reviewed de novo;  fact findings\r                                                         \r\n\nare  tested under a  clear error standard;  and discretionary\r\n\njudgments  such as evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse\r\n\nof discretion.   See United  States v. Wilson, 798  F.2d 509,\r                                                         \r\n\n512  (1st Cir.  1986).   On the  principal issue  before us--\r\n\nforfeiture  by disclosure--this  case goes  about  as far  as\r\n\npossible in  posing an  abstract issue of  law and  review is\r\n\nplenary.\r\n\n     The  question  whether   MIT  forfeited  protection   in\r\n\ndisclosing documents to  the audit agency is  not governed by\r\n\nany  federal constitutional  provision,  federal statute,  or\r\n\nrule prescribed by the Supreme Court.  Nor is the enforcement\r\n\nof  an IRS summons  a matter with respect  to which state law\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nsupplies a rule  of decision.  Accordingly, the  scope of the\r\n\nprivilege is \"governed by the principles of the common law as\r\n\nthey may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in\r\n\nthe light of reason and experience.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 501.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 562 (1989).\r                                       \r\n\n     MIT's  Appeal.     We  begin  with  the  attorney-client\r                              \r\n\nprivilege.  That privilege has  been familiarly summed up  by\r\n\nWigmore in a formula that federal courts have often repeated:\r\n\n          (1)   Where legal  advice of any  kind is\r\n          sought  (2)  from  a  professional  legal\r\n          adviser in his capacity as such,  (3) the\r\n          communications relating to  that purpose,\r\n          (4) made in confidence (5) by the client,\r\n          (6)  are  at   his  instance  permanently\r\n          protected (7) from  disclosure by himself\r\n          or by the  legal adviser, (8) except  the\r\n          protection be waived.\r\n\n8 J. Wigmore, Evidence   2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev. 1961).\r                                  \r\n\nThe government argues, and the district court agreed, that by\r\n\nits disclosure to the audit agency, MIT  waived the privilege\r\n\nto whatever extent that it might otherwise have protected the\r\n\nbilling statements and various of the minutes.\r\n\n     The  attorney-client privilege  is well-established  and\r\n\nits  present  rationale  straightforward:    by  safeguarding\r\n\ncommunications  between  lawyer  and  client,  it  encourages\r\n\ndisclosures by client to lawyer that better enable the client\r\n\nto conform his conduct to the requirements of the law and  to\r\n\npresent legitimate claims or defenses when litigation arises.\r\n\nSee Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389-90 (1981).\r                                           \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nWaiver  issues aside,  the  contours  of  the  privilege  are\r\n\nreasonably stable.\r\n\n     Quite a different  scene presents itself when  one turns\r\n\nto the problem of \"waiver,\"  a loose and misleading label for\r\n\nwhat is in fact a  collection of different rules addressed to\r\n\ndifferent  problems.    Cases  under  this  \"waiver\"  heading\r\n\ninclude situations as  divergent as an express  and voluntary\r\n\nsurrender  of   the  privilege,   partial  disclosure   of  a\r\n\nprivileged document, selective  disclosure to some  outsiders\r\n\nbut not  all,  and inadvertent  overhearings or  disclosures.\r\n\nSee McCormick on  Evidence   93, at 341-48  (J.W. Strong ed.,\r                                      \r\n\n4th ed. 1992).\r\n\n     Even where  the cases are  limited to those  involving a\r\n\ndeliberate   and  voluntary   disclosure   of  a   privileged\r\n\ncommunication to someone  other than the attorney  or client,\r\n\nthe case  law is far from settled.   But decisions do tend to\r\n\nmark  out, although  not with  perfect  consistency, a  small\r\n\ncircle  of   \"others\"  with  whom information  may  be shared\r\n\nwithout   loss   of   the   privilege   (e.g.,   secretaries,\r                                                         \r\n\ninterpreters,  counsel  for  a  cooperating  co-defendant,  a\r\n\nparent present when a child consults a lawyer).1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1See, e.g., United States v.

Cf. Westinghouse Elec.  Corp. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRepublic of the  Philippines, 951  F.2d 1414,  1424 (3d  Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1991).  An  intent to maintain confidentiality  is ordinarily\r\n\nnecessary to continued protection, but it is not sufficient.\r\n\n     On  the  contrary,  where the  client  chooses  to share\r\n\ncommunications  outside this  magic circle,  the  courts have\r\n\nusually  refused  to  extend the  privilege.2    The familiar\r\n\nplatitude  is that the privilege is narrowly confined because\r\n\nit hinders the courts in the search for truth.  See Fisher v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited States, 425 U.S. 391,  403 (1976); 8 Wigmore, supra,  \r                                                                      \r\n\n2291, at 554.

This  problem has presented itself  to six circuits.\r\n\nThe  most common  cases have  been  disclosures of  otherwise\r\n\nprivileged attorney-client  communications to  the Securities\r\n\nand  Exchange  Commission  by corporations  during  voluntary\r\n\ninternal investigations or in response to SEC subpoenas.

The only constraint imposed by the traditional rule\r\n\nhere  invoked by the  government--that disclosure to  a third\r\n\nparty waives the privilege--is to limit selective disclosure,\r                                                             \r\n\nthat is, the provision of otherwise privileged communications\r\n\nto one outsider while withholding them from another.  MIT has\r\n\nprovided  no evidence  that respecting  this constraint  will\r\n\nprevent it or anyone else from getting adequate legal advice.\r\n\n     Admittedly, the arguments on the other side are far from\r\n\noverwhelming.   The IRS'  search for truth  will not  be much\r\n\nadvanced if MIT  simply limits or recasts its  disclosures to\r\n\nthe audit agency.  But  the general principle that disclosure\r\n\nnormally  negates the  privilege is  worth  maintaining.   To\r\n\nmaintain it here makes the law more predictable and certainly\r\n\neases  its  administration.   Following the  Eighth Circuit's\r\n\napproach  would require,  at the  very  least, a  new set  of\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\ndifficult line-drawing exercises that  would consume time and\r\n\nincrease uncertainty.\r\n\n     MIT says that even if we are not  prepared to follow the\r\n\nEighth Circuit onto new ground, MIT's disclosure to the audit\r\n\nagency  should be  regarded as  akin to  the disclosure  by a\r\n\nclient's lawyer to another lawyer representing another client\r\n\nengaged in a common defense.  Invoking the concept of \"common\r\n\ninterest,\" MIT  seeks to compare its situation to cases where\r\n\ndisclosure   has   been  allowed,   without   forfeiting  the\r\n\nprivilege, among separate parties similarly aligned in a case\r\n\nor  consultation (e.g.,  codefendants,  insurer and  insured,\r                                  \r\n\npatentee and licensee).4\r\n\n     In a rather abstract sense,  MIT and the audit agency do\r\n\nhave  a \"common interest\" in the  proper performance of MIT's\r\n\ndefense  contracts and  the proper  auditing  and payment  of\r\n\nMIT's bills.  But this is not the kind of common  interest to\r\n\nwhich the  cases refer in recognizing that allied lawyers and\r\n\nclients--who are working together in prosecuting or defending\r\n\na   lawsuit  or  in  certain  other  legal  transactions--can\r\n\nexchange  information among  themselves without  loss  of the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     4Compare In re  Regents of Univ. of Cal.  101 F.3d 1386,\r                                                         \r\n1390-91  (Fed.

To  extend the notion to MIT's  relationship with\r\n\nthe   audit  agency,  which   on  another  level   is  easily\r\n\ncharacterized  as  adversarial,  would  be  to  dissolve  the\r\n\nboundary almost entirely.\r\n\n     MIT  further argues  that the  disclosure  to the  audit\r\n\nagency was not \"voluntary\" because of the practical pressures\r\n\nand  the legal  constraints  to  which it  was  subject as  a\r\n\ngovernment contractor.   The  extent of  those pressures  and\r\n\nconstraints  is far from  clear,5 but assuming  arguendo that\r                                                                    \r\n\nthey existed, MIT  chose to place itself in  this position by\r\n\nbecoming a government contractor.  In short, MIT's disclosure\r\n\nto the  audit agency resulted from its  own voluntary choice,\r\n\neven if that choice was made at the time it became  a defense\r\n\ncontractor  and subjected itself to the alleged obligation of\r\n\ndisclosure.  See In re John Doe  Corp., 675 F.2d 482, 489 (2d\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1982).\r\n\n     Anyone  who chooses to disclose a privileged document to\r\n\na third  party, or does so  pursuant to a  prior agreement or\r\n\nunderstanding, has an incentive to do so, whether for gain or\r\n\nto avoid  disadvantage.   It would  be perfectly  possible to\r\n\ncarve out some  of those disclosures  and say that,  although\r\n\nthe  disclosure itself is  not necessary to  foster attorney-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     5MIT's main citation for its  duty to disclose is not to\r\na statute or regulation but to a procedures manual maintained\r\nby  the audit agency.   There is no  actual evidence that MIT\r\nwould have been denied payment  if it had sought to negotiate\r\nsome lesser disclosure.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nclient communications, neither does it forfeit the privilege.\r\n\nWith rare  exceptions, courts  have been  unwilling to  start\r\n\ndown this path--which has no logical terminus--and we join in\r\n\nthis reluctance.\r\n\n     We add, finally, a word about reliance and fair warning.\r\n\nMIT  may have had some reason  to think that the audit agency\r\n\nwould not disclose  the documents to the IRS  (and the agency\r\n\ndid not do so).  But MIT had far less reason to think that it\r\n\ncould  disclose documents  to  the  audit  agency  and  still\r\n\nmaintain   the  privilege  when  IRS  then  sought  the  same\r\n\ndocuments.  See  note 3, above.   The choice to disclose  may\r                           \r\n\nhave been reasonable but it was still a foreseeable gamble.\r\n\n     The IRS Appeal.  We  turn now to the government's cross-\r                               \r\n\nappeal.   Here,  the  IRS  challenges  the  district  court's\r\n\nrefusal to  require MIT  to produce  three specific  minutes.\r\n\nThe  refusal reflected  the district  court's  view that  the\r\n\ndocuments  contained privileged material,  and that there was\r\n\nno waiver  because MIT had  not been shown to  have disclosed\r\n\nthose minutes to the audit agency.   On the latter point, MIT\r\n\neffectively concedes error, and properly so.\r\n\n     Where  privilege is claimed  and the opponent  alleges a\r\n\nspecific disclosure, the burden of proof is upon the claimant\r\n\nto  show nondisclosure  wherever  that  is  material  to  the\r\n\ndisposition of the  claim.  Cf. United States  v. Wilson, 798\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 509, 512-13 (1st Cir. 1986).  Here, MIT concedes that it\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\ncannot  prove that the minutes in question were withheld from\r\n\nthe audit agency.   Instead, it proffers  alternative grounds\r\n\nfor  sustaining the  district court's  judgment  as to  these\r\n\nminutes,  namely, that the  minutes were protected  under the\r\n\nattorney-client privilege and  the work product  doctrine and\r\n\nthat  these protections  were  not  waived  even  though  the\r\n\nminutes were turned over to the audit agency. \r\n\n     A  party may  defend  a  judgment in  its  favor on  any\r\n\nlegitimate ground without appealing from the judgment on that\r\n\nissue.   Martin v.  Tango's Restaurant, Inc.,  969 F.2d 1319,\r                                                        \r\n\n1325  (1st  Cir.  1992).    Our  discussion  of  the  billing\r\n\nstatements  disposes of MIT's argument that the protection of\r\n\nthe  attorney-client  privilege  survived disclosure  to  the\r\n\naudit  agency.    We  therefore  turn  to  the  work  product\r\n\ndoctrine.  In doing so, we reject the government's claim that\r\n\nMIT waived this  work product argument by only  raising it in\r\n\nits  reply brief;  MIT's \"reply\"  brief  was effectively  its\r\n\nanswering brief  on the  government's cross  appeal, and  the\r\n\ngovernment filed its own \"reply\" in turn.\r\n\n     The district  court assumed that work product protection\r\n\ndid  not  apply because  the  minutes were  not  prepared \"in\r\n\nanticipation of litigation,\"  as required by Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n26(b)(3).   MIT argues that the minutes contained substantive\r\n\ninformation  that did represent attorney work product even if\r\n\nthe minutes had a more general function.  There is little law\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nin  this area--partly,  one  suspects,  because work  product\r\n\nusually remains embodied in documents unquestionably prepared\r\n\nfor  litigation  or, if  given  to the  client,  in documents\r\n\nindependently protected by the attorney client privilege.  \r\n\n     The  government has chosen in its  brief to assume that,\r\n\nto   the  extent  that  the  minutes  contained  \"the  mental\r\n\nimpressions,  conclusions, opinions,  or  legal theories\"  of\r\n\nMIT's attorneys,   Fed.  R. Civ.  P.  26(b)(3), the  district\r\n\ncourt   erred  in  concluding  that  work  product  lost  its\r\n\nprotection when repeated in another confidential document not\r\n\nprepared  in anticipation  of litigation.    A Third  Circuit\r\n\nprecedent supports this assumption, which MIT presses and the\r\n\ngovernment does not resist.   See In re  Ford Motor Co.,  110\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.3d  954, 967 (3d  Cir. 1997).  In  view of the government's\r\n\nconcession, we will take the  point as settled for this case.\r\n\n     Nevertheless,  the  government  claims  that  any   such\r\n\nprotection was lost when the  minutes were turned over to the\r\n\naudit agency, MIT  having conceded that it cannot  prove that\r\n\nthe minutes were not so disclosed.  One might wonder  why the\r\n\nstandard of  waiver for  the attorney-client  privilege--that\r\n\nany voluntary disclosure outside the magic circle constitutes\r\n\nwaiver--would  not also apply  to the work  product doctrine.\r\n\nEquivalent waiver standards would make easier  the resolution\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nof  evidentiary disputes  where, as  often  happens, the  two\r\n\nobjections are raised together.  \r\n\n     Nonetheless, the cases  approach uniformity in  implying\r\n\nthat work-product protection  is not as easily  waived as the\r\n\nattorney-client privilege.   The  privilege, it  is said,  is\r\n\ndesigned to protect confidentiality,  so that any  disclosure\r\n\noutside  the magic circle is inconsistent with the privilege;\r\n\nby  contrast, work  product  protection  is provided  against\r\n\n\"adversaries,\"  so  only   disclosing  material   in  a   way\r\n\ninconsistent  with keeping it  from an adversary  waives work\r\n\nproduct protection.  At least five circuits have adopted this\r\n\nrule  in some form.6   See also 8  C. Wright, A.

If\r\n\none  wanted to explain  the discrepant outcomes,  it might be\r\n\nmore  persuasive  to  say  that  the  privilege  is  strictly\r\n\nconfined  because  it is  absolute; on  the other  hand, work\r\n\nproduct  protection  (with  certain  qualifications)  can  be\r\n\novercome by  a sufficient showing of need.

The disclosures did not take place in\r\n\nthe context of a joint  litigation where the parties shared a\r\n\ncommon legal interest.  The audit agency  was reviewing MIT's\r\n\nexpense submissions.  MIT doubtless hoped that there would be\r\n\nno  actual controversy  between  it  and  the  Department  of\r\n\nDefense,  but the potential  for dispute and  even litigation\r\n\nwas certainly there.   The cases treat this  situation as one\r\n\nin which the work product protection is deemed forfeit.

Nothing  in this opinion is intended  to be directed\r\n\nto  the different and  difficult question when  disclosure of\r\n\none  document   warrants  forfeiture  of  protection   for  a\r\n\ndifferent but related document.  That issue was touched on in\r\n\nthe district court but has not been pursued on appeal.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\n     Similarly, even  where work  product can  be discovered,\r\n\nthe  governing rule  directs that  \"the  court shall  protect\r\n\nagainst disclosure  of the  mental impressions,  conclusions,\r\n\nopinions,  or  legal   theories  of  an  attorney   or  other\r\n\nrepresentative of a  party concerning the litigation.\"   Fed.\r\n\nR.

Conceivably,  the  strong  policy\r\n\nunderlying  this  reservation  might serve  to  protect  such\r\n\nmaterials,  even  if  protection  of  ordinary  work  product\r\n\nmaterials were deemed waived because of selective disclosure.\r\n\nThis possibility has not been briefed or argued to us; it may\r\n\nor may not  be pertinent in this case; and we mention it only\r\n\nto stress that we are not deciding the issue.\r\n\n     Accordingly,  on  MIT's  appeal,  the  judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  is  affirmed.

The most important issue presented is whether MIT's disclosure of certain of the documents to another government agency caused it to lose the privilege.  The background facts are essentially undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT is a famous university with tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)(3).  In 1993, the IRS conducted an examination of MIT's records to determine whether MIT still qualified for exempt status and to determine whether it was complying with provisions relating to employment taxes and the reporting of unrelated business income.  In aid of this examination, the IRS requested from MIT copies of the billing statements of law firms that had represented MIT and minutes of the MIT Corporation and its executive and auditing committees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, MIT supplied the documents requested but redacted information claimed to be covered by the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine or both.  In mid-1994 the IRS requested that the redacted information be supplied, and MIT declined.  At this point the IRS sought to obtain the same documents in unredacted form from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"the audit agency\"), the auditing arm of the Department of Defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the same billing statements and possibly some or all of the minutes sought by the IRS had earlier been provided to the audit agency pursuant to contracts between MIT and components of the Department of Defense.  The audit agency helps entities in the Department of Defense review contract performance to be sure that the government is not overcharged for services.  Not surprisingly, the audit agency often reviews the private contractor's books and records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, the audit agency advised the IRS that it would not turn over the documents provided to it by MIT without the latter's consent, which MIT declines to give.  The audit agency had made no unconditional promise to keep the documents secret, but its regulations and practices offered MIT some reason to think that indiscriminate disclosure was unlikely.  The IRS then served an administrative summons on MIT in December 1994 seeking specific unredacted minutes of nine meetings of the MIT Corporation and auditing and executive committees in 1990 and 1991, and attorneys' billing statements for almost all legal expenses paid or incurred by MIT from July 1, 1990, through June 30, 1991.  26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7402(b), 7604(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When MIT declined to comply, the IRS in early 1996 petitioned the district court to enforce the summons.  The district court obtained briefs, heard arguments and considered the matter without an evidentiary hearing on the basis of the declaration filed by the IRS and an affidavit submitted by MIT.  In January 1997, the district court issued a memorandum and order enforcing the IRS administrative summons as to the unredacted legal bills and the unredacted versions of most of the minutes sought by the IRS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the disclosure of the legal bills to the audit agency forfeited the attorney-client privilege.  As to the minutes, the district court said that the privilege remained available because the government had not proved that the minutes had been disclosed to the audit agency.  After reviewing the minutes in camera, the court found that three contained privileged material and ordered MIT to turn over the others as unprivileged or because MIT had lost the privilege by disclosing the substance of the minutes in its now unprivileged legal bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court followed a different path in resolving MIT's work product objection.  The court held that neither the legal bills nor the minutes were \"prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  It ruled that they were therefore discoverable as ordinary business records.  Accordingly, the court did not discuss whether work product protection was waived by disclosure to the audit agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT now appeals, arguing that disclosure of the billing statements to the audit agency should not forfeit the privilege;  MIT no longer claims work product protection for the billing statements.  The government has cross-appealed from the district court's refusal to order production of the three remaining minutes;  it says that the burden was on MIT to prove that the minutes had not been disclosed to the audit agency.  MIT responds that the privilege was not waived even if the minutes were disclosed to the audit agency, and that the minutes remain protected by the work product doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal respecting a privilege claim, the standard of review depends on the issue.  Rulings by the district court on issues of law are reviewed de novo;  fact findings are tested under a clear error standard;  and discretionary judgments such as evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Wilson, 798 F.2d 509, 512 (1st Cir.1986).  On the principal issue before us--forfeiture by disclosure--this case goes about as far as possible in posing an abstract issue of law and review is plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether MIT forfeited protection in disclosing documents to the audit agency is not governed by any federal constitutional provision, federal statute, or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.  Nor is the enforcement of an IRS summons a matter with respect to which state law supplies a rule of decision.  Accordingly, the scope of the privilege is \"governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 501.  See also United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 562, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 2625-26, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT's Appeal.   We begin with the attorney-client privilege.  That privilege has been familiarly summed up by Wigmore in a formula that federal courts have often repeated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>(1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 J. Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev.1961).  The government argues, and the district court agreed, that by its disclosure to the audit agency, MIT waived the privilege to whatever extent that it might otherwise have protected the billing statements and various of the minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attorney-client privilege is well-established and its present rationale straightforward:  by safeguarding communications between lawyer and client, it encourages disclosures by client to lawyer that better enable the client to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law and to present legitimate claims or defenses when litigation arises.  See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389-90, 101 S.Ct. 677, 682-83, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981).  Waiver issues aside, the contours of the privilege are reasonably stable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite a different scene presents itself when one turns to the problem of \"waiver,\" a loose and misleading label for what is in fact a collection of different rules addressed to different problems.  Cases under this \"waiver\" heading include situations as divergent as an express and voluntary surrender of the privilege, partial disclosure of a privileged document, selective disclosure to some outsiders but not all, and inadvertent overhearings or disclosures.  See McCormick on Evidence &#167; 93, at 341-48 (J.W. Strong ed., 4th ed.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where the cases are limited to those involving a deliberate and voluntary disclosure of a privileged communication to someone other than the attorney or client, the case law is far from settled.  But decisions do tend to mark out, although not with perfect consistency, a small circle of \"others\" with whom information may be shared without loss of the privilege (e.g., secretaries, interpreters, counsel for a cooperating co-defendant, a parent present when a child consults a lawyer).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the decisions often describe such situations as ones in which the client \"intended\" the disclosure to remain confidential, see, e.g., Kevlik v. Goldstein, 724 F.2d 844, 849 (1st Cir.1984), the underlying concern is functional:  that the lawyer be able to consult with others needed in the representation and that the client be allowed to bring closely related persons who are appropriate, even if not vital, to a consultation.  Cf. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Republic of the Philippines, 951 F.2d 1414, 1424 (3d Cir.1991).  An intent to maintain confidentiality is ordinarily necessary to continued protection, but it is not sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, where the client chooses to share communications outside this magic circle, the courts have usually refused to extend the privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The familiar platitude is that the privilege is narrowly confined because it hinders the courts in the search for truth.  See Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 1577, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976);  8 Wigmore, supra, &#167; 2291, at 554.  Fairness is also a concern where a client is permitted to choose to disclose materials to one outsider while withholding them from another.  See, e.g., Permian Corp. v. United States, 665 F.2d 1214, 1221 (D.C.Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should this inclination not to protect a document disclosed outside the circle apply where, as here, the initial disclosure was to and at the request of a government agency?   This problem has presented itself to six circuits.  The most common cases have been disclosures of otherwise privileged attorney-client communications to the Securities and Exchange Commission by corporations during voluntary internal investigations or in response to SEC subpoenas.  The Eighth Circuit, en banc but without more than a paragraph of analysis, treated this kind of disclosure as not comprising a total waiver of the privilege.  See Diversified Indus., Inc. v. Meredith, 572 F.2d 596, 611 (8th Cir.1978) (en banc).  Subsequently, the Second, Third, Fourth, Federal and D.C. Circuits took the opposite view and ruled that such limited disclosures do destroy the privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary argument in favor of the Eighth Circuit position is that loss of the privilege may discourage the frank exchange between attorney and client in future cases, wherever the client anticipates making a disclosure to at least one government agency.  We put to one side the interest of the government agency in obtaining voluntary disclosures;  such agencies usually have means to secure the information they need and, if not, can seek legislation from Congress.  By contrast, the safeguarding of the attorney-client relationship has largely been left to the courts, which have a comparative advantage in assessing consequences in this sphere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But MIT, like any client, continues to control both the nature of its communications with counsel and the ultimate decision whether to disclose such communications to third parties.  The only constraint imposed by the traditional rule here invoked by the government--that disclosure to a third party waives the privilege--is to limit selective disclosure, that is, the provision of otherwise privileged communications to one outsider while withholding them from another.  MIT has provided no evidence that respecting this constraint will prevent it or anyone else from getting adequate legal advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the arguments on the other side are far from overwhelming.  The IRS' search for truth will not be much advanced if MIT simply limits or recasts its disclosures to the audit agency.  But the general principle that disclosure normally negates the privilege is worth maintaining.  To maintain it here makes the law more predictable and certainly eases its administration.  Following the Eighth Circuit's approach would require, at the very least, a new set of difficult line-drawing exercises that would consume time and increase uncertainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT says that even if we are not prepared to follow the Eighth Circuit onto new ground, MIT's disclosure to the audit agency should be regarded as akin to the disclosure by a client's lawyer to another lawyer representing another client engaged in a common defense.  Invoking the concept of \"common interest,\" MIT seeks to compare its situation to cases where disclosure has been allowed, without forfeiting the privilege, among separate parties similarly aligned in a case or consultation (e.g., codefendants, insurer and insured, patentee and licensee).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a rather abstract sense, MIT and the audit agency do have a \"common interest\" in the proper performance of MIT's defense contracts and the proper auditing and payment of MIT's bills.  But this is not the kind of common interest to which the cases refer in recognizing that allied lawyers and clients--who are working together in prosecuting or defending a lawsuit or in certain other legal transactions--can exchange information among themselves without loss of the privilege.  To extend the notion to MIT's relationship with the audit agency, which on another level is easily characterized as adversarial, would be to dissolve the boundary almost entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT further argues that the disclosure to the audit agency was not \"voluntary\" because of the practical pressures and the legal constraints to which it was subject as a government contractor.  The extent of those pressures and constraints is far from clear,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but assuming arguendo that they existed, MIT chose to place itself in this position by becoming a government contractor.  In short, MIT's disclosure to the audit agency resulted from its own voluntary choice, even if that choice was made at the time it became a defense contractor and subjected itself to the alleged obligation of disclosure.  See In re John Doe Corp., 675 F.2d 482, 489 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anyone who chooses to disclose a privileged document to a third party, or does so pursuant to a prior agreement or understanding, has an incentive to do so, whether for gain or to avoid disadvantage.  It would be perfectly possible to carve out some of those disclosures and say that, although the disclosure itself is not necessary to foster attorney-client communications, neither does it forfeit the privilege.  With rare exceptions, courts have been unwilling to start down this path--which has no logical terminus--and we join in this reluctance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, finally, a word about reliance and fair warning.  MIT may have had some reason to think that the audit agency would not disclose the documents to the IRS (and the agency did not do so).  But MIT had far less reason to think that it could disclose documents to the audit agency and still maintain the privilege when IRS then sought the same documents.  See note 3, above.  The choice to disclose may have been reasonable but it was still a foreseeable gamble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS Appeal.   We turn now to the government's cross-appeal.  Here, the IRS challenges the district court's refusal to require MIT to produce three specific minutes.  The refusal reflected the district court's view that the documents contained privileged material, and that there was no waiver because MIT had not been shown to have disclosed those minutes to the audit agency.  On the latter point, MIT effectively concedes error, and properly so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where privilege is claimed and the opponent alleges a specific disclosure, the burden of proof is upon the claimant to show nondisclosure wherever that is material to the disposition of the claim.  Cf. United States v. Wilson, 798 F.2d 509, 512-13 (1st Cir.1986).  Here, MIT concedes that it cannot prove that the minutes in question were withheld from the audit agency.  Instead, it proffers alternative grounds for sustaining the district court's judgment as to these minutes, namely, that the minutes were protected under the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine and that these protections were not waived even though the minutes were turned over to the audit agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party may defend a judgment in its favor on any legitimate ground without appealing from the judgment on that issue.  Martin v. Tango's Restaurant, Inc., 969 F.2d 1319, 1325 (1st Cir.1992).  Our discussion of the billing statements disposes of MIT's argument that the protection of the attorney-client privilege survived disclosure to the audit agency.  We therefore turn to the work product doctrine.  In doing so, we reject the government's claim that MIT waived this work product argument by only raising it in its reply brief;  MIT's \"reply\" brief was effectively its answering brief on the government's cross appeal, and the government filed its own \"reply\" in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court assumed that work product protection did not apply because the minutes were not prepared \"in anticipation of litigation,\" as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  MIT argues that the minutes contained substantive information that did represent attorney work product even if the minutes had a more general function.  There is little law in this area--partly, one suspects, because work product usually remains embodied in documents unquestionably prepared for litigation or, if given to the client, in documents independently protected by the attorney client privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has chosen in its brief to assume that, to the extent that the minutes contained \"the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories\" of MIT's attorneys, Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3), the district court erred in concluding that work product lost its protection when repeated in another confidential document not prepared in anticipation of litigation.  A Third Circuit precedent supports this assumption, which MIT presses and the government does not resist.  See In re Ford Motor Co., 110 F.3d 954, 967 (3d Cir.1997).  In view of the government's concession, we will take the point as settled for this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the government claims that any such protection was lost when the minutes were turned over to the audit agency, MIT having conceded that it cannot prove that the minutes were not so disclosed.  One might wonder why the standard of waiver for the attorney-client privilege--that any voluntary disclosure outside the magic circle constitutes waiver--would not also apply to the work product doctrine.  Equivalent waiver standards would make easier the resolution of evidentiary disputes where, as often happens, the two objections are raised together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the cases approach uniformity in implying that work-product protection is not as easily waived as the attorney-client privilege.  The privilege, it is said, is designed to protect confidentiality, so that any disclosure outside the magic circle is inconsistent with the privilege;  by contrast, work product protection is provided against \"adversaries,\" so only disclosing material in a way inconsistent with keeping it from an adversary waives work product protection.  At least five circuits have adopted this rule in some form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See also 8 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2024, at 368-69 (1994) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps such formulations simply beg the question.  If one wanted to explain the discrepant outcomes, it might be more persuasive to say that the privilege is strictly confined because it is absolute;  on the other hand, work product protection (with certain qualifications) can be overcome by a sufficient showing of need.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  In all events, it would take better reason than we have to depart from the prevailing rule that disclosure to an adversary, real or potential, forfeits work product protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT's disclosure to the audit agency was a disclosure to a potential adversary.  The disclosures did not take place in the context of a joint litigation where the parties shared a common legal interest.  The audit agency was reviewing MIT's expense submissions.  MIT doubtless hoped that there would be no actual controversy between it and the Department of Defense, but the potential for dispute and even litigation was certainly there.  The cases treat this situation as one in which the work product protection is deemed forfeit.  See, e.g., Steinhardt Partners, 9 F.3d at 234;  Westinghouse, 951 F.2d at 1428-31;  In re Subpoenas Duces Tecum, 738 F.2d at 1372 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, it may be helpful to stress that--with regard to both the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine--we are concerned only with loss of protection as to the very documents already disclosed to the audit agency.  Nothing in this opinion is intended to be directed to the different and difficult question when disclosure of one document warrants forfeiture of protection for a different but related document.  That issue was touched on in the district court but has not been pursued on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, even where work product can be discovered, the governing rule directs that \"the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  Conceivably, the strong policy underlying this reservation might serve to protect such materials, even if protection of ordinary work product materials were deemed waived because of selective disclosure.  This possibility has not been briefed or argued to us;  it may or may not be pertinent in this case;  and we mention it only to stress that we are not deciding the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, on MIT's appeal, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

The most important issue presented is whether MIT's disclosure of certain of the documents to another government agency caused it to lose the privilege.  The background facts are essentially undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT is a famous university with tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)(3).  In 1993, the IRS conducted an examination of MIT's records to determine whether MIT still qualified for exempt status and to determine whether it was complying with provisions relating to employment taxes and the reporting of unrelated business income.  In aid of this examination, the IRS requested from MIT copies of the billing statements of law firms that had represented MIT and minutes of the MIT Corporation and its executive and auditing committees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, MIT supplied the documents requested but redacted information claimed to be covered by the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine or both.  In mid-1994 the IRS requested that the redacted information be supplied, and MIT declined.  At this point the IRS sought to obtain the same documents in unredacted form from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"the audit agency\"), the auditing arm of the Department of Defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the same billing statements and possibly some or all of the minutes sought by the IRS had earlier been provided to the audit agency pursuant to contracts between MIT and components of the Department of Defense.  The audit agency helps entities in the Department of Defense review contract performance to be sure that the government is not overcharged for services.  Not surprisingly, the audit agency often reviews the private contractor's books and records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, the audit agency advised the IRS that it would not turn over the documents provided to it by MIT without the latter's consent, which MIT declines to give.  The audit agency had made no unconditional promise to keep the documents secret, but its regulations and practices offered MIT some reason to think that indiscriminate disclosure was unlikely.  The IRS then served an administrative summons on MIT in December 1994 seeking specific unredacted minutes of nine meetings of the MIT Corporation and auditing and executive committees in 1990 and 1991, and attorneys' billing statements for almost all legal expenses paid or incurred by MIT from July 1, 1990, through June 30, 1991.  26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7402(b), 7604(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When MIT declined to comply, the IRS in early 1996 petitioned the district court to enforce the summons.  The district court obtained briefs, heard arguments and considered the matter without an evidentiary hearing on the basis of the declaration filed by the IRS and an affidavit submitted by MIT.  In January 1997, the district court issued a memorandum and order enforcing the IRS administrative summons as to the unredacted legal bills and the unredacted versions of most of the minutes sought by the IRS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the disclosure of the legal bills to the audit agency forfeited the attorney-client privilege.  As to the minutes, the district court said that the privilege remained available because the government had not proved that the minutes had been disclosed to the audit agency.  After reviewing the minutes in camera, the court found that three contained privileged material and ordered MIT to turn over the others as unprivileged or because MIT had lost the privilege by disclosing the substance of the minutes in its now unprivileged legal bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court followed a different path in resolving MIT's work product objection.  The court held that neither the legal bills nor the minutes were \"prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  It ruled that they were therefore discoverable as ordinary business records.  Accordingly, the court did not discuss whether work product protection was waived by disclosure to the audit agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT now appeals, arguing that disclosure of the billing statements to the audit agency should not forfeit the privilege;  MIT no longer claims work product protection for the billing statements.  The government has cross-appealed from the district court's refusal to order production of the three remaining minutes;  it says that the burden was on MIT to prove that the minutes had not been disclosed to the audit agency.  MIT responds that the privilege was not waived even if the minutes were disclosed to the audit agency, and that the minutes remain protected by the work product doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal respecting a privilege claim, the standard of review depends on the issue.  Rulings by the district court on issues of law are reviewed de novo;  fact findings are tested under a clear error standard;  and discretionary judgments such as evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Wilson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474815\"><a href=\"/opinion/474815/united-states-v-william-h-wilson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 512 (1st Cir.1986).

We begin with the attorney-client privilege.

Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev.1961).  The government argues, and the district court agreed, that by its disclosure to the audit agency, MIT waived the privilege to whatever extent that it might otherwise have protected the billing statements and various of the minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attorney-client privilege is well-established and its present rationale straightforward:  by safeguarding communications between lawyer and client, it encourages disclosures by client to lawyer that better enable the client to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law and to present legitimate claims or defenses when litigation arises.  See Upjohn Co. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110374\"><a href=\"/opinion/110374/upjohn-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 389-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110374\"><a href=\"/opinion/110374/upjohn-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Waiver issues aside, the contours of the privilege are reasonably stable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite a different scene presents itself when one turns to the problem of \"waiver,\" a loose and misleading label for what is in fact a collection of different rules addressed to different problems.  Cases under this \"waiver\" heading include situations as divergent as an express and voluntary surrender of the privilege, partial disclosure of a privileged document, selective disclosure to some outsiders but not all, and inadvertent overhearings or disclosures.  See McCormick on Evidence &#167; 93, at 341-48 (J.W. Strong ed., 4th ed.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even where the cases are limited to those involving a deliberate and voluntary disclosure of a privileged communication to someone other than the attorney or client, the case law is far from settled.  But decisions do tend to mark out, although not with perfect consistency, a small circle of \"others\" with whom information may be shared without loss of the privilege (e.g., secretaries, interpreters, counsel for a cooperating co-defendant, a parent present when a child consults a lawyer).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the decisions often describe such situations as ones in which the client \"intended\" the disclosure to remain confidential, see, e.g., Kevlik v. Goldstein, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429496\"><a href=\"/opinion/429496/james-j-kevlik-v-david-b-goldstein-town-of-derry/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 849 (1st Cir.1984), the underlying concern is functional:  that the lawyer be able to consult with others needed in the representation and that the client be allowed to bring closely related persons who are appropriate, even if not vital, to a consultation.  Cf. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Republic of the Philippines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574318\"><a href=\"/opinion/574318/westinghouse-electric-corporation-and-westinghouse-international-projects/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1414</span></a></span>, 1424 (3d Cir.1991).  An intent to maintain confidentiality is ordinarily necessary to continued protection, but it is not sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, where the client chooses to share communications outside this magic circle, the courts have usually refused to extend the privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The familiar platitude is that the privilege is narrowly confined because it hinders the courts in the search for truth.

Fairness is also a concern where a client is permitted to choose to disclose materials to one outsider while withholding them from another.  See, e.g., Permian Corp. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397834\"><a href=\"/opinion/397834/the-permian-corporation-and-occidental-petroleum-corporation-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1214</span></a></span>, 1221 (D.C.Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should this inclination not to protect a document disclosed outside the circle apply where, as here, the initial disclosure was to and at the request of a government agency?   This problem has presented itself to six circuits.  The most common cases have been disclosures of otherwise privileged attorney-client communications to the Securities and Exchange Commission by corporations during voluntary internal investigations or in response to SEC subpoenas.  The Eighth Circuit, en banc but without more than a paragraph of analysis, treated this kind of disclosure as not comprising a total waiver of the privilege.  See Diversified Indus., Inc. v. Meredith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354048\"><a href=\"/opinion/354048/diversified-industries-inc-v-the-honorable-james-h-meredith-chief/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 611 (8th Cir.1978) (en banc).  Subsequently, the Second, Third, Fourth, Federal and D.C. Circuits took the opposite view and ruled that such limited disclosures do destroy the privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary argument in favor of the Eighth Circuit position is that loss of the privilege may discourage the frank exchange between attorney and client in future cases, wherever the client anticipates making a disclosure to at least one government agency.  We put to one side the interest of the government agency in obtaining voluntary disclosures;  such agencies usually have means to secure the information they need and, if not, can seek legislation from Congress.  By contrast, the safeguarding of the attorney-client relationship has largely been left to the courts, which have a comparative advantage in assessing consequences in this sphere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But MIT, like any client, continues to control both the nature of its communications with counsel and the ultimate decision whether to disclose such communications to third parties.  The only constraint imposed by the traditional rule here invoked by the government--that disclosure to a third party waives the privilege--is to limit selective disclosure, that is, the provision of otherwise privileged communications to one outsider while withholding them from another.  MIT has provided no evidence that respecting this constraint will prevent it or anyone else from getting adequate legal advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the arguments on the other side are far from overwhelming.  The IRS' search for truth will not be much advanced if MIT simply limits or recasts its disclosures to the audit agency.  But the general principle that disclosure normally negates the privilege is worth maintaining.  To maintain it here makes the law more predictable and certainly eases its administration.  Following the Eighth Circuit's approach would require, at the very least, a new set of difficult line-drawing exercises that would consume time and increase uncertainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT says that even if we are not prepared to follow the Eighth Circuit onto new ground, MIT's disclosure to the audit agency should be regarded as akin to the disclosure by a client's lawyer to another lawyer representing another client engaged in a common defense.  Invoking the concept of \"common interest,\" MIT seeks to compare its situation to cases where disclosure has been allowed, without forfeiting the privilege, among separate parties similarly aligned in a case or consultation (e.g., codefendants, insurer and insured, patentee and licensee).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a rather abstract sense, MIT and the audit agency do have a \"common interest\" in the proper performance of MIT's defense contracts and the proper auditing and payment of MIT's bills.  But this is not the kind of common interest to which the cases refer in recognizing that allied lawyers and clients--who are working together in prosecuting or defending a lawsuit or in certain other legal transactions--can exchange information among themselves without loss of the privilege.  To extend the notion to MIT's relationship with the audit agency, which on another level is easily characterized as adversarial, would be to dissolve the boundary almost entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT further argues that the disclosure to the audit agency was not \"voluntary\" because of the practical pressures and the legal constraints to which it was subject as a government contractor.  The extent of those pressures and constraints is far from clear,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but assuming arguendo that they existed, MIT chose to place itself in this position by becoming a government contractor.  In short, MIT's disclosure to the audit agency resulted from its own voluntary choice, even if that choice was made at the time it became a defense contractor and subjected itself to the alleged obligation of disclosure.  See In re John Doe Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402337\"><a href=\"/opinion/402337/fed-sec-l-rep-p-98648-10-fed-r-evid-serv-1390-in-re-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 489 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anyone who chooses to disclose a privileged document to a third party, or does so pursuant to a prior agreement or understanding, has an incentive to do so, whether for gain or to avoid disadvantage.  It would be perfectly possible to carve out some of those disclosures and say that, although the disclosure itself is not necessary to foster attorney-client communications, neither does it forfeit the privilege.  With rare exceptions, courts have been unwilling to start down this path--which has no logical terminus--and we join in this reluctance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, finally, a word about reliance and fair warning.  MIT may have had some reason to think that the audit agency would not disclose the documents to the IRS (and the agency did not do so).  But MIT had far less reason to think that it could disclose documents to the audit agency and still maintain the privilege when IRS then sought the same documents.  See note 3, above.  The choice to disclose may have been reasonable but it was still a foreseeable gamble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS Appeal.   We turn now to the government's cross-appeal.  Here, the IRS challenges the district court's refusal to require MIT to produce three specific minutes.  The refusal reflected the district court's view that the documents contained privileged material, and that there was no waiver because MIT had not been shown to have disclosed those minutes to the audit agency.  On the latter point, MIT effectively concedes error, and properly so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where privilege is claimed and the opponent alleges a specific disclosure, the burden of proof is upon the claimant to show nondisclosure wherever that is material to the disposition of the claim.  Cf. United States v. Wilson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474815\"><a href=\"/opinion/474815/united-states-v-william-h-wilson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 512-13 (1st Cir.1986).  Here, MIT concedes that it cannot prove that the minutes in question were withheld from the audit agency.  Instead, it proffers alternative grounds for sustaining the district court's judgment as to these minutes, namely, that the minutes were protected under the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine and that these protections were not waived even though the minutes were turned over to the audit agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party may defend a judgment in its favor on any legitimate ground without appealing from the judgment on that issue.  Martin v. Tango's Restaurant, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587248\"><a href=\"/opinion/587248/lynn-martin-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>, 1325 (1st Cir.1992).  Our discussion of the billing statements disposes of MIT's argument that the protection of the attorney-client privilege survived disclosure to the audit agency.  We therefore turn to the work product doctrine.  In doing so, we reject the government's claim that MIT waived this work product argument by only raising it in its reply brief;  MIT's \"reply\" brief was effectively its answering brief on the government's cross appeal, and the government filed its own \"reply\" in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court assumed that work product protection did not apply because the minutes were not prepared \"in anticipation of litigation,\" as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  MIT argues that the minutes contained substantive information that did represent attorney work product even if the minutes had a more general function.  There is little law in this area--partly, one suspects, because work product usually remains embodied in documents unquestionably prepared for litigation or, if given to the client, in documents independently protected by the attorney client privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has chosen in its brief to assume that, to the extent that the minutes contained \"the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories\" of MIT's attorneys, Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3), the district court erred in concluding that work product lost its protection when repeated in another confidential document not prepared in anticipation of litigation.  A Third Circuit precedent supports this assumption, which MIT presses and the government does not resist.  See In re Ford Motor Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739302\"><a href=\"/opinion/739302/in-re-ford-motor-company-susan-i-kelly-administratrix-and-personal/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 967 (3d Cir.1997).  In view of the government's concession, we will take the point as settled for this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the government claims that any such protection was lost when the minutes were turned over to the audit agency, MIT having conceded that it cannot prove that the minutes were not so disclosed.  One might wonder why the standard of waiver for the attorney-client privilege--that any voluntary disclosure outside the magic circle constitutes waiver--would not also apply to the work product doctrine.  Equivalent waiver standards would make easier the resolution of evidentiary disputes where, as often happens, the two objections are raised together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the cases approach uniformity in implying that work-product protection is not as easily waived as the attorney-client privilege.  The privilege, it is said, is designed to protect confidentiality, so that any disclosure outside the magic circle is inconsistent with the privilege;  by contrast, work product protection is provided against \"adversaries,\" so only disclosing material in a way inconsistent with keeping it from an adversary waives work product protection.  At least five circuits have adopted this rule in some form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See also 8 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2024, at 368-69 (1994) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps such formulations simply beg the question.  If one wanted to explain the discrepant outcomes, it might be more persuasive to say that the privilege is strictly confined because it is absolute;  on the other hand, work product protection (with certain qualifications) can be overcome by a sufficient showing of need.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  In all events, it would take better reason than we have to depart from the prevailing rule that disclosure to an adversary, real or potential, forfeits work product protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MIT's disclosure to the audit agency was a disclosure to a potential adversary.  The disclosures did not take place in the context of a joint litigation where the parties shared a common legal interest.  The audit agency was reviewing MIT's expense submissions.  MIT doubtless hoped that there would be no actual controversy between it and the Department of Defense, but the potential for dispute and even litigation was certainly there.  The cases treat this situation as one in which the work product protection is deemed forfeit.  See, e.g., Steinhardt Partners, 9 F.3d at 234;  Westinghouse, 951 F.2d at 1428-31;  In re Subpoenas Duces Tecum, 738 F.2d at 1372 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, it may be helpful to stress that--with regard to both the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine--we are concerned only with loss of protection as to the very documents already disclosed to the audit agency.  Nothing in this opinion is intended to be directed to the different and difficult question when disclosure of one document warrants forfeiture of protection for a different but related document.  That issue was touched on in the district court but has not been pursued on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, even where work product can be discovered, the governing rule directs that \"the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  Conceivably, the strong policy underlying this reservation might serve to protect such materials, even if protection of ordinary work product materials were deemed waived because of selective disclosure.  This possibility has not been briefed or argued to us;  it may or may not be pertinent in this case;  and we mention it only to stress that we are not deciding the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, on MIT's appeal, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.   On the government's cross-appeal, the judgment of the district court refusing to order production of three specified minutes is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., United States v.
