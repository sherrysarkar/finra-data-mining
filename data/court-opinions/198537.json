  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\n\nNo. 98-2369\r\n\nCITY OF BOSTON,\r\n\nPlaintiff, Appellee,\r\n\nv.\r\n\nMARITRANS CORPORATION; BOSTON TOWING\r\n&amp; TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC., IN PERSONAM;\r\nMARITRANS OPERATING PARTNERS, L.P.,\r\n\nDefendants, Appellants.\r\n\n\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n[Hon. Zachary R. Karol, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n\n\nBefore\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nCampbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Selya, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n\n\nBrian P. Flanagan and Arthur P. Skarmeas, with whom Flanagan\r\n&amp; Hunter, P.C., and Clinton &amp; Muzyka, P.C. were on brief, for\r\nappellants.\r\nKaren M. Coppa, Assistant Corporation Counsel, City of Boston\r\nLaw Department, for appellee.\r\n\n\n\nJune 23, 1999\r\n        Per Curiam.  Defendants-appellants Maritrans Operating\r\nPartners, L.P., Maritrans Corporation, and Boston Towing and\r\nTransportation Company, L.P. Inc. appeal the district court's entry\r\nof judgment following a bench trial on plaintiff-appellee City of\r\nBoston's admiralty action.  The City alleged that a flotilla of\r\nvessels owned by defendants negligently caused a barge in the\r\nflotilla, the OCEAN STATES, to strike and damage the Chelsea Street\r\nBridge while passing through a narrow area of Boston Harbor.  The\r\ndistrict court found defendants' conduct to be negligent and to be\r\na proximate cause of the damages to the bridge, but not the sole\r\nproximate cause.  Because the district court found that the City's\r\nfailure to maintain a fendering system on the damaged side of the\r\nbridge was also a proximate cause of the damages, the district\r\ncourt apportioned the damages between the City and defendants. \r\nFinding defendants to be 40% responsible, the district court\r\nentered judgment against defendants in the amount of $35,121, which\r\nconstitutes 40% of the total damages of $87,802.  Defendants\r\nappeal.\r\nWe affirm the judgment on the basis of the district\r\ncourt's November 2, 1998 Order outlining its findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.  We pause only to add the following.\r\nAppellants challenge the district court's findings that\r\nappellants were negligent and that their negligence was a proximate\r\ncause of the damages claimed.  District court determinations of\r\nnegligence and proximate cause are reviewed for clear error.  See\r\nClement v. United States, 980 F.2d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 1992); Goudy &amp;\r\nStevens, Inc. v. Cable Marine, Inc., 924 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).\r\nThe district court's finding that appellants were\r\nnegligent is not clearly erroneous.  The undisputed evidence was\r\nthat the two tugs were preparing to guide the barge through the\r\ndraw span and had properly lined up the barge to enter the span\r\nwhen one of the tugs, the VINCENT TIBBETTS, Jr. (\"TIBBETTS\"),\r\nunexpectedly turned sharply to starboard.  The barge then hit the\r\nChelsea side of the bridge and ricocheted back to strike the East\r\nBoston side of the bridge with such force that it shook the draw\r\ntender's house for the first time in the draw tender's tenure.  In\r\na statement to the Coast Guard, Tug Mate Patrick Michaud, who was\r\naboard the barge when it struck the bridge, blamed the collision on\r\n\"excessive steering by the [TIBBETTS].\"  The captain of the other\r\ntug, who was in command of the entire flotilla, stated that he had\r\nnever seen such a sudden and unordered course change.  The City's\r\nexpert, Captain David Gray, testified that the exercise of judgment\r\naboard the TIBBETTS was negligent and that it was negligent of the\r\nflotilla to fail to properly direct the TIBBETTS.  Faced with this\r\nevidence, appellants offered no explanation as to why the TIBBETTS\r\nturned sharply to starboard.  In fact, as the district court noted,\r\nthe captain of the TIBBETTS does not even acknowledge that the turn\r\noccurred.  In light of this evidence of the negligence of the\r\nTIBBETTS' course change, and in light of the absence of any\r\nexplanation for it, the district court's finding that the course\r\nchange was negligent can hardly be described as clearly erroneous.\r\nNor were the district court's findings of proximate cause\r\nclearly erroneous.  The court found appellants' negligence to be a\r\nproximate cause of the damages, but also found the City's failure\r\nto maintain a fendering system to be a second proximate cause. \r\nCiting Exxon Co. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. 830, 837 (1996),\r\nappellants argue that the City's actions constituted a superseding\r\ncause that broke the causal connection between the injury and\r\nappellants' actions.  We disagree.  \"'The doctrine of superseding\r\ncause is . . . applied where the defendant's negligence in fact\r\nsubstantially contributed to the plaintiff's injury, but the injury\r\nwas actually brought about by a later cause of independent origin\r\nthat was not foreseeable.'\"  Exxon, 517 U.S. at 837 (quoting 1 T.\r\nSchoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law,  5-3, pp. 165-166 (2d ed.\r\n1994)).  It cannot be said that the injury here was \"actually\r\nbrought about\" by a later action of the City.  The damages to the\r\nbridge were \"brought about\" by the unexpected sharp turn of the\r\nTIBBETTS.  Appellants' negligence sent the barge careening into the\r\nbridge, and the City's failure to maintain a fendering system was\r\nnot the type of independent, unforeseeable act that would break the\r\nchain of causation.  Appellants cite Exxon's statement that\r\n\"'[s]omewhere a point will be reached when courts will agree that\r\nthe link [between the defendants' actions and the injury] has\r\nbecome too tenuous -- that what is claimed to be consequence is\r\nonly fortuity.'\"  See id. at 838 (quoting Petition of Kinsman\r\nTransit Co., 338 F.2d 708, 725 (2d Cir. 1964)).  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court that we have not reached that point in this case. \r\nTherefore, the district court properly considered appellants'\r\nnegligence as one of the proximate causes of the injury when it\r\napportioned the damages.  See United States v. Reliable Transfer\r\nCo., 421 U.S. 397, 411 (1975) (\"We hold that when two or more\r\nparties have contributed by their fault to cause property damage in\r\na maritime collision . . . liability for such damage is to be\r\nallocated among the parties proportionately to the comparative\r\ndegree of their fault.\").\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\ncourt is AFFIRMED.\n",
