This admiralty case features\r\n\nseven competing claimants, each trying to take from the\r\n\nproceeds of the sale of a seized vessel, the M/V VASILIA\r\n\nEXPRESS. Three claimants, in addition to the original\r\n\ncharterer plaintiff, were allowed to intervene; all four won\r\n\njudgments after a three-day, expedited bench trial. Suit was\r\n\noriginally brought in rem against the vessel. The vessel's\r\n\ncorporate owner and its shipping agent both appeared, however,\r\n\nin \r              personam to defend the action, and were also held liable on\r\n\ntwo of the judgments (for the original charterer and another\r\n\nintervening charterer). The proceeds of the sale are\r\n\ninsufficient to satisfy even these four successful claims.\r\n\nVarious other claimants, whose claims would further tax the\r\n\navailable funds, were not allowed to intervene. Three of\r\n\nthese, the ship's captain and two repair companies, appeal.\r\n\nThe owner of the vessel, the shipping agent, and the vessel\r\n\nitself also appeal together, arguing that the district court's\r\n\nentry of judgment against them is in error, and hence that\r\n\nthere should be no division of proceeds at all. Alternatively,\r\n\nthey argue that the two charterers were awarded excessive\r\n\ndamages. These four appeals were consolidated.\r\n\n          We affirm the judgment against the vessel and the two\r\n\nin personam defendants, but we vacate the damages awards to\r\n\nboth charterers and remand for a reassessment of damages. We\r\n\nalso affirm the denial of intervention to the captain, but we\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nreverse the denials of the two repair companies' motions to\r\n\nintervene and remand to the district court to entertain those\r\n\ncompanies' proof, to calculate damages due them, if any, and to\r\n\ndetermine how the proceeds from the sale of the vessel should\r\n\nbe allocated among the various judgment winners.\r\n\n                             I.\r\n\n          The underlying facts are not now in dispute. On the\r\n\nmorning of March 28, 1996, Navieros Interamericanos S.A., Inc.\r\n\n(\"Navieros\"), a Florida corporation, entered a fixed time\r\n\ncharter party with the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS on a standard New\r\n\nYork Produce Exchange form through a ship's broker, Jan Gisholt\r\n\nShipping, Inc., also of Florida. According to the charter\r\n\nparty, the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS was owned by Royal United\r\n\nShipping, Inc. (\"Royal United\"), and was registered in the West\r\n\nIndies. During this litigation it was established that,\r\n\ndespite this written representation, the vessel was actually\r\n\n1.  A \"charter party\" is \"a specialized form of contract for\r\nthe hire of an entire ship, specified by name.\" 2 Schoenbaum,\r\nAdmiralty &amp; Maritime Law\r                                    S 11-1, at 169 (2d ed. 1994). A \"time\r\ncharter party,\" one of several different types of charter\r\nparties, is a contract \"to use a ship in order to ship goods\r\nfor a specific period of time.\"   Id. S 11-5, at 178. Under\r\nsuch agreements, \"[t]he carrier makes the ship's capacity\r\navailable to the time charterer for this purpose. The\r\ncharterer bears the expenses connected with each voyage and\r\npays hire to the carrier based upon the time the ship is under\r\ncharter.\"  Id.\r\n    A charter party is \"fixed\" when there is \"a meeting of the\r\nminds, evidenced by the parties' communications, on the\r\nsignificant 'main terms' of a charter.\"  Id. S 11-2, at 172.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nowned by Vasilia, Inc. (\"Vasilia\"), a corporation with close\r\n\nlinks to Royal United.\r\n\n          Navieros chartered the vessel for two round-trips\r\n\nbetween Florida and Guatemala, with an option for a third\r\n\nround-trip, for a total engagement of about 27 days, at $2,300\r\n\nper day. Navieros intended to ship, on behalf of various\r\n\nclients, \"general merchandise, freight [of] all kinds,\r\n\nelectrical material, toys, hardware, food stuffs, . . . heavy\r\n\nequipment, . . . road building construction-type machinery,\r\n\nand . . . used vehicles.\" The time charter party stated that\r\n\ndelivery of the vessel to Navieros, the charterer, was to occur\r\n\nupon the vessel's arrival at the pilot station in Port\r\n\nEverglades, Florida, where Navieros's cargo was to be loaded.\r\n\nThe charter party stated that this would happen \"any time, day,\r\n\nnight\" after the fixing of the charter on March 28.\r\n\n          At approximately 2:00 in the afternoon on March 28,\r\n\nKenneth Coleman, the President of Navieros, boarded the vessel\r\n\nat dock in Miami, about 30 miles from Port Everglades. Coleman\r\n\ndiscussed the stowage plan with the captain, Dusan Jeftimiades,\r\n\nand with Michael Psarellis and instructed the captain to berth\r\n\n2.  Vasilia is a Liberian corporation with its principal place\r\nof business in Greece. Steven Psarellis, a Louisiana attorney,\r\nis described as the attorney-in-fact for the corporation.\r\n    Royal United is a Delaware corporation. Vasilia Psarellis,\r\nSteven's mother (and the person after whom the vessel is\r\nnamed), is the president. Her other son, Michael, is the\r\n\"principal operating manager.\"\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nat Pier 19 when he arrived at Port Everglades, instead of at\r\n\nthe pilot station.\r\n\n          The next day, the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS left its berth\r\n\nin Miami, apparently headed for Port Everglades. The only\r\n\ndeviation from the written agreement that Coleman had mentioned\r\n\ninvolved the berthing of the ship at a different point in Port\r\n\nEverglades, but the ship never reached Port Everglades.\r\n\n          The vessel experienced problems with its bridge\r\n\ntachometer and stopped for repairs at Bicentennial Park, still\r\n\ninside the Port of Miami.  Kenneth Coleman and his brother\r\n\nWilliam, also a Navieros officer, visited the ship four or five\r\n\ntimes over the next week. During this time, Navieros also\r\n\nordered fuel for the vessel, confirmed its reservation of the\r\n\nberth space at Port Everglades, and issued the necessary check\r\n\nin payment of United States customs dues.\r\n\n          During this unexpected delay, Royal United, the\r\n\nputative owner of the vessel, entered into a second time\r\n\ncharter party with Comet Lines Agency, Inc. (\"Comet\"), which\r\n\nwas unaware of the charter party with Navieros. Royal United\r\n\napparently believed at this time that the Navieros charter\r\n\nparty had not yet been fixed. The Comet charter party,\r\n\nbrokered by Americana Marine Services, began on April 4 and was\r\n\n3.  The record does not reveal the name of the company which\r\nmade these repairs. We infer that it was Motor-Services Hugo\r\nStamp, Inc., one of the two repair company appellants denied\r\nintervention in this case.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nto last for a period of 30 days. It brought a more lucrative\r\n\ncharter rate, $2,630 per day, than did the Navieros charter.\r\n\nComet intended primarily to carry cargo between San Juan,\r\n\nPuerto Rico and Venezuela. Since the vessel was in Miami at\r\n\nthe start of the charter, Comet arranged to have some\r\n\nVenezuela-bound cargo brought down from Jacksonville and loaded\r\n\nthere; Comet's intention was to have the vessel proceed to San\r\n\nJuan where more cargo would be loaded, and then to sail to\r\n\nVenezuela.\r\n\n          Upon the vessel's arrival in the port of San Juan on\r\n\nApril 13, however, the United States Coast Guard detained the\r\n\nvessel for a litany of safety violations and ordered it not to\r\n\nproceed to sea without Coast Guard approval.\r\n\n          Navieros subsequently learned that the vessel was\r\n\nbeing detained in Puerto Rico. On April 18, while the ship was\r\n\nstill in detention, Navieros filed a complaint in the federal\r\n\ndistrict court in Puerto Rico, initiating this litigation.\r\n\nInitially, the action was \r                                     in \r                                        rem against the vessel to enforce\r\n\n4.  The violations of the  International \r                                                      Convention  \r                                                                 for \r                                                                      the\r\nSafety of Life at Sea\r                                , 32 U.S.T. 47, T.I.A.S. No. 9700 (1974),\r\nlisted in the Coast Guard citation include: intoxication of\r\nthe master (Jeftimiades); inability of intoxicated master to\r\nproduce the necessary documents and certificates to Coast Guard\r\nofficers; non-compliance with minimum safe manning certificate;\r\nvarious problems with electrical wiring in the engine room;\r\nlighting in engine room not covered; watertight door in engine\r\nroom could not be closed due to installation of cable through\r\ndoorway; non-working aft port fire hose; unreadable fire\r\ncontrol plan; absence of dangerous cargo manifest for dangerous\r\ncargo on board; and carbon dioxide alarm system disconnected\r\nand activation pull cable not labeled.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nan alleged maritime lien based on the breach of a time charter\r\n\nagreement.\r\n\n          Later that same day, April 18, the district court, in\r\n\nan ex  parte proceeding, ordered the arrest of the vessel\r\n\npursuant to Rule C of the Supplemental Rules for Certain\r\n\nAdmiralty and Maritime Claims to the Federal Rules of Civil\r\n\nProcedure. Rule C allows the holder of a maritime lien to\r\n\nproceed in rem against the vessel that is the subject of the\r\n\nlien. In its order, the court stated that Navieros had made a\r\n\nprima facie showing of a maritime lien against the vessel.\r\n\n          Vasilia, as claimant of the  in  rem defendant M/V\r\n\nVASILIA EXPRESS, filed a motion for a post-arrest hearing on\r\n\nApril 23. Vasilia claimed that the arrest of the vessel was\r\n\nimproper because Navieros had no maritime lien. The only\r\n\nargument advanced by Vasilia at this point against the\r\n\nexistence of a lien was that the charter party between Navieros\r\n\nand Royal United had not been fixed. A charterer's maritime\r\n\nlien, a right derived from a contract, will not arise in the\r\n\nabsence of a fixed charter party, that is, in the absence of an\r\n\nenforceable contract.\r\n\n          In response to Vasilia's motion, Navieros amended its\r\n\ncomplaint on April 24 and moved alternatively for attachment of\r\n\n5.  Later, Vasilia would argue that there was no lien because\r\nthe contract was still executory at the time of the breach;\r\nmaritime liens do not arise from the breach of an executory\r\ncharter party.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthe vessel under Supplemental Rule B. Navieros also added\r\n\nRoyal United as an \r                              in \r                                 personam defendant. One of the pertinent\r\n\ndifferences between Rules C and B is that the latter does not\r\n\nrequire the existence of a maritime lien. Rule B allows an\r\n\nadmiralty plaintiff to acquire quasi in rem jurisdiction over\r\n\na defendant by attaching his property in the district; this\r\n\napproach is available only if the defendant \"shall not be found\r\n\nwithin the district.\" As required by Rule B, Navieros\r\n\nsubmitted an affidavit stating that, to the best of its\r\n\nknowledge, after a diligent search, defendant Royal United\r\n\ncould not be found within the district.\r\n\n          The court ordered attachment of the vessel pursuant\r\n\nto Rule B on April 29. In its May 1, 1996 answer to Navieros's\r\n\namended complaint, Vasilia reiterated that Navieros had no\r\n\nmaritime lien because there was no fixed charter party.\r\n\nVasilia also filed a counterclaim against Navieros for wrongful\r\n\narrest, and asserted that if the court should find that there\r\n\nwas a fixed charter party, then the dispute \"would be subject\r\n\nto compulsory arbitration.\" Vasilia did not move to compel\r\n\narbitration at this time.\r\n\n          The next day, April 30, Vasilia filed a \"request for\r\n\namended process of arrest\" in which it asserted that the Rule\r\n\nB attachment was wrongly ordered by the court because Vasilia\r\n\nhad designated an agent in the district upon whom process could\r\n\nbe served on behalf of Vasilia. Navieros then amended its\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncomplaint again to name Vasilia as \r                                              in \r                                                 personam defendant along\r\n\nwith Royal United. Trial ultimately proceeded on this second\r\n\namended complaint.\r\n\n          That same day, the court held a hearing and ordered\r\n\nthe case expedited. The court accelerated discovery and set a\r\n\nMay 23 trial date. The court later explained, in its June 7\r\n\nmemorandum opinion, that this rushed schedule was necessary\r\n\nbecause the vessel had \"a fair market value of $500,000,\" it\r\n\n\"was accruing significant expenditures incidental to the\r\n\narrest,\" and there were \"liens or potential liens exceeding its\r\n\nfair market value.\" The court also denied Vasilia's motions\r\n\nto vacate the Rule C arrest of the vessel and the Rule B\r\n\nattachment of it. The court stated that the arrest could be\r\n\nlifted by the posting of a $200,000 bond. No bond was posted.\r\n\n          On May 8, Vasilia filed a \"second motion to vacate\r\n\narrest and attachment and for second post-arrest hearing.\"\r\n\nVasilia now claimed that \"there are new reasons\" showing that\r\n\nthe Rule C arrest was illegal. Vasilia argued that Navieros\r\n\nhad no maritime lien because the vessel had not been delivered\r\n\n6.  On the first day of trial, the court again expressed its\r\nconcern with the problems that would be caused by delay: \"It's\r\na vessel of marginal value in a marginal trade with charters\r\nand owners of marginal economic solvency and all that we're\r\ngoing to create [by transferring the case to arbitration] is a\r\nbigger problem for everybody here.\"\r\n\n7.  This motion and most subsequent submissions were filed by\r\nVasilia alone, not by Royal United or the vessel. Hence, we\r\noften describe the collective defendants as \"Vasilia.\"\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nto Navieros, the charter party was still executory, and a\r\n\nmaritime lien will not arise from the breach of an executory\r\n\ncharter party. Vasilia cited for the first time Navieros's\r\n\noft-repeated assertion in its pleadings that the vessel had not\r\n\nbeen delivered as required by the charter party. Both      in\r\n\npersonam defendants then waived the requirement that they be\r\n\nserved with process and waived any objections to lack of\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction. The court summarily denied Vasilia's\r\n\nmotion on May 20, three days before trial commenced.\r\n\n          On May 13, Comet and Transcaribbean Maritime Corp.\r\n\n(\"Transcaribbean\") filed motions to intervene as plaintiffs in\r\n\nthe lawsuit. Comet is the second charterer; like Navieros, it\r\n\npleaded a breach of contract claim. Transcaribbean is a San\r\n\nJuan-based ship's agent and stevedoring contractor which paid,\r\n\non behalf of the vessel, harbor and port dues, pilot fees, and\r\n\nother expenses incidental to the ship's arrival and its\r\n\nsubsequent detention in the Port of San Juan. On May 20, the\r\n\ncourt allowed both claimants to intervene.\r\n\n          On May 22, on the eve of trial, Captain Jeftimiades\r\n\nfiled a motion to intervene as plaintiff, asserting a maritime\r\n\nlien for unpaid seaman's wages. On May 23, the day the trial\r\n\nstarted, Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Co. (\"Gulf Coast\"), the holder\r\n\nof a first preferred mortgage on the vessel, filed a motion to\r\n\nintervene as plaintiff in order to request foreclosure.\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\n          At the start of trial, the court ruled from the bench\r\n\non the two motions to intervene. After establishing that\r\n\nneither Captain Jeftimiades nor his counsel were present in the\r\n\ncourtroom, the judge ascertained from Navieros's counsel that\r\n\nJeftimiades's counsel was aware that the trial was starting.\r\n\nThe court then denied Jeftimiades's motion to intervene,\r\n\nstating:\r\n\n          Well, the captain is not here. His lawyer\r\n          is not here. Everybody is aware of the\r\n          fact that this case was being tried or\r\n          there was no reason not to know.\r\n          Therefore, at this point in time I am\r\n          denying for obvious lack of interest, they\r\n          are not here, the motion for permission to\r\n          intervene . . . .\r\n\nGulf Coast's motion to intervene was granted.\r\n\n          On this first day of trial, the court also ruled from\r\n\nthe bench on Vasilia's motion to compel arbitration, filed the\r\n\nday before. Vasilia's motion relied on an arbitration clause\r\n\nin the charter party between Navieros and Royal United (and on\r\n\na similar clause in the charter party with Comet). The motion\r\n\ncame two days after Vasilia's pre-trial concession regarding\r\n\nthe existence of a fixed charter with Navieros, a point Vasilia\r\n\nhad been contesting until then.\r\n\n          The court characterized this motion as among the\r\n\n\"strongest\" of the many pre-trial motions, but nevertheless\r\n\ndenied it. The court stated that Vasilia had conducted itself\r\n\nthus far in the litigation in a manner inconsistent with a\r\n\ndesire to enforce a contractual arbitration clause, and that it\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nhad \"by its actions moved away from its right to arbitrate.\"\r\n\nSending the case to arbitration, said the judge, would also, by\r\n\ncausing further delay, increase the costs attendant to the\r\n\ncontinuing arrest of the vessel, and \"create a bigger problem\r\n\nfor everybody here.\"\r\n\n          Because Vasilia admitted the existence and breach of\r\n\na charter party with Navieros, trial proceeded on the question\r\n\nof damages alone. Vasilia argued that Navieros had no right to\r\n\narrest the vessel under Rule C or to attach it under Rule B.\r\n\nMoreover, Navieros's resort to these procedures, Vasilia said\r\n\nin its counterclaim, had caused Vasilia to breach its contract\r\n\nwith Comet and to incur other liabilities. Relying on the\r\n\nvenerable executory contract doctrine, Vasilia argued that the\r\n\nRule C arrest was improper because the vessel had not yet been\r\n\ndelivered to Navieros at the time of the breach, and the\r\n\ncharter party was still executory. Consequently, argued\r\n\nVasilia, Navieros had no maritime lien and its resort to Rule\r\n\nC was invalid. Rule B attachment was also invalid, argued\r\n\nVasilia, because this measure may only be invoked where the\r\n\n8.  Had Vasilia filed the motion to compel arbitration earlier\r\nin the pleadings, stated the court, \"it would have been very\r\ndifficult not to grant it.\" Additionally, the court indicated\r\nthat, despite its belief that Vasilia had waived the right to\r\narbitration, it might have granted the motion if Vasilia, while\r\narguing the motion at trial, had expressed a willingness to\r\npost a $200,000 bond to release the vessel from arrest, thus\r\nhastening a conclusion to the expensive arrest. Vasilia's\r\ncounsel responded, however, that his client could not post such\r\na bond.\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\ndefendant cannot be found within the district, and Vasilia had\r\n\nappointed an agent within the district for service of process\r\n\non its behalf.\r\n\n            The trial concluded on May 29, and the court issued\r\n\nits written memorandum and order on June 7. The court upheld\r\n\nboth the Rule C arrest and the Rule B attachment. Rejecting\r\n\nVasilia's Rule C argument, the court held that the vessel was\r\n\neffectively delivered to Navieros prior to the breach when\r\n\nColeman boarded the vessel in Miami. The court stated:\r\n\n          Although the vessel was to be technically\r\n          delivered at the pilot station in Port\r\n          Everglades, a location less than thirty\r\n          nautical miles away, due to the proximity\r\n          of the locations, the master and Mr.\r\n          Psarellis accepted Kenneth Coleman's\r\n          instructions to proceed further to Port\r\n          Everglades and, with a pilot, to berth at\r\n          Pier 19 in Port Everglades for loading.\r\n          The vessel was, for all purposes,\r\n          delivered to the charterer when Mr.\r\n          Psarellis and the ship's master accepted\r\n          Mr. Coleman's verbal instructions to\r\n          proceed under the charter party agreement\r\n          to Pier 19 at Port Everglades for loading.\r\n\nThe court also upheld the Rule B attachment, rejecting\r\n\nVasilia's argument that the attachment was improper because\r\n\nVasilia had appointed an agent for service of process within\r\n\nthe district. The court emphasized that Vasilia, a Liberian\r\n\ncorporation, had had no corporate presence whatsoever in the\r\n\ndistrict. The court stated that the eleventh hour appointment\r\n\nby Vasilia of counsel as local agent for service of process was\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\na \"strategic appointment directed at defeating the necessity of\r\n\nthe rule\" and could not be used to elude attachment.\r\n\n          The court entered judgment against the vessel and the\r\n\ntwo in personam defendants: for Navieros in the amount of\r\n\n$182,952; for Comet in the amount of $100,312.13; for\r\n\nTranscaribbean in the amount of $24,777.26; and for Gulf Coast\r\n\nin the amount of $285,428.91. The total of the judgments\r\n\nagainst Vasilia amounted to $593,470.30. The court ordered\r\n\nthat the vessel be sold by the United States Marshal at auction\r\n\nto satisfy these judgments.\r\n\n          The court ruled that Gulf Coast had complied with the\r\n\nrequirements of the Ship Mortgage Act, 46 U.S.C. S 30101   et\r\n\nseq., and had successfully shown that it had a preferred\r\n\nmortgage. The court, however, did not rank the four judgment\r\n\nwinners. Nor did the court know, at the time the judgments\r\n\nwere handed down, how much money would be available from the\r\n\neventual sale of the vessel to satisfy the judgments.\r\n\n          Several more would-be plaintiffs moved to intervene\r\n\nas a matter of right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) after the\r\n\ndecision was handed down; these motions were denied. We\r\n\ndiscuss only those parties that appeal. The first of these\r\n\npost-judgment movants was Motor-Services Hugo Stamp, Inc.\r\n\n9.  We note that Gulf Coast's compliance with the provisions of\r\nthe Ship Mortgage Act was the subject of considerable dispute\r\nin the district court. That question, however, is not before\r\nus.\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\n(\"Motor-Services\"), a Florida-based ship repair and supply\r\n\ncompany which sought to intervene on June 7, the day judgment\r\n\nissued. Motor-Services asserted a maritime lien in the amount\r\n\nof $76,460.55 for unpaid receivables due for work done on the\r\n\nM/V VASILIA EXPRESS and materials supplied to it between\r\n\nFebruary 28 and March 29, 1996. The second post-judgment\r\n\nmovant was Coastal Ship Repair, Inc. (\"Coastal\"), a Louisiana\r\n\ncorporation which sought intervention on June 11. Coastal,\r\n\ntoo, asserted a maritime lien for moneys due for work performed\r\n\nand materials supplied the vessel, from May 2, 1995, through\r\n\nJuly 1, 1995. Coastal asserted a lien in the amount of\r\n\n$144,800. The court denied these two late motions on July 3 by\r\n\nseparate written orders.\r\n\n          The public auction was held July 2, but the required\r\n\nminimum bid of $400,000 was not achieved. A second auction was\r\n\nheld on July 23 with a lower minimum of $300,000. Gulf Coast,\r\n\nthe first preferred mortgage holder, bought the ship for\r\n\n$300,000. After confirmation of the sale, Jeftimiades,\r\n\nCoastal, and Motor-Services moved to stay disbursement of the\r\n\nproceeds until final resolution of these appeals. This motion\r\n\nwas granted, and the proceeds of the sale, less certain\r\n\nadministrative costs and fees, remain in an escrow account\r\n\npending resolution of the appeal.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Vasilia appeals on four grounds: (1) that the arrest\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nand attachment were invalid; (2) that the motion to compel\r\n\narbitration was wrongly denied; (3) that the court awarded both\r\n\ncharterers, Navieros and Comet, excessive damages; and (3) that\r\n\nthe court improperly pierced Vasilia's corporate veil. We\r\n\nresolve Vasilia's claims without the benefit of briefs from\r\n\nNavieros  or any of the other plaintiffs in whose favor\r\n\njudgment was entered.\r\n\nA.  Arrest and Attachment\r\n\n          Vasilia admitted before trial that it was in breach\r\n\nof the charter party with Navieros. The main issue on appeal\r\n\nis whether Navieros was entitled to take the measures it took\r\n\nprior to trial regarding the vessel. Vasilia's position\r\n\nremains that (1) Navieros had no maritime lien and thus no\r\n\nright to arrest and (2) Vasilia had appointed an agent within\r\n\nthe district for service of process on its behalf and so\r\n\nattachment was improper. Vasilia apparently infers that\r\n\nNavieros is responsible for the chain of events set in motion\r\n\nby the subsequent unavailability of the vessel:    i.e., the\r\n\nbreach of the Comet charter; Gulf Coast's decision to bring its\r\n\nforeclosure action; and the need for Transcaribbean to incur\r\n\nthe custodial costs associated with the arrest of the vessel.\r\n\n10.  Navieros, the original plaintiff in this action, chose not\r\nto participate in this appeal. Navieros did not file a brief\r\nand did not appear at oral argument. Presumably, Navieros\r\nconcluded that further participation in this litigation would\r\nbe fruitless given the $285,000 judgment awarded Gulf Coast on\r\nits preferred mortgage lien.\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nVasilia's position appears to be that Navieros should have\r\n\nbrought an in  personam suit against Vasilia for breach of\r\n\ncontract, rather than moving against the vessel under Rules C\r\n\nand B, and that this would not have resulted in the same domino\r\n\neffect.\r\n\n          Navieros first invoked Rule C, seeking the arrest of\r\n\nthe vessel on the basis of an asserted maritime lien. After\r\n\nVasilia challenged the existence of a maritime lien, Navieros\r\n\nmoved alternatively for Rule B attachment.       The two\r\n\nstrategies, though similar in effect, are based on entirely\r\n\ndifferent theories.\r\n\n          An in rem action [under Rule C] differs\r\n          from maritime attachment [under Rule B] in\r\n          that an in rem action is brought against\r\n          the vessel itself as defendant. By\r\n          contrast, a vessel is attached only as an\r\n          auxiliary to an in personam claim because\r\n          the vessel is property belonging to the\r\n          defendant.\r\n\n2 Schoenbaum, supra, S 21-3, at 478-79. The district court\r\n\nordered both Rule C arrest and Rule B attachment of the vessel,\r\n\nand ruled both procedures proper in its written opinion.\r\n\nVasilia challenges both rulings on appeal. Either procedure\r\n\nstanding alone would have been sufficient to enable Navieros to\r\n\n11.  The two rules may be invoked simultaneously.  See, e.g.\r                                                                        ,\r\nAmstar Corp.\r                        v. \r                           S/S Alexandros T.\r                                            , 664 F.2d 904, 906 (4th Cir.\r\n1981); 2 Schoenbaum, supra, S 21-2, at 469 n.2, 470.\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\nensure the continued presence of the vessel in Puerto Rico\r\n\nwhile the litigation proceeded.\r\n\n1.  Arrest\r\n\n          The Rule C question is a close one, and it takes us\r\n\ninto waters uncharted by this circuit. In order to invoke Rule\r\n\nC to arrest a vessel, a plaintiff must have a valid maritime\r\n\nlien against the defendant's vessel.     See Bunn v.   Global\r\n\nMarine, Inc.\r                       , 428 F.2d 40, 48 n.10 (5th Cir. 1970) (\"a maritime\r\n\nlien is the foundation of a proceeding \r                                                  in \r                                                     rem\"); \r                                                            Rainbow Line,\r\n\nInc. v. M/V \r                        Tequila, 480 F.2d 1024, 1028 (2d Cir. 1973) (\" in\r\n\nrem jurisdiction in the admiralty exists only to enforce a\r\n\nmaritime lien\"); 2 Schoenbaum, supra, S 21-3, at 478-79. We\r\n\naffirm the district court holding that Navieros had a maritime\r\n\nlien. The Rule C arrest was thus valid.\r\n\n          Under the executory contract doctrine, charterers\r\n\nhave no maritime lien until performance of the charter contract\r\n\n12.  It is unclear from the record whether (and for how long)\r\nthe United States Coast Guard detention of the vessel in Puerto\r\nRico, effected on April 14, would have also detained the\r\nvessel. This could be an important matter because Vasilia's\r\ncounterclaim -- based on the claim that Navieros wrongfully\r\ndeprived it of the use of its vessel -- would be entirely moot\r\nif we could determine with any certainty that the Coast Guard\r\ndetention would have continued at least through June 7, the\r\ndate judgment was entered for Navieros. If this were the case,\r\nany wrongful arrest or wrongful attachment would likely be\r\nharmless error, cured by the judgment. The district court\r\nopinion, issued on June 7, does state \"[a]s of this date, the\r\nvessel is still detained at the port of San Juan, Puerto Rico,\r\nby virtue of the U.S. Coast Guard prohibition for the cited\r\nsafety violations.\" But there is no evidence in the record\r\nbefore us on this point. In the absence of such evidence, we\r\naddress Vasilia's arguments on their merits.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\nbegins.

The district court relied\r\n\nheavily on the reasoning in      E.A.S.T., where the court\r\n\ndistinguished between voyage charters and time charters as to\r\n\nwhen the contract is no longer executory (and, consequently, as\r\n\nto when a maritime lien arises). With voyage charters, whether\r\n\ncontrol over the cargo shifted to the vessel will most likely\r\n\ndetermine whether a maritime lien exists.   E.A.S.T., 673 F.\r\n\nSupp. at 802-04. With time charters, however, a maritime lien\r\n\nmay arise even before control of the cargo shifts to the\r\n\nvessel.  Id.;  see also Rainbow \r                                             Line, 480 F.2d at 1027 n.6\r\n\n(noting that cargo need not be loaded for time charter to lose\r\n\nexecutory status).\r\n\n          This distinction is sensible because under a time\r\n\ncharter the shipowner agrees to put his vessel, master, and\r\n\ncrew to the service of the time charterer for a named period.\r\n\nE.A.S.T., 673 F. Supp. at 802. The time charterer must begin\r\n\nhis performance \"well before cargo is, if ever, loaded on the\r\n\nvessel -- by paying hire, appointing and funding a port agent,\r\n\n13.  A \"voyage charter\" is a contract of affreightment under\r\nwhich the carrier, who either owns or manages a ship, agrees to\r\ntransport a certain amount of the charterer's cargo (\"freight\")\r\nfrom one port to another. The charterer pays for the shipment\r\nof freight by the voyage. 2 Schoenbaum, \r                                                   supra, S 11-4, at 175-\r\n76.\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\nand arranging and paying for pilotage, tug assistance and line\r\n\nhandlers and all else necessary to berth the vessel in order to\r\n\nload cargo.\"  Id. at 803.\r\n\n          Here, the time charter form agreement specified that:\r\n\n          Vessel to be placed at the disposal of the\r\n          Charterers, at Delivery Arrival Pilot\r\n          Station Port Everglades Any Time, Day,\r\n          Night . . . .\r\n\nThe president of the plaintiff charterer boarded the vessel 30\r\n\nmiles from Port Everglades, and changed the instructions as to\r\n\nthe destination (berthing at Pier 19 at Port Everglades instead\r\n\nof at the pilot station). The vessel proceeded until it\r\n\nexperienced mechanical problems and it stopped for repairs\r\n\nshort of Port Everglades. While it was undergoing repairs, the\r\n\ncharterer boarded the vessel four or five times, ordered fuel\r\n\nfor the vessel, confirmed its reservation of a berth space, and\r\n\nissued a check to pay U.S. Customs fees.\r\n\n          Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the\r\n\nexperienced trial judge erred in concluding that there was\r\n\nsufficient delivery of the vessel to the charterer, Navieros,\r\n\nand sufficient performance of the contract that the charter was\r\n\nno longer \"executory.\" Accordingly, there was a maritime lien\r\n\nand the Rule C arrest was proper.\r\n\n2.  Attachment\r\n\n14.  We reach this conclusion, as the district judge also did,\r\nnotwithstanding Navieros's claim in its pleadings that the\r\nvessel had not been delivered to it.\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                         21\r\r\n\n          We also affirm the Rule B attachment because Vasilia\r\n\nwas not \"within the district\" at the time attachment was sought\r\n\nand granted.\r\n\n          On April 30 Vasilia submitted to the court a copy of\r\n\na letter saying that Vasilia had appointed an agent for service\r\n\nin the district. The letter, dated April 26, 1996, states in\r\n\nits entirety:\r\n\n               This is to confirm that owners are\r\n          authorizing CALVESBERT and BROWN as\r\n          attorneys to accept service of process on\r\n          behalf of VASILIA INC. who is the owner of\r\n          M/V VASILIA EXPRESS which was named in a\r\n          suit filed by Navieros Interamericanos in\r\n          Federal District Court in Puerto Rico.\r\n\nThere is no addressee designated on the face of the letter.\r\n\nThere is evidence at the top of the page that the letter had\r\n\nbeen sent via fax to the recipient on April 29.\r\n\n          Rule B allows the attachment of a vessel or other\r\n\ntangible property under certain circumstances to gain \r                                                                 quasi \r                                                                       in\r\n\nrem jurisdiction over a defendant. A Rule B attachment may\r\n\nonly proceed when the defendant is not \"found within the\r\n\ndistrict.\" The case law makes it clear that:\r\n\n          whether or not [a foreign defendant] can\r\n          be found within the district presents a\r\n          two-pronged inquiry: first whether it can\r\n          be found within the district in terms of\r\n          jurisdiction, and second, if so, whether\r\n          it can be found for service of process.\r\n               The first inquiry is directed to\r\n          whether or not the respondent is present\r\n          within the district by reason of\r\n          activities on its behalf by authorized\r\n          agents so as to subject it to [the\r\n          district court's] jurisdiction in      in\r\n\n                            -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\n          personam proceedings. If not, then the\r\n          respondent cannot be found within the\r\n          district and this ground alone would be\r\n          sufficient to support the attachment.\r\n               Even if the foreign respondent be\r\n          found within the district in a\r\n          jurisdictional sense, its property is not\r\n          immunized from attachment. The second\r\n          question . . . then presents itself.\r\n          Could the respondent be found within the\r\n          district with due diligence for service in\r\n          the libel proceeding?\r\n\nUnited \r                   States v. Cia. \r                                  Naviera \r                                          Continental \r                                                      S.A., 178 F. Supp.\r\n\n561, 563-64 (S.D.N.Y. 1959) (footnote omitted). If the\r\n\nrespondent can be found within the district, then attachment\r\n\nmay not proceed.\r\n\n          As to the first inquiry, it is undisputed that by\r\n\npurposefully sending its vessel into Puerto Rico, Vasilia\r\n\nsubjected itself to personal jurisdiction in that district. As\r\n\nto the second inquiry, Vasilia argues that the attachment was\r\n\nwrongful because it had appointed an agent for service of\r\n\nprocess in the district. But the fact is Vasilia's purported\r\n\nappointment of the agent came, at the earliest, on April 26,\r\n\ntwo days after Navieros moved for an order of attachment (and\r\n\nafter Navieros filed an affidavit, as required by Supplemental\r\n\nRule B, saying Navieros had been unable to find the defendant\r\n\nwithin the district).  \r\n\n15.  Navieros's affidavit says that Navieros could not find\r\nRoyal \r                  United within the district. No mention was made of\r\nVasilia, the actual owner of the vessel. However, Navieros is\r\nnot to blame for this. Royal United held itself out as the\r\nowner of the vessel in the charter party agreement with\r\nNavieros. The two entities are obviously closely related.\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\n          The district court was not unjustified in stating\r\n\nthat Vasilia's argument would eviscerate the time-honored\r\n\nprocess of maritime attachment. If we were to accept Vasilia's\r\n\nposition, a defendant who was otherwise safely outside the\r\n\nservice power of the district could effectively avoid Rule B\r\n\nattachment by waiting until after the plaintiff filed a Rule B\r\n\nmotion to designate an agent for service.\r\n\n          Nor was Vasilia, simply by virtue of its subsequent\r\n\nappearance in this action, entitled to dissolution of the\r\n\nattachment.  Swift v. Compania \r                                           Colombiana, 339 U.S. 684, 693\r\n\n(1950).  But Vasilia was not without options. Prior to trial,\r\n\nVasilia had the opportunity, pursuant to Supplemental Rule\r\n\nWhatever prejudice Vasilia may have suffered by virtue of the\r\nfact that Navieros did not submit an affidavit stating that\r\nVasilia could not be found within the district properly falls\r\non Vasilia.\r\n\n16.  Moreover, the evidence defendant relies on here is simply\r\na letter from defendant to an unstated addressee purporting to\r\n\"confirm\" that Calvesbert &amp; Brown has been authorized to accept\r\nservice of process on Vasilia's behalf. This letter cannot be\r\nenough to establish presence in the district within the meaning\r\nof Rule B. The letter was not published and presumably neither\r\nNavieros nor the court knew (nor could have known) about the\r\narrangement between Vasilia and its lawyers until after Vasilia\r\nsubmitted a copy of the letter to the court.\r\n\n17.  Rule B, the modern codification of the ancient right of\r\nforeign attachment in admiralty,     see  Swift v.   Compania\r\nColombiana, 339 U.S. 684, 693 (1950), has two recognized\r\npurposes: (1) to assure defendant's appearance and (2) to\r\nassure satisfaction in case the suit is successful.

Post-attachment appearance may\r\nmoot the first purpose but it does not address the second\r\npurpose.\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\nE(5)(a), to post a bond of $200,000 in order to obtain the\r\n\nrelease of the vessel. Vasilia declined to exercise this\r\n\nright.\r\n\nB.  Arbitration\r\n\n          The district court found that Vasilia had waived its\r\n\ncontractual right to arbitration by participating in the\r\n\nlitigation for over a month before filing a motion, one day\r\n\nbefore the start of trial, to compel arbitration. Vasilia\r\n\nprotests that this ruling was error, but its arguments are not\r\n\npersuasive.\r\n\n          Vasilia complains that it could not have moved to\r\n\ncompel arbitration earlier because it was not until two days\r\n\nbefore the start of trial that Vasilia admitted the existence\r\n\nof the charter party under which the right to arbitration was\r\n\nestablished. Indeed, Vasilia did assert, at various stages of\r\n\nthe pleadings, that, if the court should determine the\r\n\nexistence of a charter party, then the case should be removed\r\n\nto arbitration. Had it moved for arbitration earlier, Vasilia\r\n\nsays, this step could have been interpreted as a concession\r\n\nthat the charter party was fixed, because the right to\r\n\narbitration comes from a clause in the charter party. By not\r\n\nmoving until the day before trial, on the other hand, Vasilia\r\n\nwas found to have waived the right. Vasilia says the district\r\n\ncourt's position presented Vasilia with a Hobson's choice\r\n\nbetween admission and waiver. Litigation frequently puts\r\n\n                            -25-\r                                         25\r\r\n\nparties to hard choices, particularly as to which of seemingly\r\n\ninconsistent theories to pursue. Vasilia is responsible for\r\n\nthe consequences of its choices.\r\n\n          Review of a district court's determination of waiver\r\n\nof the right to arbitration is plenary.

But in the unusual\r\n\ncontext of this litigation this delay was both long and\r\n\nprejudicial. The delay lasted from the filing of the complaint\r\n\nto the eve of trial. In the interim, in this expedited\r\n\nlitigation, the parties scrambled to prepare their cases for\r\n\ntrial, incurring expenses that would not have been occasioned\r\n\nby preparing for an arbitration. That is enough to show\r\n\nprejudice.  Menorah, 72 F.3d at 212.\r\n\n          The desirability of enforcing arbitration clauses is\r\n\nmuch recognized.

Vasilia\r\n\ndenied it had a valid charter party with Navieros up until the\r\n\neve of trial. It then switched positions, admitted the\r\n\nvalidity of the charter party, and sought to invoke arbitration\r\n\nunder the charter party. We agree with the district court that\r\n\nthis conduct amounted to a waiver.\r\n\nC.  Corporate Status of Vessel Owners\r\n\n          The Vasilia parties object to certain references in\r\n\nthe district court's opinion which, they believe, imply that\r\n\nthe court had pierced the corporate veils of Vasilia and Royal\r\n\nUnited, without conducting the proper legal analysis. They ask\r\n\nus to strike from the district court opinion these statements\r\n\n(and strike from the pleadings similar references made by\r\n\nplaintiffs). The argument is misplaced. It is a basic\r\n\n                            -27-\r                                         27\r\r\n\nprinciple of appellate jurisdiction that we review judgments,\r\n\nnot the editorial commentary in opinions.\r\n\n          To the extent that appellants mean to argue that the\r\n\ndistrict court's imputation of liability for the Navieros and\r\n\nComet judgments to the in personam defendants  -- Vasilia and\r\n\nRoyal United -- was erroneous, they also fail. There are two\r\n\ndistinct issues here: (1) whether Vasilia, the owner of the\r\n\nvessel, can be held liable for any damages apart from the\r\n\nproceeds obtained from the sale of the vessel, and (2) whether\r\n\nRoyal United, the shipping agent and a nominally separate\r\n\ncorporation, can be held so liable. We agree with the district\r\n\ncourt that the answer to both questions is yes.\r\n\n          The normal rule in admiralty actions \r                                                          in \r                                                             rem, such as\r\n\nthis one was initially, is that judgment creditors, absent\r\n\nservice of process on the vessel owner under Fed.

The district court's finding of liability against Vasilia\r\nand Royal United is limited to the judgments of the two\r\ncharterers, Navieros and Comet.

Here, both      in\r\n\npersonam defendants, Vasilia and Royal United, waived the\r\n\nrequirement of service of process and waived all defenses\r\n\nrelated to personal jurisdiction. They both appeared\r\n\nvoluntarily as  in personam defendants. We recognize, of\r\n\ncourse, that this was done for strategic reasons. The waivers\r\n\nand appearances came as part of defendants' ultimately\r\n\nunsuccessful campaign against Rule B attachment of the vessel\r\n\nby Navieros.\r\n\n          Nevertheless, Vasilia and Royal United must live with\r\n\nthe consequences of their choices. The waivers and appearances\r\n\nallowed the action to blossom into the full in personam case\r\n\nagainst the two defendants for breach of the charter party that\r\n\nNavieros had contemplated in its pleadings.

We are dubious about the practical significance of this\r\nmatter. It is clear that there will be nothing left of the\r\nproceeds for Vasilia.

Navieros\r\n\n          The breach of the Navieros time charter occurred when\r\n\nthe vessel was diverted to the use of Comet, after performance\r\n\nof the Navieros contract commenced but before Navieros's cargo\r\n\nwas loaded. Without noting the distinction, defendants assert\r\n\nthat the measure of damages should be that which is used in\r\n\ncases where the owner breached the charter party by repudiating\r\n\nit \r              before performance began\r                                      . The general rule for recovery in\r\n\nthat situation was stated long ago by Judge Learned Hand: \"the\r\n\nwithdrawal of the ship entitled [the charterer] prima facie to\r\n\ndamages measured by the difference between the hire reserved in\r\n\nthe charter and the hire necessary to secure such another\r\n\nbottom.\"  The \r                          Ada, 239 F. 363, 364 (S.D.N.Y. 1916), rev'd \r                                                                       on\r\n\nother grounds, 250 F. 194 (2d Cir. 1918); see also Sanders v.\r\n\nMunson, 74 F. 649, 651 (2d Cir. 1896); 2 Schoenbaum,   supra,\r\n\nS 11-17, at 204-05 (\"The charterer's damages for cancellation\r\n\nare equal to the difference between the contract hire in the\r\n\nAnd, indeed, neither Navieros nor Comet has appeared to defend\r\nthe judgments in their favor.

And so, we must visit this matter. We\r\nalso note that, as discussed later, the denial of intervention\r\nto Motor-Services and Coastal was in error, and accordingly\r\nthose two parties may have an interest in these damages awards.\r\n\n                            -30-\r                                         30\r\r\n\nbroken charter and the hire necessary to secure another\r\n\nvessel.\"). It seems reasonable to apply this general rule\r\n\nhere, provided the victim of the breach is also allowed to\r\n\nrecover out-of-pocket expenses incidental to preparing for the\r\n\narrival of the ship for loading.\r\n\n          Inherent in that rule, of course, is a duty of\r\n\nmitigation; the victim of the breach must make reasonable\r\n\nefforts to locate a substitute vessel.

If the charterer is unable to locate a\r\n\nsuitable substitute vessel, then the proper measure of damages\r\n\nfor the breach is its lost profits.

It is true that Navieros\r\n\nlearned about an available vessel and did consider using it in\r\n\nplace of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, but decided in the end that\r\n\nthis vessel was too slow.    Such a decision was within\r\n\nNavieros's rights. See \r                                   Sanders, 74 F. at 652 (charterer \"under\r\n\nno obligation to accept a slower and smaller vessel than the\r\n\n[originally chartered vessel] had been represented to be\").\r\n\nThe district court was not obliged to credit William Coleman's\r\n\ntestimony, but it is certainly not clear error for it to have\r\n\ndone so.\r\n\n          Even using the rule advocated by defendants,\r\n\ntherefore, the proper measure of damages for the breach here\r\n\n20.  Defendants claim that this alternate vessel would have\r\nbeen a suitable replacement, as its speed -- which William\r\nColeman stated to be 8 to 9 knots per hour -- was roughly the\r\nsame as the speed of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS. Coleman's\r\ndeposition, taken in context, reveals that his concern was with\r\nthe speed in relation to other costs.\r\n\n          The thing that made her unattractive was\r\n          her speed, okay, related to her\r\n          costs. . . .  Her speed, with the size tug\r\n          that they were talking about and the\r\n          barge, she would be offering you eight to\r\n          nine knots but the daily cost and the fuel\r\n          consumption was such that her per diem\r\n          cost was way high.\r\n\nWe are persuaded that Navieros's choice not to use this\r\nalternate vessel was not a violation of its duty to mitigate. \r\n\n                            -32-\r                                         32\r\r\n\nwas Navieros's lost profits.  The court purported to apply\r\n\nsuch a measure, but defendants argue that it awarded Navieros\r\n\n\"lost revenues\"  instead, a far more generous dollar amount.\r\n\nIndeed, the court's choice of words was at times confusing; for\r\n\ninstance, it titled the table of damages calculations \"Gross\r\n\nLoss of Revenue.\" We must look past the question of word\r\n\nchoice and determine if the correct measure was applied.\r\n\n          These are the components of damages awarded Navieros:\r\n\n          (1)  gross freight in the amount of\r\n               $67,000, returned to shippers upon\r\n               demand;\r\n\n          (2)  canceled bills of lading issued in\r\n               Guatemala, representing $118,000 of\r\n               freight charges for three voyages;\r\n\n          (3)  freight charges [of $71,175] on\r\n               southbound cargo received in Port\r\n               Everglades, eventually returned to\r\n               shippers;\r\n\n          (4)  net loss of $3,377 over $26,000 worth\r\n               of freight rerouted through another\r\n               steamship line providing service to\r\n               Guatemala.\r\n\nFrom this \"Gross Loss\" of $259,552, the court subtracted\r\n\n\"charter hire expense\" of $57,600 and \"fuel expense\" of\r\n\n21.  Profit is \"the excess of returns over expenditure in a\r\ntransaction.\"  Webster's \r                                      Third \r                                            New \r                                                International \r                                                               Dictionary\r\n1811 (6th ed. 1993).\r\n\n22.  Revenue is, in this context, \"the total income produced by\r\na given source.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary\r\n1942. Revenues are greater than profit; a portion of one's\r\nrevenues, in a successful venture, is profit.\r\n\n                            -33-\r                                         33\r\r\n\n$19,000. The \"Net Loss\" was $182,952, and the court awarded\r\n\ndamages in this amount.\r\n\n          That the court subtracted charter hire and fuel\r\n\nexpense from the sub-total seems to indicate that, despite its\r\n\nchoice of words, the court did not see the award as one of lost\r\n\n\"revenues\" per se.\r\n\n          However, a radically different conception of\r\n\nNavieros's lost profits is found in William Coleman's\r\n\ndeposition. Coleman stated that Navieros expected to make\r\n\n$28,500 in profits from the shipping of cargo under the M/V\r\n\nVASILIA EXPRESS charter (this estimate included the exercise by\r\n\nNavieros of its option on a third round-trip).\r\n\n          Kenneth Coleman also testified at trial that Navieros\r\n\ncharters approximately 50 voyages per year and that Navieros's\r\n\n1995 net profits were roughly $495,000. The average profit per\r\n\nvoyage is thus just under $10,000. Given this, it is hard to\r\n\nunderstand how the loss of the    three M/V VASILIA EXPRESS\r\n\nvoyages caused $182,952 in lost profits.\r\n\n          Because it is unclear on what basis the district\r\n\ncourt calculated lost profits, we vacate the damages award and\r\n\nremand the question of Navieros's damages to the district court\r\n\nfor clarification.\r\n\n2.  Comet\r\n\n                            -34-\r                                         34\r\r\n\n          Defendants challenge six of the thirteen components\r\n\nof the $100,312.13 award to Comet. They claim (1) that Comet\r\n\nshould not have been awarded the stevedoring fees ($4,500) and\r\n\nship's agency fees ($4,999.26) incurred at the port of origin,\r\n\nMiami, because Comet would have incurred these expenses even if\r\n\nthe charter had not been breached; (2) that the award of fuel\r\n\ncosts for both the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS ($5,312) and the\r\n\nreplacement vessel secured by Comet ($7,326) was duplicative;\r\n\nand (3) that the award of the entire cost of the substitute\r\n\nvessel ($15,000), along with the reimbursement of the M/V\r\n\nVASILIA EXPRESS charter hire ($39,450), was likewise\r\n\nduplicative. Defendants also argue that the district court\r\n\n\"failed to account for the fact that cargo problems were part\r\n\nof the reason why the U.S. Coast Guard initially detained the\r\n\nM/V VASILIA EXPRESS in Puerto Rico, which, along with the\r\n\narrest by Navieros, led to the vessel's inability to carry\r\n\nComet's cargo.\"\r\n\n          The final point borders on frivolous, in light of the\r\n\nnumerous vessel-related and captain-related deficiencies cited\r\n\n23.  We need not be detained by the district court's statement\r\nthat Comet's damages were \"announced as a stipulation of the\r\nparties.\" If this were so, of course, defendants would have no\r\nleg to stand on. But there was no such stipulation.\r\nDefendants simply stipulated that they would not challenge the\r\nadmission of certain documents Comet intended to use to prove\r\nits damages; they made clear their objections to the underlying\r\nmerits of the damages claims.\r\n\n                            -35-\r                                         35\r\r\n\nby the Coast Guard. See footnote 4 \r                                              supra. But the first three\r\n\nclaims have considerable merit.\r\n\n          The damages award included reimbursement for the\r\n\nstevedoring costs associated with transferring the cargo from\r\n\nthe M/V VASILIA EXPRESS to the replacement vessel. In light of\r\n\nthis, the award of costs for the original loading of the M/V\r\n\nVASILIA EXPRESS was inappropriate. The award of the\r\n\nstevedoring costs at the port of origin ($4,500) is thus\r\n\nvacated. Comet did not make a claim for reimbursement for any\r\n\nshipping agency fee for the replacement vessel, so there was no\r\n\ndouble dipping there. But that is also why the fee paid by\r\n\nComet at the port of origin ($4,999.26) is not recoverable:\r\n\nComet apparently incurred no additional shipping agency costs\r\n\nas a result of the breach. That award too is vacated.\r\n\n          There was excessive recovery for the fuel costs too.\r\n\nComet should pay only for the fuel used by the M/V VASILIA\r\n\nEXPRESS on the initial Miami-San Juan run, which was completed\r\n\nbefore the breach, but not for the additional fuel, if any,\r\n\nthat it deposited in that vessel's gas tanks in Miami in\r\n\nexpectation of the continuation of the voyage to Venezuela.\r\n\nComet is also entitled to differential money damages; that is,\r\n\nit should be reimbursed for that portion of the fuel purchased\r\n\nfor the replacement vessel that was in excess of the expected\r\n\ncost of fuel for the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, had the latter ship\r\n\nfulfilled its contractual obligations. These are calculations\r\n\n                            -36-\r                                         36\r\r\n\nthat are necessarily based on estimates and expectations. The\r\n\nrecord indicates that the replacement vessel consumed more fuel\r\n\nthan the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, but we are unable to glean\r\n\nprecise details about this or about whether the M/V VASILIA\r\n\nEXPRESS was left with any Comet-purchased fuel when detained\r\n\nand arrested in the Port of San Juan, and if so, how much. We\r\n\nthus vacate the two fuel cost awards ($5,312 &amp; $7,326) and\r\n\nremand to the district court for an amended award in light of\r\n\nthis discussion.\r\n\n          Comet was awarded excessive damages for charter hire\r\n\ntoo. Comet is entitled to differential damages. Where the\r\n\nsubstitute vessel costs less than the one originally chartered,\r\n\nthe charterer is entitled to a refund of the price paid for the\r\n\noriginal, but it should pay for the substitute. If the\r\n\nreplacement costs more, the charterer should get reimbursed for\r\n\nthis difference in cost. It is difficult to imagine a\r\n\nsituation where the charterer would be entitled to a refund of\r\n\nthe original charter hire and an award of replacement costs.\r\n\nHere, Comet's replacement vessel ($15,000) cost less than the\r\n\nM/V VASILIA EXPRESS ($39,450). Comet therefore is entitled to\r\n\na refund of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS charter hire, but not to an\r\n\naward of costs for the hire of the replacement. The $15,000\r\n\naward is thus vacated.\r\n\n                            III.\r\n\n          We turn to the appeals of the various would-be\r\n\n                            -37-\r                                         37\r\r\n\nclaimants whose motions for intervention were denied, and who\r\n\nthus missed out on the chance to compete for a share of the\r\n\nproceeds.

We conclude that the district court\r\n\nproperly exercised its discretion in denying Captain\r\n\nJeftimiades's attempted intervention, but that it abused its\r\n\ndiscretion in denying the attempted interventions of Motor-\r\n\nServices and Coastal.\r\n\nA.  Captain Jeftimiades\r\n\n          Captain Jeftimiades, asserting a maritime lien for\r\n\nunpaid seaman's wages, moved to intervene a day before the\r\n\nstart of trial. The district judge denied Jeftimiades's motion\r\n\nfrom the bench on the first day of trial after learning that\r\n\nneither the captain nor his attorney were present in the\r\n\ncourtroom. Unlike the motions of Coastal and Motor-Services,\r\n\nthe captain's motion was not denied on timeliness grounds;\r\n\nindeed, the judge indicated that he probably would have allowed\r\n\nintervention had the captain or his attorney been present at\r\n\nthe start of trial.\r\n\n          The judge carefully determined that the captain's\r\n\nattorney had been duly informed of the trial date before\r\n\n25.  Motor-Services, alone among the post-judgment movants, did\r\nnot specify in its motion that it was seeking intervention as\r\nof right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), as opposed to permissive\r\nintervention under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). But Motor-Services\r\ncaptioned the motion as one to intervene \"as a matter of\r\nright,\" and so we give it the benefit of the doubt.\r\n\n                            -39-\r                                         39\r\r\n\nannouncing that he was denying the motion. Jeftimiades does\r\n\nnot argue on appeal that his counsel had not been informed of\r\n\nthe May 23 trial date; he simply states that counsel\r\n\n\"erroneously thought the trial date was May 30th\" and that he\r\n\nwas in New Jersey on May 23 and could not have appeared.\r\n\n          Jeftimiades argues that his counsel's associate was\r\n\navailable to represent the captain and that the court should\r\n\nhave requested that this associate appear on the captain's\r\n\nbehalf. However, the judge was not told that counsel was out\r\n\nof the Commonwealth, and, while the judge certainly could have\r\n\ninquired further into the matter if he wished, he was not\r\n\nobliged to do so.\r\n\n          Captain Jeftimiades also argues that, as a seaman, he\r\n\nis a ward of the court who is entitled to greater protection\r\n\nthan the average intervenor. Courts have allowed seamen to\r\n\navoid rules of common law which affect them particularly\r\n\nharshly because of their vocation. This is true where a rule\r\n\nof law has especially harsh results on a seaman because he is\r\n\na seaman\r                   . For instance, in Socony-Vacuum Oil Company\r                                                                v. \r                                                                   Smith,\r\n\n305 U.S. 424, 430-31 (1939), the leading case cited by\r\n\nJeftimiades, the Supreme Court was faced with the question of\r\n\nwhether a seaman who had used a dangerous appliance on board\r\n\ncould have his claim barred by the doctrine of assumption of\r\n\nrisk. The Court cautioned against the application of the\r\n\ndoctrine in admiralty cases because seamen often have fewer\r\n\n                            -40-\r                                         40\r\r\n\nalternatives than do land-based workers, and are often in less\r\n\nof a position to avoid dangerous situations. \r                                                        Id. This case is\r\n\neasily distinguishable. Captain Jeftimiades's failure to\r\n\nappear at trial through counsel is not explained by any special\r\n\ndisabilities attendant to his status as a sailor.\r\n\n          Jeftimiades does not address the issue of whether\r\n\nthere would be any prejudice to the existing plaintiffs if he\r\n\nwere allowed now to intervene. Clearly, there would be\r\n\nprejudice in light of the Coast Guard citation, which described\r\n\nJeftimiades as drunk at the time the vessel was detained.\r\n\nVasilia or some of the claimants might have attempted at trial\r\n\nto prove that the captain forfeited his maritime lien for\r\n\nwages.  Cf. Johnston v. M/V Dieu Si Bon, 1996 WL 866112 (W.D.\r\n\nWa. 1996) (question of fact whether seaman forfeited lien for\r\n\nwages by deserting ship). Of course, no one made this argument\r\n\nat trial because the captain's attempted intervention was\r\n\ndenied. Allowing Jeftimiades to intervene now would\r\n\nnecessitate ordering new proceedings in which the parties could\r\n\nattempt to make this claim. We recognize that the prejudice to\r\n\nJeftimiades is also severe, but he had the opportunity to make\r\n\n26.  His maritime lien is destroyed. It is a basic principle\r\nof admiralty law that execution of a maritime lien extinguishes\r\nall other liens on ship.   See, \r                                            e.g.,  Tamblyn v.

There was\r\n\nno abuse of discretion.\r\n\nB.  Motor-Services\r\n\n          Motor-Services moved to intervene on June 7, two\r\n\nweeks after the start of trial and the day on which the\r\n\ndistrict court issued its memorandum and order. This motion\r\n\nwas denied as untimely by written order on July 3. The court\r\n\nanalyzed the motion under what it called \"the First Circuit\r\n\nstandard of \r                       Banco Popular\r                                    .\" The timeliness standard applied in\r\n\nBanco Popular\r                        , 964 F.2d 1227, is derived from the Fifth Circuit\r\n\nopinion of Stallworth v. Monsanto \r                                              Company, 558 F.2d 257 (5th\r\n\nCir. 1977).  See Culbreath v.  Dukakis, 630 F.2d 15, 20 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1980) (adopting Stallworth test).\r\n\n          The four factors are: the length of time the would-\r\n\nbe intervenor knew or reasonably should have known that its\r\n\ninterest was imperilled before it moved to intervene; the\r\n\nforeseeable prejudice to the existing parties if intervention\r\n\nis granted; the prejudice to the would-be intervenor if\r\n\nintervention is denied; and exceptional circumstances which may\r\n\nmilitate against or in favor of allowing late intervention.\r\n\nBanco Popular, 964 F.2d at 1231.\r\n\n          The district court, weighing the matter by relying on\r\n\nthe facts as alleged by Motor-Services in the motion, first\r\n\ndetermined that the credit term extended to Vasilia by Motor-\r\n\nServices expired on April 29, and that from that date until\r\n\n                            -42-\r                                         42\r\r\n\nJune 7 Motor-Services sought payment of the overdue receivables\r\n\nonly by leaving telephone messages that went unreturned. The\r\n\nobvious implication of this finding (not stated by the court)\r\n\nis that Motor-Services sat on its rights when it should have\r\n\nbeen moving more decisively to protect its interest.\r\n\n          Moving on to the second factor, the court then noted\r\n\nthat the proposed intervention would prejudice the existing\r\n\nparties because:\r\n\n          intervention on the day judgment was\r\n          entered seeks to disturb the core of the\r\n          judgment. The M/V VASILIA EXPRESS is\r\n          appraised at $500,000 and the court has\r\n          recognized plaintiffs by judgment in the\r\n          aggregate amount of $593,469.39. The\r\n          realities of the public sale market for\r\n          vessels dictated that the public sale\r\n          ordered would have an initial bidding\r\n          price set at $400,000. Any sale proceeds\r\n          will not be enough to cover the existing\r\n          plaintiffs' rights. It is not fair to\r\n          reopen the case for late-comers to gain an\r\n          undue advantage under the circumstances.\r\n\nThe court next found that no prejudice would inure to Motor-\r\n\nServices as a result of the denial of the motion because Motor-\r\n\nServices had waived its maritime lien by relying on the credit\r\n\nof Michael and Steven Psarellis, the vessel owners, and the\r\n\ncredit of Royal United, the shipping agency. Finally, the\r\n\ncourt found that there were no exceptional circumstances\r\n\nmilitating in favor of intervention, as Motor-Services, in the\r\n\ncourt's view, would still be fully able to litigate the matter\r\n\nin personam against the vessel owners.\r\n\n                            -43-\r                                         43\r\r\n\n          The denial of the intervention was, in large part,\r\n\nbased on erroneous legal conclusions reached by the district\r\n\ncourt. We believe the district court abused its discretion and\r\n\nthat Motor-Services should have been allowed to intervene.\r\n\n          The court found that the first factor weighed against\r\n\nMotor-Services because Motor-Services should have realized, as\r\n\nof April 29, that its interests were imperilled, but it failed\r\n\nto do anything about this until June 7, other than to try a few\r\n\ntimes (unsuccessfully) to reach the vessel owners by telephone.\r\n\nIn the context of this expedited litigation, a period of\r\n\ninaction lasting nearly six weeks would be difficult to excuse.\r\n\nBut the dates recited are not correct. In fact, it was not\r\n\nuntil \r                 May 19\r                        that the Vasilia account became overdue and Motor-\r\n\nServices actively sought to collect but was misled by the\r\n\nowners.  Less than three weeks later, and within a few days of\r\n\nlearning of the suit, Motor-Services had a motion before the\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n          In the days after May 19, the president of Motor-\r\n\nServices attempted to reach the vessel owners by telephone on\r\n\nthree separate occasions. He was told that the owners would\r\n\nget back to him, but they never did. The secretary who\r\n\nanswered the phone did not tell him about the arrest of the M/V\r\n\nVASILIA EXPRESS. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that\r\n\n27.  The invoice was issued on April 19 with a 30 day credit\r\nterm.\r\n\n                            -44-\r                                         44\r\r\n\nMotor-Services, which was actively trying to follow up on a\r\n\nrecently overdue account, was guilty of inaction. It was not\r\n\nuntil June 3 that Motor-Services actually learned of the arrest\r\n\nof the vessel.  Local counsel was retained the next day, and\r\n\nthe motion to intervene was filed shortly thereafter, on June\r\n\n6. Motor-Services had no way of knowing its maritime lien was\r\n\nimperilled prior to June 3; once it learned, it took prompt\r\n\naction to protect its interest. The first factor thus clearly\r\n\nmilitates in favor of allowing intervention.\r\n\n          The district court, in discussing the second factor,\r\n\nconcluded that the existing plaintiffs would be prejudiced by\r\n\nMotor-Services' intervention simply because the entry into the\r\n\ncase of another party, with an arguably superior lien, would\r\n\ndiminish the ultimate recovery available to those plaintiffs.\r\n\nThis may well be true, but it is not enough to outweigh the\r\n\nother three factors, all of which favor intervention\r\n\n(particularly since the plaintiffs' rights to a specific share\r\n\nin the recovery had not yet become final and the sale proceeds\r\n\nhad not yet been disbursed).\r\n\n          On the third factor, the court found that there was\r\n\nno prejudice to Motor-Services because Motor-Services had\r\n\nwaived its maritime lien. This was error. In inferring that\r\n\nMotor-Services had waived its maritime lien on the vessel, the\r\n\n28.  The president of Motor-Services was told of the arrest by\r\na mechanic in Florida. He promptly called Navieros for\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\n                            -45-\r                                         45\r\r\n\ncourt relied on the existence of a promissory note given by\r\n\nMichael Psarellis to Motor-Services and on the fact that Motor-\r\n\nServices billed Royal United, the vessel's agent, rather than\r\n\nthe vessel owners for much of the work done on the vessel.\r\n\n          Motor-Services' maritime lien on the vessel arises by\r\n\noperation of federal law (the Maritime Lien Act). 46 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 31342. In order to acquire a lien on a vessel, a person\r\n\nproviding necessaries to the vessel is \"not required to allege\r\n\nor prove in the action that credit was given to the vessel.\"\r\n\nId.

This is assumed to be\r\n\nthe case unless proven otherwise; the party disputing the\r\n\nexistence of the lien is required to show that \"[t]he party\r\n\nentitled to the lien [took] affirmative actions that\r\n\nmanifest[ed] a clear intention to forego the lien.\"   Farrell\r\n\nOcean Servs.\r                        v. \r                           United States\r                                        , 681 F.2d 91, 94 (1st Cir. 1982).\r\n\nThe taking of additional security by the provider of\r\n\nnecessaries from the vessel owner,   without more, does not\r\n\nconstitute such a step. \r                                   Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog\r                                                               , 310 U.S.\r\n\nat 276-77; \r                      Farrell Ocean Servs.\r                                          , 681 F.2d at 93-94; \r                                                               Crustacean\r\n\nTransp.

There was no waiver\r\n\nhere.\r\n\n          Because Motor-Services' lien was not waived by its\r\n\nconduct, it is the execution of the other liens on the vessel\r\n\nin this in rem proceeding which would strip Motor-Services of\r\n\nits lien, which would be forever extinguished. See \r                                                               supra note\r\n\n27. Clearly, there is ample prejudice to Motor-Services here.\r\n\n          Finally, the district court stated that there were no\r\n\nspecial circumstances militating in favor of intervention\r\n\nbecause Motor-Services could still bring an action \r                                                              in \r                                                                 personam\r\n\nagainst the vessel's owners. The record is silent as to\r\n\nwhether the defendants are presently solvent or not, but Motor-\r\n\n                            -47-\r                                         47\r\r\n\nServices is justifiably fearful that this right would be an\r\n\nempty one. At any rate, it is a right that pales in comparison\r\n\nto the right to exercise a lien against an identifiable sum of\r\n\nmoney. In light of this, and the fact that trial was\r\n\nexpedited, we think there were special circumstances favoring\r\n\nintervention. Intervention should have been allowed.\r\n\nC.  Coastal\r\n\n          Our Coastal analysis, in substance, tracks the Motor-\r\n\nServices analysis. Coastal moved to intervene on June 11,\r\n\n1996, asserting a maritime lien for repair work done on the\r\n\nvessel and supplies furnished the vessel the previous summer.\r\n\nThe district court, by written opinion on July 3, denied the\r\n\nmotion on untimeliness grounds. The court applied the four-\r\n\nfactor test discussed above, and its reasoning was much the\r\n\nsame as that used in the Motor-Services' denial. The only\r\n\nsubstantive difference in the court's analysis involved the\r\n\nthird factor, where the court found that Coastal had explicitly\r\n\nwaived its lien by agreeing to a payment plan with a clause\r\n\nobligating Coastal to forebear from going in rem against the\r\n\nvessel.\r\n\n          On the first factor, in finding that Coastal did not\r\n\nmove expeditiously to protect its interests, the court stressed\r\n\nthe 22-day gap between the time Coastal first learned of the\r\n\narrest and the time it sought intervention. We conclude that,\r\n\n                            -48-\r                                         48\r\r\n\nunder the unique circumstances of this case, Coastal acted\r\n\nreasonably promptly to protect its interests.\r\n\n          Vasilia was required, under the terms of its credit\r\n\nagreement with Coastal, to make monthly payments of $17,500;\r\n\npayments were due on the 8th of each month, starting in April\r\n\n1996.  Vasilia made only partial payment in April, and failed\r\n\nto make the May payment. Coastal's president called Royal\r\n\nUnited on May 15, a week after the May 8 due date, to inquire\r\n\nabout the non-payment. He was informed by Royal United that\r\n\nthere was an ongoing dispute with Navieros and Comet regarding\r\n\nthe charter of the vessel. While this is more information than\r\n\nMotor-Services was able to obtain when Vasilia failed to make\r\n\nits payment to Motor-Services at about the same time (May 19),\r\n\nCoastal, like Motor-Services, was not told of the arrest and\r\n\nthe impending trial.\r\n\n          It is true that Coastal heard something about an\r\n\narrest through other channels  during the week of May 20, but\r\n\nthe information it obtained consisted only of \"unconfirmed\r\n\nreports.\" Coastal moved expeditiously to confirm these\r\n\nreports. By early June, it had learned the details, and by\r\n\n30.  This credit agreement was negotiated and signed in January\r\n1996, after Vasilia proved unable to meet the payment schedule\r\noriginally agreed upon by the parties after Coastal's work on\r\nthe vessel was completed in July 1995.\r\n\n31.  The record does not reveal how Coastal learned about the\r\narrest. The district court fixed on May 20 because that is the\r\ndate Coastal stated, in its motion to intervene, that it first\r\nheard about the arrest.\r\n\n                            -49-\r                                         49\r\r\n\nJune 11 had moved to intervene. That Motor-Services managed to\r\n\nget its motion in four days earlier is immaterial. The first\r\n\nfactor weighs in Coastal's favor.\r\n\n          As to the other factors, Coastal is in a similar\r\n\nposition to Motor-Services and we will not repeat the\r\n\nanalysis.  Two of the remaining three factors clearly favor\r\n\nintervention, and intervention should have been allowed.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n          We affirm the judgment against the defendants, but\r\n\nvacate the awards of damages to Navieros and Comet and remand\r\n\nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion. We  affirm the\r\n\ndenial of Captain Jeftimiades's motion to intervene. But we\r\n\nreverse the denial of Motor-Services' and Coastal's motions to\r\n\nintervene, and \r                          remand to the district court to entertain their\r\n\nproof, calculate the damages due them, if any, rank the liens,\r\n\nand order disbursal of the funds to the various judgment\r\n\ncreditors.\r\n\n          Each party to bear its/his own costs.\r\n\n32.  We pause only to note that, contrary to the district\r\ncourt's findings, there was no explicit waiver of lien by\r\nCoastal. Coastal's agreement not to proceed against the vessel\r\nin rem was, by its terms, given \"in consideration for [the\r\nrenegotiated] payment schedule\" on the Vasilia account. It was\r\nnot a waiver of lien, but rather was an agreement by Coastal to\r\nforebear from doing something that Coastal was otherwise\r\nentitled to do. When Vasilia ceased making the required\r\npayments under the schedule, however, Coastal's temporary\r\nobligation to forebear from in rem action also ceased.\r\n\n                            -50-\r                                         50\r\n",

Three claimants, in addition to the original charterer plaintiff, were allowed to intervene;  all four won judgments after a three-day, expedited bench trial.  Suit was originally brought in rem against the vessel.  The vessel's corporate owner and its shipping agent both appeared, however, in personam to defend the action, and were also held liable on two of the judgments (for the original charterer and another intervening charterer).  The proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy even these four successful claims.  Various other claimants, whose claims would further tax the available funds, were not allowed to intervene.  Three of these, the ship's captain and two repair companies, appeal.  The owner of the vessel, the shipping agent, and the vessel itself also appeal together, arguing that the district court's entry of judgment against them is in error, and hence that there should be no division of proceeds at all.  Alternatively, they argue that the two charterers were awarded excessive damages.  These four appeals were consolidated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment against the vessel and the two in personam defendants, but we vacate the damages awards to both charterers and remand for a reassessment of damages.  We also affirm the denial of intervention to the captain, but we reverse the denials of the two repair companies' motions to intervene and remand to the district court to entertain those companies' proof, to calculate damages due them, if any, and to determine how the proceeds from the sale of the vessel should be allocated among the various judgment winners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying facts are not now in dispute.  On the morning of March 28, 1996, Navieros Interamericanos S.A., Inc.  (\"Navieros\"), a Florida corporation, entered a fixed time charter party<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS on a standard New York Produce Exchange form through a ship's broker, Jan Gisholt Shipping, Inc., also of Florida.  According to the charter party, the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS was owned by Royal United Shipping, Inc.  (\"Royal United\"), and was registered in the West Indies.  During this litigation it was established that, despite this written representation, the vessel was actually owned by Vasilia, Inc.  (\"Vasilia\"), a corporation with close links to Royal United.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navieros chartered the vessel for two round-trips between Florida and Guatemala, with an option for a third round-trip, for a total engagement of about 27 days, at $2,300 per day.  Navieros intended to ship, on behalf of various clients, \"general merchandise, freight [of] all kinds, electrical material, toys, hardware, food stuffs, ... heavy equipment, ... road building construction-type machinery, and ... used vehicles.\"   The time charter party stated that delivery of the vessel to Navieros, the charterer, was to occur upon the vessel's arrival at the pilot station in Port Everglades, Florida, where Navieros's cargo was to be loaded.  The charter party stated that this would happen \"any time, day, night\" after the fixing of the charter on March 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 2:00 in the afternoon on March 28, Kenneth Coleman, the President of Navieros, boarded the vessel at dock in Miami, about 30 miles from Port Everglades.  Coleman discussed the stowage plan with the captain, Dusan Jeftimiades, and with Michael Psarellis and instructed the captain to berth at Pier 19 when he arrived at Port Everglades, instead of at the pilot station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS left its berth in Miami, apparently headed for Port Everglades.  The only deviation from the written agreement that Coleman had mentioned involved the berthing of the ship at a different point in Port Everglades, but the ship never reached Port Everglades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vessel experienced problems with its bridge tachometer and stopped for repairs at Bicentennial Park, still inside the Port of Miami.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Kenneth Coleman and his brother William, also a Navieros officer, visited the ship four or five times over the next week.  During this time, Navieros also ordered fuel for the vessel, confirmed its reservation of the berth space at Port Everglades, and issued the necessary check in payment of United States customs dues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this unexpected delay, Royal United, the putative owner of the vessel, entered into a second time charter party with Comet Lines Agency, Inc.  (\"Comet\"), which was unaware of the charter party with Navieros.  Royal United apparently believed at this time that the Navieros charter party had not yet been fixed.  The Comet charter party, brokered by Americana Marine Services, began on April 4 and was to last for a period of 30 days.  It brought a more lucrative charter rate, $2,630 per day, than did the Navieros charter.  Comet intended primarily to carry cargo between San Juan, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.  Since the vessel was in Miami at the start of the charter, Comet arranged to have some Venezuela-bound cargo brought down from Jacksonville and loaded there;  Comet's intention was to have the vessel proceed to San Juan where more cargo would be loaded, and then to sail to Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the vessel's arrival in the port of San Juan on April 13, however, the United States Coast Guard detained the vessel for a litany of safety violations and ordered it not to proceed to sea without Coast Guard approval.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navieros subsequently learned that the vessel was being detained in Puerto Rico.  On April 18, while the ship was still in detention, Navieros filed a complaint in the federal district court in Puerto Rico, initiating this litigation.  Initially, the action was in rem against the vessel to enforce an alleged maritime lien based on the breach of a time charter agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same day, April 18, the district court, in an ex parte proceeding, ordered the arrest of the vessel pursuant to Rule C of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule C allows the holder of a maritime lien to proceed in rem against the vessel that is the subject of the lien.  In its order, the court stated that Navieros had made a prima facie showing of a maritime lien against the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia, as claimant of the in rem defendant M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, filed a motion for a post-arrest hearing on April 23.  Vasilia claimed that the arrest of the vessel was improper because Navieros had no maritime lien.  The only argument advanced by Vasilia at this point against the existence of a lien was that the charter party between Navieros and Royal United had not been fixed.  A charterer's maritime lien, a right derived from a contract, will not arise in the absence of a fixed charter party, that is, in the absence of an enforceable contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Vasilia's motion, Navieros amended its complaint on April 24 and moved alternatively for attachment of the vessel under Supplemental Rule B. Navieros also added Royal United as an in personam defendant.  One of the pertinent differences between Rules C and B is that the latter does not require the existence of a maritime lien.  Rule B allows an admiralty plaintiff to acquire quasi in rem jurisdiction over a defendant by attaching his property in the district;  this approach is available only if the defendant \"shall not be found within the district.\"   As required by Rule B, Navieros submitted an affidavit stating that, to the best of its knowledge, after a diligent search, defendant Royal United could not be found within the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ordered attachment of the vessel pursuant to Rule B on April 29.  In its May 1, 1996 answer to Navieros's amended complaint, Vasilia reiterated that Navieros had no maritime lien because there was no fixed charter party.  Vasilia also filed a counterclaim against Navieros for wrongful arrest, and asserted that if the court should find that there was a fixed charter party, then the dispute \"would be subject to compulsory arbitration.\"   Vasilia did not move to compel arbitration at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, April 30, Vasilia filed a \"request for amended process of arrest\" in which it asserted that the Rule B attachment was wrongly ordered by the court because Vasilia had designated an agent in the district upon whom process could be served on behalf of Vasilia.  Navieros then amended its complaint again to name Vasilia as in personam defendant along with Royal United.  Trial ultimately proceeded on this second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same day, the court held a hearing and ordered the case expedited.  The court accelerated discovery and set a May 23 trial date.  The court later explained, in its June 7 memorandum opinion, that this rushed schedule was necessary because the vessel had \"a fair market value of $500,000,\" it \"was accruing significant expenditures incidental to the arrest,\" and there were \"liens or potential liens exceeding its fair market value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The court also denied Vasilia's motions to vacate the Rule C arrest of the vessel and the Rule B attachment of it.  The court stated that the arrest could be lifted by the posting of a $200,000 bond.  No bond was posted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, Vasilia<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> filed a \"second motion to vacate arrest and attachment and for second post-arrest hearing.\"   Vasilia now claimed that \"there are new reasons\" showing that the Rule C arrest was illegal.  Vasilia argued that Navieros had no maritime lien because the vessel had not been delivered to Navieros, the charter party was still executory, and a maritime lien will not arise from the breach of an executory charter party.  Vasilia cited for the first time Navieros's oft-repeated assertion in its pleadings that the vessel had not been delivered as required by the charter party.  Both in personam defendants then waived the requirement that they be served with process and waived any objections to lack of personal jurisdiction.  The court summarily denied Vasilia's motion on May 20, three days before trial commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, Comet and Transcaribbean Maritime Corp.  (\"Transcaribbean\") filed motions to intervene as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.  Comet is the second charterer;  like Navieros, it pleaded a breach of contract claim.  Transcaribbean is a San Juan-based ship's agent and stevedoring contractor which paid, on behalf of the vessel, harbor and port dues, pilot fees, and other expenses incidental to the ship's arrival and its subsequent detention in the Port of San Juan.  On May 20, the court allowed both claimants to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, on the eve of trial, Captain Jeftimiades filed a motion to intervene as plaintiff, asserting a maritime lien for unpaid seaman's wages.  On May 23, the day the trial started, Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Co.  (\"Gulf Coast\"), the holder of a first preferred mortgage on the vessel, filed a motion to intervene as plaintiff in order to request foreclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the start of trial, the court ruled from the bench on the two motions to intervene.  After establishing that neither Captain Jeftimiades nor his counsel were present in the courtroom, the judge ascertained from Navieros's counsel that Jeftimiades's counsel was aware that the trial was starting.  The court then denied Jeftimiades's motion to intervene, stating:Well, the captain is not here.  His lawyer is not here.  Everybody is aware of the fact that this case was being tried or there was no reason not to know.  Therefore, at this point in time I am denying for obvious lack of interest, they are not here, the motion for permission to intervene....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gulf Coast's motion to intervene was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this first day of trial, the court also ruled from the bench on Vasilia's motion to compel arbitration, filed the day before.  Vasilia's motion relied on an arbitration clause in the charter party between Navieros and Royal United (and on a similar clause in the charter party with Comet).  The motion came two days after Vasilia's pre-trial concession regarding the existence of a fixed charter with Navieros, a point Vasilia had been contesting until then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court characterized this motion as among the \"strongest\" of the many pre-trial motions, but nevertheless denied it.  The court stated that Vasilia had conducted itself thus far in the litigation in a manner inconsistent with a desire to enforce a contractual arbitration clause, and that it had \"by its actions moved away from its right to arbitrate.\"   Sending the case to arbitration, said the judge, would also, by causing further delay, increase the costs attendant to the continuing arrest of the vessel, and \"create a bigger problem for everybody here.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Vasilia admitted the existence and breach of a charter party with Navieros, trial proceeded on the question of damages alone.  Vasilia argued that Navieros had no right to arrest the vessel under Rule C or to attach it under Rule B. Moreover, Navieros's resort to these procedures, Vasilia said in its counterclaim, had caused Vasilia to breach its contract with Comet and to incur other liabilities.  Relying on the venerable executory contract doctrine, Vasilia argued that the Rule C arrest was improper because the vessel had not yet been delivered to Navieros at the time of the breach, and the charter party was still executory.  Consequently, argued Vasilia, Navieros had no maritime lien and its resort to Rule C was invalid.  Rule B attachment was also invalid, argued Vasilia, because this measure may only be invoked where the defendant cannot be found within the district, and Vasilia had appointed an agent within the district for service of process on its behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial concluded on May 29, and the court issued its written memorandum and order on June 7. The court upheld both the Rule C arrest and the Rule B attachment.  Rejecting Vasilia's Rule C argument, the court held that the vessel was effectively delivered to Navieros prior to the breach when Coleman boarded the vessel in Miami.  The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>Although the vessel was to be technically delivered at the pilot station in Port Everglades, a location less than thirty nautical miles away, due to the proximity of the locations, the master and Mr. Psarellis accepted Kenneth Coleman's instructions to proceed further to Port Everglades and, with a pilot, to berth at Pier 19 in Port Everglades for loading.  The vessel was, for all purposes, delivered to the charterer when Mr. Psarellis and the ship's master accepted Mr. Coleman's verbal instructions to proceed under the charter party agreement to Pier 19 at Port Everglades for loading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also upheld the Rule B attachment, rejecting Vasilia's argument that the attachment was improper because Vasilia had appointed an agent for service of process within the district.  The court emphasized that Vasilia, a Liberian corporation, had had no corporate presence whatsoever in the district.  The court stated that the eleventh hour appointment by Vasilia of counsel as local agent for service of process was a \"strategic appointment directed at defeating the necessity of the rule\" and could not be used to elude attachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court entered judgment against the vessel and the two in personam defendants:  for Navieros in the amount of $182,952;  for Comet in the amount of $100,312.13;  for Transcaribbean in the amount of $24,777.26;  and for Gulf Coast in the amount of $285,428.91.  The total of the judgments against Vasilia amounted to $593,470.30.  The court ordered that the vessel be sold by the United States Marshal at auction to satisfy these judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ruled that Gulf Coast had complied with the requirements of the Ship Mortgage Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167; 30101 et seq., and had successfully shown that it had a preferred mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The court, however, did not rank the four judgment winners.  Nor did the court know, at the time the judgments were handed down, how much money would be available from the eventual sale of the vessel to satisfy the judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several more would-be plaintiffs moved to intervene as a matter of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a) after the decision was handed down;  these motions were denied.  We discuss only those parties that appeal.  The first of these post-judgment movants was Motor-Services Hugo Stamp, Inc.  (\"Motor-Services\"), a Florida-based ship repair and supply company which sought to intervene on June 7, the day judgment issued.  Motor-Services asserted a maritime lien in the amount of $76,460.55 for unpaid receivables due for work done on the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS and materials supplied to it between February 28 and March 29, 1996.  The second post-judgment movant was Coastal Ship Repair, Inc.  (\"Coastal\"), a Louisiana corporation which sought intervention on June 11.  Coastal, too, asserted a maritime lien for moneys due for work performed and materials supplied the vessel, from May 2, 1995, through July 1, 1995.  Coastal asserted a lien in the amount of $144,800.  The court denied these two late motions on July 3 by separate written orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The public auction was held July 2, but the required minimum bid of $400,000 was not achieved.  A second auction was held on July 23 with a lower minimum of $300,000.  Gulf Coast, the first preferred mortgage holder, bought the ship for $300,000.  After confirmation of the sale, Jeftimiades, Coastal, and Motor-Services moved to stay disbursement of the proceeds until final resolution of these appeals.  This motion was granted, and the proceeds of the sale, less certain administrative costs and fees, remain in an escrow account pending resolution of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia appeals on four grounds:  (1) that the arrest and attachment were invalid;  (2) that the motion to compel arbitration was wrongly denied;  (3) that the court awarded both charterers, Navieros and Comet, excessive damages;  and (3) that the court improperly pierced Vasilia's corporate veil.  We resolve Vasilia's claims without the benefit of briefs from Navieros<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> or any of the other plaintiffs in whose favor judgment was entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Arrest and Attachment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia admitted before trial that it was in breach of the charter party with Navieros.  The main issue on appeal is whether Navieros was entitled to take the measures it took prior to trial regarding the vessel.  Vasilia's position remains that (1) Navieros had no maritime lien and thus no right to arrest and (2) Vasilia had appointed an agent within the district for service of process on its behalf and so attachment was improper.  Vasilia apparently infers that Navieros is responsible for the chain of events set in motion by the subsequent unavailability of the vessel:  i.e., the breach of the Comet charter;  Gulf Coast's decision to bring its foreclosure action;  and the need for Transcaribbean to incur the custodial costs associated with the arrest of the vessel.  Vasilia's position appears to be that Navieros should have brought an in personam suit against Vasilia for breach of contract, rather than moving against the vessel under Rules C and B, and that this would not have resulted in the same domino effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navieros first invoked Rule C, seeking the arrest of the vessel on the basis of an asserted maritime lien.  After Vasilia challenged the existence of a maritime lien, Navieros moved alternatively for Rule B attachment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The two strategies, though similar in effect, are based on entirely different theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>An in rem action [under Rule C] differs from maritime attachment [under Rule B] in that an in rem action is brought against the vessel itself as defendant.  By contrast, a vessel is attached only as an auxiliary to an in personam claim because the vessel is property belonging to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Schoenbaum, supra, &#167; 21-3, at 478-79.  The district court ordered both Rule C arrest and Rule B attachment of the vessel, and ruled both procedures proper in its written opinion.  Vasilia challenges both rulings on appeal.  Either procedure standing alone would have been sufficient to enable Navieros to ensure the continued presence of the vessel in Puerto Rico while the litigation proceeded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rule C question is a close one, and it takes us into waters uncharted by this circuit.  In order to invoke Rule C to arrest a vessel, a plaintiff must have a valid maritime lien against the defendant's vessel.  See Bunn v. Global Marine, Inc., 428 F.2d 40, 48 n. 10 (5th Cir.1970) (\"a maritime lien is the foundation of a proceeding in rem \");  Rainbow Line, Inc. v. M/V Tequila, 480 F.2d 1024, 1028 (2d Cir.1973) (\"in rem jurisdiction in the admiralty exists only to enforce a maritime lien\");  2 Schoenbaum, supra, &#167; 21-3, at 478-79.  We affirm the district court holding that Navieros had a maritime lien.  The Rule C arrest was thus valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the executory contract doctrine, charterers have no maritime lien until performance of the charter contract begins.

(The Saigon Maru), 260 U.S. 490, 495, 43 S.Ct. 172, 172-73, 67 L.Ed. 364 (1923).  \"Liability arises in the admiralty as elsewhere from breach of any valid contract, but until the parties have entered in performance remedy for the breach is in personam only;  the added advantages of lien status are reserved to claimants under executed contracts.\"   Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty &#167; 9-22, at 635 (2d ed.1975);  see also Bunn, 428 F.2d at 48 n. 10 (\"The rule in admiralty is well settled that no lien attaches for the breach of an executory contract....  [U]ntil the parties have entered into performance, the remedy in admiralty for the breach is in personam only.\");  Rainbow Line, 480 F.2d at 1027 n. 6;  The Oceano, 148 F. 131, 133 (S.D.N.Y.1906);  Rule C(1) (setting forth when an action in rem may be brought).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the goods to be shipped were never actually loaded on the vessel.  The vessel never got to the dockside for loading.  There is no evidence that the goods to be shipped were ever in the custody or control of the vessel master.  Ordinarily, those facts would most likely end any claim of maritime lien.  See Gilmore &amp; Black, supra, &#167; 9-22, at 636.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The great majority of cases addressing the executory contract doctrine, however, have concerned contracts of affreightment evidenced by bills of lading or voyage charters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  E.A.S.T., Inc. v. M/V Alaia, 673 F.Supp. 796, 802 (E.D.La.1987), aff'd, 876 F.2d 1168 (5th Cir.1989).  This case involves a time charter agreement.  The district court relied heavily on the reasoning in E.A.S.T., where the court distinguished between voyage charters and time charters as to when the contract is no longer executory (and, consequently, as to when a maritime lien arises).  With voyage charters, whether control over the cargo shifted to the vessel will most likely determine whether a maritime lien exists.  E.A.S.T., 673 F.Supp. at 802-04.   With time charters, however, a maritime lien may arise even before control of the cargo shifts to the vessel.  Id.;  see also Rainbow Line, 480 F.2d at 1027 n. 6 (noting that cargo need not be loaded for time charter to lose executory status).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distinction is sensible because under a time charter the shipowner agrees to put his vessel, master, and crew to the service of the time charterer for a named period.  E.A.S.T., 673 F.Supp. at 802.   The time charterer must begin his performance \"well before cargo is, if ever, loaded on the vessel--by paying hire, appointing and funding a port agent, and arranging and paying for pilotage, tug assistance and line handlers and all else necessary to berth the vessel in order to load cargo.\"  Id. at 803.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>Here, the time charter form agreement specified that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>Vessel to be placed at the disposal of the Charterers, at Delivery Arrival Pilot Station Port Everglades Any Time, Day, Night....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The president of the plaintiff charterer boarded the vessel 30 miles from Port Everglades, and changed the instructions as to the destination (berthing at Pier 19 at Port Everglades instead of at the pilot station).  The vessel proceeded until it experienced mechanical problems and it stopped for repairs short of Port Everglades.  While it was undergoing repairs, the charterer boarded the vessel four or five times, ordered fuel for the vessel, confirmed its reservation of a berth space, and issued a check to pay U.S. Customs fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the experienced trial judge erred in concluding that there was sufficient delivery of the vessel to the charterer, Navieros, and sufficient performance of the contract that the charter was no longer \"executory.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Accordingly, there was a maritime lien and the Rule C arrest was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Attachment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also affirm the Rule B attachment because Vasilia was not \"within the district\" at the time attachment was sought and granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 30 Vasilia submitted to the court a copy of a letter saying that Vasilia had appointed an agent for service in the district.  The letter, dated April 26, 1996, states in its entirety:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is to confirm that owners are authorizing CALVESBERT and BROWN as attorneys to accept service of process on behalf of VASILIA INC. who is the owner of M/V VASILIA EXPRESS which was named in a suit filed by Navieros Interamericanos in Federal District Court in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no addressee designated on the face of the letter.  There is evidence at the top of the page that the letter had been sent via fax to the recipient on April 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule B allows the attachment of a vessel or other tangible property under certain circumstances to gain quasi in rem jurisdiction over a defendant.  A Rule B attachment may only proceed when the defendant is not \"found within the district.\"   The case law makes it clear that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>whether or not [a foreign defendant] can be found within the district presents a two-pronged inquiry:  first whether it can be found within the district in terms of jurisdiction, and second, if so, whether it can be found for service of process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first inquiry is directed to whether or not the respondent is present within the district by reason of activities on its behalf by authorized agents so as to subject it to [the district court's] jurisdiction in in personam proceedings.  If not, then the respondent cannot be found within the district and this ground alone would be sufficient to support the attachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the foreign respondent be found within the district in a jurisdictional sense, its property is not immunized from attachment.  The second question ... then presents itself.  Could the respondent be found within the district with due diligence for service in the libel proceeding?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Cia.  Naviera Continental S.A., 178 F.Supp. 561, 563-64 (S.D.N.Y.1959) (footnote omitted).  If the respondent can be found within the district, then attachment may not proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first inquiry, it is undisputed that by purposefully sending its vessel into Puerto Rico, Vasilia subjected itself to personal jurisdiction in that district.  As to the second inquiry, Vasilia argues that the attachment was wrongful because it had appointed an agent for service of process in the district.  But the fact is Vasilia's purported appointment of the agent came, at the earliest, on April 26, two days after Navieros moved for an order of attachment (and after Navieros filed an affidavit, as required by Supplemental Rule B, saying Navieros had been unable to find the defendant within the district).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was not unjustified in stating that Vasilia's argument would eviscerate the time-honored process of maritime attachment.  If we were to accept Vasilia's position, a defendant who was otherwise safely outside the service power of the district could effectively avoid Rule B attachment by waiting until after the plaintiff filed a Rule B motion to designate an agent for service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was Vasilia, simply by virtue of its subsequent appearance in this action, entitled to dissolution of the attachment.  Swift v. Compania Colombiana, 339 U.S. 684, 693, 70 S.Ct. 861, 867, 94 L.Ed. 1206 (1950).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  But Vasilia was not without options.  Prior to trial, Vasilia had the opportunity, pursuant to Supplemental Rule E(5)(a), to post a bond of $200,000 in order to obtain the release of the vessel.  Vasilia declined to exercise this right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Arbitration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Vasilia had waived its contractual right to arbitration by participating in the litigation for over a month before filing a motion, one day before the start of trial, to compel arbitration.  Vasilia protests that this ruling was error, but its arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia complains that it could not have moved to compel arbitration earlier because it was not until two days before the start of trial that Vasilia admitted the existence of the charter party under which the right to arbitration was established.  Indeed, Vasilia did assert, at various stages of the pleadings, that, if the court should determine the existence of a charter party, then the case should be removed to arbitration.  Had it moved for arbitration earlier, Vasilia says, this step could have been interpreted as a concession that the charter party was fixed, because the right to arbitration comes from a clause in the charter party.  By not moving until the day before trial, on the other hand, Vasilia was found to have waived the right.  Vasilia says the district court's position presented Vasilia with a Hobson's choice between admission and waiver.  Litigation frequently puts parties to hard choices, particularly as to which of seemingly inconsistent theories to pursue.  Vasilia is responsible for the consequences of its choices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of a district court's determination of waiver of the right to arbitration is plenary.  Menorah Ins. Co. v. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d 218 (1st Cir.1995);  Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 992 F.2d 386, 390 (1st Cir.1993).  The party opposing the motion to compel arbitration--that is, the party urging a waiver--must show prejudice.  Sevinor v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 807 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was prejudice here.  The delay was not long in absolute terms;  it was only one month.  But in the unusual context of this litigation this delay was both long and prejudicial.  The delay lasted from the filing of the complaint to the eve of trial.  In the interim, in this expedited litigation, the parties scrambled to prepare their cases for trial, incurring expenses that would not have been occasioned by preparing for an arbitration.  That is enough to show prejudice.  Menorah, 72 F.3d at 222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The desirability of enforcing arbitration clauses is much recognized.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 633, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 3357, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985).  Arbitration may be \"a mutually optimal method and forum for dispute resolution [which] serves the interests of efficiency and economy.\"  Menorah, 72 F.3d at 223.   But we have also recognized that the very rationale for arbitration may be undercut if a party is permitted to pursue a claim through the courts and then later claim a right to arbitration.  Id. Accordingly, we have repeatedly held that a party may, by engaging in litigation, implicitly waive its contractual right to arbitrate.  Id.; Caribbean Ins. Servs., Inc. v. American Bankers Life Assurance Co., 715 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1983);  Jones Motor Co. v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters &amp; Helpers Local Union No. 633 of New Hampshire, 671 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.1982);  Gutor Int'l AG v. Raymond Packer Co., 493 F.2d 938, 945 (1st Cir.1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia complains of self-inflicted wounds.  Vasilia denied it had a valid charter party with Navieros up until the eve of trial.  It then switched positions, admitted the validity of the charter party, and sought to invoke arbitration under the charter party.  We agree with the district court that this conduct amounted to a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Corporate Status of Vessel Owners</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Vasilia parties object to certain references in the district court's opinion which, they believe, imply that the court had pierced the corporate veils of Vasilia and Royal United, without conducting the proper legal analysis.  They ask us to strike from the district court opinion these statements (and strike from the pleadings similar references made by plaintiffs).  The argument is misplaced.  It is a basic principle of appellate jurisdiction that we review judgments, not the editorial commentary in opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that appellants mean to argue that the district court's imputation of liability for the Navieros and Comet judgments to the in personam defendants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>Vasilia and Royal United--was erroneous, they also fail.  There are two distinct issues here:  (1) whether Vasilia, the owner of the vessel, can be held liable for any damages apart from the proceeds obtained from the sale of the vessel, and (2) whether Royal United, the shipping agent and a nominally separate corporation, can be held so liable.  We agree with the district court that the answer to both questions is yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The normal rule in admiralty actions in rem, such as this one was initially, is that judgment creditors, absent service of process on the vessel owner under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, are only entitled to enforce their liens against the vessel itself.  See Orbis Marine Enters., Inc. v. TEC Marine Lines, Ltd., 692 F.Supp. 280, 284 (S.D.N.Y.1988);  East Asiatic Co., Ltd. v. Indomar Ltd., 422 F.Supp. 1335, 1341 (S.D.N.Y.1976);  2 Schoenbaum, supra, &#167; 21-2, at 469;  cf.  Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 77 U.S. 308, 318-19, 19 L.Ed. 931 (1870) (same principle in non-admiralty action in rem ).  The owners of the vessels against which actions in rem are brought are not, in such cases, personally liable for judgments in excess of the value of the vessel, if any.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not the normal case.  Here, both in personam defendants, Vasilia and Royal United, waived the requirement of service of process and waived all defenses related to personal jurisdiction.  They both appeared voluntarily as in personam defendants.  We recognize, of course, that this was done for strategic reasons.  The waivers and appearances came as part of defendants' ultimately unsuccessful campaign against Rule B attachment of the vessel by Navieros.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Vasilia and Royal United must live with the consequences of their choices.  The waivers and appearances allowed the action to blossom into the full in personam case against the two defendants for breach of the charter party that Navieros had contemplated in its pleadings.  Cf. Atkins v. Fibre Disintegrating Co., 18 Wall. 272, 85 U.S. 272, 298, 21 L.Ed. 841 (1873).  We see no error in the district court's finding of liability against both defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia complains that both Navieros and Comet were awarded excessive damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The propriety of the amount of damages awarded is an issue of fact, which we review for clear error.  Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 166 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Navieros</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The breach of the Navieros time charter occurred when the vessel was diverted to the use of Comet, after performance of the Navieros contract commenced but before Navieros's cargo was loaded.  Without noting the distinction, defendants assert that the measure of damages should be that which is used in cases where the owner breached the charter party by repudiating it before performance began.   The general rule for recovery in that situation was stated long ago by Judge Learned Hand:  \"the withdrawal of the ship entitled [the charterer] prima facie to damages measured by the difference between the hire reserved in the charter and the hire necessary to secure such another bottom.\"  The Ada, 239 F. 363, 364 (S.D.N.Y.1916), rev'd on other grounds, 250 F. 194 (2d Cir.1918);  see also Sanders v. Munson, 74 F. 649, 651 (2d Cir.1896);  2 Schoenbaum, supra, &#167; 11-17, at 204-05 (\"The charterer's damages for cancellation are equal to the difference between the contract hire in the broken charter and the hire necessary to secure another vessel.\").  It seems reasonable to apply this general rule here, provided the victim of the breach is also allowed to recover out-of-pocket expenses incidental to preparing for the arrival of the ship for loading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inherent in that rule, of course, is a duty of mitigation;  the victim of the breach must make reasonable efforts to locate a substitute vessel.  See Glidden Co. v. Hellenic Lines, Ltd., 315 F.2d 162, 164 (2d Cir.1963);  The Ada, 239 F. at 364;  Sanders, 74 F. at 651, 2 Schoenbaum, supra, &#167; 11-17, at 204-05.  If the charterer is unable to locate a suitable substitute vessel, then the proper measure of damages for the breach is its lost profits.  See Polar Steamship Corp. v. Inland Overseas Steamship Corp., 136 F.2d 835, 842 (4th Cir.1943);  The Ada, 239 F. at 364.   Here, the trial court found that Navieros was unable to locate an adequate substitute.  Defendants argue that Navieros in fact found a suitable substitute, but did not use it.  We review findings of fact for clear error.  Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820, 827 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Coleman's deposition testimony at trial and Kenneth Coleman's trial testimony were the only evidence offered by any of the parties on the question of mitigation.  According to William Coleman's uncontroverted testimony, Navieros conducted an intensive but fruitless search for a replacement vessel.  Cf. Polar Steamship Corp., 136 F.2d at 842 (\"The evidence is that efforts were made to obtain [another vessel] but without success.\").  It is true that Navieros learned about an available vessel and did consider using it in place of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, but decided in the end that this vessel was too slow.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  Such a decision was within Navieros's rights.  See Sanders, 74 F. at 652 (charterer \"under no obligation to accept a slower and smaller vessel than the [originally chartered vessel] had been represented to be\").  The district court was not obliged to credit William Coleman's testimony, but it is certainly not clear error for it to have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even using the rule advocated by defendants, therefore, the proper measure of damages for the breach here was Navieros's lost profits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  The court purported to apply such a measure, but defendants argue that it awarded Navieros \"lost revenues\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> instead, a far more generous dollar amount.  Indeed, the court's choice of words was at times confusing;  for instance, it titled the table of damages calculations \"Gross Loss of Revenue.\"   We must look past the question of word choice and determine if the correct measure was applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are the components of damages awarded Navieros:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) gross freight in the amount of $67,000, returned to shippers upon demand;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) canceled bills of lading issued in Guatemala, representing $118,000 of freight charges for three voyages;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) freight charges [of $71,175] on southbound cargo received in Port Everglades, eventually returned to shippers;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) net loss of $3,377 over $26,000 worth of freight rerouted through another steamship line providing service to Guatemala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this \"Gross Loss\" of $259,552, the court subtracted \"charter hire expense\" of $57,600 and \"fuel expense\" of $19,000.  The \"Net Loss\" was $182,952, and the court awarded damages in this amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the court subtracted charter hire and fuel expense from the sub-total seems to indicate that, despite its choice of words, the court did not see the award as one of lost \"revenues\" per se.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, a radically different conception of Navieros's lost profits is found in William Coleman's deposition.  Coleman stated that Navieros expected to make $28,500 in profits from the shipping of cargo under the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS charter (this estimate included the exercise by Navieros of its option on a third round-trip).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kenneth Coleman also testified at trial that Navieros charters approximately 50 voyages per year and that Navieros's 1995 net profits were roughly $495,000.  The average profit per voyage is thus just under $10,000.  Given this, it is hard to understand how the loss of the three M/V VASILIA EXPRESS voyages caused $182,952 in lost profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it is unclear on what basis the district court calculated lost profits, we vacate the damages award and remand the question of Navieros's damages to the district court for clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Comet</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge six of the thirteen components of the $100,312.13 award to Comet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  They claim (1) that Comet should not have been awarded the stevedoring fees ($4,500) and ship's agency fees ($4,999.26) incurred at the port of origin, Miami, because Comet would have incurred these expenses even if the charter had not been breached;  (2) that the award of fuel costs for both the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS ($5,312) and the replacement vessel secured by Comet ($7,326) was duplicative;  and (3) that the award of the entire cost of the substitute vessel ($15,000), along with the reimbursement of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS charter hire ($39,450), was likewise duplicative.  Defendants also argue that the district court \"failed to account for the fact that cargo problems were part of the reason why the U.S. Coast Guard initially detained the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS in Puerto Rico, which, along with the arrest by Navieros, led to the vessel's inability to carry Comet's cargo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final point borders on frivolous, in light of the numerous vessel-related and captain-related deficiencies cited by the Coast Guard.  See footnote 4 supra.   But the first three claims have considerable merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages award included reimbursement for the stevedoring costs associated with transferring the cargo from the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS to the replacement vessel.  In light of this, the award of costs for the original loading of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS was inappropriate.  The award of the stevedoring costs at the port of origin ($4,500) is thus vacated.  Comet did not make a claim for reimbursement for any shipping agency fee for the replacement vessel, so there was no double dipping there.  But that is also why the fee paid by Comet at the port of origin ($4,999.26) is not recoverable:  Comet apparently incurred no additional shipping agency costs as a result of the breach.  That award too is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was excessive recovery for the fuel costs too.  Comet should pay only for the fuel used by the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS on the initial Miami-San Juan run, which was completed before the breach, but not for the additional fuel, if any, that it deposited in that vessel's gas tanks in Miami in expectation of the continuation of the voyage to Venezuela.  Comet is also entitled to differential money damages;  that is, it should be reimbursed for that portion of the fuel purchased for the replacement vessel that was in excess of the expected cost of fuel for the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, had the latter ship fulfilled its contractual obligations. These are calculations that are necessarily based on estimates and expectations.  The record indicates that the replacement vessel consumed more fuel than the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, but we are unable to glean precise details about this or about whether the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS was left with any Comet-purchased fuel when detained and arrested in the Port of San Juan, and if so, how much.  We thus vacate the two fuel cost awards ($5,312 &amp; $7,326) and remand to the district court for an amended award in light of this discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comet was awarded excessive damages for charter hire too.  Comet is entitled to differential damages.  Where the substitute vessel costs less than the one originally chartered, the charterer is entitled to a refund of the price paid for the original, but it should pay for the substitute.  If the replacement costs more, the charterer should get reimbursed for this difference in cost.  It is difficult to imagine a situation where the charterer would be entitled to a refund of the original charter hire and an award of replacement costs.  Here, Comet's replacement vessel ($15,000) cost less than the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS ($39,450).  Comet therefore is entitled to a refund of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS charter hire, but not to an award of costs for the hire of the replacement.  The $15,000 award is thus vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the appeals of the various would-be claimants whose motions for intervention were denied, and who thus missed out on the chance to compete for a share of the proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  We review a district court's denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion.  Conservation Law Found. of New England v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir.1992);  International Paper v. Town of Jay, 887 F.2d 338, 343 (1st Cir.1989);  cf.  Banco Popular de Puerto Rico v. Greenblatt, 964 F.2d 1227, 1230 n. 3 (1st Cir.1992).  We analyze the district court's rulings against the backdrop of a purposefully accelerated litigation in which scarcely more than a month passed between the arrest of the vessel and the start of trial, with the memorandum and order admirably following trial by less than two weeks.  We are also mindful of the fact that the standards for timeliness are less strict for Rule 24(a) motions to intervene (intervention as a matter of right) than for such motions under Rule 24(b) (permissive intervention), and that all three appellants here invoked Rule 24(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Banco Popular, 964 F.2d at 1227 n. 2;  Fiandaca v. Cunningham, 827 F.2d 825, 832-33 (1st Cir.1987);  Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 266 (5th Cir.1977).  We conclude that the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying Captain Jeftimiades's attempted intervention, but that it abused its discretion in denying the attempted interventions of Motor-Services and Coastal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Captain Jeftimiades</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Captain Jeftimiades, asserting a maritime lien for unpaid seaman's wages, moved to intervene a day before the start of trial.  The district judge denied Jeftimiades's motion from the bench on the first day of trial after learning that neither the captain nor his attorney were present in the courtroom.  Unlike the motions of Coastal and Motor-Services, the captain's motion was not denied on timeliness grounds;  indeed, the judge indicated that he probably would have allowed intervention had the captain or his attorney been present at the start of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge carefully determined that the captain's attorney had been duly informed of the trial date before announcing that he was denying the motion.  Jeftimiades does not argue on appeal that his counsel had not been informed of the May 23 trial date;  he simply states that counsel \"erroneously thought the trial date was May 30th\" and that he was in New Jersey on May 23 and could not have appeared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jeftimiades argues that his counsel's associate was available to represent the captain and that the court should have requested that this associate appear on the captain's behalf.  However, the judge was not told that counsel was out of the Commonwealth, and, while the judge certainly could have inquired further into the matter if he wished, he was not obliged to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Captain Jeftimiades also argues that, as a seaman, he is a ward of the court who is entitled to greater protection than the average intervenor.  Courts have allowed seamen to avoid rules of common law which affect them particularly harshly because of their vocation.  This is true where a rule of law has especially harsh results on a seaman because he is a seaman.   For instance, in Socony-Vacuum Oil Company v. Smith, 305 U.S. 424, 430-31, 59 S.Ct. 262, 266-67, 83 L.Ed. 265 (1939), the leading case cited by Jeftimiades, the Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether a seaman who had used a dangerous appliance on board could have his claim barred by the doctrine of assumption of risk.  The Court cautioned against the application of the doctrine in admiralty cases because seamen often have fewer alternatives than do land-based workers, and are often in less of a position to avoid dangerous situations.  Id. This case is easily distinguishable.  Captain Jeftimiades's failure to appear at trial through counsel is not explained by any special disabilities attendant to his status as a sailor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jeftimiades does not address the issue of whether there would be any prejudice to the existing plaintiffs if he were allowed now to intervene.  Clearly, there would be prejudice in light of the Coast Guard citation, which described Jeftimiades as drunk at the time the vessel was detained.  Vasilia or some of the claimants might have attempted at trial to prove that the captain forfeited his maritime lien for wages.  Cf. Johnston v. M/V Dieu Si Bon, 1996 WL 866112 (W.D.Wa.1996) (question of fact whether seaman forfeited lien for wages by deserting ship).  Of course, no one made this argument at trial because the captain's attempted intervention was denied.  Allowing Jeftimiades to intervene now would necessitate ordering new proceedings in which the parties could attempt to make this claim.  We recognize that the prejudice to Jeftimiades is also severe,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> but he had the opportunity to make his case and did not take advantage of this chance.  There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Motor-Services</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motor-Services moved to intervene on June 7, two weeks after the start of trial and the day on which the district court issued its memorandum and order.  This motion was denied as untimely by written order on July 3. The court analyzed the motion under what it called \"the First Circuit standard of Banco Popular.\"   The timeliness standard applied in Banco Popular, 964 F.2d 1227, is derived from the Fifth Circuit opinion of Stallworth v. Monsanto Company, 558 F.2d 257 (5th Cir.1977).  See Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d 15, 20 (1st Cir.1980) (adopting Stallworth test).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four factors are:  the length of time the would-be intervenor knew or reasonably should have known that its interest was imperilled before it moved to intervene;  the foreseeable prejudice to the existing parties if intervention is granted;  the prejudice to the would-be intervenor if intervention is denied;  and exceptional circumstances which may militate against or in favor of allowing late intervention.  Banco Popular, 964 F.2d at 1231.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, weighing the matter by relying on the facts as alleged by Motor-Services in the motion, first determined that the credit term extended to Vasilia by Motor-Services expired on April 29, and that from that date until June 7 Motor-Services sought payment of the overdue receivables only by leaving telephone messages that went unreturned.  The obvious implication of this finding (not stated by the court) is that Motor-Services sat on its rights when it should have been moving more decisively to protect its interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving on to the second factor, the court then noted that the proposed intervention would prejudice the existing parties because:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>intervention on the day judgment was entered seeks to disturb the core of the judgment.  The M/V VASILIA EXPRESS is appraised at $500,000 and the court has recognized plaintiffs by judgment in the aggregate amount of $593,469.39.  The realities of the public sale market for vessels dictated that the public sale ordered would have an initial bidding price set at $400,000.  Any sale proceeds will not be enough to cover the existing plaintiffs' rights.  It is not fair to reopen the case for late-comers to gain an undue advantage under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court next found that no prejudice would inure to Motor-Services as a result of the denial of the motion because Motor-Services had waived its maritime lien by relying on the credit of Michael and Steven Psarellis, the vessel owners, and the credit of Royal United, the shipping agency.  Finally, the court found that there were no exceptional circumstances militating in favor of intervention, as Motor-Services, in the court's view, would still be fully able to litigate the matter in personam against the vessel owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of the intervention was, in large part, based on erroneous legal conclusions reached by the district court.  We believe the district court abused its discretion and that Motor-Services should have been allowed to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that the first factor weighed against Motor-Services because Motor-Services should have realized, as of April 29, that its interests were imperilled, but it failed to do anything about this until June 7, other than to try a few times (unsuccessfully) to reach the vessel owners by telephone.  In the context of this expedited litigation, a period of inaction lasting nearly six weeks would be difficult to excuse.  But the dates recited are not correct.  In fact, it was not until May 19 that the Vasilia account became overdue and Motor-Services actively sought to collect but was misled by the owners.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Less than three weeks later, and within a few days of learning of the suit, Motor-Services had a motion before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the days after May 19, the president of Motor-Services attempted to reach the vessel owners by telephone on three separate occasions.  He was told that the owners would get back to him, but they never did.  The secretary who answered the phone did not tell him about the arrest of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS.  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that Motor-Services, which was actively trying to follow up on a recently overdue account, was guilty of inaction.  It was not until June 3 that Motor-Services actually learned of the arrest of the vessel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Local counsel was retained the next day, and the motion to intervene was filed shortly thereafter, on June 6. Motor-Services had no way of knowing its maritime lien was imperilled prior to June 3;  once it learned, it took prompt action to protect its interest.  The first factor thus clearly militates in favor of allowing intervention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in discussing the second factor, concluded that the existing plaintiffs would be prejudiced by Motor-Services' intervention simply because the entry into the case of another party, with an arguably superior lien, would diminish the ultimate recovery available to those plaintiffs.  This may well be true, but it is not enough to outweigh the other three factors, all of which favor intervention (particularly since the plaintiffs' rights to a specific share in the recovery had not yet become final and the sale proceeds had not yet been disbursed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the third factor, the court found that there was no prejudice to Motor-Services because Motor-Services had waived its maritime lien.  This was error.  In inferring that Motor-Services had waived its maritime lien on the vessel, the court relied on the existence of a promissory note given by Michael Psarellis to Motor-Services and on the fact that Motor-Services billed Royal United, the vessel's agent, rather than the vessel owners for much of the work done on the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motor-Services' maritime lien on the vessel arises by operation of federal law (the Maritime Lien Act).  46 U.S.C. &#167; 31342.  In order to acquire a lien on a vessel, a person providing necessaries to the vessel is \"not required to allege or prove in the action that credit was given to the vessel.\"  Id. &#167; 31342(a)(3);  see Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog v. Signal Oil &amp; Gas Co., 310 U.S. 268, 273, 60 S.Ct. 937, 940, 84 L.Ed. 1197 (1940).  This is assumed to be the case unless proven otherwise;  the party disputing the existence of the lien is required to show that \"[t]he party entitled to the lien [took] affirmative actions that manifest[ed] a clear intention to forego the lien.\"  Farrell Ocean Servs. v. United States, 681 F.2d 91, 94 (1st Cir.1982).  The taking of additional security by the provider of necessaries from the vessel owner,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> without more, does not constitute such a step.  Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog, 310 U.S. at 276-77, 60 S.Ct. at 941-42;  Farrell Ocean Servs., 681 F.2d at 93-94;  Crustacean Transp. Corp. v. Atalanta Trading Corp., 369 F.2d 656, 660-61 (5th Cir.1966);  Gilmore &amp; Black, supra, &#167; 9-84, at 786.  \"The party attacking the lien has the burden of ... showing that the party rendering the service [Motor-Services] relied solely on personal credit.\"  Farrell Ocean Servs., 681 F.2d at 93 (emphasis added).  No such showing has been made here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in finding a waiver, also relied on the fact that Motor-Services billed Royal United, the M/V VASILIA's agent, rather than the owner of the vessel, for many of the services provided.  However, \"the submission of a bill to the owner's agent with whom the supplier has been dealing rather than to the owner and the vessel [does not] constitute waiver.\"  Id. at 94;  see also Nacirema Operating Co. v. S.S. Al Kulsum, 407 F.Supp. 1222, 1226 (S.D.N.Y.1975) (\"mere fact\" that stevedore billed ship's agent for services provided vessel \"not sufficient to indicate that there was an implied waiver of its right to a lien against the ship\").  There was no waiver here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Motor-Services' lien was not waived by its conduct, it is the execution of the other liens on the vessel in this in rem proceeding which would strip Motor-Services of its lien, which would be forever extinguished.  See supra note 26.  Clearly, there is ample prejudice to Motor-Services here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court stated that there were no special circumstances militating in favor of intervention because Motor-Services could still bring an action in personam against the vessel's owners.  The record is silent as to whether the defendants are presently solvent or not, but Motor-Services is justifiably fearful that this right would be an empty one.  At any rate, it is a right that pales in comparison to the right to exercise a lien against an identifiable sum of money.  In light of this, and the fact that trial was expedited, we think there were special circumstances favoring intervention.  Intervention should have been allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Coastal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our Coastal analysis, in substance, tracks the Motor-Services analysis.  Coastal moved to intervene on June 11, 1996, asserting a maritime lien for repair work done on the vessel and supplies furnished the vessel the previous summer.  The district court, by written opinion on July 3, denied the motion on untimeliness grounds.  The court applied the four-factor test discussed above, and its reasoning was much the same as that used in the Motor-Services' denial.  The only substantive difference in the court's analysis involved the third factor, where the court found that Coastal had explicitly waived its lien by agreeing to a payment plan with a clause obligating Coastal to forebear from going in rem against the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first factor, in finding that Coastal did not move expeditiously to protect its interests, the court stressed the 22-day gap between the time Coastal first learned of the arrest and the time it sought intervention.  We conclude that, under the unique circumstances of this case, Coastal acted reasonably promptly to protect its interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia was required, under the terms of its credit agreement with Coastal, to make monthly payments of $17,500;  payments were due on the 8th of each month, starting in April 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  Vasilia made only partial payment in April, and failed to make the May payment.  Coastal's president called Royal United on May 15, a week after the May 8 due date, to inquire about the non-payment.  He was informed by Royal United that there was an ongoing dispute with Navieros and Comet regarding the charter of the vessel.

If this were the case, any wrongful arrest or wrongful attachment would likely be harmless error, cured by the judgment.  The district court opinion, issued on June 7, does state \"[a]s of this date, the vessel is still detained at the port of San Juan, Puerto Rico, by virtue of the U.S. Coast Guard prohibition for the cited safety violations.\"   But there is no evidence in the record before us on this point.

And, indeed, neither Navieros nor Comet has appeared to defend the judgments in their favor.  However, in light of the affirmance of the district court's liability finding as to the two in personam defendants, it is possible that Navieros and/or Comet will seek to enforce their judgments against the in personam defendants.

Three claimants, in addition to the original charterer plaintiff, were allowed to intervene;  all four won judgments after a three-day, expedited bench trial.  Suit was originally brought in rem against the vessel.  The vessel's corporate owner and its shipping agent both appeared, however, in personam to defend the action, and were also held liable on two of the judgments (for the original charterer and another intervening charterer).  The proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy even these four successful claims.  Various other claimants, whose claims would further tax the available funds, were not allowed to intervene.  Three of these, the ship's captain and two repair companies, appeal.  The owner of the vessel, the shipping agent, and the vessel itself also appeal together, arguing that the district court's entry of judgment against them is in error, and hence that there should be no division of proceeds at all.  Alternatively, they argue that the two charterers were awarded excessive damages.  These four appeals were consolidated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment against the vessel and the two in personam defendants, but we vacate the damages awards to both charterers and remand for a reassessment of damages.

On the morning of March 28, 1996, Navieros Interamericanos S.A., Inc.  (\"Navieros\"), a Florida corporation, entered a fixed time charter party<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS on a standard New York Produce Exchange form through a ship's broker, Jan Gisholt Shipping, Inc., also of Florida.  According to the charter party, the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS was owned by Royal United Shipping, Inc.  (\"Royal United\"), and was registered in the West Indies.  During this litigation it was established that, despite this written representation, the vessel was actually owned by Vasilia, Inc.

Navieros intended to ship, on behalf of various clients, \"general merchandise, freight [of] all kinds, electrical material, toys, hardware, food stuffs, ... heavy equipment, ... road building construction-type machinery, and ... used vehicles.\"   The time charter party stated that delivery of the vessel to Navieros, the charterer, was to occur upon the vessel's arrival at the pilot station in Port Everglades, Florida, where Navieros's cargo was to be loaded.  The charter party stated that this would happen \"any time, day, night\" after the fixing of the charter on March 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 2:00 in the afternoon on March 28, Kenneth Coleman, the President of Navieros, boarded the vessel at dock in Miami, about 30 miles from Port Everglades.  Coleman discussed the stowage plan with the captain, Dusan Jeftimiades, and with Michael Psarellis and instructed the captain to berth at Pier 19 when he arrived at Port Everglades, instead of at the pilot station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS left its berth in Miami, apparently headed for Port Everglades.  The only deviation from the written agreement that Coleman had mentioned involved the berthing of the ship at a different point in Port Everglades, but the ship never reached Port Everglades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vessel experienced problems with its bridge tachometer and stopped for repairs at Bicentennial Park, still inside the Port of Miami.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Kenneth Coleman and his brother William, also a Navieros officer, visited the ship four or five times over the next week.  During this time, Navieros also ordered fuel for the vessel, confirmed its reservation of the berth space at Port Everglades, and issued the necessary check in payment of United States customs dues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this unexpected delay, Royal United, the putative owner of the vessel, entered into a second time charter party with Comet Lines Agency, Inc.  (\"Comet\"), which was unaware of the charter party with Navieros.  Royal United apparently believed at this time that the Navieros charter party had not yet been fixed.  The Comet charter party, brokered by Americana Marine Services, began on April 4 and was to last for a period of 30 days.  It brought a more lucrative charter rate, $2,630 per day, than did the Navieros charter.  Comet intended primarily to carry cargo between San Juan, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.  Since the vessel was in Miami at the start of the charter, Comet arranged to have some Venezuela-bound cargo brought down from Jacksonville and loaded there;  Comet's intention was to have the vessel proceed to San Juan where more cargo would be loaded, and then to sail to Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the vessel's arrival in the port of San Juan on April 13, however, the United States Coast Guard detained the vessel for a litany of safety violations and ordered it not to proceed to sea without Coast Guard approval.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navieros subsequently learned that the vessel was being detained in Puerto Rico.  On April 18, while the ship was still in detention, Navieros filed a complaint in the federal district court in Puerto Rico, initiating this litigation.  Initially, the action was in rem against the vessel to enforce an alleged maritime lien based on the breach of a time charter agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same day, April 18, the district court, in an ex parte proceeding, ordered the arrest of the vessel pursuant to Rule C of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule C allows the holder of a maritime lien to proceed in rem against the vessel that is the subject of the lien.  In its order, the court stated that Navieros had made a prima facie showing of a maritime lien against the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia, as claimant of the in rem defendant M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, filed a motion for a post-arrest hearing on April 23.  Vasilia claimed that the arrest of the vessel was improper because Navieros had no maritime lien.  The only argument advanced by Vasilia at this point against the existence of a lien was that the charter party between Navieros and Royal United had not been fixed.  A charterer's maritime lien, a right derived from a contract, will not arise in the absence of a fixed charter party, that is, in the absence of an enforceable contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Vasilia's motion, Navieros amended its complaint on April 24 and moved alternatively for attachment of the vessel under Supplemental Rule B. Navieros also added Royal United as an in personam defendant.  One of the pertinent differences between Rules C and B is that the latter does not require the existence of a maritime lien.  Rule B allows an admiralty plaintiff to acquire quasi in rem jurisdiction over a defendant by attaching his property in the district;  this approach is available only if the defendant \"shall not be found within the district.\"   As required by Rule B, Navieros submitted an affidavit stating that, to the best of its knowledge, after a diligent search, defendant Royal United could not be found within the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ordered attachment of the vessel pursuant to Rule B on April 29.  In its May 1, 1996 answer to Navieros's amended complaint, Vasilia reiterated that Navieros had no maritime lien because there was no fixed charter party.  Vasilia also filed a counterclaim against Navieros for wrongful arrest, and asserted that if the court should find that there was a fixed charter party, then the dispute \"would be subject to compulsory arbitration.\"   Vasilia did not move to compel arbitration at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, April 30, Vasilia filed a \"request for amended process of arrest\" in which it asserted that the Rule B attachment was wrongly ordered by the court because Vasilia had designated an agent in the district upon whom process could be served on behalf of Vasilia.  Navieros then amended its complaint again to name Vasilia as in personam defendant along with Royal United.  Trial ultimately proceeded on this second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same day, the court held a hearing and ordered the case expedited.  The court accelerated discovery and set a May 23 trial date.  The court later explained, in its June 7 memorandum opinion, that this rushed schedule was necessary because the vessel had \"a fair market value of $500,000,\" it \"was accruing significant expenditures incidental to the arrest,\" and there were \"liens or potential liens exceeding its fair market value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The court also denied Vasilia's motions to vacate the Rule C arrest of the vessel and the Rule B attachment of it.  The court stated that the arrest could be lifted by the posting of a $200,000 bond.  No bond was posted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, Vasilia<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> filed a \"second motion to vacate arrest and attachment and for second post-arrest hearing.\"   Vasilia now claimed that \"there are new reasons\" showing that the Rule C arrest was illegal.  Vasilia argued that Navieros had no maritime lien because the vessel had not been delivered to Navieros, the charter party was still executory, and a maritime lien will not arise from the breach of an executory charter party.  Vasilia cited for the first time Navieros's oft-repeated assertion in its pleadings that the vessel had not been delivered as required by the charter party.  Both in personam defendants then waived the requirement that they be served with process and waived any objections to lack of personal jurisdiction.  The court summarily denied Vasilia's motion on May 20, three days before trial commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, Comet and Transcaribbean Maritime Corp.  (\"Transcaribbean\") filed motions to intervene as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.  Comet is the second charterer;  like Navieros, it pleaded a breach of contract claim.  Transcaribbean is a San Juan-based ship's agent and stevedoring contractor which paid, on behalf of the vessel, harbor and port dues, pilot fees, and other expenses incidental to the ship's arrival and its subsequent detention in the Port of San Juan.  On May 20, the court allowed both claimants to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, on the eve of trial, Captain Jeftimiades filed a motion to intervene as plaintiff, asserting a maritime lien for unpaid seaman's wages.  On May 23, the day the trial started, Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Co.  (\"Gulf Coast\"), the holder of a first preferred mortgage on the vessel, filed a motion to intervene as plaintiff in order to request foreclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the start of trial, the court ruled from the bench on the two motions to intervene.  After establishing that neither Captain Jeftimiades nor his counsel were present in the courtroom, the judge ascertained from Navieros's counsel that Jeftimiades's counsel was aware that the trial was starting.  The court then denied Jeftimiades's motion to intervene, stating:Well, the captain is not here.  His lawyer is not here.  Everybody is aware of the fact that this case was being tried or there was no reason not to know.  Therefore, at this point in time I am denying for obvious lack of interest, they are not here, the motion for permission to intervene....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gulf Coast's motion to intervene was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this first day of trial, the court also ruled from the bench on Vasilia's motion to compel arbitration, filed the day before.  Vasilia's motion relied on an arbitration clause in the charter party between Navieros and Royal United (and on a similar clause in the charter party with Comet).  The motion came two days after Vasilia's pre-trial concession regarding the existence of a fixed charter with Navieros, a point Vasilia had been contesting until then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court characterized this motion as among the \"strongest\" of the many pre-trial motions, but nevertheless denied it.  The court stated that Vasilia had conducted itself thus far in the litigation in a manner inconsistent with a desire to enforce a contractual arbitration clause, and that it had \"by its actions moved away from its right to arbitrate.\"   Sending the case to arbitration, said the judge, would also, by causing further delay, increase the costs attendant to the continuing arrest of the vessel, and \"create a bigger problem for everybody here.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Vasilia admitted the existence and breach of a charter party with Navieros, trial proceeded on the question of damages alone.  Vasilia argued that Navieros had no right to arrest the vessel under Rule C or to attach it under Rule B. Moreover, Navieros's resort to these procedures, Vasilia said in its counterclaim, had caused Vasilia to breach its contract with Comet and to incur other liabilities.  Relying on the venerable executory contract doctrine, Vasilia argued that the Rule C arrest was improper because the vessel had not yet been delivered to Navieros at the time of the breach, and the charter party was still executory.  Consequently, argued Vasilia, Navieros had no maritime lien and its resort to Rule C was invalid.  Rule B attachment was also invalid, argued Vasilia, because this measure may only be invoked where the defendant cannot be found within the district, and Vasilia had appointed an agent within the district for service of process on its behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial concluded on May 29, and the court issued its written memorandum and order on June 7. The court upheld both the Rule C arrest and the Rule B attachment.  Rejecting Vasilia's Rule C argument, the court held that the vessel was effectively delivered to Navieros prior to the breach when Coleman boarded the vessel in Miami.  The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>Although the vessel was to be technically delivered at the pilot station in Port Everglades, a location less than thirty nautical miles away, due to the proximity of the locations, the master and Mr. Psarellis accepted Kenneth Coleman's instructions to proceed further to Port Everglades and, with a pilot, to berth at Pier 19 in Port Everglades for loading.  The vessel was, for all purposes, delivered to the charterer when Mr. Psarellis and the ship's master accepted Mr. Coleman's verbal instructions to proceed under the charter party agreement to Pier 19 at Port Everglades for loading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also upheld the Rule B attachment, rejecting Vasilia's argument that the attachment was improper because Vasilia had appointed an agent for service of process within the district.  The court emphasized that Vasilia, a Liberian corporation, had had no corporate presence whatsoever in the district.  The court stated that the eleventh hour appointment by Vasilia of counsel as local agent for service of process was a \"strategic appointment directed at defeating the necessity of the rule\" and could not be used to elude attachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court entered judgment against the vessel and the two in personam defendants:  for Navieros in the amount of $182,952;  for Comet in the amount of $100,312.13;  for Transcaribbean in the amount of $24,777.26;  and for Gulf Coast in the amount of $285,428.91.  The total of the judgments against Vasilia amounted to $593,470.30.  The court ordered that the vessel be sold by the United States Marshal at auction to satisfy these judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ruled that Gulf Coast had complied with the requirements of the Ship Mortgage Act, 46 U.S.C. &#167; 30101 et seq., and had successfully shown that it had a preferred mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The court, however, did not rank the four judgment winners.  Nor did the court know, at the time the judgments were handed down, how much money would be available from the eventual sale of the vessel to satisfy the judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several more would-be plaintiffs moved to intervene as a matter of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a) after the decision was handed down;  these motions were denied.  We discuss only those parties that appeal.  The first of these post-judgment movants was Motor-Services Hugo Stamp, Inc.  (\"Motor-Services\"), a Florida-based ship repair and supply company which sought to intervene on June 7, the day judgment issued.  Motor-Services asserted a maritime lien in the amount of $76,460.55 for unpaid receivables due for work done on the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS and materials supplied to it between February 28 and March 29, 1996.  The second post-judgment movant was Coastal Ship Repair, Inc.  (\"Coastal\"), a Louisiana corporation which sought intervention on June 11.  Coastal, too, asserted a maritime lien for moneys due for work performed and materials supplied the vessel, from May 2, 1995, through July 1, 1995.  Coastal asserted a lien in the amount of $144,800.  The court denied these two late motions on July 3 by separate written orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The public auction was held July 2, but the required minimum bid of $400,000 was not achieved.  A second auction was held on July 23 with a lower minimum of $300,000.  Gulf Coast, the first preferred mortgage holder, bought the ship for $300,000.  After confirmation of the sale, Jeftimiades, Coastal, and Motor-Services moved to stay disbursement of the proceeds until final resolution of these appeals.  This motion was granted, and the proceeds of the sale, less certain administrative costs and fees, remain in an escrow account pending resolution of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia appeals on four grounds:  (1) that the arrest and attachment were invalid;  (2) that the motion to compel arbitration was wrongly denied;  (3) that the court awarded both charterers, Navieros and Comet, excessive damages;  and (3) that the court improperly pierced Vasilia's corporate veil.  We resolve Vasilia's claims without the benefit of briefs from Navieros<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> or any of the other plaintiffs in whose favor judgment was entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Arrest and Attachment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia admitted before trial that it was in breach of the charter party with Navieros.  The main issue on appeal is whether Navieros was entitled to take the measures it took prior to trial regarding the vessel.  Vasilia's position remains that (1) Navieros had no maritime lien and thus no right to arrest and (2) Vasilia had appointed an agent within the district for service of process on its behalf and so attachment was improper.  Vasilia apparently infers that Navieros is responsible for the chain of events set in motion by the subsequent unavailability of the vessel:  i.e., the breach of the Comet charter;  Gulf Coast's decision to bring its foreclosure action;  and the need for Transcaribbean to incur the custodial costs associated with the arrest of the vessel.  Vasilia's position appears to be that Navieros should have brought an in personam suit against Vasilia for breach of contract, rather than moving against the vessel under Rules C and B, and that this would not have resulted in the same domino effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Navieros first invoked Rule C, seeking the arrest of the vessel on the basis of an asserted maritime lien.  After Vasilia challenged the existence of a maritime lien, Navieros moved alternatively for Rule B attachment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The two strategies, though similar in effect, are based on entirely different theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>An in rem action [under Rule C] differs from maritime attachment [under Rule B] in that an in rem action is brought against the vessel itself as defendant.  By contrast, a vessel is attached only as an auxiliary to an in personam claim because the vessel is property belonging to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Schoenbaum, supra, &#167; 21-3, at 478-79.  The district court ordered both Rule C arrest and Rule B attachment of the vessel, and ruled both procedures proper in its written opinion.  Vasilia challenges both rulings on appeal.  Either procedure standing alone would have been sufficient to enable Navieros to ensure the continued presence of the vessel in Puerto Rico while the litigation proceeded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.

This case involves a time charter agreement.  The district court relied heavily on the reasoning in E.A.S.T., where the court distinguished between voyage charters and time charters as to when the contract is no longer executory (and, consequently, as to when a maritime lien arises).  With voyage charters, whether control over the cargo shifted to the vessel will most likely determine whether a maritime lien exists.  E.A.S.T., 673 F.Supp. at 802-04.   With time charters, however, a maritime lien may arise even before control of the cargo shifts to the vessel.

As to the second inquiry, Vasilia argues that the attachment was wrongful because it had appointed an agent for service of process in the district.  But the fact is Vasilia's purported appointment of the agent came, at the earliest, on April 26, two days after Navieros moved for an order of attachment (and after Navieros filed an affidavit, as required by Supplemental Rule B, saying Navieros had been unable to find the defendant within the district).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was not unjustified in stating that Vasilia's argument would eviscerate the time-honored process of maritime attachment.

Indeed, Vasilia did assert, at various stages of the pleadings, that, if the court should determine the existence of a charter party, then the case should be removed to arbitration.  Had it moved for arbitration earlier, Vasilia says, this step could have been interpreted as a concession that the charter party was fixed, because the right to arbitration comes from a clause in the charter party.  By not moving until the day before trial, on the other hand, Vasilia was found to have waived the right.  Vasilia says the district court's position presented Vasilia with a Hobson's choice between admission and waiver.  Litigation frequently puts parties to hard choices, particularly as to which of seemingly inconsistent theories to pursue.

Indeed, the court's choice of words was at times confusing;  for instance, it titled the table of damages calculations \"Gross Loss of Revenue.\"   We must look past the question of word choice and determine if the correct measure was applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are the components of damages awarded Navieros:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) gross freight in the amount of $67,000, returned to shippers upon demand;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) canceled bills of lading issued in Guatemala, representing $118,000 of freight charges for three voyages;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) freight charges [of $71,175] on southbound cargo received in Port Everglades, eventually returned to shippers;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) net loss of $3,377 over $26,000 worth of freight rerouted through another steamship line providing service to Guatemala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this \"Gross Loss\" of $259,552, the court subtracted \"charter hire expense\" of $57,600 and \"fuel expense\" of $19,000.  The \"Net Loss\" was $182,952, and the court awarded damages in this amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the court subtracted charter hire and fuel expense from the sub-total seems to indicate that, despite its choice of words, the court did not see the award as one of lost \"revenues\" per se.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, a radically different conception of Navieros's lost profits is found in William Coleman's deposition.  Coleman stated that Navieros expected to make $28,500 in profits from the shipping of cargo under the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS charter (this estimate included the exercise by Navieros of its option on a third round-trip).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kenneth Coleman also testified at trial that Navieros charters approximately 50 voyages per year and that Navieros's 1995 net profits were roughly $495,000.  The average profit per voyage is thus just under $10,000.  Given this, it is hard to understand how the loss of the three M/V VASILIA EXPRESS voyages caused $182,952 in lost profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it is unclear on what basis the district court calculated lost profits, we vacate the damages award and remand the question of Navieros's damages to the district court for clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Comet</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge six of the thirteen components of the $100,312.13 award to Comet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  They claim (1) that Comet should not have been awarded the stevedoring fees ($4,500) and ship's agency fees ($4,999.26) incurred at the port of origin, Miami, because Comet would have incurred these expenses even if the charter had not been breached;  (2) that the award of fuel costs for both the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS ($5,312) and the replacement vessel secured by Comet ($7,326) was duplicative;  and (3) that the award of the entire cost of the substitute vessel ($15,000), along with the reimbursement of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS charter hire ($39,450), was likewise duplicative.  Defendants also argue that the district court \"failed to account for the fact that cargo problems were part of the reason why the U.S. Coast Guard initially detained the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS in Puerto Rico, which, along with the arrest by Navieros, led to the vessel's inability to carry Comet's cargo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final point borders on frivolous, in light of the numerous vessel-related and captain-related deficiencies cited by the Coast Guard.  See footnote 4 supra.   But the first three claims have considerable merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages award included reimbursement for the stevedoring costs associated with transferring the cargo from the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS to the replacement vessel.  In light of this, the award of costs for the original loading of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS was inappropriate.  The award of the stevedoring costs at the port of origin ($4,500) is thus vacated.  Comet did not make a claim for reimbursement for any shipping agency fee for the replacement vessel, so there was no double dipping there.  But that is also why the fee paid by Comet at the port of origin ($4,999.26) is not recoverable:  Comet apparently incurred no additional shipping agency costs as a result of the breach.  That award too is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was excessive recovery for the fuel costs too.  Comet should pay only for the fuel used by the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS on the initial Miami-San Juan run, which was completed before the breach, but not for the additional fuel, if any, that it deposited in that vessel's gas tanks in Miami in expectation of the continuation of the voyage to Venezuela.  Comet is also entitled to differential money damages;  that is, it should be reimbursed for that portion of the fuel purchased for the replacement vessel that was in excess of the expected cost of fuel for the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, had the latter ship fulfilled its contractual obligations. These are calculations that are necessarily based on estimates and expectations.  The record indicates that the replacement vessel consumed more fuel than the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS, but we are unable to glean precise details about this or about whether the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS was left with any Comet-purchased fuel when detained and arrested in the Port of San Juan, and if so, how much.  We thus vacate the two fuel cost awards ($5,312 &amp; $7,326) and remand to the district court for an amended award in light of this discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comet was awarded excessive damages for charter hire too.  Comet is entitled to differential damages.  Where the substitute vessel costs less than the one originally chartered, the charterer is entitled to a refund of the price paid for the original, but it should pay for the substitute.  If the replacement costs more, the charterer should get reimbursed for this difference in cost.  It is difficult to imagine a situation where the charterer would be entitled to a refund of the original charter hire and an award of replacement costs.  Here, Comet's replacement vessel ($15,000) cost less than the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS ($39,450).  Comet therefore is entitled to a refund of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS charter hire, but not to an award of costs for the hire of the replacement.  The $15,000 award is thus vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the appeals of the various would-be claimants whose motions for intervention were denied, and who thus missed out on the chance to compete for a share of the proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  We review a district court's denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion.

We analyze the district court's rulings against the backdrop of a purposefully accelerated litigation in which scarcely more than a month passed between the arrest of the vessel and the start of trial, with the memorandum and order admirably following trial by less than two weeks.  We are also mindful of the fact that the standards for timeliness are less strict for Rule 24(a) motions to intervene (intervention as a matter of right) than for such motions under Rule 24(b) (permissive intervention), and that all three appellants here invoked Rule 24(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Banco Popular, 964 F.2d at 1227 n. 2;  Fiandaca v.

We conclude that the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying Captain Jeftimiades's attempted intervention, but that it abused its discretion in denying the attempted interventions of Motor-Services and Coastal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Captain Jeftimiades</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Captain Jeftimiades, asserting a maritime lien for unpaid seaman's wages, moved to intervene a day before the start of trial.  The district judge denied Jeftimiades's motion from the bench on the first day of trial after learning that neither the captain nor his attorney were present in the courtroom.  Unlike the motions of Coastal and Motor-Services, the captain's motion was not denied on timeliness grounds;  indeed, the judge indicated that he probably would have allowed intervention had the captain or his attorney been present at the start of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge carefully determined that the captain's attorney had been duly informed of the trial date before announcing that he was denying the motion.  Jeftimiades does not argue on appeal that his counsel had not been informed of the May 23 trial date;  he simply states that counsel \"erroneously thought the trial date was May 30th\" and that he was in New Jersey on May 23 and could not have appeared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jeftimiades argues that his counsel's associate was available to represent the captain and that the court should have requested that this associate appear on the captain's behalf.  However, the judge was not told that counsel was out of the Commonwealth, and, while the judge certainly could have inquired further into the matter if he wished, he was not obliged to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Captain Jeftimiades also argues that, as a seaman, he is a ward of the court who is entitled to greater protection than the average intervenor.  Courts have allowed seamen to avoid rules of common law which affect them particularly harshly because of their vocation.  This is true where a rule of law has especially harsh results on a seaman because he is a seaman.   For instance, in Socony-Vacuum Oil Company v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103121\"><a href=\"/opinion/103121/socony-vacuum-oil-co-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 430-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103121\"><a href=\"/opinion/103121/socony-vacuum-oil-co-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 266-67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103121\"><a href=\"/opinion/103121/socony-vacuum-oil-co-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1939), the leading case cited by Jeftimiades, the Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether a seaman who had used a dangerous appliance on board could have his claim barred by the doctrine of assumption of risk.  The Court cautioned against the application of the doctrine in admiralty cases because seamen often have fewer alternatives than do land-based workers, and are often in less of a position to avoid dangerous situations.  Id. This case is easily distinguishable.  Captain Jeftimiades's failure to appear at trial through counsel is not explained by any special disabilities attendant to his status as a sailor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jeftimiades does not address the issue of whether there would be any prejudice to the existing plaintiffs if he were allowed now to intervene.  Clearly, there would be prejudice in light of the Coast Guard citation, which described Jeftimiades as drunk at the time the vessel was detained.  Vasilia or some of the claimants might have attempted at trial to prove that the captain forfeited his maritime lien for wages.  Cf. Johnston v. M/V Dieu Si Bon, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">866112</span></span> (W.D.Wa.1996) (question of fact whether seaman forfeited lien for wages by deserting ship).  Of course, no one made this argument at trial because the captain's attempted intervention was denied.  Allowing Jeftimiades to intervene now would necessitate ordering new proceedings in which the parties could attempt to make this claim.  We recognize that the prejudice to Jeftimiades is also severe,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> but he had the opportunity to make his case and did not take advantage of this chance.  There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Motor-Services</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motor-Services moved to intervene on June 7, two weeks after the start of trial and the day on which the district court issued its memorandum and order.  This motion was denied as untimely by written order on July 3. The court analyzed the motion under what it called \"the First Circuit standard of Banco Popular.\"   The timeliness standard applied in Banco Popular, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583859\"><a href=\"/opinion/583859/banco-popular-de-puerto-rico-v-david-greenblatt-the-official-secured/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, is derived from the Fifth Circuit opinion of Stallworth v. Monsanto Company, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span> (5th Cir.1977).  See Culbreath v.

Banco Popular, 964 F.2d at 1231.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, weighing the matter by relying on the facts as alleged by Motor-Services in the motion, first determined that the credit term extended to Vasilia by Motor-Services expired on April 29, and that from that date until June 7 Motor-Services sought payment of the overdue receivables only by leaving telephone messages that went unreturned.  The obvious implication of this finding (not stated by the court) is that Motor-Services sat on its rights when it should have been moving more decisively to protect its interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving on to the second factor, the court then noted that the proposed intervention would prejudice the existing parties because:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>intervention on the day judgment was entered seeks to disturb the core of the judgment.  The M/V VASILIA EXPRESS is appraised at $500,000 and the court has recognized plaintiffs by judgment in the aggregate amount of $593,469.39.  The realities of the public sale market for vessels dictated that the public sale ordered would have an initial bidding price set at $400,000.  Any sale proceeds will not be enough to cover the existing plaintiffs' rights.  It is not fair to reopen the case for late-comers to gain an undue advantage under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court next found that no prejudice would inure to Motor-Services as a result of the denial of the motion because Motor-Services had waived its maritime lien by relying on the credit of Michael and Steven Psarellis, the vessel owners, and the credit of Royal United, the shipping agency.  Finally, the court found that there were no exceptional circumstances militating in favor of intervention, as Motor-Services, in the court's view, would still be fully able to litigate the matter in personam against the vessel owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of the intervention was, in large part, based on erroneous legal conclusions reached by the district court.  We believe the district court abused its discretion and that Motor-Services should have been allowed to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that the first factor weighed against Motor-Services because Motor-Services should have realized, as of April 29, that its interests were imperilled, but it failed to do anything about this until June 7, other than to try a few times (unsuccessfully) to reach the vessel owners by telephone.  In the context of this expedited litigation, a period of inaction lasting nearly six weeks would be difficult to excuse.  But the dates recited are not correct.  In fact, it was not until May 19 that the Vasilia account became overdue and Motor-Services actively sought to collect but was misled by the owners.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  Less than three weeks later, and within a few days of learning of the suit, Motor-Services had a motion before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the days after May 19, the president of Motor-Services attempted to reach the vessel owners by telephone on three separate occasions.  He was told that the owners would get back to him, but they never did.  The secretary who answered the phone did not tell him about the arrest of the M/V VASILIA EXPRESS.  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that Motor-Services, which was actively trying to follow up on a recently overdue account, was guilty of inaction.  It was not until June 3 that Motor-Services actually learned of the arrest of the vessel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Local counsel was retained the next day, and the motion to intervene was filed shortly thereafter, on June 6. Motor-Services had no way of knowing its maritime lien was imperilled prior to June 3;  once it learned, it took prompt action to protect its interest.  The first factor thus clearly militates in favor of allowing intervention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in discussing the second factor, concluded that the existing plaintiffs would be prejudiced by Motor-Services' intervention simply because the entry into the case of another party, with an arguably superior lien, would diminish the ultimate recovery available to those plaintiffs.  This may well be true, but it is not enough to outweigh the other three factors, all of which favor intervention (particularly since the plaintiffs' rights to a specific share in the recovery had not yet become final and the sale proceeds had not yet been disbursed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the third factor, the court found that there was no prejudice to Motor-Services because Motor-Services had waived its maritime lien.  This was error.  In inferring that Motor-Services had waived its maritime lien on the vessel, the court relied on the existence of a promissory note given by Michael Psarellis to Motor-Services and on the fact that Motor-Services billed Royal United, the vessel's agent, rather than the vessel owners for much of the work done on the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motor-Services' maritime lien on the vessel arises by operation of federal law (the Maritime Lien Act).  46 U.S.C. &#167; 31342.

There was no waiver here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Motor-Services' lien was not waived by its conduct, it is the execution of the other liens on the vessel in this in rem proceeding which would strip Motor-Services of its lien, which would be forever extinguished.  See supra note 26.  Clearly, there is ample prejudice to Motor-Services here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court stated that there were no special circumstances militating in favor of intervention because Motor-Services could still bring an action in personam against the vessel's owners.  The record is silent as to whether the defendants are presently solvent or not, but Motor-Services is justifiably fearful that this right would be an empty one.  At any rate, it is a right that pales in comparison to the right to exercise a lien against an identifiable sum of money.  In light of this, and the fact that trial was expedited, we think there were special circumstances favoring intervention.  Intervention should have been allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Coastal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our Coastal analysis, in substance, tracks the Motor-Services analysis.  Coastal moved to intervene on June 11, 1996, asserting a maritime lien for repair work done on the vessel and supplies furnished the vessel the previous summer.  The district court, by written opinion on July 3, denied the motion on untimeliness grounds.  The court applied the four-factor test discussed above, and its reasoning was much the same as that used in the Motor-Services' denial.  The only substantive difference in the court's analysis involved the third factor, where the court found that Coastal had explicitly waived its lien by agreeing to a payment plan with a clause obligating Coastal to forebear from going in rem against the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first factor, in finding that Coastal did not move expeditiously to protect its interests, the court stressed the 22-day gap between the time Coastal first learned of the arrest and the time it sought intervention.  We conclude that, under the unique circumstances of this case, Coastal acted reasonably promptly to protect its interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vasilia was required, under the terms of its credit agreement with Coastal, to make monthly payments of $17,500;  payments were due on the 8th of each month, starting in April 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  Vasilia made only partial payment in April, and failed to make the May payment.  Coastal's president called Royal United on May 15, a week after the May 8 due date, to inquire about the non-payment.  He was informed by Royal United that there was an ongoing dispute with Navieros and Comet regarding the charter of the vessel.  While this is more information than Motor-Services was able to obtain when Vasilia failed to make its payment to Motor-Services at about the same time (May 19), Coastal, like Motor-Services, was not told of the arrest and the impending trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Coastal heard something about an arrest through other channels<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> during the week of May 20, but the information it obtained consisted only of \"unconfirmed reports.\"   Coastal moved expeditiously to confirm these reports.  By early June, it had learned the details, and by June 11 had moved to intervene.  That Motor-Services managed to get its motion in four days earlier is immaterial.  The first factor weighs in Coastal's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the other factors, Coastal is in a similar position to Motor-Services and we will not repeat the analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  Two of the remaining three factors clearly favor intervention, and intervention should have been allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment against the defendants, but vacate the awards of damages to Navieros and Comet and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

If this were the case, any wrongful arrest or wrongful attachment would likely be harmless error, cured by the judgment.  The district court opinion, issued on June 7, does state \"[a]s of this date, the vessel is still detained at the port of San Juan, Puerto Rico, by virtue of the U.S. Coast Guard prohibition for the cited safety violations.\"   But there is no evidence in the record before us on this point.
