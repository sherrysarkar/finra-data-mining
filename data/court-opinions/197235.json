On  October   13,  1994,\r                    TORRUELLA,  Chief   Judge.\r                                             \r\n\nDefendant-Appellant Thomas D'Andrea (\"D'Andrea\") was  indicted on\r\n\none count of  bank fraud in violation of 18  U.S.C.   1344 (Count\r\n\nOne) and six  counts of  making false statements  to a  federally\r\n\ninsured financial institution in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    1014.\r\n\nAfter  a two-week trial in the  District Court of Rhode Island, a\r\n\njury found D'Andrea  guilty on  all counts.   The district  court\r\n\nsentenced D'Andrea to  five years' imprisonment on Count  One and\r\n\ntwo  years' imprisonment  for each  of the  other counts,  to run\r\n\nconcurrently, and  three years'  supervised release on  Count One\r\n\nand one year supervised release on the  other counts, also to run\r\n\nconcurrently.   In addition, the district  court ordered D'Andrea\r\n\nto make restitution  to the Resolution  Trust Corporation in  the\r\n\namount  of $2.2 million for losses related to the fraudulent loan\r\n\nactivities.  D'Andrea now claims errors related to both the trial\r\n\nand sentencing phases.   Concluding that  the district court  did\r\n\nnot commit error, we affirm D'Andrea's conviction and sentence.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In  late  1988, D'Andrea,  Robert  D'Andrea (D'Andrea's\r\n\nbrother),  Gary Lowenstein,  and Michael  Tulman applied  for and\r\n\nobtained a  $2.88 million loan  from New England  Federal Savings\r\n\nBank  (\"New England Federal\" or  \"the bank\"), a federally insured\r\n\ninstitution.   The loan was obtained for the purpose of acquiring\r\n\na warehouse and truck terminal located in Cranston, Rhode Island.\r\n\nBecause  the bank would  only lend  up to  eighty percent  of the\r\n\ntotal purchase price of the warehouse, D'Andrea, and at least one\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nof the sellers of the property, Frank Paolino, schemed to inflate\r\n\nthe  purchase price of the  warehouse from just  over two million\r\n\ndollars  to $4.18 million.   By so inflating  the price, D'Andrea\r\n\nwas able to  receive from the  bank a loan in  the amount of  the\r\n\npurchase  price,   thereby  relieving  himself   and  his  fellow\r\n\npurchasers  of the burden of putting  any of their own money into\r\n\nthe purchase of the warehouse.\r\n\n          The scheme  went as  follows.  D'Andrea  represented to\r\n\nNew  England  Federal that  the  purchasers  would pay  the  $1.3\r\n\nmillion difference  required to  meet the $4.18  million purchase\r\n\nprice.  In  order to make up  this gap, D'Andrea submitted  false\r\n\nrecords to the bank indicating that certain deposits  had already\r\n\nbeen  made to  the  sellers.   In  addition, the  bank  requested\r\n\nagreements  indicating the  amount of  rent paid  by each  of the\r\n\ntenants  at the warehouse.  D'Andrea forged the signatures of the\r\n\nofficers  of each of the  warehouse tenants on  documents that he\r\n\nthen submitted to the  bank.  D'Andrea also submitted  a document\r\n\nto  the bank  indicating  a tenant-landlord  relationship with  a\r\n\ncompany  that never rented space at the warehouse.  Two witnesses\r\n\ntestified that  D'Andrea presented them with  copies of documents\r\n\ncontaining falsified rental amounts for tenants at the warehouse.\r\n\nD'Andrea  also  admitted  that  he forged  tenant  signatures  on\r\n\ntenant-at-will agreements without the  knowledge or permission of\r\n\nofficials at the tenant-companies.\r\n\n          During the course of the trial, D'Andrea testified that\r\n\nhe took  pains to pay off the $2.88 million loan from New England\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nFederal.    On  cross-examination  of  D Andrea,  the  government\r\n\nelicited testimony that he used proceeds from a $5.9 million loan\r\n\nfrom  Rhode Island Central  Credit Union to pay  off part of that\r\n\nloan.   D'Andrea obtained this  loan along with  four others, the\r\n\nZarella brothers.1   D'Andrea  testified that, in  obtaining this\r\n\nloan,  he forged the signatures of the Zarella brothers  wives on\r\n\na guarantee form.\r\n\n          Finally,  D'Andrea used the  warehouse property located\r\n\nin  Cranston, Rhode  Island, obtained  through the  use of  false\r\n\ndocuments, as security  for yet another  loan, for $585,000  from\r\n\nRhode Island Central Credit Union.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          D'Andrea makes numerous claims on appeal, most of which\r\n\nwe  discern to be  related to his  sentencing.   We will consider\r\n\neach argument individually.\r\n\nI.  Government's Use of the Phrase \"Straw Borrowers\"\r          I.  Government's Use of the Phrase \"Straw Borrowers\"\r\n\n          Without citation to  any supporting case law,  D'Andrea\r\n\nargues as follows:\r\n\n            At trial, over D'Andrea's  objection, the\r\n            prosecutor   repeatedly  asked   D'Andrea\r\n            whether he used 'straw borrowers   in his\r\n            dealings with Rhode Island Central Credit\r\n            Union.  . .  .    D'Andrea  denied  using\r\n            'straws', but regardless, the  jury could\r\n            not  have  been  unaffected, because  the\r\n            term 'straw borrowers'  was a  hot-button\r\n            term repeatedly used by the news media to\r\n            describe unsophisticated participants  in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   This name  is spelled \"Zarella\"  in the  trial transcript and\r\n\"Zarrella\" in the sentencing hearing transcript.  For purposes of\r\nconsistency, we will use the spelling \"Zarella.\"  Some quotations\r\ntaken from Appellant's Brief contain the spelling \"Zarrella.\"\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            real  estate  ventures who  were  said to\r\n            [have]  been induced  to  join with  real\r\n            estate developers  in funding speculative\r\n            and unsound real estate ventures.\r\n\nWe read this  statement to  be an argument  that the  prejudicial\r\n\neffect of the government's  use of the term \"straw  borrowers\" so\r\n\noutweighed  its probative  value that  the district  court should\r\n\nhave barred use of  the term.  \"Unfairly prejudicial  evidence is\r\n\nevidence . . .  that 'triggers [the] mainsprings of  human action\r\n\n[in  such a way  as to]  cause the jury  to base  its decision on\r\n\nsomething other  than the established proposition  in the case.'\"\r\n\nUnited  States  v.  Currier, 836  F.2d  11,  18  (1st Cir.  1987)\r                                     \r\n\n(quoting 1 Weinstein's Evidence   403, 36-39 (1986)).\r\n\n          We review  a district  court's evidentiary  rulings for\r\n\nabuse of discretion.   United States v. Trenkler, 61  F.3d 45, 56\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1995).    We  grant  a  district  court's on-the-spot\r\n\ndetermination of  prejudice and probativeness  wide latitude  and\r\n\n\"'[o]nly   in  exceptional  circumstances  will  we  reverse  the\r\n\nexercise of a district  court's informed discretion vis-a-vis the\r\n\nrelative  weighing of  probative value  and unfairly  prejudicial\r\n\neffect.'\"  United States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1252 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1996)  (quoting  Currier, 836  F.2d  at 18),  petition  for cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\nfiled, No. 96-1176, 65 U.S.L.W. 3531 (Nov. 12, 1996).\r               \r\n\n          Although  the  judge  did  not  make  explicit findings\r\n\nregarding the probativeness of the inquiry into the use of \"straw\r\n\nborrowers,\"  the  government  stated  that it  was  pursuing  the\r\n\ninquiry  as   rebuttal  to  D'Andrea's  statement   that  he  had\r\n\napproximately  $100,000  on  deposit with  Rhode  Island  Central\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nCredit  Union when the credit  union closed.   The government was\r\n\nattempting to show that, although D Andrea lost a significant sum\r\n\nof money because of the failure of the credit union, he also owed\r\n\nthe credit union  millions of dollars, including money from loans\r\n\nobtained using others' names.\r\n\n          The  government s line of questioning was probative for\r\n\nrebuttal purposes and was limited in  nature.  \"Rebuttal evidence\r\n\nmay  be introduced to  explain, repel, contradict  or disprove an\r\n\nadversary's  proof.\"  United States  v. Laboy, 909  F.2d 581, 588\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1990).  Moreover, once the government established in a\r\n\nmatter of  five questions that  D'Andrea claimed no  knowledge of\r\n\nsuch loans, it moved  on and did  not refer to \"straw  borrowers\"\r\n\nagain during the course of the trial.  We find  that the district\r\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion.\r\n\nII.  Sentencing Issues\r          II.  Sentencing Issues\r\n\n          A.  Relevant Conduct\r                    A.  Relevant Conduct\r\n\n          D'Andrea's  next  claim  of  error  suggests  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's judgment during  sentencing was somehow tainted\r\n\nby its consideration of the term \"straw borrowers\":\r\n\n            D'Andrea's  prominent  role  as  a  major\r\n            borrower   from  [Rhode   Island  Central\r\n            Credit Union] could not have been ignored\r\n            by Judge  Lagueux  in his  assessment  of\r\n            D'Andrea's  culpability,  and it  was his\r\n            involvement  in  the latter  that fatally\r\n            infected the court's judgment in  the New\r\n            England  Federal Savings Bank case. . . .\r\n            D'Andrea  was   not  on  trial   for  his\r\n            activities  involving the  RISDIC-insured\r\n            credit   unions;  and   the  prosecutor's\r\n            questions  [regarding \"straw  borrowers\"]\r\n            were clearly intended to inflame the jury\r\n            and the court.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n               In   considering    the   Government's\r\n            position, Judge  Lagueux noted D'Andrea's\r\n            objections,  but   considered  D'Andrea's\r\n            forgery  of  the  Zarrella  wive's  [sic]\r\n            signatures  on  the  loan   guarantee  as\r\n            \"relevant conduct\". . . .\r\n\n               At  the  same  time  the  trial  judge\r\n            assumed  that  the  Zarrellas['] role  in\r                             \r\n            that  transaction was  . .  . fraudulent,\r\n            and   he   made  no   finding   that  the\r\n            Zarrellas, or for that matter, any of the\r\n            other  alleged   \"straw  borrowers\"  were\r\n            involved  in  a scheme  to  defraud Rhode\r\n            Island   Central   Credit   Union,   were\r\n            unsophisticated   investors,    or   were\r\n            unaware  of  the  obligations  they  were\r\n            incurring . . . .\r\n\nAppellant's  Brief  at  22-24.   Although  appellant s  brief  is\r\n\ndifficult to  decipher, D'Andrea  appears to object  both to  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  consideration  of  D'Andrea's forgery  of  the\r\n\nZarellas'   wives'  signatures  and   to  the   district  court's\r\n\nconsideration  of  the  alleged  fraudulent nature  of  the  loan\r\n\nD'Andrea obtained from Rhode Island Central Credit Union with the\r\n\nZarellas.  Both claims lack merit.\r\n\n          First,   the   district   court's  determination   that\r\n\nD'Andrea's forgery constituted \"relevant conduct\" is a finding of\r\n\nfact,  which we review for clear error.  United States v. Tejada-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBeltr n, 50  F.3d 105, 109 (1st  Cir. 1995).  For  the sentencing\r                 \r\n\ncourt  to   consider  uncharged  conduct   at  sentencing,   \"the\r\n\ngovernment must  show a sufficient nexus between  the conduct and\r\n\nthe offense  of conviction by  a preponderance of  the evidence.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Young, 78 F.3d  758, 763 (1st Cir. 1996).  Under\r                                \r\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, \"relevant conduct\" includes acts \"that\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nwere part of the same course of conduct or common  scheme or plan\r\n\nas the offense of conviction.\"  U.S.S.G.   1B1.3.  For actions in\r\n\nthe Rhode  Island Central Credit  Union loan acquisition  and the\r\n\ncharged offense to be considered part of a common scheme or plan,\r\n\n\"they must be substantially  connected to each other by  at least\r\n\none common  factor, such  as common victims,  common accomplices,\r\n\ncommon purpose, or  similar modus operandi.\"   U.S.S.G.    1B1.3,\r\n\nCommentary.\r\n\n          We believe  that the district court  properly concluded\r\n\nthat the use of forgery to obtain the Rhode Island Central Credit\r\n\nUnion loan was  part of  the same  scheme or  plan as  D Andrea s\r\n\nfraudulent  efforts to obtain the loan  from New England Federal.\r\n\nD'Andrea  used  proceeds  from  the  fraudulently  obtained  $5.9\r\n\nmillion  credit union  loan  to pay  off  portions of  the  first\r\n\nfraudulently  obtained bank  loan.   This, as the  district court\r\n\nnoted,  amounted to a scheme by which D'Andrea \"robb[ed] Peter to\r\n\npay  Paul.\"  Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, September 7, 1995,\r\n\nat 16.  We cannot find any error here, let alone clear error.\r\n\n          Second,  the record  offers  some indication  that  the\r\n\nsentencing court considered D'Andrea's  use of straw borrowers as\r\n\npart of the fraud  he perpetrated on Rhode Island  Central Credit\r\n\nUnion  to obtain  the  $5.9  million  loan.    To  be  considered\r\n\n\"relevant conduct,\" the government  must prove D'Andrea's actions\r\n\nby  a preponderance of the  evidence.  At  trial, D Andrea denied\r\n\nuse of straw borrowers  and nothing in the  pre-sentencing report\r\n\nsupports, by a preponderance of the evidence, the conclusion that\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nD'Andrea used the Zarellas as straw borrowers.  Although, on this\r\n\nrecord,  it does not appear that a  showing by a preponderance of\r\n\nthe evidence  was made by the government regarding D'Andrea's use\r\n\nof  straw borrowers, we have already determined that the loan was\r\n\nproperly before  the  court as  \"relevant conduct\"  based on  the\r\n\nforgery.\r\n\n          Moreover,  at  the  sentencing  proceeding,  D'Andrea's\r\n\ntrial counsel objected to enhancement of D Andrea s offense level\r\n\non the basis of his use of  straw borrowers only as it related to\r\n\nwhat he considered triple counting:  use of the loan to calculate\r\n\nthe  measure  of  loss  as  a  result  of  D'Andrea's  fraudulent\r\n\nactivities; use of the loan as \"relevant conduct\"; and use of the\r\n\nloan  to determine D'Andrea's role in the offense.2  D'Andrea did\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  D'Andrea's counsel's objection was stated as follows:\r\n\n            In addition, your  Honor, it's  counsel's\r\n            opinion  that all  of the  reference with\r\n            respect to the adjustment for the role of\r\n            the offense  of  straw borrowers  in  the\r\n            state  case, cases, is, again, an attempt\r\n            with an increase of  a level 4 to subject\r\n            Mr. D'Andrea to additional punishment for\r\n            something that  has not been  decided.  I\r\n            realize there are  federal cases that say\r\n            in fact  that can be  done.  My  point is\r\n            that it's being  done three times to  him\r\n            on  three  different  levels   for  three\r\n            different  types  of consideration  under\r\n            the  guidelines.   I  don't  think that's\r\n            appropriate.    Certainly  if  the  Court\r\n            finds that it's \"relevant conduct\" it can\r\n            consider it.   But it considers  it as to\r\n            the  amount  of  the  loan,   as  to  the\r\n            \"relevant    conduct\",    as    to    his\r\n            participation in the  offense.  It's  all\r\n            the  same   thing.    But  yet   he  gets\r\n            increased   levels   for  that   kind  of\r\n            activity   and   I  don't   think  that's\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nnot object  that the  government  had failed  to prove  uncharged\r\n\n\"straw borrowers\" conduct  by a preponderance of  the evidence to\r\n\njustify its consideration as \"relevant conduct,\" as he appears to\r\n\ncharge here.   Because  D'Andrea did  not preserve this  argument\r\n\nbelow, we  review only  for plain  error.   See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBennett, 60  F.3d 902, 905 (1st Cir. 1995) (rejecting appellant s\r                 \r\n\nargument  raised  for the  first time  on appeal  where different\r\n\nargument  accompanied  his  objection below);  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nTutiven, 40 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying plain  error to\r                 \r\n\nsentencing argument that was  not preserved below), cert. denied,\r                                                                          \r\n\n115 S.

Because  the  $5.9  million  loan  was\r\n\nproperly before the sentencing  court as \"relevant conduct\" based\r\n\non the forgeries alone, the district court's consideration of the\r\n\nloan based on other factors cannot be plain error.\r\n\n          B.

The New England Federal Loan\r\n\n          Regarding  the  New  England  Federal   loan,  D'Andrea\r\n\ncontends that the loss  of $2.2 million3 to New  England Federal,\r\n\nand  its successor, Resolution Trust  Corporation, had more to do\r\n\nwith the economic climate in which  it later sold the property to\r\n\nrecover  some of  its  loss than  it  had to  do with  D'Andrea's\r\n\nconduct.  He appears to argue that the district court should have\r\n\nrecognized the  multiple loss causation and  departed downward to\r\n\naccommodate it.\r\n\n          We begin by noting that the loss table in section 2F1.1\r\n\nof the  Sentencing Guidelines \"presumes that  the defendant alone\r\n\nis  responsible for the entire amount of victim loss specified in\r\n\nthe  particular loss  range  selected by  the sentencing  court.\"\r\n\nUnited States v.

Such\r\n            situations   typically   occur   when   a\r\n            misrepresentation    is     of    limited\r\n            materiality or is  not the sole cause  of\r\n            the loss.  . . .

The Rhode Island Central Credit Union Loan\r                      2.  The Rhode Island Central Credit Union Loan\r\n\n          D'Andrea's  argument here appears  to suggest  that the\r\n\n$5.9 million loss was  not foreseeable to him because  he thought\r\n\nhe  was  negotiating a  non-recourse  loan.   At  trial, D'Andrea\r\n\ncontended that he was convinced after discussions with the credit\r\n\nunion's  president, John Lanfredi, that  the loan was  to be non-\r\n\nrecourse and, therefore, the bank could  not pursue the borrowers\r\n\nfor   recourse  in  the  event  of  default.    Because  of  this\r\n\nmisperception, D'Andrea seems  to suggest that he  could not have\r\n\nforeseen the loss  and thus cannot be held liable  for the amount\r\n\nof that loss.\r\n\n          The  record  shows  only  the  following  comment  from\r\n\nD'Andrea's  counsel   regarding  the  loss  calculation:     \"The\r\n\ndefendant contends under Section F1.1(b)(1)(L) that the principal\r\n\nand actual loss was  1.3 million and no  other factors should  be\r\n\nconsidered to  determine the characteristic level.\"   Addendum to\r\n\nthe  Presentence Report, at 2.  We accordingly find that D'Andrea\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfailed to  preserve any  foreseeability argument for  appeal, and\r\n\nreview only  for plain error.   Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d at  775.  We\r                                                     \r\n\ndiscern no such error here.\r\n\n          C.  Role in the Offense\r                    C.  Role in the Offense\r\n\n          D'Andrea argues  that  the sentencing  court  committed\r\n\nreversible error when it determined, in finding that D'Andrea was\r\n\na  \"leader\" or  \"organizer\"  under U.S.S.G.  section 3B1.1,  that\r\n\nD'Andrea's  fraud  included at  least  five  participants or  was\r\n\notherwise  extensive.   D'Andrea presents  no caselaw  to support\r\n\nthis proposition.  Typically,  finding an error of this  sort, we\r\n\nvacate  the  sentence and  remand  to  the sentencing  court  for\r\n\nresentencing.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Wester, 90  F.3d 592,\r                                                            \r\n\n599-600  (1st  Cir.  1996)  (vacating  appellant's  sentence  and\r\n\nremanding  case for  resentencing upon  a determination  that the\r\n\nsentencing  court  had not  made  clear  and legally  supportable\r\n\nfindings that the defendant was a  leader or organizer of a fraud\r\n\ninvolving  five  or  more  participants  or  that  was  otherwise\r\n\nextensive).\r\n\n          The district court's findings regarding D'Andrea's role\r\n\nin  the offense are fact-intensive  and we review  them for clear\r\n\nerror.  See United States v.  Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 413 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1995).  In  finding that D'Andrea  was a  leader or organizer  of\r\n\nthis fraud, the sentencing court determined the following:\r\n\n            There's  no  question   that  he  was  an\r\n            organizer or leader  of this  transaction\r\n            and   he   enlisted  two   other  people,\r\n            [Tulman]   and    Lowenstein,   in   this\r\n            transaction.      There's   very   little\r\n            evidence  about  [Tulman]  or  Lowenstein\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n            that  was  presented  in  this  case  but\r\n            certain[ly] they had to be aware of  some\r\n            of the Defendant's activities in securing\r\n            this fraudulent loan and making all these\r\n            false statements with  the bank.  Paolino\r\n            was in effect a co-conspirator  with him.\r\n            The  evidence is clear  on that.  Paolino\r\n            had  to know  that this  was a  great big\r\n            fraud,  that the real  purchase price for\r\n            the  property  was $2.8  million  and not\r\n            $4.1  million as  stated in  the purchase\r\n            and sale agreement.  . . .  [Pat Paolino]\r\n            did  [D'Andrea's] road running to get all\r\n            the fraudulent tenant letters together to\r\n            fool  the bank.   And  Michael Favicchio,\r\n            another  actor  in   this,  he  was   the\r\n            mortgage broker.  He was the most nervous\r\n            witness  I ever saw on the witness stand.\r\n            Michael Favicchio knew what was going on.\r\n            He wanted  his fee  as a mortgage  broker\r\n            and  so he transmitted  all this material\r\n            that was coming from the Defendant to the\r\n            bank.   He didn't  tell all he  knew from\r\n            the   witness   stand   but   he   was  a\r\n            participant   in   this   fraud   whether\r\n            wittingly or unwittingly.   So there were\r\n            at  least  five   participants  in   this\r\n            particular  fraud  and, of  course, there\r\n            were the  Zarrellas in the  other banking\r\n            fraud  with  Rhode Island  Central Credit\r\n            Union  and  his forgery  of  the Zarrella\r\n            wives' signatures.   So  it  seems to  me\r\n            that the first test is met that he was an\r\n            organizer  or  leader with  five  or more\r\n            participants.   In any  event, it  was an\r\n            otherwise extensive fraud  and there  was\r\n            one other co-conspirator, Paolino, and so\r\n            both prongs of that adjustment are met in\r\n            this case  and  the total  offense  level\r\n            should be increased by four.\r\n\nTranscript of Sentencing  Hearing, at  18-19.  A  court making  a\r\n\nfour-level role-in-the-offense adjustment under  U.S.S.G. section\r\n\n3B1.1(a) must first determine \"whether the defendant acted as  an\r\n\norganizer/leader of  a specific  criminal activity.

D'Andrea does  not challenge the sentencing court's\r\n\ninitial  finding that he was  an organizer or  leader of criminal\r\n\nactivity.   His  argument focuses  on whether the  district court\r\n\nproperly found five participants in his fraud.\r\n\n          The record  indicates that  the district court  set out\r\n\nthe  individuals involved  in the  transaction, without  making a\r\n\nspecific  finding that  each was  a \"participant.\"   We  need not\r\n\ndetermine,  however, whether  the  court could  have  found by  a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence that D'Andrea's fraud involved five\r\n\ncriminally  responsible  \"participants.\"   \"Since  the   relevant\r\n\nlanguage  of subsection[]  (a)  . .  .   is  disjunctive,  either\r\n\nextensiveness or numerosity is a sufficient predicate for a . . .\r\n\nfour-level upward adjustment.\"   Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 413.

D'Andrea's criminal activity, including relevant\r\n\nconduct, involved  a  fraud against  two  financial  institutions\r\n\nwhereby  he obtained  loans  for  a  total  of  $8.1  million  by\r\n\nsubmitting to those  institutions documents that  contained false\r\n\nfinancial information  and the  forged signatures of  tenants and\r\n\nguarantors.

He  conspired with Frank  Paolino, a participant  under\r\n\nsection  3B1.1, to falsify the actual sale price of the property.\r\n\nHe manipulated  figures involved  in the transaction  to indicate\r\n\nthat  he and  his co-purchasers  were investing  $1.3  million of\r\n\ntheir  own money  into the  sale,  when, in  fact, they  were not\r\n\ninvesting any  of their own money.   He also used  the witting or\r\n\nunwitting services  of  Michael Favicchio,  Pat Paolino,  Michael\r\n\nTulman, and  Gary  Lowenstein to  secure  the $2.88  million  New\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nEngland  Federal loan, and of the four Zarella brothers and their\r\n\nwives, to  obtain the  $5.9 million  Rhode Island  Central Credit\r\n\nUnion loan.   We find  that the sentencing  court quite  properly\r\n\ndetermined that D'Andrea's fraudulent schemes were  extensive and\r\n\nthus supported a four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement.\r\n\n          D'Andrea  further argues  that  the sentencing  judge's\r\n\ndetermination  that  his   criminal  activities  were   extensive\r\n\nimpermissibly mixes \"legitimate loans and  development activities\r\n\nwith isolated instances of criminal conduct.\"  Absolutely nothing\r\n\nin the record indicates that the sentencing judge considered  any\r                                                                           \r\n\nactivities,  legitimate or illegitimate,  beyond those related to\r\n\nthe New  England Federal and  Rhode Island  Central Credit  Union\r\n\nloans.   This argument, unsupported by the record, does not alter\r\n\nour finding of no error  in the sentencing court's  extensiveness\r\n\ndetermination.\r\n\n          D.  Obstruction of Justice\r                    D.  Obstruction of Justice\r\n\n          The  sentencing court enhanced  D'Andrea's base offense\r\n\nlevel by  two points  for obstruction  of justice  under U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  3C1.1.  Under that section, the sentencing court must  increase\r\n\nthe offense level by two \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed\r\n\nor   impeded,   or  attempted   to   obstruct   or  impede,   the\r\n\nadministration  of justice during the investigation, prosecution,\r\n\nor sentencing of  the instant offense . . . .\"  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1.\r\n\nPerjury  falls within the scope  of obstruction of  justice.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3C1.1,  Commentary.  The  sentencing court found  that\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nD'Andrea committed perjury on  four separate occasions during the\r\n\ntrial:\r\n\n            I  conclude  that  two points  should  be\r\n            added for obstruction of  justice because\r\n            the  Defendant  committed perjury  during\r\n            this  trial.   He committed  perjury time\r\n            and time again.  His main approach to his\r\n            testimony  was  to  lie about  everything\r\n            until he was  backed up against  the wall\r\n            and then he admitted the  truth, admitted\r\n            forgery,  but  then tried  to rationalize\r\n            them.   I  can think  of  four  instances\r\n            where he committed perjury.  He committed\r\n            perjury concerning his lack  of knowledge\r\n            of the  amount of  money that was  in the\r\n            tenant letters.  He denied  forging some,\r\n            admitted  forging others.  He forged them\r\n            all.   He  committed perjury  by claiming\r\n            that there was another purchase  and sale\r\n            agreement  that didn't have the words 'as\r\n            is' in it.  Such document was never found\r\n            or presented.  He  was just lying through\r\n            his teeth.   There was no  such document.\r\n            He lied about his conversation with Patty\r\n            El[der].      What  Patty   El[der]  said\r\n            concerning the amount  of money that  had\r\n            to be available at  closing.  And he lied\r\n            about  the  work  credits.    That  was a\r\n            substantial   part  of  the  fraud.    He\r\n            claimed that there  were legitimate  work\r\n            credits  taken off the  purchase price to\r\n            get it  down to  two million eight.   The\r\n            figures didn't even add up.\r\n\nTranscript of Sentencing Hearing, at 20.\r\n\n          A  determination  of  perjury  must  be  based  on  the\r\n\ntraditional perjury  test as explained  by the  Supreme Court  in\r\n\nUnited States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87 (1993).  Dunnigan requires\r                                                                  \r\n\na finding that \"[a] witness testifying under  oath or affirmation\r\n\n. . .  [gave] false testimony  concerning a material  matter with\r\n\nthe willful intent to  provide false testimony, rather than  as a\r\n\nresult of confusion,  mistake, or faulty memory.\"   Dunnigan, 507\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nU.S. at 94.   Here, the  court found at  least four instances  of\r\n\nperjury, \"but  any one is  sufficient\" to uphold  the adjustment.\r\n\nSee United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                      \r\n\n          The  matters regarding which  the court  found D Andrea\r\n\noffered  false  testimony  were  material  because  they  concern\r\n\nD'Andrea's specific intent to  commit fraud, an element the  jury\r\n\nmust  have found  to support  a guilty  verdict.   The sentencing\r\n\ncourt's  findings of perjury cannot be overturned unless they are\r\n\nclearly erroneous.  United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 199, 202 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 609 (1994).\r                             \r\n\n            Even  if the  record, read  generously to\r\n            appellant, might conceivably support some\r\n            less damning  scenario -- and  we do  not\r\n            suggest  that  it  can --  we  would  not\r\n            meddle.   Our review  is  only for  clear\r\n            error -- and  \"where there  is more  than\r\n            one plausible view of  the circumstances,\r\n            the   sentencing  court's   choice  among\r\n            supportable   alternatives    cannot   be\r\n            clearly erroneous.\"\r\n\nTejada-Beltr n,  50 F.3d at 110.  Here, there was ample evidence,\r                        \r\n\nconsidering only D'Andrea's false testimony regarding his forgery\r\n\nof  both  tenant  and  guarantor  signatures,  to  find  that  he\r\n\nwillfully  obstructed  justice.    On  more  than  one  occasion,\r\n\nD'Andrea testified  on direct examination that  he had permission\r\n\nto sign a tenant or guarantor signature, only to be caught in his\r\n\nlie  on cross-examination and to be forced to acknowledge that he\r\n\nindeed committed  forgery without the permission  or knowledge of\r\n\nthe  pertinent \"signatory.\"   The  sentencing court  could easily\r\n\nhave  found  that such  direct testimony  was  not the  result of\r\n\nconfusion, mistake,  or faulty  memory.   This single finding  of\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nperjury   is  sufficient   to  uphold   the  sentencing   court's\r\n\nobstruction of justice enhancement.   We further note in passing,\r\n\nthat support for the sentencing court's other findings of perjury\r\n\nexist in the record and preclude a finding that they were clearly\r\n\nerroneous.  See id.\r                             \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n          E.  Restitution Order\r                    E.  Restitution Order\r\n\n          D'Andrea implores  us to vacate the  sentencing court's\r\n\nimposition  of $2.2 million restitution to  be paid to Resolution\r\n\nTrust  Corporation, the  successor to  New England  Federal.   He\r\n\ncontends that such action  is warranted because \"[r]estitution in\r\n\nthe  amount ordered by [J]udge Lagueux is, as a practical matter,\r\n\nvirtually  impossible  of fulfillment,  regardless  of D'Andrea's\r\n\npost-imprisonment  earning  capacity,  and  his  sentence  should\r\n\nreflect  that reality.\"   Appellant's  Brief at  43.   D'Andrea's\r\n\nargument,  then,  is  that  the restitution  order  cannot  stand\r\n\nbecause  the  sentencing  court  failed  to  properly  take  into\r\n\nconsideration  his ability to pay such an amount.  The sentencing\r\n\ncourt found the following:\r\n\n            On  all these supervised  release terms I\r\n            impose  a  condition  that the  Defendant\r\n            make restitution to the  Resolution Trust\r\n            Corporation   in   the  amount   of  $2.2\r\n            million.    I  realize   that's  probably\r\n            unrealistic.      I   realize  that   the\r\n            Defendant   probably   will  never   earn\r\n            anything close to that in the future when\r\n            he comes out  of prison.  But  I want him\r\n            to be  aware that he has  that obligation\r\n            and that any earnings that he makes  will\r\n            go toward restitution.\r\n\nTranscript of Sentencing Hearing, at 32.\r\n\n          \"In  fashioning  a  restitution  order,  a  court  must\r\n\nconsider 'the  amount of the  loss sustained by  any victim  as a\r\n\nresult of the offense, the financial resources of the  defendant,\r\n\nthe  financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the\r\n\ndefendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems\r\n\nappropriate.'\"  United  States v. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\r                                                  \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n1995) (quoting 18 U.S.C.   3664(a) (1988)).  The sentencing court\r\n\nis  not required to base its determination  on a finding that the\r\n\ndefendant  has  the  ability  to  repay  the  ordered  amount  of\r\n\nrestitution.   United States v.  Royal, 100 F.3d  1019, 1033 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1996).   Instead, there must only be an  indication that the\r\n\nsentencing  court considered  D'Andrea's  financial situation  in\r\n\narriving  at its  figure.   Id.    The record  here  sufficiently\r                                         \r\n\nsupports the conclusion that  the sentencing court considered all\r\n\nof the relevant factors in making its determination.  That is all\r\n\nthat is required.\r\n\n          Moreover,  should  this  restitution  order   prove  so\r\n\nunreasonably onerous that D'Andrea is clearly unable to  meet his\r\n\nresponsibilities, he  may move  the district  court to modify  it\r\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C.   3663(g).\r\n\nIII.  Judicial Misconduct\r          III.  Judicial Misconduct\r\n\n          D'Andrea   peppers  the   \"Argument\"  section   of  his\r\n\nappellate brief with allegationsof judicial bias and misconduct.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4    Appellant's  bald   assertions  of  misconduct  include  the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\n--   \"D'Andrea's prominent role  as a major  borrower from [Rhode\r\nIsland Central Credit Union] could not have been ignored by Judge\r\nLagueux  in his assessment of D'Andrea's  culpability, and it was\r\nhis involvement in  the latter that fatally infected  the court's\r\njudgment  in the New England Federal Savings Bank case.\"  (citing\r\nto a  newspaper  article  in  the March  6,  1996  issue  of  the\r\nProvidence Sunday Journal).  Appellant's Brief, at 22.\r\n\n--  \"Given the  depressed economic climate and hostile  political\r\natmosphere prevailing  in Rhode Island  since 1991, and  the fact\r\nthat Rhode Islanders will be repaying the losses . .  . well into\r\nthe  21st  Century,  it  is unsurprising  that  heavy  borrowers,\r\nincluding D'Andrea would  be demonized, both in the  public mind,\r\nand  as political scapegoats.  Judge Lagueux also appears to have\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n          An inquiry  into the  judge's conduct  of the\r\n          trial  necessarily turns  on the  question of\r\n          whether  the  complaining   party  can   show\r\n          serious prejudice.  . . .   In answering this\r\n          question a reviewing  court must evaluate the\r\n          judge's  actions 'according to  a standard of\r\n          fairness  and impartiality,  recognizing that\r\n          each case  tends to be fact-specific.'  . . .\r\n          This process requires the reviewing  court to\r\n          differentiate    between    expressions    of\r\n          impatience,  annoyance  or  ire, on  the  one\r\n          hand, and bias or partiality, on the other.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nbeen  infected by the clamor,  and that his  sentence reflected a\r\nwillingness to  punish D'Andrea  for his involvement  with [Rhode\r\nIsland Central Credit Union],  on a dubious theory of  liability,\r\nwithout specific proof of fraud or conspiracy presented.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n26.\r\n\n--  \"Moreover,  [Rhode Island Central Credit Union],  a privately\r\ninsured financial institution,  subject to weak  state regulation\r\nand  political intrigue  with  the Rhode  Island Legislature  and\r\nStatehouse  makes a weak case  on which the  Government can rely.\r\nAbsent   proof   he   violated   specific   prohibitions,   moral\r\ncondemnation is  not enough to sustain D'Andrea's punishment. . .\r\n.  This  distinction was apparently lost on Judge Lagueux, and he\r\nregarded the [Rhode Island Central Credit Union] and [New England\r\nFederal] transactions  as correlatives  both in time  and intent.\r\nGiven the limited  information the judge had before  him, linking\r\nthe two  together  in his  own  mind in  order  to quadruple  the\r\npunishment meted out to D'Andrea strongly suggests that the prior\r\npublicity about  RISDIC and  [Rhode Island Central  Credit Union]\r\nhad an effect.\"  Id. at 30.\r                              \r\n\n--  \"A fair  reading of the sentencing hearing  transcript yields\r\nbut one conclusion, that Judge Lagueux's  comments from the bench\r\nsay  more about  what he  thought D'Andrea  stood for  than about\r\nconduct for which D'Andrea bears legitimate responsibility.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\nat 35-36.\r\n\n--   \"Judge Lagueux determined that  virtually every disagreement\r\nbetween D'Andrea's  testimony  and  the  testimony  of  witnesses\r\nagainst him  was perjurious.

The entire tenor  of Judge  Lagueux's\r\ncomment showed his predisposition to discount everything D'Andrea\r\nsaid,  regardless  of the  probability that  one  or more  of the\r\nGovernment's witnesses was not telling the entire truth.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n39-41.\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nLogue v.

After a two-week trial in the District Court of Rhode Island, a jury found D'Andrea guilty on all counts.  The district court sentenced D'Andrea to five years' imprisonment on Count One and two years' imprisonment for each of the other counts, to run concurrently, and three years' supervised release on Count One and one year supervised release on the other counts, also to run concurrently.  In addition, the district court ordered D'Andrea to make restitution to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the amount of $2.2 million for losses related to the fraudulent loan activities.  D'Andrea now claims errors related to both the trial and sentencing phases.  Concluding that the district court did not commit error, we affirm D'Andrea's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1988, D'Andrea, Robert D'Andrea (D'Andrea's brother), Gary Lowenstein, and Michael Tulman applied for and obtained a $2.88 million loan from New England Federal Savings Bank (\"New England Federal\" or \"the bank\"), a federally insured institution.  The loan was obtained for the purpose of acquiring a warehouse and truck terminal located in Cranston, Rhode Island.  Because the bank would only lend up to eighty percent of the total purchase price of the warehouse, D'Andrea, and at least one of the sellers of the property, Frank Paolino, schemed to inflate the purchase price of the warehouse from just over two million dollars to $4.18 million.  By so inflating the price, D'Andrea was able to receive from the bank a loan in the amount of the purchase price, thereby relieving himself and his fellow purchasers of the burden of putting any of their own money into the purchase of the warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme went as follows.  D'Andrea represented to New England Federal that the purchasers would pay the $1.3 million difference required to meet the $4.18 million purchase price.  In order to make up this gap, D'Andrea submitted false records to the bank indicating that certain deposits had already been made to the sellers.  In addition, the bank requested agreements indicating the amount of rent paid by each of the tenants at the warehouse.  D'Andrea forged the signatures of the officers of each of the warehouse tenants on documents that he then submitted to the bank.  D'Andrea also submitted a document to the bank indicating a tenant-landlord relationship with a company that never rented space at the warehouse.  Two witnesses testified that D'Andrea presented them with copies of documents containing falsified rental amounts for tenants at the warehouse.  D'Andrea also admitted that he forged tenant signatures on tenant-at-will agreements without the knowledge or permission of officials at the tenant-companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the trial, D'Andrea testified that he took pains to pay off the $2.88 million loan from New England Federal.

D'Andrea obtained this loan along with four others, the Zarella brothers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  D'Andrea testified that, in obtaining this loan, he forged the signatures of the Zarella brothers' wives on a guarantee form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, D'Andrea used the warehouse property located in Cranston, Rhode Island, obtained through the use of false documents, as security for yet another loan, for $585,000 from Rhode Island Central Credit Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea makes numerous claims on appeal, most of which we discern to be related to his sentencing.

Moreover, once the government established in a matter of five questions that D'Andrea claimed no knowledge of such loans, it moved on and did not refer to \"straw borrowers\" again during the course of the trial.  We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Sentencing Issues</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

D'Andrea was not on trial for his activities involving the RISDIC-insured credit unions;  and the prosecutor's questions [regarding \"straw borrowers\"] were clearly intended to inflame the jury and the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the Government's position, Judge Lagueux noted D'Andrea's objections, but considered D'Andrea's forgery of the Zarrella wive's [sic] signatures on the loan guarantee as \"relevant conduct\"....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time the trial judge assumed that the Zarrellas['] role in that transaction was ... fraudulent, and he made no finding that the Zarrellas, or for that matter, any of the other alleged \"straw borrowers\" were involved in a scheme to defraud Rhode Island Central Credit Union, were unsophisticated investors, or were unaware of the obligations they were incurring....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's Brief at 22-24.  Although appellant's brief is difficult to decipher, D'Andrea appears to object both to the district court's consideration of D'Andrea's forgery of the Zarellas' wives' signatures and to the district court's consideration of the alleged fraudulent nature of the loan D'Andrea obtained from Rhode Island Central Credit Union with the Zarellas.  Both claims lack merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court's determination that D'Andrea's forgery constituted \"relevant conduct\" is a finding of fact, which we review for clear error.  United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 109 (1st Cir.1995).  For the sentencing court to consider uncharged conduct at sentencing, \"the government must show a sufficient nexus between the conduct and the offense of conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  United States v. Young, 78 F.3d 758, 763 (1st Cir.1996).  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \"relevant conduct\" includes acts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.  For actions in the Rhode Island Central Credit Union loan acquisition and the charged offense to be considered part of a common scheme or plan, \"they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, Commentary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the district court properly concluded that the use of forgery to obtain the Rhode Island Central Credit Union loan was part of the same scheme or plan as D'Andrea's fraudulent efforts to obtain the loan from New England Federal.  D'Andrea used proceeds from the fraudulently obtained $5.9 million credit union loan to pay off portions of the first fraudulently obtained bank loan.  This, as the district court noted, amounted to a scheme by which D'Andrea \"robb[ed] Peter to pay Paul.\"  Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, September 7, 1995, at 16.  We cannot find any error here, let alone clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the record offers some indication that the sentencing court considered D'Andrea's use of straw borrowers as part of the fraud he perpetrated on Rhode Island Central Credit Union to obtain the $5.9 million loan.  To be considered \"relevant conduct,\" the government must prove D'Andrea's actions by a preponderance of the evidence.  At trial, D'Andrea denied use of straw borrowers and nothing in the pre-sentencing report supports, by a preponderance of the evidence, the conclusion that D'Andrea used the Zarellas as straw borrowers.  Although, on this record, it does not appear that a showing by a preponderance of the evidence was made by the government regarding D'Andrea's use of straw borrowers, we have already determined that the loan was properly before the court as \"relevant conduct\" based on the forgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, at the sentencing proceeding, D'Andrea's trial counsel objected to enhancement of D'Andrea's offense level on the basis of his use of straw borrowers only as it related to what he considered triple counting:  use of the loan to calculate the measure of loss as a result of D'Andrea's fraudulent activities;  use of the loan as \"relevant conduct\";  and use of the loan to determine D'Andrea's role in the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  D'Andrea did not object that the government had failed to prove uncharged \"straw borrowers\" conduct by a preponderance of the evidence to justify its consideration as \"relevant conduct,\" as he appears to charge here.  Because D'Andrea did not preserve this argument below, we review only for plain error.  See United States v. Bennett, 60 F.3d 902, 905 (1st Cir.1995) (rejecting appellant's argument raised for the first time on appeal where different argument accompanied his objection below);  United States v. Tutiven, 40 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.1994) (applying plain error to sentencing argument that was not preserved below), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1031, 115 S.Ct. 1391, 131 L.Ed.2d 243 (1995).  Under this standard, we \"will reverse only if the error 'seriously affect[ed] the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings.' \"  United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 775 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1132, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).  Because the $5.9 million loan was properly before the sentencing court as \"relevant conduct\" based on the forgeries alone, the district court's consideration of the loan based on other factors cannot be plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Amount of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea claims error both in the sentencing court's failure to depart downward for multiple loss causation regarding the amount of loss to New England Federal and in the sentencing court's consideration of the Rhode Island Central Credit Union loan in calculating overall loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The New England Federal Loan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the New England Federal loan, D'Andrea contends that the loss of $2.2 million<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to New England Federal, and its successor, Resolution Trust Corporation, had more to do with the economic climate in which it later sold the property to recover some of its loss than it had to do with D'Andrea's conduct.  He appears to argue that the district court should have recognized the multiple loss causation and departed downward to accommodate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the loss table in section 2F1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines \"presumes that the defendant alone is responsible for the entire amount of victim loss specified in the particular loss range selected by the sentencing court.\"  United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341, 347 (1st Cir.1992).  Commentary to section 2F1.1 states that a sentencing court may depart downward where it finds the loss was caused by factors in addition to the defendant's conduct:In a few instances, the total dollar loss that results from the offense may overstate its seriousness.  Such situations typically occur when a misrepresentation is of limited materiality or is not the sole cause of the loss....  In such instances, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, Commentary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We lack jurisdiction to review the district court's decision not to depart downward under the long-standing rule that \"a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.\"  United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1119, 115 S.Ct. 919, 130 L.Ed.2d 799 (1995);  see generally, United States v. Tucker, 892 F.2d 8, 9 (1st Cir.1989) (holding defendant may not appeal a district court's decision not to depart downward).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>2. The Rhode Island Central Credit Union Loan</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea's argument here appears to suggest that the $5.9 million loss was not foreseeable to him because he thought he was negotiating a non-recourse loan.  At trial, D'Andrea contended that he was convinced after discussions with the credit union's president, John Lanfredi, that the loan was to be non-recourse and, therefore, the bank could not pursue the borrowers for recourse in the event of default.  Because of this misperception, D'Andrea seems to suggest that he could not have foreseen the loss and thus cannot be held liable for the amount of that loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows only the following comment from D'Andrea's counsel regarding the loss calculation:  \"The defendant contends under Section F1.1(b)(1)(L) that the principal and actual loss was 1.3 million and no other factors should be considered to determine the characteristic level.\"   Addendum to the Presentence Report, at 2. We accordingly find that D'Andrea failed to preserve any foreseeability argument for appeal, and review only for plain error.  Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d at 775.   We discern no such error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea argues that the sentencing court committed reversible error when it determined, in finding that D'Andrea was a \"leader\" or \"organizer\" under U.S.S.G. section 3B1.1, that D'Andrea's fraud included at least five participants or was otherwise extensive.  D'Andrea presents no caselaw to support this proposition.  Typically, finding an error of this sort, we vacate the sentence and remand to the sentencing court for resentencing.  See, e.g., United States v. Wester, 90 F.3d 592, 599-600 (1st Cir.1996) (vacating appellant's sentence and remanding case for resentencing upon a determination that the sentencing court had not made clear and legally supportable findings that the defendant was a leader or organizer of a fraud involving five or more participants or that was otherwise extensive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's findings regarding D'Andrea's role in the offense are fact-intensive and we review them for clear error.  See United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 413 (1st Cir.1995).  In finding that D'Andrea was a leader or organizer of this fraud, the sentencing court determined the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>There's no question that he was an organizer or leader of this transaction and he enlisted two other people, [Tulman] and Lowenstein, in this transaction.  There's very little evidence about [Tulman] or Lowenstein that was presented in this case but certain[ly] they had to be aware of some of the Defendant's activities in securing this fraudulent loan and making all these false statements with the bank.  Paolino was in effect a co-conspirator with him.  The evidence is clear on that.  Paolino had to know that this was a great big fraud, that the real purchase price for the property was $2.8 million and not $4.1 million as stated in the purchase and sale agreement....  [Pat Paolino] did [D'Andrea's] road running to get all the fraudulent tenant letters together to fool the bank.  And Michael Favicchio, another actor in this, he was the mortgage broker.  He was the most nervous witness I ever saw on the witness stand.  Michael Favicchio knew what was going on.  He wanted his fee as a mortgage broker and so he transmitted all this material that was coming from the Defendant to the bank.  He didn't tell all he knew from the witness stand but he was a participant in this fraud whether wittingly or unwittingly.  So there were at least five participants in this particular fraud and, of course, there were the Zarrellas in the other banking fraud with Rhode Island Central Credit Union and his forgery of the Zarrella wives' signatures.  So it seems to me that the first test is met that he was an organizer or leader with five or more participants.  In any event, it was an otherwise extensive fraud and there was one other co-conspirator, Paolino, and so both prongs of that adjustment are met in this case and the total offense level should be increased by four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, at 18-19.  A court making a four-level role-in-the-offense adjustment under U.S.S.G. section 3B1.1(a) must first determine \"whether the defendant acted as an organizer/leader of a specific criminal activity.  If so, the court asks the separate question of whether that criminal activity involved five or more participants, defined in the Commentary as persons who are 'criminally responsible for the commission of the offense....' \"  United States v. Preakos, 907 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, Commentary).  D'Andrea does not challenge the sentencing court's initial finding that he was an organizer or leader of criminal activity.  His argument focuses on whether the district court properly found five participants in his fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that the district court set out the individuals involved in the transaction, without making a specific finding that each was a \"participant.\"   We need not determine, however, whether the court could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that D'Andrea's fraud involved five criminally responsible \"participants.\"  \"Since the relevant language of subsection[ ] (a) ... is disjunctive, either extensiveness or numerosity is a sufficient predicate for a ... four-level upward adjustment.\"  Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 413.   Thus, we affirm the district court's determination of D'Andrea's role in the offense because it properly found that his fraud was \"otherwise extensive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] determination that a criminal activity is 'extensive' within the meaning of section 3B1.1 derives from 'the totality of the circumstances, including not only the number of participants but also the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the scheme.' \"  Id. at 414 (quoting United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir.1991)).  The commentary to the Guidelines provides:  \"In assessing whether an organization is 'otherwise extensive,' all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered.  Thus, a fraud that involved only three participants but used the unknowing services of many outsiders could be considered extensive.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, Commentary.  Where a sentencing court finds that the defendant's scheme involved one other criminally responsible participant, the \"court is free to consider the use of unwitting outsiders in determining [whether] a criminal enterprise is 'extensive' within the contemplation of section 3B1.1.\"  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 53.   D'Andrea's criminal activity, including relevant conduct, involved a fraud against two financial institutions whereby he obtained loans for a total of $8.1 million by submitting to those institutions documents that contained false financial information and the forged signatures of tenants and guarantors.  D'Andrea's forgeries of the tenants' signatures attested to the accuracy of the financial information supplied to the bank, while his forgeries of the Zarellas' wives' signatures bound the wives to guarantee a loan in the amount of $5.9 million.  He conspired with Frank Paolino, a participant under section 3B1.1, to falsify the actual sale price of the property.  He manipulated figures involved in the transaction to indicate that he and his co-purchasers were investing $1.3 million of their own money into the sale, when, in fact, they were not investing any of their own money.  He also used the witting or unwitting services of Michael Favicchio, Pat Paolino, Michael Tulman, and Gary Lowenstein to secure the $2.88 million New England Federal loan, and of the four Zarella brothers and their wives, to obtain the $5.9 million Rhode Island Central Credit Union loan.  We find that the sentencing court quite properly determined that D'Andrea's fraudulent schemes were extensive and thus supported a four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea further argues that the sentencing judge's determination that his criminal activities were extensive impermissibly mixes \"legitimate loans and development activities with isolated instances of criminal conduct.\"   Absolutely nothing in the record indicates that the sentencing judge considered any activities, legitimate or illegitimate, beyond those related to the New England Federal and Rhode Island Central Credit Union loans.  This argument, unsupported by the record, does not alter our finding of no error in the sentencing court's extensiveness determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court enhanced D'Andrea's base offense level by two points for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  Under that section, the sentencing court must increase the offense level by two \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense....\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  Perjury falls within the scope of obstruction of justice.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, Commentary.  The sentencing court found that D'Andrea committed perjury on four separate occasions during the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>I conclude that two points should be added for obstruction of justice because the Defendant committed perjury during this trial.  He committed perjury time and time again.  His main approach to his testimony was to lie about everything until he was backed up against the wall and then he admitted the truth, admitted forgery, but then tried to rationalize them.  I can think of four instances where he committed perjury.  He committed perjury concerning his lack of knowledge of the amount of money that was in the tenant letters.  He denied forging some, admitted forging others.  He forged them all.  He committed perjury by claiming that there was another purchase and sale agreement that didn't have the words 'as is' in it.  Such document was never found or presented.  He was just lying through his teeth.  There was no such document.  He lied about his conversation with Patty El[der].  What Patty El[der] said concerning the amount of money that had to be available at closing.  And he lied about the work credits.  That was a substantial part of the fraud.  He claimed that there were legitimate work credits taken off the purchase price to get it down to two million eight.  The figures didn't even add up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A determination of perjury must be based on the traditional perjury test as explained by the Supreme Court in United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).  Dunnigan requires a finding that \"[a] witness testifying under oath or affirmation ...

Here, the court found at least four instances of perjury, \"but any one is sufficient\" to uphold the adjustment.  See United States v.

Here, there was ample evidence, considering only D'Andrea's false testimony regarding his forgery of both tenant and guarantor signatures, to find that he willfully obstructed justice.  On more than one occasion, D'Andrea testified on direct examination that he had permission to sign a tenant or guarantor signature, only to be caught in his lie on cross-examination and to be forced to acknowledge that he indeed committed forgery without the permission or knowledge of the pertinent \"signatory.\"   The sentencing court could easily have found that such direct testimony was not the result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.  This single finding of perjury is sufficient to uphold the sentencing court's obstruction of justice enhancement.  We further note in passing, that support for the sentencing court's other findings of perjury exist in the record and preclude a finding that they were clearly erroneous.

D'Andrea's argument, then, is that the restitution order cannot stand because the sentencing court failed to properly take into consideration his ability to pay such an amount.  The sentencing court found the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>On all these supervised release terms I impose a condition that the Defendant make restitution to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the amount of $2.2 million.

I realize there are federal cases that say in fact that can be done.  My point is that it's being done three times to him on three different levels for three different types of consideration under the guidelines.  I don't think that's appropriate.  Certainly if the Court finds that it's \"relevant conduct\" it can consider it.  But it considers it as to the amount of the loan, as to the \"relevant conduct\", as to his participation in the offense.  It's all the same thing.  But yet he gets increased levels for that kind of activity and I don't think that's appropriate....  So my suggestion to the Court is that although the level with respect to fraud is six it can be increased but it should not be increased three fold with respect to those particular items.</p>\n        <p>Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, at 13-14.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The amount of loss was determined by subtracting from the original $2.88 million loan the amount recovered at the ultimate sale of the property by Resolution Trust Corporation, roughly $600,000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Appellant's bald assertions of misconduct include the following:</p>\n        <p>--\"D'Andrea's prominent role as a major borrower from [Rhode Island Central Credit Union] could not have been ignored by Judge Lagueux in his assessment of D'Andrea's culpability, and it was his involvement in the latter that fatally infected the court's judgment in the New England Federal Savings Bank case.\"  (citing to a newspaper article in the March 6, 1996 issue of the Providence Sunday Journal).

After a two-week trial in the District Court of Rhode Island, a jury found D'Andrea guilty on all counts.  The district court sentenced D'Andrea to five years' imprisonment on Count One and two years' imprisonment for each of the other counts, to run concurrently, and three years' supervised release on Count One and one year supervised release on the other counts, also to run concurrently.  In addition, the district court ordered D'Andrea to make restitution to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the amount of $2.2 million for losses related to the fraudulent loan activities.  D'Andrea now claims errors related to both the trial and sentencing phases.  Concluding that the district court did not commit error, we affirm D'Andrea's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1988, D'Andrea, Robert D'Andrea (D'Andrea's brother), Gary Lowenstein, and Michael Tulman applied for and obtained a $2.88 million loan from New England Federal Savings Bank (\"New England Federal\" or \"the bank\"), a federally insured institution.  The loan was obtained for the purpose of acquiring a warehouse and truck terminal located in Cranston, Rhode Island.  Because the bank would only lend up to eighty percent of the total purchase price of the warehouse, D'Andrea, and at least one of the sellers of the property, Frank Paolino, schemed to inflate the purchase price of the warehouse from just over two million dollars to $4.18 million.  By so inflating the price, D'Andrea was able to receive from the bank a loan in the amount of the purchase price, thereby relieving himself and his fellow purchasers of the burden of putting any of their own money into the purchase of the warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme went as follows.  D'Andrea represented to New England Federal that the purchasers would pay the $1.3 million difference required to meet the $4.18 million purchase price.  In order to make up this gap, D'Andrea submitted false records to the bank indicating that certain deposits had already been made to the sellers.  In addition, the bank requested agreements indicating the amount of rent paid by each of the tenants at the warehouse.  D'Andrea forged the signatures of the officers of each of the warehouse tenants on documents that he then submitted to the bank.  D'Andrea also submitted a document to the bank indicating a tenant-landlord relationship with a company that never rented space at the warehouse.  Two witnesses testified that D'Andrea presented them with copies of documents containing falsified rental amounts for tenants at the warehouse.  D'Andrea also admitted that he forged tenant signatures on tenant-at-will agreements without the knowledge or permission of officials at the tenant-companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the trial, D'Andrea testified that he took pains to pay off the $2.88 million loan from New England Federal.  On cross-examination of D'Andrea, the government elicited testimony that he used proceeds from a $5.9 million loan from Rhode Island Central Credit Union to pay off part of that loan.  D'Andrea obtained this loan along with four others, the Zarella brothers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  D'Andrea testified that, in obtaining this loan, he forged the signatures of the Zarella brothers' wives on a guarantee form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, D'Andrea used the warehouse property located in Cranston, Rhode Island, obtained through the use of false documents, as security for yet another loan, for $585,000 from Rhode Island Central Credit Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea makes numerous claims on appeal, most of which we discern to be related to his sentencing.

Although appellant's brief is difficult to decipher, D'Andrea appears to object both to the district court's consideration of D'Andrea's forgery of the Zarellas' wives' signatures and to the district court's consideration of the alleged fraudulent nature of the loan D'Andrea obtained from Rhode Island Central Credit Union with the Zarellas.  Both claims lack merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court's determination that D'Andrea's forgery constituted \"relevant conduct\" is a finding of fact, which we review for clear error.

D'Andrea used proceeds from the fraudulently obtained $5.9 million credit union loan to pay off portions of the first fraudulently obtained bank loan.  This, as the district court noted, amounted to a scheme by which D'Andrea \"robb[ed] Peter to pay Paul.\"  Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, September 7, 1995, at 16.  We cannot find any error here, let alone clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the record offers some indication that the sentencing court considered D'Andrea's use of straw borrowers as part of the fraud he perpetrated on Rhode Island Central Credit Union to obtain the $5.9 million loan.  To be considered \"relevant conduct,\" the government must prove D'Andrea's actions by a preponderance of the evidence.  At trial, D'Andrea denied use of straw borrowers and nothing in the pre-sentencing report supports, by a preponderance of the evidence, the conclusion that D'Andrea used the Zarellas as straw borrowers.  Although, on this record, it does not appear that a showing by a preponderance of the evidence was made by the government regarding D'Andrea's use of straw borrowers, we have already determined that the loan was properly before the court as \"relevant conduct\" based on the forgery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, at the sentencing proceeding, D'Andrea's trial counsel objected to enhancement of D'Andrea's offense level on the basis of his use of straw borrowers only as it related to what he considered triple counting:  use of the loan to calculate the measure of loss as a result of D'Andrea's fraudulent activities;  use of the loan as \"relevant conduct\";  and use of the loan to determine D'Andrea's role in the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  D'Andrea did not object that the government had failed to prove uncharged \"straw borrowers\" conduct by a preponderance of the evidence to justify its consideration as \"relevant conduct,\" as he appears to charge here.

At trial, D'Andrea contended that he was convinced after discussions with the credit union's president, John Lanfredi, that the loan was to be non-recourse and, therefore, the bank could not pursue the borrowers for recourse in the event of default.  Because of this misperception, D'Andrea seems to suggest that he could not have foreseen the loss and thus cannot be held liable for the amount of that loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows only the following comment from D'Andrea's counsel regarding the loss calculation:  \"The defendant contends under Section F1.1(b)(1)(L) that the principal and actual loss was 1.3 million and no other factors should be considered to determine the characteristic level.\"   Addendum to the Presentence Report, at 2. We accordingly find that D'Andrea failed to preserve any foreseeability argument for appeal, and review only for plain error.  Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d at 775.   We discern no such error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea argues that the sentencing court committed reversible error when it determined, in finding that D'Andrea was a \"leader\" or \"organizer\" under U.S.S.G. section 3B1.1, that D'Andrea's fraud included at least five participants or was otherwise extensive.  D'Andrea presents no caselaw to support this proposition.  Typically, finding an error of this sort, we vacate the sentence and remand to the sentencing court for resentencing.  See, e.g., United States v. Wester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196877\"><a href=\"/opinion/196877/united-states-v-wester/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 599-600 (1st Cir.1996) (vacating appellant's sentence and remanding case for resentencing upon a determination that the sentencing court had not made clear and legally supportable findings that the defendant was a leader or organizer of a fraud involving five or more participants or that was otherwise extensive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's findings regarding D'Andrea's role in the offense are fact-intensive and we review them for clear error.  See United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 413 (1st Cir.1995).  In finding that D'Andrea was a leader or organizer of this fraud, the sentencing court determined the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>There's no question that he was an organizer or leader of this transaction and he enlisted two other people, [Tulman] and Lowenstein, in this transaction.  There's very little evidence about [Tulman] or Lowenstein that was presented in this case but certain[ly] they had to be aware of some of the Defendant's activities in securing this fraudulent loan and making all these false statements with the bank.  Paolino was in effect a co-conspirator with him.  The evidence is clear on that.  Paolino had to know that this was a great big fraud, that the real purchase price for the property was $2.8 million and not $4.1 million as stated in the purchase and sale agreement....  [Pat Paolino] did [D'Andrea's] road running to get all the fraudulent tenant letters together to fool the bank.  And Michael Favicchio, another actor in this, he was the mortgage broker.  He was the most nervous witness I ever saw on the witness stand.  Michael Favicchio knew what was going on.  He wanted his fee as a mortgage broker and so he transmitted all this material that was coming from the Defendant to the bank.  He didn't tell all he knew from the witness stand but he was a participant in this fraud whether wittingly or unwittingly.  So there were at least five participants in this particular fraud and, of course, there were the Zarrellas in the other banking fraud with Rhode Island Central Credit Union and his forgery of the Zarrella wives' signatures.  So it seems to me that the first test is met that he was an organizer or leader with five or more participants.  In any event, it was an otherwise extensive fraud and there was one other co-conspirator, Paolino, and so both prongs of that adjustment are met in this case and the total offense level should be increased by four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, at 18-19.  A court making a four-level role-in-the-offense adjustment under U.S.S.G. section 3B1.1(a) must first determine \"whether the defendant acted as an organizer/leader of a specific criminal activity.  If so, the court asks the separate question of whether that criminal activity involved five or more participants, defined in the Commentary as persons who are 'criminally responsible for the commission of the offense....' \"  United States v. Preakos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543832\"><a href=\"/opinion/543832/united-states-v-darrell-walter-preakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, Commentary).  D'Andrea does not challenge the sentencing court's initial finding that he was an organizer or leader of criminal activity.  His argument focuses on whether the district court properly found five participants in his fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that the district court set out the individuals involved in the transaction, without making a specific finding that each was a \"participant.\"   We need not determine, however, whether the court could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that D'Andrea's fraud involved five criminally responsible \"participants.\"  \"Since the relevant language of subsection[ ] (a) ... is disjunctive, either extensiveness or numerosity is a sufficient predicate for a ... four-level upward adjustment.\"  Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 413.   Thus, we affirm the district court's determination of D'Andrea's role in the offense because it properly found that his fraud was \"otherwise extensive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] determination that a criminal activity is 'extensive' within the meaning of section 3B1.1 derives from 'the totality of the circumstances, including not only the number of participants but also the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the scheme.' \"  Id. at 414 (quoting United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1991)).  The commentary to the Guidelines provides:  \"In assessing whether an organization is 'otherwise extensive,' all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered.  Thus, a fraud that involved only three participants but used the unknowing services of many outsiders could be considered extensive.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, Commentary.  Where a sentencing court finds that the defendant's scheme involved one other criminally responsible participant, the \"court is free to consider the use of unwitting outsiders in determining [whether] a criminal enterprise is 'extensive' within the contemplation of section 3B1.1.\"  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 53.   D'Andrea's criminal activity, including relevant conduct, involved a fraud against two financial institutions whereby he obtained loans for a total of $8.1 million by submitting to those institutions documents that contained false financial information and the forged signatures of tenants and guarantors.  D'Andrea's forgeries of the tenants' signatures attested to the accuracy of the financial information supplied to the bank, while his forgeries of the Zarellas' wives' signatures bound the wives to guarantee a loan in the amount of $5.9 million.  He conspired with Frank Paolino, a participant under section 3B1.1, to falsify the actual sale price of the property.  He manipulated figures involved in the transaction to indicate that he and his co-purchasers were investing $1.3 million of their own money into the sale, when, in fact, they were not investing any of their own money.  He also used the witting or unwitting services of Michael Favicchio, Pat Paolino, Michael Tulman, and Gary Lowenstein to secure the $2.88 million New England Federal loan, and of the four Zarella brothers and their wives, to obtain the $5.9 million Rhode Island Central Credit Union loan.  We find that the sentencing court quite properly determined that D'Andrea's fraudulent schemes were extensive and thus supported a four-level role-in-the-offense enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Andrea further argues that the sentencing judge's determination that his criminal activities were extensive impermissibly mixes \"legitimate loans and development activities with isolated instances of criminal conduct.\"   Absolutely nothing in the record indicates that the sentencing judge considered any activities, legitimate or illegitimate, beyond those related to the New England Federal and Rhode Island Central Credit Union loans.  This argument, unsupported by the record, does not alter our finding of no error in the sentencing court's extensiveness determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court enhanced D'Andrea's base offense level by two points for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  Under that section, the sentencing court must increase the offense level by two \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense....\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  Perjury falls within the scope of obstruction of justice.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, Commentary.  The sentencing court found that D'Andrea committed perjury on four separate occasions during the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>I conclude that two points should be added for obstruction of justice because the Defendant committed perjury during this trial.  He committed perjury time and time again.  His main approach to his testimony was to lie about everything until he was backed up against the wall and then he admitted the truth, admitted forgery, but then tried to rationalize them.  I can think of four instances where he committed perjury.  He committed perjury concerning his lack of knowledge of the amount of money that was in the tenant letters.  He denied forging some, admitted forging others.  He forged them all.  He committed perjury by claiming that there was another purchase and sale agreement that didn't have the words 'as is' in it.  Such document was never found or presented.  He was just lying through his teeth.  There was no such document.  He lied about his conversation with Patty El[der].  What Patty El[der] said concerning the amount of money that had to be available at closing.  And he lied about the work credits.  That was a substantial part of the fraud.  He claimed that there were legitimate work credits taken off the purchase price to get it down to two million eight.  The figures didn't even add up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A determination of perjury must be based on the traditional perjury test as explained by the Supreme Court in United States v.

Here, there was ample evidence, considering only D'Andrea's false testimony regarding his forgery of both tenant and guarantor signatures, to find that he willfully obstructed justice.  On more than one occasion, D'Andrea testified on direct examination that he had permission to sign a tenant or guarantor signature, only to be caught in his lie on cross-examination and to be forced to acknowledge that he indeed committed forgery without the permission or knowledge of the pertinent \"signatory.\"   The sentencing court could easily have found that such direct testimony was not the result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.  This single finding of perjury is sufficient to uphold the sentencing court's obstruction of justice enhancement.  We further note in passing, that support for the sentencing court's other findings of perjury exist in the record and preclude a finding that they were clearly erroneous.

The record here sufficiently supports the conclusion that the sentencing court considered all of the relevant factors in making its determination.

In answering this question a reviewing court must evaluate the judge's actions 'according to a standard of fairness and impartiality, recognizing that each case tends to be fact-specific.'  ...  This process requires the reviewing court to differentiate between expressions of impatience, annoyance or ire, on the one hand, and bias or partiality, on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue v.

After painstakingly poring over nearly 1,450 pages of transcript from both the trial and sentencing hearing, we are left with the unmistakable conclusion that Judge Lagueux did not engage in a single act of \"impatience, annoyance or ire,\" let alone bias or misconduct.  D'Andrea's allegations are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing considerations, we affirm the district court's rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This name is spelled \"Zarella\" in the trial transcript and \"Zarrella\" in the sentencing hearing transcript.  For purposes of consistency, we will use the spelling \"Zarella.\"   Some quotations taken from Appellant's Brief contain the spelling \"Zarrella.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> D'Andrea's counsel's objection was stated as follows:</p>\n        <p>In addition, your Honor, it's counsel's opinion that all of the reference with respect to the adjustment for the role of the offense of straw borrowers in the state case, cases, is, again, an attempt with an increase of a level 4 to subject Mr. D'Andrea to additional punishment for something that has not been decided.  I realize there are federal cases that say in fact that can be done.  My point is that it's being done three times to him on three different levels for three different types of consideration under the guidelines.  I don't think that's appropriate.  Certainly if the Court finds that it's \"relevant conduct\" it can consider it.  But it considers it as to the amount of the loan, as to the \"relevant conduct\", as to his participation in the offense.  It's all the same thing.  But yet he gets increased levels for that kind of activity and I don't think that's appropriate....  So my suggestion to the Court is that although the level with respect to fraud is six it can be increased but it should not be increased three fold with respect to those particular items.</p>\n        <p>Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, at 13-14.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The amount of loss was determined by subtracting from the original $2.88 million loan the amount recovered at the ultimate sale of the property by Resolution Trust Corporation, roughly $600,000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Appellant's bald assertions of misconduct include the following:</p>\n        <p>--\"D'Andrea's prominent role as a major borrower from [Rhode Island Central Credit Union] could not have been ignored by Judge Lagueux in his assessment of D'Andrea's culpability, and it was his involvement in the latter that fatally infected the court's judgment in the New England Federal Savings Bank case.\"  (citing to a newspaper article in the March 6, 1996 issue of the Providence Sunday Journal).  Appellant's Brief, at 22.</p>\n        <p>--\"Given the depressed economic climate and hostile political atmosphere prevailing in Rhode Island since 1991, and the fact that Rhode Islanders will be repaying the losses ... well into the 21st Century, it is unsurprising that heavy borrowers, including D'Andrea would be demonized, both in the public mind, and as political scapegoats.  Judge Lagueux also appears to have been infected by the clamor, and that his sentence reflected a willingness to punish D'Andrea for his involvement with [Rhode Island Central Credit Union], on a dubious theory of liability, without specific proof of fraud or conspiracy presented.\"  Id. at 26.</p>\n        <p>--\"Moreover, [Rhode Island Central Credit Union], a privately insured financial institution, subject to weak state regulation and political intrigue with the Rhode Island Legislature and Statehouse makes a weak case on which the Government can rely.  Absent proof he violated specific prohibitions, moral condemnation is not enough to sustain D'Andrea's punishment....  This distinction was apparently lost on Judge Lagueux, and he regarded the [Rhode Island Central Credit Union] and [New England Federal] transactions as correlatives both in time and intent.  Given the limited information the judge had before him, linking the two together in his own mind in order to quadruple the punishment meted out to D'Andrea strongly suggests that the prior publicity about RISDIC and [Rhode Island Central Credit Union] had an effect.\"  Id. at 30.</p>\n        <p>--\"A fair reading of the sentencing hearing transcript yields but one conclusion, that Judge Lagueux's comments from the bench say more about what he thought D'Andrea stood for than about conduct for which D'Andrea bears legitimate responsibility.\"  Id. at 35-36.</p>\n        <p>--\"Judge Lagueux determined that virtually every disagreement between D'Andrea's testimony and the testimony of witnesses against him was perjurious.  Those findings were entirely one-sided and unfair....  The entire tenor of Judge Lagueux's comment showed his predisposition to discount everything D'Andrea said, regardless of the probability that one or more of the Government's witnesses was not telling the entire truth.\"  Id. at 39-41.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
