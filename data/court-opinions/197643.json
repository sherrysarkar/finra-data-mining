Appellate  counsel has\r\n\nfiled a  brief  under  Anders  v. California,  386  U.S.  738\r                                                        \r\n\n(1967),  and a motion to  withdraw.

After fully reviewing the record, we agree that\r\n\nthere is no meritorious ground  for appeal, and so we affirm,\r\n\nwith the qualification noted further below.  \r\n\n          Collins  pled  guilty  at  a  plea  hearing   which\r\n\nconformed  substantially to Fed.

Consequently,  the\r\n\ndistrict   court  properly  accepted   his  guilty  plea  and\r\n\nsentenced him  for conspiring  to possess  and to  distribute\r\n\ncrack cocaine, even  though the information charged  him only\r\n\nwith conspiring to possess and  to distribute \"cocaine.\"  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.
