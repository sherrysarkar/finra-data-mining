Defendant-appellant Edwin  J.  Gunn was\r                    Per  Curiam.\r                               \r\n\nindicted for  being a  felon in  possession of  a firearm  and of\r\n\nammunition, both in  violation of 18 U.S.C.    922(g)(1), and was\r\n\nconvicted of possessing the firearm.  At sentencing, the district\r\n\ncourt found Gunn to be an armed career criminal, as defined in 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   924(e), and sentenced him to  216 months in prison and a\r\n\nfive-year term of supervised release.   Gunn now appeals both his\r\n\nconviction and his sentence.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Gunn first  argues that  his conviction  should be  set\r\n\naside   because  the  government  failed  to  establish  that  he\r\n\npossessed the  firearm \"in or  affecting commerce.\"  18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n922(g).   He  contends that,  under  the test  enunciated by  the\r\n\nSupreme Court  in United  States v. L pez,  514 U.S.  549 (1995),\r                                                   \r\n\nCongress's exercise of its  Commerce Clause power can only  reach\r\n\nactivities that involve  the use  of the  channels of  interstate\r\n\ncommerce, instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or activities\r\n\nthat substantially affect  interstate commerce.  Noting  that the\r\n\nonly  evidence adduced  at trial as  to the  firearm's connection\r\n\nwith  interstate or  foreign commerce  was that  the firearm  was\r\n\nmanufactured  in Argentina,  Gunn  concludes that  this  evidence\r\n\nfailed  to  establish   that  his  mere  possession  of  the  gun\r\n\nsubstantially affected interstate commerce.\r\n\n          This first  argument fails because the  government does\r\n\nnot  need  to   prove  that  Gunn's   possession  of  a   firearm\r\n\nsubstantially affected commerce.   We have repeatedly  held that,\r\n\nafter L pez,  \"it remains the  law that where a  federal criminal\r                     \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nstatute contains a jurisdictional element requiring proof that an\r\n\nobject  was 'in or affecting' commerce,  the government need only\r\n\nmeet the 'minimal nexus' test enunciated in Scarborough v.

Scarborough, 431\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 577.   The evidence provided  by the government at  trial\r\n\nwas sufficient to establish the required minimal nexus.\r\n\n          Gunn  also  claims  that the  district  court  erred in\r\n\nsentencing him  as an \"armed  career criminal,\" which  is defined\r\n\nunder 18  U.S.C.    924(e)(1) as \"a  person who  violates section\r\n\n922(g) . . . and has three previous convictions . . . for a . . .\r\n\nserious drug offense,\"  because his three prior  drug convictions\r\n\ndid not  qualify as \"serious  drug offense[s].\"  Under  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  924(e)(2)(A)(ii),  a \"serious drug  offense\" is defined  as \"an\r\n\noffense under State  law, involving . . .  possessing with intent\r\n\nto .  . . distribute,  a controlled substance, .  . . or  which a\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmaximum term of  imprisonment of ten years or  more is prescribed\r\n\nby  law.\"   Even  though  his three  prior  convictions were  for\r\n\nviolations of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  94C,   32A,  which carries  a\r\n\nmaximum penalty  of ten years  in state prison, Gunn  argues that\r\n\nthe convictions were not  for \"serious drug offenses\" because  he\r\n\nwas prosecuted for  those offenses in  certain lower courts  that\r\n\nlacked  competence  to  sentence  him  to  the  ten-year  maximum\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          We  reject this argument and affirm Gunn's sentence for\r                                                 affirm\r\n\nthe  reasons  expressed  in the  district  court's  memorandum of\r\n\ndecision.

Scarborough, 431\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 577.   The evidence provided  by the government at  trial\r\n\nwas sufficient to establish the required minimal nexus.\r\n\n          Gunn  also  claims  that the  district  court  erred in\r\n\nsentencing him  as an \"armed  career criminal,\" which  is defined\r\n\nunder 18  U.S.C.    924(e)(1) as \"a  person who  violates section\r\n\n922(g) . . . and has three previous convictions . . . for a . . .\r\n\nserious drug offense,\"  because his three prior  drug convictions\r\n\ndid not  qualify as \"serious  drug offense[s].\"  Under  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  924(e)(2)(A)(ii),  a \"serious drug  offense\" is defined  as \"an\r\n\noffense under State  law, involving . . .  possessing with intent\r\n\nto .  . . distribute,  a controlled substance, .  . . or  which a\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmaximum term of  imprisonment of ten years or  more is prescribed\r\n\nby  law.\"   Even  though  his three  prior  convictions were  for\r\n\nviolations of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  94C,   32A,  which carries  a\r\n\nmaximum penalty  of ten years  in state prison, Gunn  argues that\r\n\nthe convictions were not  for \"serious drug offenses\" because  he\r\n\nwas prosecuted for  those offenses in  certain lower courts  that\r\n\nlacked  competence  to  sentence  him  to  the  ten-year  maximum\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          We  reject this argument and affirm Gunn's sentence for\r                                                 affirm\r\n\nthe  reasons  expressed  in the  district  court's  memorandum of\r\n\ndecision.
