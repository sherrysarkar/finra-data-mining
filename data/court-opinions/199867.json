Vega-Pacheco\nand Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\nbrief for appellee\n\n\n\n\n                         March 15, 2002\n\f\f             Per Curiam. On December 30, 1998, a federal grand jury\n\nin the District of Puerto Rico handed up a second superseding\n\nindictment against twenty persons, including defendant-appellant\n\nJuan Márquez-Hernández.               The grand jury accused these defendants\n\nof committing sundry drug-related crimes.                    Márquez-Hernández was\n\nnamed only in the first two counts.                    Count 1 charged that the\n\nappellant and others unlawfully conspired to possess with intent\n\nto distribute multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 846.               Count 2 charged             the appellant with\n\nviolating     21     U.S.C.       §    841(a)(1)       and   18    U.S.C.    §   2   by\n\nparticipating in the underlying offense — the smuggle of 689\n\nkilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico — on May 29, 1998.1\n\n             The charging papers described several overt acts that\n\nallegedly     occurred       in       furtherance      of    the   drug-trafficking\n\nconspiracy. Pertinently, this descriptive material related that\n\none of the organizers of the scheme, Juan Carlos Pion, wanted a\n\nsatellite telephone to assist the ring in smuggling a huge load\n\nof cocaine (containing roughly 689 kilograms) into Puerto Rico;\n\nthat on May 13, 1998, a coconspirator, José Antonio Casillas,\n\ndelivered more that $7,000 to fund the purchase of the device;\n\nand   that    four    days    later,       at    St.    Marteen,     the    appellant\n\n\n\n      1\n     The district court ultimately dismissed count 2, and it has\nno bearing on this appeal.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fparticipated in the acquisition of a Nera satellite telephone,\n\nbought with the funds provided by Casillas, and learned how to\n\noperate it.\n\n           The appellant initially pled not guilty to both counts.\n\nOn January 18, 2000, however, he entered a guilty plea to count\n\n1 pursuant to a non-binding plea agreement.           See Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP 11(e)(1)(A).    The plea agreement contained several concessions\n\nfavorable to the appellant.       Among other things, the government\n\nagreed that it would not seek to hold him accountable for more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine; that it would recommend not only\n\na   full   three-level    downward     adjustment    for    acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility, see USSG § 3E1.1, but also a sentence at the low\n\nend of the applicable guideline range; and that it would invite\n\nthe district court to dismiss count 2 of the indictment insofar\n\nas that count pertained to the appellant.\n\n           The district court conducted a Rule 11 hearing and\n\npermitted the appellant to change his plea.          The court continued\n\nthe matter several months for sentencing.             The appellant and\n\nhis counsel received the presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport)    a   full   month   before   sentencing,    and    unreservedly\n\nacquiesced in it.     At the disposition hearing, the court imposed\n\na seventy-month incarcerative term and dismissed count 2 of the\n\nindictment.     This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            In this venue, Márquez-Hernández raises only a single\n\nissue.      He    concedes    that,    in    general,   the     district    court\n\nconducted the change-of-plea proceeding in conformity with the\n\nrequirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, but he claims that the\n\ncourt did not make an adequate inquiry into whether there was a\n\nfactual basis sufficient to sustain his guilty plea.                    Because\n\nthe appellant advances this argument for the first time on\n\nappeal — in the court below, he neither questioned the factual\n\npredicate for his guilty plea nor sought to withdraw that plea\n\n— our review is for plain error.              See United States v. Valdez-\n\nSantana, 279 F.3d 143, ___ (1st Cir. 2002) [No. 00-2138, slip\n\nop. at 6]; United States v. Perez-Carrera, 243 F.3d 42, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Gandía-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).       The plain error standard requires an appellant to\n\nshow four things:        \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was\n\nclear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial       rights,     but   also     (4)    seriously    impaired    the\n\nfairness,        integrity,    or     public       reputation     of   judicial\n\nproceedings.\"        United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (citing, inter alia, Johnson v. United States, 520\n\nU.S. 461, 466-67 (1997); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n732 (1993)).         In the plea-withdrawal context, a defendant,\n\nfacing plain-error review, must, inter alia, carry the burden of\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fshowing not only that an error transpired, but also \"that the\n\noutcome would likely have been different if the error had not\n\noccurred.\"       United States v. Hoyle, 237 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).     The appellant cannot carry that heavy burden here.\n\n              It is, of course, a bedrock rule, memorialized in Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(f), that the district court must                        not   enter\n\njudgment upon a guilty plea unless and until it is satisfied\n\nthat    the    plea   rests    upon     an     adequate     factual   foundation.\n\nHowever, the factual foundation required by the rule need not be\n\nexquisitely detailed or precise to the point of pedantry.                      See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1220\n\n(1st   Cir.    1995).     In     this    instance,    the     sentencing     court,\n\nalthough not meticulous in its efforts, appears to have done\n\nenough.\n\n              First, the court read the conspiracy charge to the\n\nappellant and took steps to ensure that he understood it.                       The\n\nappellant thereupon admitted that he had committed the charged\n\ncrime.    Second, the plea agreement, introduced as an exhibit at\n\nthe change-of-plea hearing, contained the government's version\n\nof what the appellant had done to assist in the preparations for\n\nthe smuggle (i.e., the procurement of the satellite telephone).\n\nThe    appellant      verified    that    account     at    the   hearing.      The\n\ndistrict      court    also    requested       that   the    prosecutor      orally\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsummarize the government's evidence against the appellant.                She,\n\ntoo, described the appellant's participation in the purchase of\n\nthe satellite telephone and linked that device to the planned\n\nsmuggle.     The   appellant      acknowledged     the   accuracy    of   this\n\nnarrative.    Against that backdrop, the admitted facts — that the\n\nappellant    participated    in    the   acquisition     of   the   satellite\n\ntelephone and joined several coconspirators in learning how to\n\nuse it — were highly incriminating, leading the court to make an\n\nexplicit     finding,   at     the    close   of     the      change-of-plea\n\nproceedings, that \"there is a basis in fact for the plea.\"\n\n            To be sure, the district court's questioning could have\n\nbeen more pointed, and some of the appellant's answers may be\n\nsusceptible of two interpretations — one innocent and one not.\n\nBut the district court was the proper venue in which to clarify\n\nthe matter, and in the absence of any contemporaneous objection,\n\nany error that may have occurred certainly was not \"plain.\"\n\n            In all events, Rule 11(f)'s requirement — that the\n\ntrial court be satisfied that a guilty plea has a basis in fact\n\n— is designed to \"protect a defendant who is in the position of\n\npleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the\n\ncharge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually\n\nfall within the charge.\"          McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S.\n\n459, 467 (1969).     Bearing in mind that a defendant's agreement\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fto join in a conspiracy and his actions in furtherance of it\n\noften hinge on circumstantial, rather than direct, evidence,\n\ne.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); United States v. Gómez-Pabón, 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), the record in this case, taken as a whole, adequately\n\nevinces the appellant's understanding of the nature of the\n\ncharge and how his conduct fit within it.2\n\n            We need go no further.   Under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we can detect no plain error in the Rule 11\n\nproceedings.    Moreover, there is no reason, on this record, to\n\nsuspect that justice has miscarried.    Consequently, we uphold\n\nthe trial court's acceptance of the appellant's guilty plea and\n\nreject the assignment of error.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    2We note, too, that nothing in the circumstances of this\ncase indicates that the appellant's plea plausibly could be\ncharacterized as involuntary. The appellant had the benefit of\nseasoned counsel; originally pleaded not guilty and maintained\nthat stance for approximately one year (until he negotiated a\nfavorable plea agreement); acknowledged that he understood the\nnature of the charge; and tendered no objection to the PSI\nReport (which contained, inter alia, the government's version of\nthe offense and of his role in it).\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

The\n\ndistrict      court    also    requested       that   the    prosecutor      orally\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsummarize the government's evidence against the appellant.                She,\n\ntoo, described the appellant's participation in the purchase of\n\nthe satellite telephone and linked that device to the planned\n\nsmuggle.     The   appellant      acknowledged     the   accuracy    of   this\n\nnarrative.    Against that backdrop, the admitted facts — that the\n\nappellant    participated    in    the   acquisition     of   the   satellite\n\ntelephone and joined several coconspirators in learning how to\n\nuse it — were highly incriminating, leading the court to make an\n\nexplicit     finding,   at     the    close   of     the      change-of-plea\n\nproceedings, that \"there is a basis in fact for the plea.\"\n\n            To be sure, the district court's questioning could have\n\nbeen more pointed, and some of the appellant's answers may be\n\nsusceptible of two interpretations — one innocent and one not.\n\nBut the district court was the proper venue in which to clarify\n\nthe matter, and in the absence of any contemporaneous objection,\n\nany error that may have occurred certainly was not \"plain.\"\n\n            In all events, Rule 11(f)'s requirement — that the\n\ntrial court be satisfied that a guilty plea has a basis in fact\n\n— is designed to \"protect a defendant who is in the position of\n\npleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the\n\ncharge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually\n\nfall within the charge.\"          McCarthy v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107892\"><a href=\"/opinion/107892/mccarthy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (1969).     Bearing in mind that a defendant's agreement\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fto join in a conspiracy and his actions in furtherance of it\n\noften hinge on circumstantial, rather than direct, evidence,\n\ne.g., United States v.

Under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we can detect no plain error in the Rule 11\n\nproceedings.    Moreover, there is no reason, on this record, to\n\nsuspect that justice has miscarried.    Consequently, we uphold\n\nthe trial court's acceptance of the appellant's guilty plea and\n\nreject the assignment of error.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    2We note, too, that nothing in the circumstances of this\ncase indicates that the appellant's plea plausibly could be\ncharacterized as involuntary. The appellant had the benefit of\nseasoned counsel; originally pleaded not guilty and maintained\nthat stance for approximately one year (until he negotiated a\nfavorable plea agreement); acknowledged that he understood the\nnature of the charge; and tendered no objection to the PSI\nReport (which contained, inter alia, the government's version of\nthe offense and of his role in it).\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
