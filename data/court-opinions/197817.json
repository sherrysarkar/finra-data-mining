(Eastern) brought  an  action under  the\r\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.   1001\r\n\net seq. (1994),  against the trustee of the  failed air carrier's\r                 \r\n\nretirement  plan.   The district  court dismissed the  suit after\r\n\nreviewing the trust agreement and concluding that the trustee was\r\n\nnot subject to ERISA liability  as a fiduciary or co-fiduciary in\r\n\nrespect to the harms alleged.  The plaintiffs appeal.  We affirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  draw the facts  from the plaintiffs'  complaint and\r\n\nthe trust agreement.  In 1958, Eastern and the union representing\r\n\nits pilots  established  a defined  contribution retirement  plan\r\n\n(the Plan) designed  to provide retirees with a  range of pension\r\n\noptions.     Almost   a   quarter-century   later,   the   Plan's\r\n\nadministrative committee (the TAC) retained State Street Bank and\r\n\nTrust  Company (the  Bank) to  hold the  Plan's assets  in trust,\r\n\nmanage them as directed, and  periodically report their value (so\r\n\nthat  the   TAC,  inter  alia,  could  effectuate   the  Plan  by\r                                       \r\n\ncalculating  annuity  and  lump-sum  retirement  benefits).   The\r\n\nparties spelled out the Bank's duties and obligations qua trustee\r                                                                   \r\n\nin a trust agreement (the Agreement).\r\n\n          As time  went  by, the  Plan invested  heavily in  real\r\n\nestate.   In reporting the  value of these investments,  the Bank\r\n\nrelied on  information obtained  from Hawthorne  Associates, Inc.\r\n\n(Hawthorne), the Plan's principal investment manager, in the form\r\n\nof periodic appraisals prepared by Blake, a consultant engaged by\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nHawthorne.   Despite  a  subsequent decline  in  the real  estate\r\n\nmarket, Blake assigned consistently high valuations to the Plan's\r\n\nproperties and the  Bank parroted those valuations in its reports\r\n\nto the TAC.\r\n\n          In the summer of 1991, the Bank expressed concern anent\r\n\nthe   figures  supplied  by  Hawthorne.    Eventually,  it  hired\r\n\nSpaulding  &amp; Slye (S&amp;S), an independent appraisal firm, to review\r\n\nBlake's  handiwork.   Upon  encountering  difficulty  in  gaining\r\n\naccess to the necessary information, the Bank wrote to  Hawthorne\r\n\nstating that:\r\n\n          Our appraiser is prepared to begin his review\r\n          on Monday, October 7.  If he is not permitted\r\n          to  begin his review by Friday, October 11 on\r\n          the basis of full access to the documents, we\r\n          believe  that we have no recourse but to seek\r\n          the advice of  the Department of Labor  as to\r\n          our concerns about Hawthorne's instructing us\r\n          to  continue  to report  the  real  estate at\r\n          values  supplied by  Hawthorne as  investment\r\n          manager.\r\n\nIn short  order, Hawthorne  relented and  an unencumbered  review\r\n\nproceeded.\r\n\n          S&amp;S thereafter  issued a report that criticized Blake's\r\n\nvaluations and recommended that new appraisals  be secured from a\r\n\nnew appraiser.   The Bank submitted the S&amp;S  report to the TAC on\r\n\nNovember 8, 1991.   One week later,  the Bank wrote to  the TAC's\r\n\nattorney expressing concern that, according to S&amp;S, \"many of  the\r\n\nappraisals  are  incomplete  and/or  suffer  from  methodological\r\n\nflaws.\"  The Bank declared that it was  \"unwilling to continue to\r\n\ncarry  these valuations  on its  books  without qualification  in\r\n\nlight of the[se] concerns.\"   Within a matter of weeks, Hawthorne\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ninformed the  Bank that  it had lowered  the appraised  values of\r\n\ncertain properties.   The Bank  accepted the new  figures without\r\n\nfurther investigation.\r\n\n          The TAC eventually retained an independent appraiser to\r\n\nassess the Plan's real estate holdings.  This exercise culminated\r\n\nin  a substantial  reduction of  the  reported values.   At  that\r\n\npoint,  it became evident that Blake's exaggerated valuations had\r\n\nskewed the Plan's  finances:  because inflated  appraisal figures\r\n\nhad  been  carried on  the  Plan's  books  for nearly  a  decade,\r\n\nretiring pilots who opted for lump-sum retirement benefits during\r\n\nthat  period  received  a windfall,  whereas  the  remaining Plan\r\n\nparticipants were left holding an unduly depleted bag.\r\n\nII.  THE ENSUING LITIGATION\r          II.  THE ENSUING LITIGATION\r\n\n          Eastern filed for bankruptcy  in 1989.  In due  course,\r\n\nseveral quondam pilots  brought an  action in  a Florida  federal\r\n\ncourt against the  Plan, its sponsors, the TAC,  and sundry other\r\n\nparties  (not including  the Bank).    The plaintiffs'  complaint\r\n\ninvoked ERISA and  alleged myriad breaches  of fiduciary duty  in\r\n\nconnection with the investment of the Plan's assets.  See Beddall\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Eastern Air Lines, C.A. No.  91-1865-CIV (S.D. Fla.) (Beddall\r                                                                           \r\n\nI).   The Florida  court transferred  the case to  Massachusetts.\r           \r\n\nSee 28 U.S.C.   1404(a).\r             \r\n\n          The Beddall I  plaintiffs moved to amend  the complaint\r                                 \r\n\nto add  the Bank  as a  defendant.   As a  precaution, they  also\r\n\ninitiated a separate  suit against the Bank in  the Massachusetts\r\n\nfederal court  (Beddall II).   The complaint  in the  latter suit\r                                    \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncharged  that the Bank  violated ERISA's fiduciary  provisions by\r\n\nits failure  to  ensure  that  the Plan's  holdings  were  valued\r\n\nappropriately.\r\n\n          Judge   Wolf  eventually   approved   a  class   action\r\n\nsettlement in Beddall I, see Beddall v. Eastern Airlines Variable\r                                                                           \r\n\nBenefit Retirement Plan for  Pilots, No. 93-12074 (D.  Mass. Nov.\r                                             \r\n\n7,  1996) (order approving final settlement),1 and the plaintiffs\r\n\nwithdrew  the pending motion  to amend.   The Bank  then moved to\r\n\ndismiss Beddall II  for failure to  state a claim.   See Fed.  R.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCiv. P.  12(b)(6).  The district  court granted the motion.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBeddall II, 1996 WL 74218 (D.  Mass. Feb. 14, 1996).  Judge  Wolf\r                    \r\n\nconcluded that, because  the Agreement absolved  the Bank of  any\r\n\nfiduciary  responsibility for  the  alleged overvaluation  of the\r\n\nPlan's real  properties once  the TAC  engaged  Hawthorne as  the\r\n\ninvestment  manager in  respect to  those  assets, the  complaint\r\n\nfailed to state an actionable ERISA claim for breach of fiduciary\r\n\nduty.  See id. at *1-*2.  Then,  citing ERISA   405(d), 29 U.S.C.\r                        \r\n\n  1105(d), the judge  determined that, even if  the Bank knew  or\r\n\nshould  have  known  of Hawthorne's  indiscretions,  co-fiduciary\r\n\nliability did not attach in the absence of an allegation that the\r\n\nBank had participated actively in, or concealed, the breach.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at *2.  This appeal ensued.\r             \r\n\nIII.      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r          III.

As a condition of  the settlement, Judge\r\nWolf  precluded the  Bank  from impleading  any  of the  settling\r\ndefendants in the instant action.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          We   afford  de  novo  review  to  a  district  court's\r\n\nresolution  of  a motion  to  dismiss.    See Garita  Hotel  Ltd.\r                                                                           \r\n\nPartnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st  Cir. 1992).\r                                        \r\n\nLike  the  court  below  we  must  accept  as  true  the  factual\r\n\nallegations of the complaint, construe all  reasonable inferences\r\n\ntherefrom in favor of  the plaintiffs, and determine  whether the\r\n\ncomplaint, so read, limns facts sufficient to justify recovery on\r\n\nany  cognizable theory  of the  case.   See  Dartmouth Review  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nDartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).\r                           \r\n\n          This is familiar lore.   Here, however, there is an odd\r\n\ntwist:   the court below  scrutinized not only the  complaint but\r\n\nalso the  Agreement    and it is  undisputed that  the plaintiffs\r\n\nneither  appended  the  latter  document  to  the  complaint  nor\r\n\nincorporated  it  therein  by an  explicit  reference.    In this\r\n\nposture  of  the case,  the  lower court's  consideration  of the\r\n\nAgreement gives us pause.\r\n\n          We think  that this  situation calls  for a  practical,\r\n\ncommonsense  approach    one  that  does  not elevate  form  over\r\n\nsubstance.  The complaint discusses the Agreement at considerable\r\n\nlength.  And, although it states conclusorily that  \"State Street\r\n\nis a  fiduciary of the Plan,\"  it then proceeds to  summarize the\r\n\nparts  of the Agreement  that, in  the plaintiffs'  view, justify\r\n\nthis characterization.   The Bank responded to  these allegations\r\n\nby filing a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion and  appending to it a  copy of\r\n\nthe   Agreement.     The   plaintiffs   neither   challenged  the\r\n\nauthenticity of  the Agreement  nor moved to  strike it  from the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nrecord.\r\n\n          Under these  circumstances, the Agreement  was properly\r\n\nbefore   the  court.    When,   as  now,  a  complaint's  factual\r\n\nallegations  are expressly linked  to   and  admittedly dependent\r\n\nupon   a document (the  authenticity of which is not challenged),\r\n\nthat document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial\r\n\ncourt can review it  in deciding a motion  to dismiss under  Rule\r\n\n12(b)(6).   See Fudge  v. Penthouse Int'l,  Ltd., 840  F.2d 1012,\r                                                          \r\n\n1015  (1st Cir. 1988); see  also Branch v.  Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449,\r                                                             \r\n\n454 (9th Cir. 1994) (\"[D]ocuments whose contents are alleged in a\r\n\ncomplaint  and whose authenticity  no party questions,  but which\r\n\nare not physically attached to the pleading, may be considered in\r\n\nruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\"); 2 James Wm. Moore\r\n\net  al., Moore's  Federal  Practice     12.34[2]  (3d  ed.  1997)\r                                             \r\n\n(explaining  that  courts  may  consider \"[u]ndisputed  documents\r\n\nalleged or referenced  in the complaint\" in deciding  a motion to\r\n\ndismiss); see generally Fed. R.  Civ. P. 10(c) (stating that \"[a]\r                                 \r\n\ncopy of any written  instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading\r\n\nis a part thereof\").   Accordingly, we conclude that the district\r\n\ncourt  had the authority to consider the Agreement if it chose to\r\n\ndo so.\r\n\n          This  conclusion  makes  eminent  sense.    A  district\r\n\ncourt's  central task  in evaluating  a motion  to dismiss  is to\r\n\ndetermine whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state\r\n\na cause  of action.  In conducting  that tamisage, the court need\r\n\nnot accept  a  complaint's \"bald  assertions\"  or  \"unsupportable\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nconclusions.\"  Chongris v. Board of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1987).   While a plaintiff only is obliged  to make provable\r\n\nallegations,  the court's  inquiry into  the  viability of  those\r\n\nallegations  should not be hamstrung simply because the plaintiff\r\n\nfails to append to the complaint the  very document upon which by\r                                                                           \r\n\nher own admission the allegations rest.  Any other approach would\r                           \r\n\nseriously  hinder recourse  to Rule  12  motions, as  a plaintiff\r\n\ncould thwart the  consideration of a critical  document merely by\r\n\nomitting  it from the complaint.   We doubt  that the drafters of\r\n\nthe Civil Rules, who envisioned Rule 12(b)(6) motions as a swift,\r\n\nuncomplicated  way to weed out plainly unmeritorious cases, would\r\n\nhave countenanced such a result.\r\n\n          To their  credit, the plaintiffs  tacitly concede  that\r\n\nthe  lower court  had  the prerogative  to  review the  Agreement\r\n\nnotwithstanding its omission from the complaint.  They asseverate\r\n\ninstead  that the  court should  not  have done  so without  also\r\n\nenabling them to submit other evidence (and, thereby, convert the\r\n\nmotion  before the  court into  one  for summary  judgment).   We\r\n\nreject  that  asseveration  and hold  that  consideration  of the\r\n\nAgreement  did not in itself compel the court to treat the motion\r\n\nbefore it as  one for  summary judgment.2   See Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\r                                                         \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2There is a  certain irony to  the plaintiffs' criticism  of\r\nthe district court's course  of action.  Although the  conversion\r\nof  the plaintiffs'  motion  would have  enabled  them to  submit\r\nevidence regarding the Bank's fiduciary responsibilities, the act\r\nof  conversion  also  would have  imported  the  summary judgment\r\nstandard into  the case  and raised the  bar for  the plaintiffs.\r\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).  By eschewing conversion, the district\r             \r\ncourt ensured that  the plaintiffs' complaint would  be subjected\r\nto  the  less  demanding  scrutiny  associated  with  motions  to\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n12(b).  We offer three reasons in support of this ruling.  First,\r\n\nthe  Agreement's centrality  to the  plaintiffs' contentions,  as\r\n\nlimned  in  their complaint,  makes  it  in  effect part  of  the\r\n\npleadings,   and,   thus,   differentiates  its   evaluation   in\r\n\nconjunction  with a  motion  to dismiss  from  the assessment  of\r\n\ntraditional extrinsic  evidence.   See Venture  Assocs. Corp.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nZenith  Data  Sys. Corp.,  987  F.2d  429,  431 (7th  Cir.  1993)\r                                  \r\n\n(\"Documents that a defendant attaches  to a motion to dismiss are\r\n\nconsidered a part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the\r\n\nplaintiff's complaint and  are central to her  claim.\").  Second,\r\n\nand relatedly, the  complaint predicates  the plaintiffs'  claims\r\n\nregarding the existence of the Bank's ostensible fiduciary duties\r\n\nsolely on  the Agreement,  not on external  events.   Lastly, the\r\n\nconversion of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  into a Rule 56 motion is  a\r\n\nmatter  quintessentially  within  the  purview  of  the  district\r\n\ncourt's sound discretion.  See Garita Hotel, 958 F.2d at 18.\r                                                     \r\n\nIV.  ANALYSIS\r          IV.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          We begin  our treatment of the merits  by examining the\r\n\npertinent portions of ERISA's statutory  scheme.  We then turn to\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' triad of claims:  (1) that the complaint states a\r\n\ncause of action  for fiduciary liability by reason  of the Bank's\r\n\ndiscretionary authority over the Plan's real estate holdings; (2)\r\n\nthat the complaint states a claim for fiduciary liability arising\r\n\nout of the  Bank's conduct, including its role in  respect to the\r\n\nPlan's Short  Term Investment Fund  (the STIF); and (3)  that the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ndismiss.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ncomplaint  states a  claim  against  the  Bank  for  co-fiduciary\r\n\nliability.\r\n\n                    A.  The Statutory Scheme.\r                              A.  The Statutory Scheme.\r                                                      \r\n\n          ERISA's fiduciary duty provisions not only describe who\r\n\nis  a \"fiduciary\"  or \"co-fiduciary,\"  but  also what  activities\r\n\nconstitute a  breach of fiduciary  duty.  In the  first instance,\r\n\nthe statute reserves fiduciary liability for \"named fiduciaries,\"\r\n\ndefined either as those individuals  listed as fiduciaries in the\r\n\nplan  documents  or   those  who  are  otherwise   identified  as\r\n\nfiduciaries pursuant to a plan-specified  procedure.  29 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1102(a)(2).  But the statute also extends fiduciary  liability to\r\n\nfunctional fiduciaries    persons who act as  fiduciaries (though\r\n\nnot explicitly denominated as such) by performing at least one of\r\n\nseveral enumerated  functions with  respect to a  plan.   In this\r\n\nwise, the statute instructs that\r\n\n          a person  is a  fiduciary with  respect to  a\r\n          plan  to  the  extent  (i)  he  exercises any\r\n          discretionary   authority  or   discretionary\r\n          control respecting management of such plan or\r\n          exercises any authority or control respecting\r\n          management or disposition of its assets, (ii)\r\n          he renders  investment  advice for  a fee  or\r\n          other compensation, direct  or indirect, with\r\n          respect to  any moneys or  other property  of\r\n          such   plan,   or   has  any   authority   or\r\n          responsibility  to do so, or (iii) he has any\r\n          discretionary   authority  or   discretionary\r\n          responsibility in the  administration of such\r\n          plan.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   1002(21)(A).\r\n\n          The key determinant of whether a person qualifies  as a\r\n\nfunctional   fiduciary   is   whether   that   person   exercises\r\n\ndiscretionary  authority in  respect  to,  or meaningful  control\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nover, an ERISA  plan, its administration, or its  assets (such as\r\n\nby rendering investment advice).  See O'Toole v.  Arlington Trust\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  681  F.2d 94,  96 (1st  Cir.  1982); see  also 29  C.F.R.  \r                                                              \r\n\n2509.75-8, at  571 (1986).   We make  two points that  inform the\r\n\napplication of this  rule.  First, the mere  exercise of physical\r\n\ncontrol  or the  performance  of mechanical  administrative tasks\r\n\ngenerally  is insufficient  to  confer  fiduciary  status.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCottrill v. Sparrow,  Johnson &amp; Ursillo, Inc., 74  F.3d 20, 21-22\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996); Concha  v. London, 62 F.3d 1493,  1502 (9th Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1995),  cert.  dismissed,  116  S.  Ct.  1710  (1996).    Second,\r                                  \r\n\nfiduciary status  is  not  an  all or  nothing  proposition;  the\r\n\nstatutory language indicates  that a person  is a plan  fiduciary\r\n\nonly \"to the extent\" that he possesses or exercises the requisite\r\n\ndiscretion and control.  29  U.S.C.   1002(21)(A).  Because one's\r\n\nfiduciary  responsibility under  ERISA  is  directly  and  solely\r\n\nattributable  to  his  possession or  exercise  of  discretionary\r\n\nauthority, fiduciary  liability  arises  in  specific  increments\r\n\ncorrelated  to the vesting or performance of particular fiduciary\r\n\nfunctions in  service of the  plan, not in broad,  general terms.\r\n\nSee Maniace v. Commerce  Bank, 40 F.3d 264, 267  (8th Cir. 1994);\r                                       \r\n\nBrandt v. Grounds, 687 F.2d 895, 897 (7th Cir. 1982); NARDA, Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank, 744 F. Supp. 685, 690 (D.\r                                                \r\n\nMd. 1990).\r\n\n          An ERISA  fiduciary, properly  identified, must  employ\r\n\nwithin  the  defined  domain  \"the  care,  skill,  prudence,  and\r\n\ndiligence  under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nman  acting in  a like  capacity and  familiar with  such matters\r\n\nwould use.\"  29 U.S.C.   1104(a)(1)(B).  The fiduciary should act\r\n\n\"solely in the  interest of the participants  and beneficiaries,\"\r\n\nand his overarching purpose should  be to \"provid[e] benefits  to\r\n\nthe  participants  and  their  beneficiaries\"  and  to  \"defray[]\r\n\nreasonable   expenses  of  administering   the  plan.\"     Id.   \r                                                                        \r\n\n1104(a)(1).      A   fiduciary  who   fails   to   fulfill  these\r\n\nresponsibilities is \"personally liable to make good to [the] plan\r\n\nany losses to the plan resulting from  . . . such breach.\"  Id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1109(a).\r\n\n          Co-fiduciary liability  is  a  shorthand  rubric  under\r\n\nwhich  one ERISA  fiduciary may  be  liable for  the failings  of\r\n\nanother fiduciary.  Co-fiduciary liability inheres if a fiduciary\r\n\nknowingly participates in or conceals another fiduciary's breach,\r\n\nenables such  other to  commit a breach,  or learns about  such a\r\n\nbreach and fails  to make reasonable efforts  to remedy it.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.   1105(a).  In  some circumstances, co-fiduciary liability is\r             \r\n\nsubject to a  special set of rules.   This is true,  for example,\r\n\nwhere the putative co-fiduciary is a trustee and the breach is at\r\n\nthe  hands of  a plan-appointed  investment manager.   See  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1105(d)(1) (stating generally that a trustee shall only be liable\r\n\nfor a money manager's violation  if the former participates in or\r\n\nacts to conceal the breach).\r\n\n                      B.  The Bank's Status.\r                                B.  The Bank's Status.\r                                                     \r\n\n          The  starting point for reasoned analysis of the Bank's\r\n\nfiduciary status is the Agreement.  In support of their assertion\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nthat  the  Bank  bears fiduciary  responsibility  for Hawthorne's\r\n\nmisvaluation  of  the  real estate  investments,  the  plaintiffs\r\n\ndirect our attention to three sections of the Agreement, which we\r\n\nset out in pertinent part:\r\n\n          Section  3.   Investment of  the  Fund.   The\r                              \r\n          Trustee [the Bank]  shall cause all principal\r\n          and income at any time forming  a part of the\r\n          fund to be  invested as a single fund,  . . .\r\n          in  such  property as  the  Trustee may  deem\r\n          proper and appropriate . . . .\r\n\n          Section 4.  Duties and Powers of the Trustee.\r                             \r\n          The Trustee [the Bank] shall have the duties,\r\n          powers and  responsibilities with  respect to\r\n          the  Fund,   in  addition   to  and   not  in\r\n          modification or  limitation of  the authority\r\n          provided by law and this Agreement:\r\n\n               (a) to manage,  control and operate\r\n               the Fund and to prepare and  submit\r\n               to  the  Committee  [the  TAC]  and\r\n               Eastern, and otherwise  as required\r\n               by  applicable  law,  all financial\r\n               information,   including   periodic\r\n               valuation of the  Fund, as required\r\n               by   law,   the   Plan   and   this\r\n               Agreement;\r\n               . . .\r\n               (c)  to  invest  and  reinvest  the\r\n               Fund, as  provided in Section  3 of\r\n               this Agreement;\r\n               . . . .\r\n\n          Section 5.  Records, Accounting and Valuation\r                             \r\n          of  the Assets  of Fund.    The Trustee  [the\r\n          Bank]  shall keep  accurate  accounts of  all\r\n          investments, receipts  and disbursements  and\r\n          other  transactions  hereunder  regarding the\r\n          Fund. . . .\r\n               Following the  close of  each month  the\r\n          Trustee shall provide the Committee [the TAC]\r\n          and  Eastern and  such  others as  they shall\r\n          direct  from  time  to time  with  a  monthly\r\n          report  of the assets held in  the Fund as of\r\n          the close of said month . . . .\r\n               . . . .\r\n               Except  as  otherwise provided  in  this\r\n          Section,  the  assets  of the  Trust  at  any\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          monthly  or annual  valuation  date shall  be\r\n          valued at market value as  of such date . . .\r\n          .   Real property  . . .  shall be  valued at\r\n          market value  on the valuation  dates on  the\r\n          basis of information obtained from qualified,\r\n          available sources  such as  dealers, bankers,\r\n          brokers,  or appraisers  dealing or  familiar\r\n          with the type of  investment involved, or  on\r\n          the basis of reference to the market value of\r\n          similar investments; and the Trustee may rely\r\n          on an appraisal  of real property made  by an\r\n          independent appraiser deemed competent by the\r\n          Trustee,  within  two   years  prior  to  the\r\n          valuation  date  as of  which  such  value is\r\n          being determined.\r\n\nWe also deem relevant to the Bank's status as regards real estate\r\n\ninvestments  another section of the Agreement that the plaintiffs\r\n\ntend to downplay.  We reprint that provision in pertinent part:\r\n\n          Section   6.     Appointment  of   Investment\r                               \r\n          Manager.  The  Committee [the TAC] .  . . may\r\n          direct the  Trustee [the Bank]  in writing to\r\n          segregate  all  or  a portion  of  the  Fund,\r\n          including  without   limitation,  all   or  a\r\n          portion  of   such  investments  as   may  be\r\n          initially  transferred  to   the  Trustee  in\r\n          accordance with  this Agreement, into  one or\r\n          more  separate   accounts  to  be   known  as\r\n          \"Investment  Manager Accounts.\"  .  . .   The\r\n          Committee shall  promptly thereafter  appoint\r\n          for  each   Investment  Manager   Account  an\r\n          Investment  Manager  .  .  . and  shall  give\r\n          written  notice of  such  appointment to  the\r\n          Trustee. . . .\r\n               . . . .\r\n               It shall  be the  responsibility of  the\r\n          Committee  to  vest each  Investment  Manager\r\n          with the authority necessary to discharge its\r\n          duties hereunder and to properly direct  each\r\n          Investment Manager to perform such accounting\r\n          and valuation functions and such other duties\r\n          as shall  be necessary to enable  the Trustee\r\n          to fully perform hereunder.\r\n               The Trustee shall  follow the directions\r\n          of each  Investment Manager  with respect  to\r\n          the Investment  Manager Account  forming part\r\n          of   the   Fund;  provided   that   all  such\r\n          directions  be  in  writing,  signed  by   an\r\n          officer,  or  partner,   of  such  Investment\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\n          Manager. .  . .   The  Trustee shall  have no\r\n          obligation to act pursuant  to any directions\r\n          from any Investment Manager unless and  until\r\n          it  receives   such  directions  in   a  form\r\n          satisfactory to it.\r\n               The Trustee shall have no responsibility\r\n          for supervising any  Investment Manager.  The\r\n          Trustee  shall  be  under  no  obligation  to\r\n          invest  or otherwise to  manage any  asset of\r\n          the Fund  which is subject to  the management\r\n          of any Investment Manager.  The Trustee shall\r\n          be under no  obligation to review or  to make\r\n          inquiries  as to  any action or  direction of\r\n          any  Investment  Manager  taken  as  provided\r\n          herein  or   as  to   any  failure  to   give\r\n          directions, nor to review or value the assets\r\n          held in any  Investment Manager Account,  nor\r\n          to  make any  suggestions  to the  Investment\r\n          Manager or Committee  or Eastern with respect\r\n          to  the  investment and  reinvestment  of, or\r\n          disposal  of investments  in, any  Investment\r\n          Manager  Account . .  . .   The Trustee shall\r\n          not be liable  for any act or omission of any\r\n          Investment  Manager,  except as  provided  in\r\n          Section 405(a) of ERISA [29 U.S.C.  1105(a)].\r\n               In the case  of any purchase or  sale of\r\n          real property by any Investment Manager,  the\r\n          Trustee shall have the right to request, as a\r\n          condition to its  executing any documents  or\r\n          paying  over  any  assets  of  the   Fund  in\r\n          connection  with  such transaction,  that  it\r\n          receive a certified appraisal of the value of\r\n          such property . . . .\r\n\n          The plaintiffs read these provisions, in the aggregate,\r\n\nas conferring  upon the  Bank sufficient authority  to make  it a\r\n\nfiduciary in regard to the Plan's real estate investments.  We do\r\n\nnot agree.  The quoted text authorizes the Bank mainly to perform\r\n\nadministrative  and  ministerial  functions in  respect  to those\r\n\ninvestments which,  like real estate, are held within a so-called\r\n\nInvestment   Manager   Account.      Without   more,   mechanical\r\n\nadministrative responsibilities (such as retaining the assets and\r\n\nkeeping a  record of  their value) are  insufficient to  ground a\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nclaim  of  fiduciary  status.

Nevertheless, section 4\r\n\ncannot be read  in a vacuum.   The TAC nominated Hawthorne  as an\r\n\ninvestment manager in respect to the Plan's real estate holdings,\r\n\nand  the plain  language of  section  6 of  the Agreement  leaves\r\n\nlittle doubt but  that the TAC thereby  relieved the Bank  of all\r\n\nfiduciary responsibility regarding those  investments.  In terms,\r\n\nsection  6  shifts   to  an  appointed  investment   manager  all\r\n\ndiscretion  over affected assets and makes the investment manager\r\n\n  not the trustee   responsible for \"perform[ing] such accounting\r\n\nand  valuation  functions  and  such  other  duties  as shall  be\r\n\nnecessary  to enable  the Trustee  to fully  perform.\"   To cinch\r\n\nmatters,   section  6   expressly   absolves   the   trustee   of\r\n\n\"responsibility for supervising any Investment Manager\"; confirms\r\n\nthat the trustee  is not obliged \"to review or  make inquiries as\r\n\nto any  action or  direction of any  Investment Manager,\"  or \"to\r\n\nreview  or  value  the  assets held  in  any  Investment  Manager\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\naccount.\"   Further, it  proclaims, with  a single  exception not\r\n\nrelevant  to this  discussion,  that the  trustee  \"shall not  be\r\n\nliable for any act or omission of any Investment Manager.\"  These\r\n\nstipulations   strip   any  veneer   of  plausibility   from  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' bald assertion that  the Bank is a fiduciary  subject\r\n\nto liability  for Hawthorne's  overvaluation of  the Plan's  real\r\n\nproperty.\r\n\n          In  a last-ditch  attempt to  blunt the  force of  this\r\n\nconclusion,  the  plaintiffs  point to  language  that  gives the\r\n\ntrustee the right  to reject the investment  manager's directions\r\n\nin certain circumstances   say, if those directions are not \"in a\r\n\nform satisfactory to  it\"   and they  argue that, as a  result of\r\n\nthis \"discretion\" (to use plaintiffs' word), the Bank retains its\r\n\nstatus  as  a   fiduciary  notwithstanding  the   other  language\r\n\ncontained in section 6.  This argument will not fly.\r\n\n          It  is  beyond cavil  that  when  the  TAC appoints  an\r\n\ninvestment manager  for designated  assets, the  Agreement shifts\r\n\nall significant  discretion and control over those  assets to the\r\n\ninvestment manager  and relegates the  trustee to the role  of an\r\n\nadministrative  functionary.    With  section  6  velivolant, the\r\n\nBank's  remaining  powers  are ministerial.    They  involve such\r\n\ndetails as  checking whether  Hawthorne's instructions  are in  a\r\n\nwriting  signed  by  an authorized  person  and  issuing periodic\r\n\nreports to  the TAC anent the  Fund's status.  Although  the Bank\r\n\narguably may  refuse to  follow instructions that  are not  in an\r\n\nacceptable  format, this negative discretion lies well within the\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nadministrative sphere, and  its existence does not  transform the\r\n\nBank into  a  fiduciary  vis- -vis  the affected  assets.3    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nArizona State Carpenters Pension Trust Fund v.

The complaint acknowledges\r\n\nthat  the  TAC  appointed Hawthorne  to  manage  its real  estate\r\n\ninvestments.  In that circumstance, the trust document, read as a\r\n\nwhole, divests  the Bank of  any and all management  authority or\r\n\ndiscretionary control  over those  assets.   Whatever the  Bank's\r\n\npowers  may  have  been  in  the  absence  of  a  duly  appointed\r\n\ninvestment  manager, no fiduciary responsibility in regard to the\r\n\nvaluation  of  the  Plan's  real  estate  holdings  survived  the\r\n\nappointment.\r\n\n                     C.

They posit that, because the Bank was not\r\n\nentirely passive   it questioned Hawthorne's valuations,  engaged\r\n\nan independent  appraiser  to  review  Hawthorne's  numbers,  and\r\n\nultimately  threatened  to  report Hawthorne's  practices  to the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Similarly, the Bank's retention under section  6 of a right\r\nto secure a certified appraisal of the real estate does not alter\r\nthe  decisional  calculus because  the  Bank  has  no such  duty.\r                                                                          \r\nIndeed, section  6  explicitly  provides that  the  Bank  has  no\r\nobligation \"to review or value  the assets held in any Investment\r\nManager Account.\"\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nauthorities   it acted as a fiduciary and thus we should treat it\r\n\nas one.  We think not.\r\n\n          As a  matter of  policy and  principle, ERISA does  not\r\n\nimpose  Good Samaritan liability.  A financial institution cannot\r\n\nbe  deemed  to  have volunteered  itself  as  a  fiduciary simply\r\n\nbecause it undertakes reporting responsibilities that exceed  its\r\n\nofficial  mandate.    Imputing  fiduciary  status  to  those  who\r\n\ngratuitously assist a  plan's administrators is undesirable  in a\r\n\nvariety of ways, and ERISA's somewhat narrow fiduciary provisions\r\n\nare  designed to  avoid such  incremental costs.   See  generally\r                                                                           \r\n\nMertens v. Hewitt  Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 262-63  (1993).  Viewed\r                                    \r\n\nagainst this backdrop, a rule  that would dampen any incentive on\r\n\nthe  part of depository institutions voluntarily to make relevant\r\n\ninformation available to fund administrators and other interested\r\n\nparties is counter-intuitive.  Moreover, such a wrong-headed rule\r\n\n\"would  also  risk   creating  a  climate  in   which  depository\r\n\ninstitutions would routinely  increase their fees to  account for\r\n\nthe  risk that fiduciary  liability might attach  to nonfiduciary\r\n\nwork.\"  Arizona State Carpenters, 125 F.3d at 722.\r                                          \r\n\n          To  the extent  that  the plaintiffs'  fiduciary  claim\r\n\nderives from  the Bank's  activities with  regard to Plan  assets\r\n\napart from real estate, it fares no better.  The plaintiffs argue\r\n\nthat because the  Bank is a fiduciary with regard to the STIF, it\r\n\nhad a statutory responsibility to make a timely disclosure to the\r\n\nPlan participants of  its concerns about Hawthorne's  real estate\r\n\nvaluations.  We agree with the plaintiffs' premise   clearly, the\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nBank had  some discretion  with regard to  investing cash  in the\r\n\nSTIF   but their conclusion does not necessarily follow.\r\n\n          Refined to  bare essence,  the question  is whether  an\r\n\nERISA fiduciary for one purpose has an obligation to disclose his\r\n\nsuspicions  even when  there is  no nexus between  his particular\r\n\nfiduciary responsibilities and  the perceived jeopardy.   This is\r\n\nan  issue of  first impression,  certainly  in this  circuit, and\r\n\nperhaps  more broadly.   Good arguments exist on  both sides.  On\r\n\nthe  one hand,  the  obligations  of  an ERISA  fiduciary,  while\r\n\ngoverned  by federal  law,  are  informed by  the  common law  of\r\n\ntrusts.  That law generally treats the communication  of material\r\n\nfacts   to  the  beneficiary  as   \"the  core  of  a  fiduciary's\r\n\nresponsibility.\"  Eddy  v. Colonial Life Ins. Co.,  919 F.2d 747,\r                                                           \r\n\n750  (D.C. Cir. 1990).4  On the  other hand, it is settled that a\r\n\nnon-fiduciary's failure to communicate knowledge of a fiduciary's\r\n\nbreach does not \"constitute culpable participation in a breach of\r\n\ntrust under ERISA.\"   Painters of Philadelphia  Dist.

Indeed, every case  that the plaintiffs have cited in\r\nsupport  of  an affirmative duty to  disclose arises in a context\r\nin which  the plaintiff  charges the  defendant with  withholding\r\ninformation   related  (i.e.,   relevant)   to  the   fiduciary's\r\nassociation with the  plan.  See,  e.g., Ream v.

Apart from the co-fiduciary claim,\r\n\nconsidered  infra, the plaintiffs'  complaint does not  premise a\r                           \r\n\nclaim   on  the  Bank's   supposed  obligation  to   inform  Plan\r\n\nparticipants  of  the  suspected  misvaluations.    Instead,  the\r\n\ncomplaint predicates the plaintiffs' alternate claim of fiduciary\r\n\nliability  on  the  Bank's  \"willingness  to  accept  Hawthorne's\r\n\ninstructions  as to  the values  to  be carried  on [the  Bank's]\r\n\nbooks.\"   According to  the  complaint, this  gaffe \"resulted  in\r\n\nthose properties  being carried  on the  [Bank's] books  for many\r\n\nyears at values  greatly in excess of their  market values, which\r\n\nin turn  led to retiring  pilots receiving millions more  in lump\r\n\nsum benefits  than  the benefits  to which  they were  entitled.\"\r\n\nNowhere in the complaint (or in the plaintiffs' opposition to the\r\n\nmotion to  dismiss, for that  matter) do the plaintiffs  make the\r\n\nentirely  distinct claim  that  the  Bank  breached  a  fiduciary\r\n\nobligation  under  ERISA   because  it  failed  to   notify  Plan\r\n\nparticipants of Hawthorne's erroneous appraisals.\r\n\n          That ends  the matter.   Afterthought  theories    even\r\n\ncleverly constructed afterthought theories   cannot be introduced\r\n\nfor  the first  time in  an  appellate venue  through the  simple\r\n\nexpedient  of dressing them  up to look  like preexisting claims.\r\n\n\"If any  principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent\r\n\nthe most  extraordinary circumstances, legal theories  not raised\r\n\nsquarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\r\n\non appeal.\"  Teamsters Local No. 59 v.

This  claim comes\r\n\nperilously  close to suffering from the same procedural infirmity\r\n\nthat  we have  just identified.   The  complaint is  not artfully\r\n\npleaded and no  explicit co-fiduciary liability claim  appears on\r\n\nits face.   Nevertheless,  the plaintiffs  argued a  co-fiduciary\r\n\nliability claim  theory below  and the  district court  addressed\r\n\nit.5  So do we.\r\n\n          We need  not linger long.  The short  of it is that the\r\n\nplaintiffs' allegations, even  if well-pleaded and assumed  to be\r\n\ntrue,  do not  establish  a  violation  of  ERISA's  co-fiduciary\r\n\nprovisions.   ERISA renders  a fiduciary vulnerable  to liability\r\n\nfor breaches committed by other fiduciaries in three situations:\r\n\n          (1)  if  he  participates  knowingly  in,  or\r\n          knowingly undertakes  to conceal,  an act  or\r\n          omission  of  such other  fiduciary,  knowing\r\n          such act or omission is a breach;\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The lower  court apparently cobbled the  co-fiduciary claim\r\ntogether from a liberal reading  of the complaint.  The complaint\r\ndoes allege  that the Bank is a  fiduciary (an allegation that is\r\nirrefutable with regard to the  STIF), that it had some knowledge\r\nof   Hawthorne's  improprieties,  and  that  it  failed  to  make\r\nreasonable efforts to remedy the situation.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\n          (2) if, by  his failure to comply with  . . .\r\n          the    administration    of    his   specific\r\n          responsibilities which  give  rise  to    his\r\n          status as  a fiduciary, he  has enabled  such\r\n          other fiduciary to commit a breach; or\r\n          (3) if he  has knowledge of a  breach by such\r\n          other fiduciary,  unless he  makes reasonable\r\n          efforts under the circumstances to remedy the\r\n          breach.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.    1105(a).  Given  their allegations, the  plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaim must stand  or fall on the  third of these scenarios.6   We\r\n\nthink that it falls.\r\n\n          29 U.S.C.   1105(d) provides that a fiduciary (such  as\r\n\nthe Bank)  cannot be  held responsible as  a co-fiduciary  on the\r\n\nbasis of acts described in section 1105(a)(2) or (3):\r\n\n          If  an  investment manager  or  managers have\r\n          been appointed  . .  . then,  notwithstanding\r                                                                 \r\n          subsections  (a)(2) and (3) . . ., no trustee\r                                               \r\n          shall be liable from the acts or omissions of\r\n          such investment  manager or  managers, or  be\r\n          under  an obligation  to invest  or otherwise\r\n          manage any asset of the plan which is subject\r\n          to the management of such investment manager.\r\n\n29  U.S.C.    1105(d)  (emphasis  supplied).   Given  its literal\r\n\nmeaning, section 1105(d) defenestrates the plaintiffs' claim that\r\n\nthe Bank is subject to co-fiduciary liability in this instance.\r\n\n          The plaintiffs attempt  to steer away from  the obvious\r\n\nconclusion  and  to ensure  a  soft  landing  by two  stratagems.\r\n\nFirst,  they  point to  the exact  language of  section 6  of the\r\n\nAgreement  (\"The Trustee  shall  not  be liable  for  any act  of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Of course,  the  Bank  argues  that it  did,  indeed,  take\r\nreasonable steps to investigate Hawthorne's improprieties and put\r\nan  end to them.   The potential issues  relating to whether such\r\nsteps actually were taken and/or their sufficiency are not before\r\nus, and we do not endeavor to decide those issues.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nomission of the Investment Manager, except as provided in Section\r                                                                           \r\n\n405(a) of  ERISA [29  U.S.C.    1105(a)].\") (emphasis  supplied).\r                          \r\n\nThis verbiage, they assert, evinces an intent to hold a fiduciary\r\n\nliable for all the conduct described in  section 1105(a), without\r\n\nreference to the exculpatory  provisions of section 1105(d).   We\r\n\nreject that assertion out of  hand.  The Agreement's reference to\r\n\n29  U.S.C.    1105(a)  can  only be  read  as incorporating  that\r\n\nsection to  the extent that  it would impart liability  under the\r\n\nstatute.   Cf.

Co., 713 F.2d  254, 259 (7th Cir.  1983) (stating\r                             \r\n\nthat \"although the parties may  decide how much authority to vest\r\n\nin any  person, they  may not decide  how much  [ERISA] liability\r\n\nattaches to the exercise of that authority\").\r\n\n          The plaintiffs'  second  attempt  to  avoid  the  clear\r\n\nimplication of section  1105(d) is  disingenuous at  best.   They\r\n\nspeculate  that  Hawthorne  may not  be  an  \"investment manager\"\r\n\nwithin the meaning  of the statute.   This suggestion contradicts\r\n\nthe premise on  which the case has  been argued up to  this point\r\n\nand is  thus precluded.   In the  district court,  the plaintiffs\r\n\nrepeatedly characterized Hawthorne as the Plan's \"principal money\r\n\nmanager,\" and never contended otherwise during the hearing on the\r\n\nmotion to dismiss.  The  plaintiffs must have recognized that the\r\n\ndistrict  court   understood  their  representations  to   be  an\r\n\nadmission that Hawthorne was an investment  manager (at least for\r\n\nthe purpose of the pending  Rule 12(b)(6) motion).  Moreover, the\r\n\nplaintiffs  made  no  effort  to  correct  the  district  court's\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nunderstanding  by moving for reconsideration after Judge Wolf had\r\n\nissued his  decision.   See, e.g., Vanhaaren  v. State  Farm Mut.\r                                                                           \r\n\nAuto. Ins. Co.,  989 F.2d 1, 4-5  (1st Cir. 1993).   We generally\r                        \r\n\nwill  not permit litigants  to assert contradictory  positions at\r\n\ndifferent  stages   of  a  lawsuit  in  order  to  advance  their\r\n\ninterests.  See  Patriot Cinemas, Inc.  v. General Cinema  Corp.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n834  F.2d 208, 211-12 (1st Cir. 1987);  see also United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLevasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 792-93 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating the rule\r                   \r\n\nbut  finding exceptional  circumstances sufficient  to warrant  a\r\n\ndeparture).  In all events, even if the investment manager gambit\r\n\nis not  judicially estopped, it  is surely waived inasmuch  as it\r\n\nmakes its debut in this court.\r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need go  no further.   Because the  trust agreement\r\n\n(coupled with the TAC's  appointment of Hawthorne)  unambiguously\r\n\nestablishes  that the  Bank retained  no discretionary  authority\r\n\nover  the  Plan's  real  estate investments,  we  hold  that  the\r\n\ncomplaint fails to state an actionable claim against the Bank for\r\n\nHawthorne's overvaluation  of those assets.   By the  same token,\r\n\nthe complaint fails to state an actionable claim for co-fiduciary\r\n\nliability  inasmuch as ERISA,  specifically 29 U.S.C.    1105(d),\r\n\nlimits such liability  to knowing participation or  concealment  \r\n\nfacts  not alleged  in  this  case.   Hence,  the district  court\r\n\nappropriately granted the Bank's motion to dismiss.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                25\r\r\n",

(Eastern) brought an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq.  (1994), against the trustee of the failed air carrier's retirement plan.  The district court dismissed the suit after reviewing the trust agreement and concluding that the trustee was not subject to ERISA liability as a fiduciary or co-fiduciary in respect to the harms alleged.  The plaintiffs appeal.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw the facts from the plaintiffs' complaint and the trust agreement.  In 1958, Eastern and the union representing its pilots established a defined contribution retirement plan (the Plan) designed to provide retirees with a range of pension options.  Almost a quarter-century later, the Plan's administrative committee (the TAC) retained State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Bank) to hold the Plan's assets in trust, manage them as directed, and periodically report their value (so that the TAC, inter alia, could effectuate the Plan by calculating annuity and lump-sum retirement benefits).  The parties spelled out the Bank's duties and obligations qua trustee in a trust agreement (the Agreement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As time went by, the Plan invested heavily in real estate.  In reporting the value of these investments, the Bank relied on information obtained from Hawthorne Associates, Inc.  (Hawthorne), the Plan's principal investment manager, in the form of periodic appraisals prepared by Blake, a consultant engaged by Hawthorne.  Despite a subsequent decline in the real estate market, Blake assigned consistently high valuations to the Plan's properties and the Bank parroted those valuations in its reports to the TAC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1991, the Bank expressed concern anent the figures supplied by Hawthorne.  Eventually, it hired Spaulding &amp; Slye (S &amp; S), an independent appraisal firm, to review Blake's handiwork.  Upon encountering difficulty in gaining access to the necessary information, the Bank wrote to Hawthorne stating that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>Our appraiser is prepared to begin his review on Monday, October 7. If he is not permitted to begin his review by Friday, October 11 on the basis of full access to the documents, we believe that we have no recourse but to seek the advice of the Department of Labor as to our concerns about Hawthorne's instructing us to continue to report the real estate at values supplied by Hawthorne as investment manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, Hawthorne relented and an unencumbered review proceeded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S &amp; S thereafter issued a report that criticized Blake's valuations and recommended that new appraisals be secured from a new appraiser.  The Bank submitted the S &amp; S report to the TAC on November 8, 1991.  One week later, the Bank wrote to the TAC's attorney expressing concern that, according to S &amp; S, \"many of the appraisals are incomplete and/or suffer from methodological flaws.\"   The Bank declared that it was \"unwilling to continue to carry these valuations on its books without qualification in light of the[se] concerns.\"   Within a matter of weeks, Hawthorne informed the Bank that it had lowered the appraised values of certain properties.  The Bank accepted the new figures without further investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TAC eventually retained an independent appraiser to assess the Plan's real estate holdings.  This exercise culminated in a substantial reduction of the reported values.  At that point, it became evident that Blake's exaggerated valuations had skewed the Plan's finances:  because inflated appraisal figures had been carried on the Plan's books for nearly a decade, retiring pilots who opted for lump-sum retirement benefits during that period received a windfall, whereas the remaining Plan participants were left holding an unduly depleted bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ENSUING LITIGATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern filed for bankruptcy in 1989.  In due course, several quondam pilots brought an action in a Florida federal court against the Plan, its sponsors, the TAC, and sundry other parties (not including the Bank).  The plaintiffs' complaint invoked ERISA and alleged myriad breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the investment of the Plan's assets.  See Beddall v. Eastern Air Lines, C.A. No. 91-1865-CIV (S.D.Fla.)  (Beddall I ).  The Florida court transferred the case to Massachusetts.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Beddall I plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint to add the Bank as a defendant.  As a precaution, they also initiated a separate suit against the Bank in the Massachusetts federal court (Beddall II ).   The complaint in the latter suit charged that the Bank violated ERISA's fiduciary provisions by its failure to ensure that the Plan's holdings were valued appropriately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Wolf eventually approved a class action settlement in Beddall I, see Beddall v. Eastern Airlines Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for Pilots, No. 93-12074 (D.Mass. Nov. 7, 1996) (order approving final settlement),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the plaintiffs withdrew the pending motion to amend.  The Bank then moved to dismiss Beddall II for failure to state a claim.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  The district court granted the motion.  See Beddall II v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust, 1996 WL 74218 (D.Mass.1996).  Judge Wolf concluded that, because the Agreement absolved the Bank of any fiduciary responsibility for the alleged overvaluation of the Plan's real properties once the TAC engaged Hawthorne as the investment manager in respect to those assets, the complaint failed to state an actionable ERISA claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  See id. at * 1-* 2.   Then, citing ERISA &#167; 405(d), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d), the judge determined that, even if the Bank knew or should have known of Hawthorne's indiscretions, co-fiduciary liability did not attach in the absence of an allegation that the Bank had participated actively in, or concealed, the breach.  See id. at * 2.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We afford de novo review to a district court's resolution of a motion to dismiss.  See Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1992).  Like the court below we must accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint, construe all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiffs, and determine whether the complaint, so read, limns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory of the case.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is familiar lore.  Here, however, there is an odd twist:  the court below scrutinized not only the complaint but also the Agreement--and it is undisputed that the plaintiffs neither appended the latter document to the complaint nor incorporated it therein by an explicit reference.  In this posture of the case, the lower court's consideration of the Agreement gives us pause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this situation calls for a practical, commonsense approach--one that does not elevate form over substance.  The complaint discusses the Agreement at considerable length.  And, although it states conclusorily that \"State Street is a fiduciary of the Plan,\" it then proceeds to summarize the parts of the Agreement that, in the plaintiffs' view, justify this characterization.  The Bank responded to these allegations by filing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and appending to it a copy of the Agreement.  The plaintiffs neither challenged the authenticity of the Agreement nor moved to strike it from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the Agreement was properly before the court.  When, as now, a complaint's factual allegations are expressly linked to--and admittedly dependent upon--a document (the authenticity of which is not challenged), that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 840 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir.1988);  see also Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir.1994) (\"[D]ocuments whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the pleading, may be considered in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\");   2 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 12.34 (3d ed.1997) (explaining that courts may consider \"[u]ndisputed documents alleged or referenced in the complaint\" in deciding a motion to dismiss);  see generally Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(c) (stating that \"[a] copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof\").  Accordingly, we conclude that the district court had the authority to consider the Agreement if it chose to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion makes eminent sense.  A district court's central task in evaluating a motion to dismiss is to determine whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action.  In conducting that tamisage, the court need not accept a complaint's \"bald assertions\" or \"unsupportable conclusions.\"  Chongris v. Board of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987).  While a plaintiff only is obliged to make provable allegations, the court's inquiry into the viability of those allegations should not be hamstrung simply because the plaintiff fails to append to the complaint the very document upon which by her own admission the allegations rest.  Any other approach would seriously hinder recourse to Rule 12 motions, as a plaintiff could thwart the consideration of a critical document merely by omitting it from the complaint.  We doubt that the drafters of the Civil Rules, who envisioned Rule 12(b)(6) motions as a swift, uncomplicated way to weed out plainly unmeritorious cases, would have countenanced such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To their credit, the plaintiffs tacitly concede that the lower court had the prerogative to review the Agreement notwithstanding its omission from the complaint.  They asseverate instead that the court should not have done so without also enabling them to submit other evidence (and, thereby, convert the motion before the court into one for summary judgment).  We reject that asseveration and hold that consideration of the Agreement did not in itself compel the court to treat the motion before it as one for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  We offer three reasons in support of this ruling.  First, the Agreement's centrality to the plaintiffs' contentions, as limned in their complaint, makes it in effect part of the pleadings, and, thus, differentiates its evaluation in conjunction with a motion to dismiss from the assessment of traditional extrinsic evidence.  See Venture Assocs.  Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp., 987 F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir.1993) (\"Documents that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered a part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to her claim.\").  Second, and relatedly, the complaint predicates the plaintiffs' claims regarding the existence of the Bank's ostensible fiduciary duties solely on the Agreement, not on external events.  Lastly, the conversion of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion is a matter quintessentially within the purview of the district court's sound discretion.  See Garita Hotel, 958 F.2d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our treatment of the merits by examining the pertinent portions of ERISA's statutory scheme.  We then turn to the plaintiffs' triad of claims:  (1) that the complaint states a cause of action for fiduciary liability by reason of the Bank's discretionary authority over the Plan's real estate holdings;  (2) that the complaint states a claim for fiduciary liability arising out of the Bank's conduct, including its role in respect to the Plan's Short Term Investment Fund (the STIF);  and (3) that the complaint states a claim against the Bank for co-fiduciary liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>A. The Statutory Scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA's fiduciary duty provisions not only describe who is a \"fiduciary\" or \"co-fiduciary,\" but also what activities constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.  In the first instance, the statute reserves fiduciary liability for \"named fiduciaries,\" defined either as those individuals listed as fiduciaries in the plan documents or those who are otherwise identified as fiduciaries pursuant to a plan-specified procedure.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(2).  But the statute also extends fiduciary liability to functional fiduciaries--persons who act as fiduciaries (though not explicitly denominated as such) by performing at least one of several enumerated functions with respect to a plan.  In this wise, the statute instructs that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key determinant of whether a person qualifies as a functional fiduciary is whether that person exercises discretionary authority in respect to, or meaningful control over, an ERISA plan, its administration, or its assets (such as by rendering investment advice).  See O'Toole v. Arlington Trust Co., 681 F.2d 94, 96 (1st Cir.1982);  see also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2509.75-8, at 571 (1986).  We make two points that inform the application of this rule.  First, the mere exercise of physical control or the performance of mechanical administrative tasks generally is insufficient to confer fiduciary status.  See Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson &amp; Ursillo, Inc., 74 F.3d 20, 21-22 (1st Cir.1996);  Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1502 (9th Cir.1995), cert. dismissed, 517 U.S. 1183, 116 S.Ct. 1710, 134 L.Ed.2d 772 (1996).  Second, fiduciary status is not an all or nothing proposition;  the statutory language indicates that a person is a plan fiduciary only \"to the extent\" that he possesses or exercises the requisite discretion and control.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A).  Because one's fiduciary responsibility under ERISA is directly and solely attributable to his possession or exercise of discretionary authority, fiduciary liability arises in specific increments correlated to the vesting or performance of particular fiduciary functions in service of the plan, not in broad, general terms.  See Maniace v. Commerce Bank, 40 F.3d 264, 267 (8th Cir.1994);  Brandt v. Grounds, 687 F.2d 895, 897 (7th Cir.1982);  NARDA, Inc. v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank, 744 F.Supp. 685, 690 (D.Md.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ERISA fiduciary, properly identified, must employ within the defined domain \"the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(a)(1)(B).  The fiduciary should act \"solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,\" and his overarching purpose should be to \"provid[e] benefits to the participants and their beneficiaries\" and to \"defray[ ] reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\"  Id. &#167; 1104(a)(1).  A fiduciary who fails to fulfill these responsibilities is \"personally liable to make good to [the] plan any losses to the plan resulting from ... such breach.\"  Id. &#167; 1109(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-fiduciary liability is a shorthand rubric under which one ERISA fiduciary may be liable for the failings of another fiduciary.  Co-fiduciary liability inheres if a fiduciary knowingly participates in or conceals another fiduciary's breach, enables such other to commit a breach, or learns about such a breach and fails to make reasonable efforts to remedy it.  See id. &#167; 1105(a).  In some circumstances, co-fiduciary liability is subject to a special set of rules.  This is true, for example, where the putative co-fiduciary is a trustee and the breach is at the hands of a plan-appointed investment manager.  See id. &#167; 1105(d)(1) (stating generally that a trustee shall only be liable for a money manager's violation if the former participates in or acts to conceal the breach).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>B. The Bank's Status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The starting point for reasoned analysis of the Bank's fiduciary status is the Agreement.  In support of their assertion that the Bank bears fiduciary responsibility for Hawthorne's misvaluation of the real estate investments, the plaintiffs direct our attention to three sections of the Agreement, which we set out in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Section 3. Investment of the Fund.

We do not agree.  The quoted text authorizes the Bank mainly to perform administrative and ministerial functions in respect to those investments which, like real estate, are held within a so-called Investment Manager Account.  Without more, mechanical administrative responsibilities (such as retaining the assets and keeping a record of their value) are insufficient to ground a claim of fiduciary status.  See O'Toole, 681 F.2d at 96 (concluding that a bank's duties \"as the depository for the funds do not include the discretionary, advisory activities described by the [ERISA] statute\");  Pension Fund--Mid Jersey Trucking Indus.--Local 701 v. Omni Funding Group, 731 F.Supp. 161, 174-75 (D.N.J.1990) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To give the devil his due, we acknowledge that section 4, standing alone, might be construed as authorizing the Bank, under some circumstances, to manage the Plan's real estate investments in a manner that would render it a fiduciary with regard to the valuation of those assets.  Nevertheless, section 4 cannot be read in a vacuum.  The TAC nominated Hawthorne as an investment manager in respect to the Plan's real estate holdings, and the plain language of section 6 of the Agreement leaves little doubt but that the TAC thereby relieved the Bank of all fiduciary responsibility regarding those investments.  In terms, section 6 shifts to an appointed investment manager all discretion over affected assets and makes the investment manager--not the trustee--responsible for \"perform[ing] such accounting and valuation functions and such other duties as shall be necessary to enable the Trustee to fully perform.\"   To cinch matters, section 6 expressly absolves the trustee of \"responsibility for supervising any Investment Manager\";  confirms that the trustee is not obliged \"to review or make inquiries as to any action or direction of any Investment Manager,\" or \"to review or value the assets held in any Investment Manager account.\"   Further, it proclaims, with a single exception not relevant to this discussion, that the trustee \"shall not be liable for any act or omission of any Investment Manager.\"   These stipulations strip any veneer of plausibility from the plaintiffs' bald assertion that the Bank is a fiduciary subject to liability for Hawthorne's overvaluation of the Plan's real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch attempt to blunt the force of this conclusion, the plaintiffs point to language that gives the trustee the right to reject the investment manager's directions in certain circumstances--say, if those directions are not \"in a form satisfactory to it\"--and they argue that, as a result of this \"discretion\" (to use plaintiffs' word), the Bank retains its status as a fiduciary notwithstanding the other language contained in section 6. This argument will not fly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond cavil that when the TAC appoints an investment manager for designated assets, the Agreement shifts all significant discretion and control over those assets to the investment manager and relegates the trustee to the role of an administrative functionary.  With section 6 velivolant, the Bank's remaining powers are ministerial.  They involve such details as checking whether Hawthorne's instructions are in a writing signed by an authorized person and issuing periodic reports to the TAC anent the Fund's status.  Although the Bank arguably may refuse to follow instructions that are not in an acceptable format, this negative discretion lies well within the administrative sphere, and its existence does not transform the Bank into a fiduciary vis-a-vis the affected assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Arizona State Carpenters Pension Trust Fund v. Citibank, 125 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not paint the lily.  The complaint acknowledges that the TAC appointed Hawthorne to manage its real estate investments.  In that circumstance, the trust document, read as a whole, divests the Bank of any and all management authority or discretionary control over those assets.  Whatever the Bank's powers may have been in the absence of a duly appointed investment manager, no fiduciary responsibility in regard to the valuation of the Plan's real estate holdings survived the appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>C. The Bank's Actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charting a slightly different flight path, the plaintiffs urge us to set the Agreement to one side and to deem the Bank a fiduciary of the Plan's real estate investments by virtue of its actions.  They posit that, because the Bank was not entirely passive--it questioned Hawthorne's valuations, engaged an independent appraiser to review Hawthorne's numbers, and ultimately threatened to report Hawthorne's practices to the authorities--it acted as a fiduciary and thus we should treat it as one.  We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of policy and principle, ERISA does not impose Good Samaritan liability.  A financial institution cannot be deemed to have volunteered itself as a fiduciary simply because it undertakes reporting responsibilities that exceed its official mandate.  Imputing fiduciary status to those who gratuitously assist a plan's administrators is undesirable in a variety of ways, and ERISA's somewhat narrow fiduciary provisions are designed to avoid such incremental costs.  See generally Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 262-63, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 2071-72, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993).  Viewed against this backdrop, a rule that would dampen any incentive on the part of depository institutions voluntarily to make relevant information available to fund administrators and other interested parties is counter-intuitive.  Moreover, such a wrong-headed rule \"would also risk creating a climate in which depository institutions would routinely increase their fees to account for the risk that fiduciary liability might attach to nonfiduciary work.\"  Arizona State Carpenters, 125 F.3d at 722.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the plaintiffs' fiduciary claim derives from the Bank's activities with regard to Plan assets apart from real estate, it fares no better.  The plaintiffs argue that because the Bank is a fiduciary with regard to the STIF, it had a statutory responsibility to make a timely disclosure to the Plan participants of its concerns about Hawthorne's real estate valuations.  We agree with the plaintiffs' premise--clearly, the Bank had some discretion with regard to investing cash in the STIF--but their conclusion does not necessarily follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refined to bare essence, the question is whether an ERISA fiduciary for one purpose has an obligation to disclose his suspicions even when there is no nexus between his particular fiduciary responsibilities and the perceived jeopardy.  This is an issue of first impression, certainly in this circuit, and perhaps more broadly.  Good arguments exist on both sides.  On the one hand, the obligations of an ERISA fiduciary, while governed by federal law, are informed by the common law of trusts.  That law generally treats the communication of material facts to the beneficiary as \"the core of a fiduciary's responsibility.\"  Eddy v. Colonial Life Ins. Co., 919 F.2d 747, 750 (D.C.Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  On the other hand, it is settled that a non-fiduciary's failure to communicate knowledge of a fiduciary's breach does not \"constitute culpable participation in a breach of trust under ERISA.\"  Painters of Philadelphia Dist. Council No. 21 Welfare Fund v. Price Waterhouse, 879 F.2d 1146, 1153 n. 9 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this question is both close and interesting, we need not answer it today.  Apart from the co-fiduciary claim, considered infra, the plaintiffs' complaint does not premise a claim on the Bank's supposed obligation to inform Plan participants of the suspected misvaluations.  Instead, the complaint predicates the plaintiffs' alternate claim of fiduciary liability on the Bank's \"willingness to accept Hawthorne's instructions as to the values to be carried on [the Bank's] books.\"   According to the complaint, this gaffe \"resulted in those properties being carried on the [Bank's] books for many years at values greatly in excess of their market values, which in turn led to retiring pilots receiving millions more in lump sum benefits than the benefits to which they were entitled.\"   Nowhere in the complaint (or in the plaintiffs' opposition to the motion to dismiss, for that matter) do the plaintiffs make the entirely distinct claim that the Bank breached a fiduciary obligation under ERISA because it failed to notify Plan participants of Hawthorne's erroneous appraisals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  Afterthought theories--even cleverly constructed afterthought theories--cannot be introduced for the first time in an appellate venue through the simple expedient of dressing them up to look like preexisting claims.  \"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992);  accord McCoy v. M.I.T., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991).  Since there are no extraordinary circumstances here--when the plaintiffs sued, they had experienced counsel, a good grasp of the facts (honed by the rigors of Beddall I ), and ample time to decide which arguments to press--that principle applies full bore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>D. Co-Fiduciary Liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' final approach centers around a claim that the Bank is liable as a co-fiduciary.  This claim comes perilously close to suffering from the same procedural infirmity that we have just identified.  The complaint is not artfully pleaded and no explicit co-fiduciary liability claim appears on its face.  Nevertheless, the plaintiffs argued a co-fiduciary liability claim theory below and the district court addressed it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long.  The short of it is that the plaintiffs' allegations, even if well-pleaded and assumed to be true, do not establish a violation of ERISA's co-fiduciary provisions.  ERISA renders a fiduciary vulnerable to liability for breaches committed by other fiduciaries in three situations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>(1) if he participates knowingly in, or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>(2) if, by his failure to comply with ... the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a fiduciary, he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(a).  Given their allegations, the plaintiffs' claim must stand or fall on the third of these scenarios.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We think that it falls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d) provides that a fiduciary (such as the Bank) cannot be held responsible as a co-fiduciary on the basis of acts described in section 1105(a)(2) or (3):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>If an investment manager or managers have been appointed ... then, notwithstanding subsections (a)(2) and (3) ..., no trustee shall be liable from the acts or omissions of such investment manager or managers, or be under an obligation to invest or otherwise manage any asset of the plan which is subject to the management of such investment manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d) (emphasis supplied).  Given its literal meaning, section 1105(d) defenestrates the plaintiffs' claim that the Bank is subject to co-fiduciary liability in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs attempt to steer away from the obvious conclusion and to ensure a soft landing by two stratagems.  First, they point to the exact language of section 6 of the Agreement (\"The Trustee shall not be liable for any act or omission of the Investment Manager, except as provided in Section 405(a) of ERISA [29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(a) ].\") (emphasis supplied).  This verbiage, they assert, evinces an intent to hold a fiduciary liable for all the conduct described in section 1105(a), without reference to the exculpatory provisions of section 1105(d).  We reject that assertion out of hand.  The Agreement's reference to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(a) can only be read as incorporating that section to the extent that it would impart liability under the statute.  Cf. Chicago Bd. Options Exchange, Inc. v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 713 F.2d 254, 259 (7th Cir.1983) (stating that \"although the parties may decide how much authority to vest in any person, they may not decide how much [ERISA] liability attaches to the exercise of that authority\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' second attempt to avoid the clear implication of section 1105(d) is disingenuous at best.  They speculate that Hawthorne may not be an \"investment manager\" within the meaning of the statute.  This suggestion contradicts the premise on which the case has been argued up to this point and is thus precluded.  In the district court, the plaintiffs repeatedly characterized Hawthorne as the Plan's \"principal money manager,\" and never contended otherwise during the hearing on the motion to dismiss.  The plaintiffs must have recognized that the district court understood their representations to be an admission that Hawthorne was an investment manager (at least for the purpose of the pending Rule 12(b)(6) motion).  Moreover, the plaintiffs made no effort to correct the district court's understanding by moving for reconsideration after Judge Wolf had issued his decision.  See, e.g., VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1993).  We generally will not permit litigants to assert contradictory positions at different stages of a lawsuit in order to advance their interests.  See Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 211-12 (1st Cir.1987);  see also United States v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 792-93 (1st Cir.1988) (stating the rule but finding exceptional circumstances sufficient to warrant a departure).  In all events, even if the investment manager gambit is not judicially estopped, it is surely waived inasmuch as it makes its debut in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Because the trust agreement (coupled with the TAC's appointment of Hawthorne) unambiguously establishes that the Bank retained no discretionary authority over the Plan's real estate investments, we hold that the complaint fails to state an actionable claim against the Bank for Hawthorne's overvaluation of those assets.  By the same token, the complaint fails to state an actionable claim for co-fiduciary liability inasmuch as ERISA, specifically 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d), limits such liability to knowing participation or concealment--facts not alleged in this case.  Hence, the district court appropriately granted the Bank's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the settlement, the named defendants paid the Plan more than $10,000,000.

Although the conversion of the plaintiffs' motion would have enabled them to submit evidence regarding the Bank's fiduciary responsibilities, the act of conversion also would have imported the summary judgment standard into the case and raised the bar for the plaintiffs.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  By eschewing conversion, the district court ensured that the plaintiffs' complaint would be subjected to the less demanding scrutiny associated with motions to dismiss</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Similarly, the Bank's retention under section 6 of a right to secure a certified appraisal of the real estate does not alter the decisional calculus because the Bank has no such duty.   Indeed, section 6 explicitly provides that the Bank has no obligation \"to review or value the assets held in any Investment Manager Account.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note, however, that the Eddy court described ERISA's fiduciary duty to disclose as the duty \"not only to inform a beneficiary of new and relevant information as it arises, but also to advise him of circumstances that threaten interests relevant to the relationship.\"  Eddy, 919 F.2d at 750 (emphasis supplied).  Indeed, every case that the plaintiffs have cited in support of an affirmative duty to disclose arises in a context in which the plaintiff charges the defendant with withholding information related (i.e., relevant) to the fiduciary's association with the plan.  See, e.g., Ream v. Frey, 107 F.3d 147, 149-50 (3d Cir.1997);  Glaziers and Glassworkers Union Local No. 252 Annuity Fund v. Newbridge Sec., Inc., 93 F.3d 1171, 1175-77 (3d Cir.1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The lower court apparently cobbled the co-fiduciary claim together from a liberal reading of the complaint.  The complaint does allege that the Bank is a fiduciary (an allegation that is irrefutable with regard to the STIF), that it had some knowledge of Hawthorne's improprieties, and that it failed to make reasonable efforts to remedy the situation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Of course, the Bank argues that it did, indeed, take reasonable steps to investigate Hawthorne's improprieties and put an end to them.  The potential issues relating to whether such steps actually were taken and/or their sufficiency are not before us, and we do not endeavor to decide those issues</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(Eastern) brought an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq.  (1994), against the trustee of the failed air carrier's retirement plan.  The district court dismissed the suit after reviewing the trust agreement and concluding that the trustee was not subject to ERISA liability as a fiduciary or co-fiduciary in respect to the harms alleged.  The plaintiffs appeal.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw the facts from the plaintiffs' complaint and the trust agreement.  In 1958, Eastern and the union representing its pilots established a defined contribution retirement plan (the Plan) designed to provide retirees with a range of pension options.  Almost a quarter-century later, the Plan's administrative committee (the TAC) retained State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Bank) to hold the Plan's assets in trust, manage them as directed, and periodically report their value (so that the TAC, inter alia, could effectuate the Plan by calculating annuity and lump-sum retirement benefits).  The parties spelled out the Bank's duties and obligations qua trustee in a trust agreement (the Agreement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As time went by, the Plan invested heavily in real estate.  In reporting the value of these investments, the Bank relied on information obtained from Hawthorne Associates, Inc.  (Hawthorne), the Plan's principal investment manager, in the form of periodic appraisals prepared by Blake, a consultant engaged by Hawthorne.  Despite a subsequent decline in the real estate market, Blake assigned consistently high valuations to the Plan's properties and the Bank parroted those valuations in its reports to the TAC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1991, the Bank expressed concern anent the figures supplied by Hawthorne.  Eventually, it hired Spaulding &amp; Slye (S &amp; S), an independent appraisal firm, to review Blake's handiwork.  Upon encountering difficulty in gaining access to the necessary information, the Bank wrote to Hawthorne stating that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>Our appraiser is prepared to begin his review on Monday, October 7. If he is not permitted to begin his review by Friday, October 11 on the basis of full access to the documents, we believe that we have no recourse but to seek the advice of the Department of Labor as to our concerns about Hawthorne's instructing us to continue to report the real estate at values supplied by Hawthorne as investment manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, Hawthorne relented and an unencumbered review proceeded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S &amp; S thereafter issued a report that criticized Blake's valuations and recommended that new appraisals be secured from a new appraiser.  The Bank submitted the S &amp; S report to the TAC on November 8, 1991.  One week later, the Bank wrote to the TAC's attorney expressing concern that, according to S &amp; S, \"many of the appraisals are incomplete and/or suffer from methodological flaws.\"   The Bank declared that it was \"unwilling to continue to carry these valuations on its books without qualification in light of the[se] concerns.\"   Within a matter of weeks, Hawthorne informed the Bank that it had lowered the appraised values of certain properties.  The Bank accepted the new figures without further investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TAC eventually retained an independent appraiser to assess the Plan's real estate holdings.  This exercise culminated in a substantial reduction of the reported values.  At that point, it became evident that Blake's exaggerated valuations had skewed the Plan's finances:  because inflated appraisal figures had been carried on the Plan's books for nearly a decade, retiring pilots who opted for lump-sum retirement benefits during that period received a windfall, whereas the remaining Plan participants were left holding an unduly depleted bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ENSUING LITIGATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern filed for bankruptcy in 1989.  In due course, several quondam pilots brought an action in a Florida federal court against the Plan, its sponsors, the TAC, and sundry other parties (not including the Bank).  The plaintiffs' complaint invoked ERISA and alleged myriad breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the investment of the Plan's assets.  See Beddall v. Eastern Air Lines, C.A. No. 91-1865-CIV (S.D.Fla.)  (Beddall I ).  The Florida court transferred the case to Massachusetts.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Beddall I plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint to add the Bank as a defendant.  As a precaution, they also initiated a separate suit against the Bank in the Massachusetts federal court (Beddall II ).   The complaint in the latter suit charged that the Bank violated ERISA's fiduciary provisions by its failure to ensure that the Plan's holdings were valued appropriately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Wolf eventually approved a class action settlement in Beddall I, see Beddall v. Eastern Airlines Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for Pilots, No. 93-12074 (D.Mass. Nov. 7, 1996) (order approving final settlement),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the plaintiffs withdrew the pending motion to amend.  The Bank then moved to dismiss Beddall II for failure to state a claim.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  The district court granted the motion.  See Beddall II v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">74218</span></span> (D.Mass.1996).  Judge Wolf concluded that, because the Agreement absolved the Bank of any fiduciary responsibility for the alleged overvaluation of the Plan's real properties once the TAC engaged Hawthorne as the investment manager in respect to those assets, the complaint failed to state an actionable ERISA claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  See id. at * 1-* 2.   Then, citing ERISA &#167; 405(d), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d), the judge determined that, even if the Bank knew or should have known of Hawthorne's indiscretions, co-fiduciary liability did not attach in the absence of an allegation that the Bank had participated actively in, or concealed, the breach.  See id. at * 2.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We afford de novo review to a district court's resolution of a motion to dismiss.  See Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578672\"><a href=\"/opinion/578672/garita-hotel-limited-partnership-etc-v-ponce-federal-bank-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1992).  Like the court below we must accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint, construe all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiffs, and determine whether the complaint, so read, limns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory of the case.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is familiar lore.  Here, however, there is an odd twist:  the court below scrutinized not only the complaint but also the Agreement--and it is undisputed that the plaintiffs neither appended the latter document to the complaint nor incorporated it therein by an explicit reference.  In this posture of the case, the lower court's consideration of the Agreement gives us pause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this situation calls for a practical, commonsense approach--one that does not elevate form over substance.  The complaint discusses the Agreement at considerable length.  And, although it states conclusorily that \"State Street is a fiduciary of the Plan,\" it then proceeds to summarize the parts of the Agreement that, in the plaintiffs' view, justify this characterization.  The Bank responded to these allegations by filing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and appending to it a copy of the Agreement.  The plaintiffs neither challenged the authenticity of the Agreement nor moved to strike it from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the Agreement was properly before the court.  When, as now, a complaint's factual allegations are expressly linked to--and admittedly dependent upon--a document (the authenticity of which is not challenged), that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502426\"><a href=\"/opinion/502426/leslie-fudge-v-penthouse-international-ltd-leslie-fudge-v-penthouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span>, 1015 (1st Cir.1988);  see also Branch v. Tunnell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660713\"><a href=\"/opinion/660713/jerry-l-branch-valenna-branch-colby-branch-v-dale-l-tunnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 454 (9th Cir.1994) (\"[D]ocuments whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the pleading, may be considered in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\");   2 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 12.34 (3d ed.1997) (explaining that courts may consider \"[u]ndisputed documents alleged or referenced in the complaint\" in deciding a motion to dismiss);  see generally Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(c) (stating that \"[a] copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof\").  Accordingly, we conclude that the district court had the authority to consider the Agreement if it chose to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion makes eminent sense.  A district court's central task in evaluating a motion to dismiss is to determine whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action.  In conducting that tamisage, the court need not accept a complaint's \"bald assertions\" or \"unsupportable conclusions.\"  Chongris v. Board of Appeals, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482848\"><a href=\"/opinion/482848/james-chongris-and-george-chongris-v-board-of-appeals-of-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1987).  While a plaintiff only is obliged to make provable allegations, the court's inquiry into the viability of those allegations should not be hamstrung simply because the plaintiff fails to append to the complaint the very document upon which by her own admission the allegations rest.  Any other approach would seriously hinder recourse to Rule 12 motions, as a plaintiff could thwart the consideration of a critical document merely by omitting it from the complaint.  We doubt that the drafters of the Civil Rules, who envisioned Rule 12(b)(6) motions as a swift, uncomplicated way to weed out plainly unmeritorious cases, would have countenanced such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To their credit, the plaintiffs tacitly concede that the lower court had the prerogative to review the Agreement notwithstanding its omission from the complaint.  They asseverate instead that the court should not have done so without also enabling them to submit other evidence (and, thereby, convert the motion before the court into one for summary judgment).  We reject that asseveration and hold that consideration of the Agreement did not in itself compel the court to treat the motion before it as one for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  We offer three reasons in support of this ruling.  First, the Agreement's centrality to the plaintiffs' contentions, as limned in their complaint, makes it in effect part of the pleadings, and, thus, differentiates its evaluation in conjunction with a motion to dismiss from the assessment of traditional extrinsic evidence.  See Venture Assocs.  Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601537\"><a href=\"/opinion/601537/venture-associates-corporation-a-tennessee-corporation-v-zenith-data/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>, 431 (7th Cir.1993) (\"Documents that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered a part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to her claim.\").  Second, and relatedly, the complaint predicates the plaintiffs' claims regarding the existence of the Bank's ostensible fiduciary duties solely on the Agreement, not on external events.  Lastly, the conversion of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion is a matter quintessentially within the purview of the district court's sound discretion.  See Garita Hotel, 958 F.2d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our treatment of the merits by examining the pertinent portions of ERISA's statutory scheme.  We then turn to the plaintiffs' triad of claims:  (1) that the complaint states a cause of action for fiduciary liability by reason of the Bank's discretionary authority over the Plan's real estate holdings;  (2) that the complaint states a claim for fiduciary liability arising out of the Bank's conduct, including its role in respect to the Plan's Short Term Investment Fund (the STIF);  and (3) that the complaint states a claim against the Bank for co-fiduciary liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>A. The Statutory Scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA's fiduciary duty provisions not only describe who is a \"fiduciary\" or \"co-fiduciary,\" but also what activities constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.  In the first instance, the statute reserves fiduciary liability for \"named fiduciaries,\" defined either as those individuals listed as fiduciaries in the plan documents or those who are otherwise identified as fiduciaries pursuant to a plan-specified procedure.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(2).  But the statute also extends fiduciary liability to functional fiduciaries--persons who act as fiduciaries (though not explicitly denominated as such) by performing at least one of several enumerated functions with respect to a plan.  In this wise, the statute instructs that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key determinant of whether a person qualifies as a functional fiduciary is whether that person exercises discretionary authority in respect to, or meaningful control over, an ERISA plan, its administration, or its assets (such as by rendering investment advice).  See O'Toole v. Arlington Trust Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405338\"><a href=\"/opinion/405338/3-employee-benefits-ca-1820-10-fed-r-evid-serv-1579-joseph-f-otoole/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir.1982);  see also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2509.75-8, at 571 (1986).  We make two points that inform the application of this rule.  First, the mere exercise of physical control or the performance of mechanical administrative tasks generally is insufficient to confer fiduciary status.  See Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson &amp; Ursillo, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711063\"><a href=\"/opinion/711063/pens-plan-guide-p-23917o-arthur-t-cottrill-v-sparrow-johnson-ursillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 21-22 (1st Cir.1996);  Concha v. London, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702291\"><a href=\"/opinion/702291/nos-93-55478-93-55695/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1493</span></a></span>, 1502 (9th Cir.1995), cert. dismissed, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1710</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></span> (1996).  Second, fiduciary status is not an all or nothing proposition;  the statutory language indicates that a person is a plan fiduciary only \"to the extent\" that he possesses or exercises the requisite discretion and control.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A).  Because one's fiduciary responsibility under ERISA is directly and solely attributable to his possession or exercise of discretionary authority, fiduciary liability arises in specific increments correlated to the vesting or performance of particular fiduciary functions in service of the plan, not in broad, general terms.  See Maniace v. Commerce Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682483\"><a href=\"/opinion/682483/anthony-t-maniace-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all-other-participants/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 267 (8th Cir.1994);  Brandt v.

The fiduciary should act \"solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,\" and his overarching purpose should be to \"provid[e] benefits to the participants and their beneficiaries\" and to \"defray[ ] reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\"  Id. &#167; 1104(a)(1).  A fiduciary who fails to fulfill these responsibilities is \"personally liable to make good to [the] plan any losses to the plan resulting from ... such breach.\"  Id. &#167; 1109(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-fiduciary liability is a shorthand rubric under which one ERISA fiduciary may be liable for the failings of another fiduciary.  Co-fiduciary liability inheres if a fiduciary knowingly participates in or conceals another fiduciary's breach, enables such other to commit a breach, or learns about such a breach and fails to make reasonable efforts to remedy it.  See id. &#167; 1105(a).  In some circumstances, co-fiduciary liability is subject to a special set of rules.  This is true, for example, where the putative co-fiduciary is a trustee and the breach is at the hands of a plan-appointed investment manager.  See id. &#167; 1105(d)(1) (stating generally that a trustee shall only be liable for a money manager's violation if the former participates in or acts to conceal the breach).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>B.

In support of their assertion that the Bank bears fiduciary responsibility for Hawthorne's misvaluation of the real estate investments, the plaintiffs direct our attention to three sections of the Agreement, which we set out in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Section 3.

We do not agree.  The quoted text authorizes the Bank mainly to perform administrative and ministerial functions in respect to those investments which, like real estate, are held within a so-called Investment Manager Account.  Without more, mechanical administrative responsibilities (such as retaining the assets and keeping a record of their value) are insufficient to ground a claim of fiduciary status.  See O'Toole, 681 F.2d at 96 (concluding that a bank's duties \"as the depository for the funds do not include the discretionary, advisory activities described by the [ERISA] statute\");  Pension Fund--Mid Jersey Trucking Indus.--Local 701 v. Omni Funding Group, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Nevertheless, section 4 cannot be read in a vacuum.  The TAC nominated Hawthorne as an investment manager in respect to the Plan's real estate holdings, and the plain language of section 6 of the Agreement leaves little doubt but that the TAC thereby relieved the Bank of all fiduciary responsibility regarding those investments.  In terms, section 6 shifts to an appointed investment manager all discretion over affected assets and makes the investment manager--not the trustee--responsible for \"perform[ing] such accounting and valuation functions and such other duties as shall be necessary to enable the Trustee to fully perform.\"   To cinch matters, section 6 expressly absolves the trustee of \"responsibility for supervising any Investment Manager\";  confirms that the trustee is not obliged \"to review or make inquiries as to any action or direction of any Investment Manager,\" or \"to review or value the assets held in any Investment Manager account.\"   Further, it proclaims, with a single exception not relevant to this discussion, that the trustee \"shall not be liable for any act or omission of any Investment Manager.\"   These stipulations strip any veneer of plausibility from the plaintiffs' bald assertion that the Bank is a fiduciary subject to liability for Hawthorne's overvaluation of the Plan's real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch attempt to blunt the force of this conclusion, the plaintiffs point to language that gives the trustee the right to reject the investment manager's directions in certain circumstances--say, if those directions are not \"in a form satisfactory to it\"--and they argue that, as a result of this \"discretion\" (to use plaintiffs' word), the Bank retains its status as a fiduciary notwithstanding the other language contained in section 6. This argument will not fly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond cavil that when the TAC appoints an investment manager for designated assets, the Agreement shifts all significant discretion and control over those assets to the investment manager and relegates the trustee to the role of an administrative functionary.  With section 6 velivolant, the Bank's remaining powers are ministerial.  They involve such details as checking whether Hawthorne's instructions are in a writing signed by an authorized person and issuing periodic reports to the TAC anent the Fund's status.  Although the Bank arguably may refuse to follow instructions that are not in an acceptable format, this negative discretion lies well within the administrative sphere, and its existence does not transform the Bank into a fiduciary vis-a-vis the affected assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Arizona State Carpenters Pension Trust Fund v.

The complaint acknowledges that the TAC appointed Hawthorne to manage its real estate investments.  In that circumstance, the trust document, read as a whole, divests the Bank of any and all management authority or discretionary control over those assets.  Whatever the Bank's powers may have been in the absence of a duly appointed investment manager, no fiduciary responsibility in regard to the valuation of the Plan's real estate holdings survived the appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>C.

They posit that, because the Bank was not entirely passive--it questioned Hawthorne's valuations, engaged an independent appraiser to review Hawthorne's numbers, and ultimately threatened to report Hawthorne's practices to the authorities--it acted as a fiduciary and thus we should treat it as one.  We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of policy and principle, ERISA does not impose Good Samaritan liability.  A financial institution cannot be deemed to have volunteered itself as a fiduciary simply because it undertakes reporting responsibilities that exceed its official mandate.  Imputing fiduciary status to those who gratuitously assist a plan's administrators is undesirable in a variety of ways, and ERISA's somewhat narrow fiduciary provisions are designed to avoid such incremental costs.

Hewitt Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112867\"><a href=\"/opinion/112867/mertens-v-hewitt-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 262-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112867\"><a href=\"/opinion/112867/mertens-v-hewitt-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Viewed against this backdrop, a rule that would dampen any incentive on the part of depository institutions voluntarily to make relevant information available to fund administrators and other interested parties is counter-intuitive.  Moreover, such a wrong-headed rule \"would also risk creating a climate in which depository institutions would routinely increase their fees to account for the risk that fiduciary liability might attach to nonfiduciary work.\"  Arizona State Carpenters, 125 F.3d at 722.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the plaintiffs' fiduciary claim derives from the Bank's activities with regard to Plan assets apart from real estate, it fares no better.  The plaintiffs argue that because the Bank is a fiduciary with regard to the STIF, it had a statutory responsibility to make a timely disclosure to the Plan participants of its concerns about Hawthorne's real estate valuations.  We agree with the plaintiffs' premise--clearly, the Bank had some discretion with regard to investing cash in the STIF--but their conclusion does not necessarily follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refined to bare essence, the question is whether an ERISA fiduciary for one purpose has an obligation to disclose his suspicions even when there is no nexus between his particular fiduciary responsibilities and the perceived jeopardy.  This is an issue of first impression, certainly in this circuit, and perhaps more broadly.  Good arguments exist on both sides.  On the one hand, the obligations of an ERISA fiduciary, while governed by federal law, are informed by the common law of trusts.  That law generally treats the communication of material facts to the beneficiary as \"the core of a fiduciary's responsibility.\"  Eddy v. Colonial Life Ins.

Apart from the co-fiduciary claim, considered infra, the plaintiffs' complaint does not premise a claim on the Bank's supposed obligation to inform Plan participants of the suspected misvaluations.  Instead, the complaint predicates the plaintiffs' alternate claim of fiduciary liability on the Bank's \"willingness to accept Hawthorne's instructions as to the values to be carried on [the Bank's] books.\"   According to the complaint, this gaffe \"resulted in those properties being carried on the [Bank's] books for many years at values greatly in excess of their market values, which in turn led to retiring pilots receiving millions more in lump sum benefits than the benefits to which they were entitled.\"   Nowhere in the complaint (or in the plaintiffs' opposition to the motion to dismiss, for that matter) do the plaintiffs make the entirely distinct claim that the Bank breached a fiduciary obligation under ERISA because it failed to notify Plan participants of Hawthorne's erroneous appraisals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  Afterthought theories--even cleverly constructed afterthought theories--cannot be introduced for the first time in an appellate venue through the simple expedient of dressing them up to look like preexisting claims.  \"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters Local No. 59 v.

Since there are no extraordinary circumstances here--when the plaintiffs sued, they had experienced counsel, a good grasp of the facts (honed by the rigors of Beddall I ), and ample time to decide which arguments to press--that principle applies full bore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>D. Co-Fiduciary Liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' final approach centers around a claim that the Bank is liable as a co-fiduciary.  This claim comes perilously close to suffering from the same procedural infirmity that we have just identified.  The complaint is not artfully pleaded and no explicit co-fiduciary liability claim appears on its face.  Nevertheless, the plaintiffs argued a co-fiduciary liability claim theory below and the district court addressed it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long.  The short of it is that the plaintiffs' allegations, even if well-pleaded and assumed to be true, do not establish a violation of ERISA's co-fiduciary provisions.  ERISA renders a fiduciary vulnerable to liability for breaches committed by other fiduciaries in three situations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>(1) if he participates knowingly in, or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>(2) if, by his failure to comply with ... the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a fiduciary, he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(a).  Given their allegations, the plaintiffs' claim must stand or fall on the third of these scenarios.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We think that it falls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d) provides that a fiduciary (such as the Bank) cannot be held responsible as a co-fiduciary on the basis of acts described in section 1105(a)(2) or (3):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>If an investment manager or managers have been appointed ... then, notwithstanding subsections (a)(2) and (3) ..., no trustee shall be liable from the acts or omissions of such investment manager or managers, or be under an obligation to invest or otherwise manage any asset of the plan which is subject to the management of such investment manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d) (emphasis supplied).  Given its literal meaning, section 1105(d) defenestrates the plaintiffs' claim that the Bank is subject to co-fiduciary liability in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs attempt to steer away from the obvious conclusion and to ensure a soft landing by two stratagems.  First, they point to the exact language of section 6 of the Agreement (\"The Trustee shall not be liable for any act or omission of the Investment Manager, except as provided in Section 405(a) of ERISA [29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(a) ].\") (emphasis supplied).  This verbiage, they assert, evinces an intent to hold a fiduciary liable for all the conduct described in section 1105(a), without reference to the exculpatory provisions of section 1105(d).  We reject that assertion out of hand.  The Agreement's reference to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(a) can only be read as incorporating that section to the extent that it would impart liability under the statute.  Cf. Chicago Bd. Options Exchange, Inc. v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422087\"><a href=\"/opinion/422087/chicago-board-options-exchange-inc-contractholder-and-donald-r-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 259 (7th Cir.1983) (stating that \"although the parties may decide how much authority to vest in any person, they may not decide how much [ERISA] liability attaches to the exercise of that authority\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' second attempt to avoid the clear implication of section 1105(d) is disingenuous at best.  They speculate that Hawthorne may not be an \"investment manager\" within the meaning of the statute.  This suggestion contradicts the premise on which the case has been argued up to this point and is thus precluded.  In the district court, the plaintiffs repeatedly characterized Hawthorne as the Plan's \"principal money manager,\" and never contended otherwise during the hearing on the motion to dismiss.  The plaintiffs must have recognized that the district court understood their representations to be an admission that Hawthorne was an investment manager (at least for the purpose of the pending Rule 12(b)(6) motion).  Moreover, the plaintiffs made no effort to correct the district court's understanding by moving for reconsideration after Judge Wolf had issued his decision.  See, e.g., VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602828\"><a href=\"/opinion/602828/dennis-vanhaaren-v-state-farm-mutual-automobile-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1993).  We generally will not permit litigants to assert contradictory positions at different stages of a lawsuit in order to advance their interests.  See Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v.

In all events, even if the investment manager gambit is not judicially estopped, it is surely waived inasmuch as it makes its debut in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Because the trust agreement (coupled with the TAC's appointment of Hawthorne) unambiguously establishes that the Bank retained no discretionary authority over the Plan's real estate investments, we hold that the complaint fails to state an actionable claim against the Bank for Hawthorne's overvaluation of those assets.  By the same token, the complaint fails to state an actionable claim for co-fiduciary liability inasmuch as ERISA, specifically 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1105(d), limits such liability to knowing participation or concealment--facts not alleged in this case.  Hence, the district court appropriately granted the Bank's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the settlement, the named defendants paid the Plan more than $10,000,000.

By eschewing conversion, the district court ensured that the plaintiffs' complaint would be subjected to the less demanding scrutiny associated with motions to dismiss</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Similarly, the Bank's retention under section 6 of a right to secure a certified appraisal of the real estate does not alter the decisional calculus because the Bank has no such duty.   Indeed, section 6 explicitly provides that the Bank has no obligation \"to review or value the assets held in any Investment Manager Account.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note, however, that the Eddy court described ERISA's fiduciary duty to disclose as the duty \"not only to inform a beneficiary of new and relevant information as it arises, but also to advise him of circumstances that threaten interests relevant to the relationship.\"  Eddy, 919 F.2d at 750 (emphasis supplied).  Indeed, every case that the plaintiffs have cited in support of an affirmative duty to disclose arises in a context in which the plaintiff charges the defendant with withholding information related (i.e., relevant) to the fiduciary's association with the plan.  See, e.g., Ream v. Frey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736208\"><a href=\"/opinion/736208/jeffrey-ream-v-jeffrey-e-frey-fulton-bank-laurie-l-frey-fulton-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 149-50 (3d Cir.1997);  Glaziers and Glassworkers Union Local No. 252 Annuity Fund v. Newbridge Sec., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725011\"><a href=\"/opinion/725011/20-employee-benefits-cas-1697-pens-plan-guide-p-23924m-glaziers-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1171</span></a></span>, 1175-77 (3d Cir.1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The lower court apparently cobbled the co-fiduciary claim together from a liberal reading of the complaint.  The complaint does allege that the Bank is a fiduciary (an allegation that is irrefutable with regard to the STIF), that it had some knowledge of Hawthorne's improprieties, and that it failed to make reasonable efforts to remedy the situation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Of course, the Bank argues that it did, indeed, take reasonable steps to investigate Hawthorne's improprieties and put an end to them.  The potential issues relating to whether such steps actually were taken and/or their sufficiency are not before us, and we do not endeavor to decide those issues</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
