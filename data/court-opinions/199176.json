BEREZIN\n                   as general partner in the\n          Riverplace Apartments Limited Partnership,\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n                    REGENCY SAVINGS BANK,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Valeriano Diviacchi, with whom Diviacchi Law Office was on\nbrief for plaintiff.\n     Kevin C.

Herbert Berezin appeals from the\n\njudgment of the district court dismissing his complaint against\n\nRegency Savings Bank (\"Regency\").             Claiming that an error in a\n\npromissory note's recitation of the interest rate resulted in\n\noverpayments, Berezin seeks to recover nearly $1 million in\n\ninterest     payments   he    made    to   Regency.    The    district      court\n\ngranted Regency's motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6), ruling that the \"clear and unambiguous\"\n\nterms of the promissory note precluded consideration of any\n\ncontrary terms in the commitment letter relied upon by Berezin.\n\nBecause      we   conclude     that    Massachusetts        law   permits     the\n\nconsideration of extrinsic evidence when one party to a contract\n\nalleges a mutual mistake in its terms, we vacate the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n             We may affirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim\n\n\"only if it clearly appears, according to the facts alleged,\n\nthat   the    plaintiff      cannot   recover    on   any    viable   theory.\"\n\nCorrea-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     In making this determination, we accept the well-pled\n\nfacts of Berezin's complaint as true and draw every reasonable\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\finference in his favor.         See Langadinos v. American Airlines,\n\nInc., 199 F.3d 68, 69 (1st Cir. 2000).             Accordingly, we recount\n\nthe facts as Berezin has alleged them.\n\n            The   original     parties     to   this   transaction,      Herbert\n\nBerezin, as general partner of Riverplace Apartments Limited\n\nPartnership,      and   Bank    of   New    England     (\"BNE\"),       signed     a\n\ncommitment letter on February 8, 1988 for a $4.5 million loan to\n\nfinance     the   Partnership's       acquisition       and     renovation       of\n\nproperties for low and moderate income housing.                  They executed\n\na note for the loan on March 11.                BNE sold the note to Fleet\n\nBank in 1991, and Fleet sold the note to the defendant in this\n\naction, Regency Savings Bank (\"Regency\"), in February, 1998.\n\nThe commitment letter of February 8 recites that, after three\n\nyears, the rate of interest on the loan would be the interest\n\nrate   of   three-year    United     States     Treasury      notes,    plus    2.5\n\npercent.    Significantly, the commitment letter does not provide\n\nfor a minimum interest rate.              The promissory note, however,\n\nspecifies    that   the   interest       rate   will   not    drop     below    ten\n\npercent.\n\n            On August 1, 1992, the interest rate for three-year\n\nTreasury notes fell below 7.5 percent for the first time since\n\nthe execution of the note, dropping to 7.47 percent.                   Under the\n\nterms of the commitment letter, Berezin would have been entitled\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fto an interest rate of 9.97 percent at that time.                    However,\n\naccording to the terms of the promissory note -- setting the\n\ninterest rate at a minimum of ten percent -- Berezin continued\n\nto pay ten percent interest on the loan.            He alleges that this\n\nprovision in the note is in error, and that he has paid excess\n\ninterest \"of at least $972,636.00\" because of this mistake.\n\n           During the time that it owned the note, Fleet Bank\n\nbrought two errors to Berezin's attention: one involved an\n\nalleged mistake in the maturity date, while the other involved\n\nthe   omission    of   a   demand   provision    that   had   been    in   the\n\ncommitment letter but was not contained in the note.                 In both\n\ninstances, Berezin agreed to a written modification to the note\n\nto    reflect    the   terms   of   the    commitment    letter      and   the\n\nunderstanding of both parties.            Berezin proffers these written\n\nmodifications as evidence that other mistakes existed in the\n\nexecuted note, comparable to the interest rate error.\n\n           In support of its motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n\n12(b)(6), Regency argued that the interest rate provision of the\n\nnote was unambiguous on its face and the parol evidence rule\n\nbarred the consideration of extrinsic evidence, including the\n\nterms of the commitment letter, to establish the rate.                Regency\n\nclaimed, in the alternative, that Berezin's claim was time-\n\nbarred.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             Following        a    hearing,       the       district    court      granted\n\nRegency's     motion     to       dismiss.        Because      the    court   found     for\n\nRegency on the application of the parol evidence rule, it did\n\nnot reach the issue of whether the statute of limitations bars\n\nBerezin's claim.         We conclude that Berezin's claim of mutual\n\nmistake survives a motion to dismiss, and that his claim is not\n\nbarred by the statute of limitations.\n\n                                  II. Mutual Mistake\n\n             We begin with Berezin's allegation in his complaint\n\nthat   the    promissory          note   reflects       a    mutual    mistake     of   the\n\nparties with respect to the interest rate.                      Paragraph six of his\n\ncomplaint states:\n\n             The note contained a significant error and\n             discrepancy from the commitment letter in\n             that it did not clearly make it known that\n             the interest rate on the loan would go below\n             ten percent per annum and in fact that the\n             interest rate was required to be adjusted to\n             below 10% to a rate 2.5 percent per annum\n             above the three year Treasury Note rate with\n             no ten percent minimum rate.\n\n\n(Emphasis added).        Berezin also described the two other mistakes\n\nin the note, brought to his attention by Fleet, and modified by\n\nwritten      agreement      to     reflect        the   terms     specified        in   the\n\ncommitment letter.          Paragraph 11 of his complaint quotes from a\n\nletter    written      to     Berezin        by    Fleet      about     one   of     those\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fdiscrepancies, in which Fleet noted that certain language \"was\n\nunintentionally              omitted      from    the       promissory        note.\"\n\nAdditionally, the complaint avers that Berezin did not become\n\naware of the alleged error in the interest rate until July,\n\n1999.    In his memorandum in opposition to Regency's motion to\n\ndismiss, Berezin reiterated these allegations, claiming that,\n\n\"[u]nintentionally and without agreement of the parties, the\n\nterms of the note differed from the terms of the commitment\n\nletter.\"      Berezin has continued to articulate this theory of\n\nmutual mistake on appeal, claiming in his brief that the note\n\ncontained \"a significant error and discrepancy.\"\n\n              In granting Regency's motion to dismiss the complaint,\n\nthe district court invoked the familiar precept that the parol\n\nevidence      rule      bars   consideration     of     extrinsic      evidence    to\n\ncontradict the terms of an unambiguous, fully-integrated written\n\ninstrument.         See, e.g., ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp., 926 F.2d 1258,\n\n1261 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Under Massachusetts law, parol evidence\n\nmay    not    be   admitted      to     contradict    the    clear    terms   of    an\n\nagreement,         or   to     create     ambiguity     where       none   otherwise\n\nexists.\"); see also Governor Apartments Inc. v. Carney, 173 N.E.\n\n287,    289   (Mass.      1961).        The   district      court    explained     its\n\nreasoning as follows:\n\n              In summary, to countenance plaintiff's\n              complaint the court would have to ignore the\n\n                                           -6-\n\f             parol evidence rule.        The controlling\n             document in this case is the note signed by\n             the    plaintiff    and   the    defendant's\n             predecessor in interest.    Plaintiff simply\n             cannot rely on an inconsistent prior written\n             communication -- here, the commitment letter\n             -- to alter the terms of the note.     Since\n             the terms of the note are clear and\n             unambiguous,   they   control   and  require\n             dismissal of plaintiff's lawsuit.\n\n\n             In part, perhaps, because Berezin's complaint does not\n\nidentify by name his theory of \"mutual mistake,\" the district\n\ncourt's ruling overlooks the possibility that the promissory\n\nnote could be reformed if Berezin provided sufficient evidence\n\nthat the parties had made a mistake in the note's description of\n\nthe interest rate.      Nonetheless, we must accept all of the facts\n\nin the complaint as true, and indulge all reasonable inferences\n\nin Berezin's favor.      See Langadinos, 199 F.3d at 69.     Viewed in\n\nlight of these liberal requirements, we find that Berezin has\n\narticulated an adequate basis for review of his claim based on\n\na theory of mutual mistake.      See Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co.\n\nv. Universal Ins. Co., 838 F.2d 612, 622 (1st Cir. 1988) (noting\n\nthat \"a pleading must contain a short and plain statement of the\n\nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" but that\n\n\"[i]t is not necessary to set out the legal theory on which the\n\nclaim   is    based\")    (quotations    omitted);   see   also   Schott\n\nMotorcycle Supply, Inc. v. American Honda Motor Co., 976 F.2d\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f58, 62 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating, \"Rule 8 [of the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure] does not require a party to specify its\n\nlegal theory of recovery\" so long as the complaint implicates\n\nthe relevant legal issues).             Significantly, Regency has never\n\nargued that Berezin's complaint does not adequately identify a\n\ntheory of mutual mistake.\n\n              Massachusetts       law   permits     reformation        of    written\n\ncontracts where one party has alleged a mutual mistake in the\n\nterms    of    the   agreement.         \"If   the   language     of     a    written\n\ninstrument does not reflect the true intent of both parties, the\n\nmutual mistake is reformable.\"                Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers\n\nIndemnity Co., 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (Mass. 1993).                            See also\n\nMickelson v. Barnet, 460 N.E.2d 566, 569 (Mass. 1984) (finding\n\n\"a mutual mistake is reformable\" where \"the language adopted by\n\nthe parties did not reflect their true intent\").                       Under these\n\ncircumstances,            the   parol    evidence        rule   does        not   bar\n\nconsideration        of    extrinsic    evidence    of    the   parties'      actual\n\nintent.1      See Polaroid Corp., 610 N.E.2d at 917; Mickelson, 460\n\n\n     1The district court was concerned that Berezin was asking\nfor a ruling that the commitment letter itself, and not the\npromissory note, was the binding legal document between the\nparties.   The court stated at the hearing on the motion to\ndismiss: \"I don't understand how you can go back to the\ncommitment letter and attempt to enforce the commitment letter\nas an independent contract.\" In fact, however, the commitment\nletter would simply be part of the extrinsic evidence proffered\nby Berezin to substantiate his allegation of mutual mistake.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fN.E. at 570.     This doctrine of reformation is driven by respect\n\nfor the parties' intent and \"gives effect to the terms mutually\n\nagreed upon by the parties.\"        Southeastern Ins. Agency, Inc. v.\n\nLumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., 650 N.E.2d 1285, 1288 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1995).     See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 155 cmt.\n\na (1981) (noting that reformation on grounds of mutual mistake\n\n\"make[s]    a   writing   express   the   agreement   that   the   parties\n\nintended it should.\").\n\n            Nonetheless, mindful of the parol evidence rule, which\n\n\"bars the introduction of prior or contemporaneous written or\n\noral agreements that contradict, vary, or broaden an integrated\n\nwriting,\" Kobayashi v. Orion Ventures, Inc., 678 N.E.2d 180, 184\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1997), the Massachusetts courts have required a\n\nparty to present clear and convincing evidence before reforming\n\na contract on the grounds of mutual mistake.          See Polaroid, 610\n\nN.E.2d at 917 (requiring \"full, clear, and decisive proof of\n\nmistake\"); Covich v. Chambers, 397 N.E.2d 1115, 1120 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1979) (upholding \"the stricter test of clear and convincing\n\nproof\"); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 153 cmt.\n\na (noting, \"because mistakes are the exception rather than the\n\nrule, the trier of the facts should examine the evidence with\n\nparticular care\" when a party attempts to prove mistake).             This\n\nstandard of proof strikes an appropriate balance between the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fparol    evidence    rule   and    the      importance       of    ensuring   that    a\n\nwritten agreement reflects the true intent of the parties.\n\n            In summary, given the allegations in the complaint, and\n\nthe applicable Massachusetts law, we cannot conclude that \"it\n\nclearly    appears,     according       to    the    facts    alleged,      that   the\n\nplaintiff      cannot   recover        on    any    viable    theory.\"        Correa-\n\nMartinez, 903 F.2d at 52.2\n\n                     III. The Statute of Limitations\n\n               The district court declined to rule on Regency's\n\nstatute of limitations argument because it found the parol\n\nevidence rule dispositive in dismissing Berezin's complaint.\n\nHaving determined that Berezin's complaint is not barred by the\n\nparol evidence rule, we must decide whether Berezin's claim is\n\nbarred    by   the   statute      of    limitations.              We   conclude    that\n\nBerezin's suit is not time-barred.\n\n            The statute of limitations in an action for breach of\n\ncontract in Massachusetts is six years.                  See Mass. Gen. Laws,\n\n\n\n    2 Because Regency did not make the argument in its motion to\ndismiss or on appeal, we do not consider the effect on\nplaintiff's mutual mistake claim of any special status that\nRegency may have as the second purchaser of the note.       See,\ne.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 155 cmt. f (\"The\nclaim of a mistaken party to reformation, being equitable in its\norigin, is subject to the rights of good faith purchasers for\nvalue and other third parties who have similarly relied on the\nfinality of a consensual transaction in which they have acquired\nan interest in property.\").\n\n                                        -10-\n\fch. 260 § 2; see also City of New Bedford v. Lloyd Investment\n\nAssoc., Inc., 292 N.E.2d 688, 688 (Mass. 1973).                     \"When the\n\nstatute of limitations for a breach of contract begins to run\n\ndepends   on     whether   the    contract    is   entire   or     divisible.\"\n\nFlannery v. Flannery, 705 N.E.2d 1140, 1143 (Mass. 1999).                  If an\n\nobligation       is   payable    in     installments,      the    statute     of\n\nlimitations       begins   to    run   against     the   recovery     of    each\n\ninstallment from the time it becomes due.                See id.; Clark v.\n\nTrumble, 692 N.E.2d 74, 79-80 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998).                 This rule\n\napplies even where one contract provides all the terms of the\n\nagreement between the parties, so long as the contract requires\n\nthat the payments be made in installments.               See Flannery, 705\n\nN.E.2d at 1143.        A contract need not specifically reference\n\ninstallments to be deemed an installment contract.                  See, e.g.,\n\nAllan R. Hackel Org., Inc. v. American Radio Sys. Corp., No.\n\n980335, 2000 WL 281689, at * 2 (Mass. Super. Ct. Jan. 12, 2000)\n\n(\"The parties' actual performance, which has been over time, is\n\na reliable indication that this [is] an installment contract.\").\n\n           The promissory note provides that the interest and\n\nprincipal shall be payable on a monthly basis.                   Massachusetts\n\ncourts    have     characterized       such   agreements    as     installment\n\ncontracts.       See, e.g., Clark, 692 N.E.2d at 79 (finding, \"[t]he\n\nnote here is an installment note for a one-year period\" where\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\finterest was due in monthly payments and the principal balance\n\nwas due in full one year after execution of the note); Chambers\n\nv. Lemuel Shattuck Hosp., 669 N.E.2d 1079, 1081 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1996) (treating injured employee's weekly cash benefits as an\n\ninstallment contract and considering \"each alleged violation of\n\nthe continuing weekly payment obligation a new claim for statute\n\nof limitations purposes.\").       Pursuant to these precedents, we\n\nconclude that the promissory note is an installment contract.\n\nAccordingly, the statute of limitations for the recovery of each\n\ninstallment under the note runs from the time it becomes due.\n\nSee Flannery, 705 N.E.2d at 1143.          Because Berezin filed his\n\ncomplaint on September 14, 1999, his claim is timely for those\n\ninterest   payments   he   made   within   the   six-year   statute   of\n\nlimitations period.3\n\n\n    3  As an alternative to his theory that the promissory note\nis an installment contract, and as a basis for even avoiding the\nsix-year statute of limitations period, Berezin argues that his\nclaim is timely pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 36.

Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990). In making this determination, we accept the well-pled facts of Berezin's complaint as true and draw every reasonable inference in his favor. See Langadinos v. American Airlines, Inc., 199 F.3d 68, 69 (1st Cir. 2000). Accordingly, we recount the facts as Berezin has alleged them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original parties to this transaction, Herbert Berezin, as general partner of Riverplace Apartments Limited Partnership, and Bank of New England (\"BNE\"), signed a commitment letter on February 8, 1988 for a $4.5 million loan to finance the Partnership's acquisition and renovation of properties for low and moderate income housing. They executed a note for the loan on March 11. BNE sold the note to Fleet Bank in 1991, and Fleet sold the note to the defendant in this action, Regency Savings Bank (\"Regency\"), in February, 1998. The commitment letter of February 8 recites that, after three years, the rate of interest on the loan would be the interest rate of three-year United States Treasury notes, plus 2.5 percent. Significantly, the commitment letter does not provide for a minimum interest rate. The promissory note, however, specifies that the interest rate will not drop below ten percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 1992, the interest rate for three-year Treasury notes fell below 7.5 percent for the first time since the execution of the note, dropping to 7.47 percent. Under the terms of the commitment letter, Berezin would have been entitled to an interest rate of 9.97 percent at that time. However, according to the terms of the promissory note -- setting the interest rate at a minimum of ten percent -- Berezin continued to pay ten percent interest on the loan. He alleges that this provision in the note is in error, and that he has paid excess interest \"of at least $972,636.00\" because of this mistake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the time that it owned the note, Fleet Bank brought two errors to Berezin's attention: one involved an alleged mistake in the maturity date, while the other involved the omission of a demand provision that had been in the commitment letter but was not contained in the note. In both instances, Berezin agreed to a written modification to the note to reflect the terms of the commitment letter and the understanding of both parties. Berezin proffers these written modifications as evidence that other mistakes existed in the executed note, comparable to the interest rate error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Regency argued that the interest rate provision of the note was unambiguous on its face and the parol evidence rule barred the consideration of extrinsic evidence, including the terms of the commitment letter, to establish the rate. Regency claimed, in the alternative, that Berezin's claim was time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the district court granted Regency's motion to dismiss. Because the court found for Regency on the application of the parol evidence rule, it did not reach the issue of whether the statute of limitations bars Berezin's claim. We conclude that Berezin's claim of mutual mistake survives a motion to dismiss, and that his claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Mutual Mistake</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Berezin's allegation in his complaint that the promissory note reflects a mutual mistake of the parties with respect to the interest rate. Paragraph six of his complaint states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The note contained a significant error and discrepancy from the commitment letter in that it did not clearly make it known that the interest rate on the loan would go below ten percent per annum and in fact that the interest rate was required to be adjusted to below 10% to a rate 2.5 percent per annum above the three year Treasury Note rate with no ten percent minimum rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). Berezin also described the two other mistakes in the note, brought to his attention by Fleet, and modified by written agreement to reflect the terms specified in the commitment letter. Paragraph 11 of his complaint quotes from a letter written to Berezin by Fleet about one of those discrepancies, in which Fleet noted that certain language \"was unintentionally omitted from the promissory note.\" Additionally, the complaint avers that Berezin did not become aware of the alleged error in the interest rate until July, 1999. In his memorandum in opposition to Regency's motion to dismiss, Berezin reiterated these allegations, claiming that, \"[u]nintentionally and without agreement of the parties, the terms of the note differed from the terms of the commitment letter.\" Berezin has continued to articulate this theory of mutual mistake on appeal, claiming in his brief that the note contained \"a significant error and discrepancy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting Regency's motion to dismiss the complaint, the district court invoked the familiar precept that the parol evidence rule bars consideration of extrinsic evidence to contradict the terms of an unambiguous, fully-integrated written instrument. See, e.g., ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp., 926 F.2d 1258, 1261 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Under Massachusetts law, parol evidence may not be admitted to contradict the clear terms of an agreement, or to create ambiguity where none otherwise exists.\"); see also Governor Apartments Inc. v. Carney, 173 N.E. 287, 289 (Mass. 1961). The district court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, to countenance plaintiff's complaint the court would have to ignore the parol evidence rule. The controlling document in this case is the note signed by the plaintiff and the defendant's predecessor in interest. Plaintiff simply cannot rely on an inconsistent prior written communication -- here, the commitment letter -- to alter the terms of the note. Since the terms of the note are clear and unambiguous, they control and require dismissal of plaintiff's lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In part, perhaps, because Berezin's complaint does not identify by name his theory of \"mutual mistake,\" the district court's ruling overlooks the possibility that the promissory note could be reformed if Berezin provided sufficient evidence that the parties had made a mistake in the note's description of the interest rate. Nonetheless, we must accept all of the facts in the complaint as true, and indulge all reasonable inferences in Berezin's favor. See Langadinos, 199 F.3d at 69. Viewed in light of these liberal requirements, we find that Berezin has articulated an adequate basis for review of his claim based on a theory of mutual mistake. See Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Universal Ins. Co., 838 F.2d 612, 622 (1st Cir. 1988) (noting that \"a pleading must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" but that \"[i]t is not necessary to set out the legal theory on which the claim is based\") (quotations omitted); see also Schott Motorcycle Supply, Inc. v. American Honda Motor Co., 976 F.2d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating, \"Rule 8 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] does not require a party to specify its legal theory of recovery\" so long as the complaint implicates the relevant legal issues). Significantly, Regency has never argued that Berezin's complaint does not adequately identify a theory of mutual mistake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law permits reformation of written contracts where one party has alleged a mutual mistake in the terms of the agreement. \"If the language of a written instrument does not reflect the true intent of both parties, the mutual mistake is reformable.\" Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (Mass. 1993). See also Mickelson v. Barnet, 460 N.E.2d 566, 569 (Mass. 1984) (finding \"a mutual mistake is reformable\" where \"the language adopted by the parties did not reflect their true intent\"). Under these circumstances, the parol evidence rule does not bar consideration of extrinsic evidence of the parties' actual intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See Polaroid Corp., 610 N.E.2d at 917; Mickelson, 460 N.E. at 570. This doctrine of reformation is driven by respect for the parties' intent and \"gives effect to the terms mutually agreed upon by the parties.\" Southeastern Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., 650 N.E.2d 1285, 1288 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995). See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts,  155 cmt. a (1981) (noting that reformation on grounds of mutual mistake \"make[s] a writing express the agreement that the parties intended it should.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, mindful of the parol evidence rule, which \"bars the introduction of prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements that contradict, vary, or broaden an integrated writing,\" Kobayashi v. Orion Ventures, Inc., 678 N.E.2d 180, 184 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997), the Massachusetts courts have required a party to present clear and convincing evidence before reforming a contract on the grounds of mutual mistake. See Polaroid, 610 N.E.2d at 917 (requiring \"full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake\"); Covich v. Chambers, 397 N.E.2d 1115, 1120 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979) (upholding \"the stricter test of clear and convincing proof\"); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts,  153 cmt. a (noting, \"because mistakes are the exception rather than the rule, the trier of the facts should examine the evidence with particular care\" when a party attempts to prove mistake). This standard of proof strikes an appropriate balance between the parol evidence rule and the importance of ensuring that a written agreement reflects the true intent of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, given the allegations in the complaint, and the applicable Massachusetts law, we cannot conclude that \"it clearly appears, according to the facts alleged, that the plaintiff cannot recover on any viable theory.\" Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 52.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. The Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to rule on Regency's statute of limitations argument because it found the parol evidence rule dispositive in dismissing Berezin's complaint. Having determined that Berezin's complaint is not barred by the parol evidence rule, we must decide whether Berezin's claim is barred by the statute of limitations. We conclude that Berezin's suit is not time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of limitations in an action for breach of contract in Massachusetts is six years. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 260  2; see also City of New Bedford v. Lloyd Investment Assoc., Inc., 292 N.E.2d 688, 688 (Mass. 1973). \"When the statute of limitations for a breach of contract begins to run depends on whether the contract is entire or divisible.\" Flannery v. Flannery, 705 N.E.2d 1140, 1143 (Mass. 1999). If an obligation is payable in installments, the statute of limitations begins to run against the recovery of each installment from the time it becomes due. See id.; Clark v. Trumble, 692 N.E.2d 74, 79-80 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998). This rule applies even where one contract provides all the terms of the agreement between the parties, so long as the contract requires that the payments be made in installments. See Flannery, 705 N.E.2d at 1143. A contract need not specifically reference installments to be deemed an installment contract. See, e.g., Allan R. Hackel Org., Inc. v. American Radio Sys. Corp., No. 980335, 2000 WL 281689, at * 2 (Mass. Super. Ct. Jan. 12, 2000) (\"The parties' actual performance, which has been over time, is a reliable indication that this [is] an installment contract.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The promissory note provides that the interest and principal shall be payable on a monthly basis. Massachusetts courts have characterized such agreements as installment contracts. See, e.g., Clark, 692 N.E.2d at 79 (finding, \"[t]he note here is an installment note for a one-year period\" where interest was due in monthly payments and the principal balance was due in full one year after execution of the note); Chambers v. Lemuel Shattuck Hosp., 669 N.E.2d 1079, 1081 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996) (treating injured employee's weekly cash benefits as an installment contract and considering \"each alleged violation of the continuing weekly payment obligation a new claim for statute of limitations purposes.\"). Pursuant to these precedents, we conclude that the promissory note is an installment contract. Accordingly, the statute of limitations for the recovery of each installment under the note runs from the time it becomes due. See Flannery, 705 N.E.2d at 1143. Because Berezin filed his complaint on September 14, 1999, his claim is timely for those interest payments he made within the six-year statute of limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment vacated.

The court stated at the hearing on the motion to dismiss: \"I don't understand how you can go back to the commitment letter and attempt to enforce the commitment letter as an independent contract.\" In fact, however, the commitment letter would simply be part of the extrinsic evidence proffered by Berezin to substantiate his allegation of mutual mistake.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because Regency did not make the argument in its motion to dismiss or on appeal, we do not consider the effect on plaintiff's mutual mistake claim of any special status that Regency may have as the second purchaser of the note. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts,  155 cmt. f (\"The claim of a mistaken party to reformation, being equitable in its origin, is subject to the rights of good faith purchasers for value and other third parties who have similarly relied on the finality of a consensual transaction in which they have acquired an interest in property.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As an alternative to his theory that the promissory note is an installment contract, and as a basis for even avoiding the six-year statute of limitations period, Berezin argues that his claim is timely pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260,  36. That provision allows a defendant to file a compulsory counterclaim for recoupment without regard to the statute of limitations. However,  36 is plainly not applicable to the instant situation because Berezin is not filing a compulsory counterclaim in response to an action initiated by Regency. Berezin has provided no authority for the proposition that  36 is a proper basis for disregarding or extending the statute of limitations in these circumstances, where Berezin is the plaintiff and there was no initial claim filed by Regency. Indeed, as we have noted, recoupment, which is the essence of a counterclaim pursuant to  36, is \"in the nature of a defense.\" United Structures of America, Inc. v. G.R.G. Eng'g, S.E., 9 F.3d 996, 999 (1st Cir. 1993). Therefore,  36 is not properly asserted by a plaintiff as authority for avoiding the statute of limitations.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

They executed a note for the loan on March 11. BNE sold the note to Fleet Bank in 1991, and Fleet sold the note to the defendant in this action, Regency Savings Bank (\"Regency\"), in February, 1998. The commitment letter of February 8 recites that, after three years, the rate of interest on the loan would be the interest rate of three-year United States Treasury notes, plus 2.5 percent. Significantly, the commitment letter does not provide for a minimum interest rate. The promissory note, however, specifies that the interest rate will not drop below ten percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 1992, the interest rate for three-year Treasury notes fell below 7.5 percent for the first time since the execution of the note, dropping to 7.47 percent. Under the terms of the commitment letter, Berezin would have been entitled to an interest rate of 9.97 percent at that time. However, according to the terms of the promissory note -- setting the interest rate at a minimum of ten percent -- Berezin continued to pay ten percent interest on the loan. He alleges that this provision in the note is in error, and that he has paid excess interest \"of at least $972,636.00\" because of this mistake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the time that it owned the note, Fleet Bank brought two errors to Berezin's attention: one involved an alleged mistake in the maturity date, while the other involved the omission of a demand provision that had been in the commitment letter but was not contained in the note. In both instances, Berezin agreed to a written modification to the note to reflect the terms of the commitment letter and the understanding of both parties. Berezin proffers these written modifications as evidence that other mistakes existed in the executed note, comparable to the interest rate error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Regency argued that the interest rate provision of the note was unambiguous on its face and the parol evidence rule barred the consideration of extrinsic evidence, including the terms of the commitment letter, to establish the rate.

Paragraph six of his complaint states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The note contained a significant error and discrepancy from the commitment letter in that it did not clearly make it known that the interest rate on the loan would go below ten percent per annum and in fact that the interest rate was required to be adjusted to below 10% to a rate 2.5 percent per annum above the three year Treasury Note rate with no ten percent minimum rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). Berezin also described the two other mistakes in the note, brought to his attention by Fleet, and modified by written agreement to reflect the terms specified in the commitment letter. Paragraph 11 of his complaint quotes from a letter written to Berezin by Fleet about one of those discrepancies, in which Fleet noted that certain language \"was unintentionally omitted from the promissory note.\" Additionally, the complaint avers that Berezin did not become aware of the alleged error in the interest rate until July, 1999. In his memorandum in opposition to Regency's motion to dismiss, Berezin reiterated these allegations, claiming that, \"[u]nintentionally and without agreement of the parties, the terms of the note differed from the terms of the commitment letter.\" Berezin has continued to articulate this theory of mutual mistake on appeal, claiming in his brief that the note contained \"a significant error and discrepancy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting Regency's motion to dismiss the complaint, the district court invoked the familiar precept that the parol evidence rule bars consideration of extrinsic evidence to contradict the terms of an unambiguous, fully-integrated written instrument. See, e.g., ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556606\"><a href=\"/opinion/556606/itt-corporation-v-ltx-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span>, 1261 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Under Massachusetts law, parol evidence may not be admitted to contradict the clear terms of an agreement, or to create ambiguity where none otherwise exists.\"); see also Governor Apartments Inc. v. Carney, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></span>, 289 (Mass. 1961). The district court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, to countenance plaintiff's complaint the court would have to ignore the parol evidence rule. The controlling document in this case is the note signed by the plaintiff and the defendant's predecessor in interest. Plaintiff simply cannot rely on an inconsistent prior written communication -- here, the commitment letter -- to alter the terms of the note. Since the terms of the note are clear and unambiguous, they control and require dismissal of plaintiff's lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In part, perhaps, because Berezin's complaint does not identify by name his theory of \"mutual mistake,\" the district court's ruling overlooks the possibility that the promissory note could be reformed if Berezin provided sufficient evidence that the parties had made a mistake in the note's description of the interest rate. Nonetheless, we must accept all of the facts in the complaint as true, and indulge all reasonable inferences in Berezin's favor. See Langadinos, 199 F.3d at 69. Viewed in light of these liberal requirements, we find that Berezin has articulated an adequate basis for review of his claim based on a theory of mutual mistake. See Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Universal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501184\"><a href=\"/opinion/501184/connecticut-general-life-insurance-company-v-universal-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 622 (1st Cir. 1988) (noting that \"a pleading must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" but that \"[i]t is not necessary to set out the legal theory on which the claim is based\") (quotations omitted); see also Schott Motorcycle Supply, Inc. v. American Honda Motor Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591388\"><a href=\"/opinion/591388/schott-motorcycle-supply-inc-v-american-honda-motor-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating, \"Rule 8 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] does not require a party to specify its legal theory of recovery\" so long as the complaint implicates the relevant legal issues). Significantly, Regency has never argued that Berezin's complaint does not adequately identify a theory of mutual mistake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law permits reformation of written contracts where one party has alleged a mutual mistake in the terms of the agreement. \"If the language of a written instrument does not reflect the true intent of both parties, the mutual mistake is reformable.\" Polaroid Corp. v.

The Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to rule on Regency's statute of limitations argument because it found the parol evidence rule dispositive in dismissing Berezin's complaint. Having determined that Berezin's complaint is not barred by the parol evidence rule, we must decide whether Berezin's claim is barred by the statute of limitations. We conclude that Berezin's suit is not time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of limitations in an action for breach of contract in Massachusetts is six years. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 260  2; see also City of New Bedford v. Lloyd Investment Assoc., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></span>, 688 (Mass. 1973). \"When the statute of limitations for a breach of contract begins to run depends on whether the contract is entire or divisible.\" Flannery v.

If an obligation is payable in installments, the statute of limitations begins to run against the recovery of each installment from the time it becomes due. See id.; Clark v. Trumble, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span>, 79-80 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998). This rule applies even where one contract provides all the terms of the agreement between the parties, so long as the contract requires that the payments be made in installments. See Flannery, 705 N.E.2d at 1143. A contract need not specifically reference installments to be deemed an installment contract. See, e.g., Allan R. Hackel Org., Inc. v. American Radio Sys. Corp., No. 980335, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">281689</span></span>, at * 2 (Mass. Super. Ct. Jan. 12, 2000) (\"The parties' actual performance, which has been over time, is a reliable indication that this [is] an installment contract.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The promissory note provides that the interest and principal shall be payable on a monthly basis. Massachusetts courts have characterized such agreements as installment contracts. See, e.g., Clark, 692 N.E.2d at 79 (finding, \"[t]he note here is an installment note for a one-year period\" where interest was due in monthly payments and the principal balance was due in full one year after execution of the note); Chambers v. Lemuel Shattuck Hosp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></span>, 1081 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996) (treating injured employee's weekly cash benefits as an installment contract and considering \"each alleged violation of the continuing weekly payment obligation a new claim for statute of limitations purposes.\"). Pursuant to these precedents, we conclude that the promissory note is an installment contract. Accordingly, the statute of limitations for the recovery of each installment under the note runs from the time it becomes due. See Flannery, 705 N.E.2d at 1143. Because Berezin filed his complaint on September 14, 1999, his claim is timely for those interest payments he made within the six-year statute of limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment vacated. Remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court was concerned that Berezin was asking for a ruling that the commitment letter itself, and not the promissory note, was the binding legal document between the parties. The court stated at the hearing on the motion to dismiss: \"I don't understand how you can go back to the commitment letter and attempt to enforce the commitment letter as an independent contract.\" In fact, however, the commitment letter would simply be part of the extrinsic evidence proffered by Berezin to substantiate his allegation of mutual mistake.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because Regency did not make the argument in its motion to dismiss or on appeal, we do not consider the effect on plaintiff's mutual mistake claim of any special status that Regency may have as the second purchaser of the note. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts,  155 cmt. f (\"The claim of a mistaken party to reformation, being equitable in its origin, is subject to the rights of good faith purchasers for value and other third parties who have similarly relied on the finality of a consensual transaction in which they have acquired an interest in property.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As an alternative to his theory that the promissory note is an installment contract, and as a basis for even avoiding the six-year statute of limitations period, Berezin argues that his claim is timely pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260,  36. That provision allows a defendant to file a compulsory counterclaim for recoupment without regard to the statute of limitations. However,  36 is plainly not applicable to the instant situation because Berezin is not filing a compulsory counterclaim in response to an action initiated by Regency. Berezin has provided no authority for the proposition that  36 is a proper basis for disregarding or extending the statute of limitations in these circumstances, where Berezin is the plaintiff and there was no initial claim filed by Regency. Indeed, as we have noted, recoupment, which is the essence of a counterclaim pursuant to  36, is \"in the nature of a defense.\" United Structures of America, Inc. v. G.R.G. Eng'g, S.E., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"657317\"><a href=\"/opinion/657317/united-structures-of-america-inc-and-united-states-of-america-for-the-use/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir. 1993). Therefore,  36 is not properly asserted by a plaintiff as authority for avoiding the statute of limitations.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
