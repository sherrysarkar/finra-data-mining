This appeal is brought by Mrs. B., the\n\nmother of a troubled boy, DC, whom she placed in a private residential\n\nschool in 1998 after rejecting the public school's proposed\n\nIndividualized Education Plan. That IEP instead proposed mainstreaming\n\nthe child into the local school for the 1998-99 school year. A hearing\n\nofficer found the proposed IEP from the Rome School Committee for that\n\nyear as well as the IEP proposed for the 1999-2000 school year to be\n\ninadequate under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1400-1491, and ordered Rome to reimburse Mrs. B. for the\n\nprivate school placement for those two years.\n\n          In the school system's suit challenging the hearing officer's\n\ndetermination, the district court concluded, as had the reviewing\n\nmagistrate judge, that the hearing officer was wrong on the substance\n\n-- that the IEPs were adequate. Nonetheless, the district court,\n\nfollowing precedent that a parent may rely on the hearing officer's\n\ndetermination, held that Mrs. B. did not have to reimburse Rome for\n\npayments it had made for the tuition and related expenses in those two\n\nyears. See Town of Burlington v. Dep't of Educ., 736 F.2d 773, 800-01\n\n(1st Cir. 1984) (\"Burlington II\"), aff'd, 471 U.S. 359 (1985). This\n\nholding was independent of the holding on the adequacy of the IEPs.\n\n          Mrs. B. has appealed. The school system has not. And DC,\n\napparently, continues at the private school, although we have nothing\n\nin the record on that point or on any later IEPs the school system may\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fhave proposed. The purpose of Mrs. B.'s appeal, in large part, is to\n\nbe certain Rome cannot obtain reimbursement from her for the two school\n\nyears, 1998-2000. But there is no issue as to that, because Rome does\n\nnot appeal. Reimbursement is a different question than the merits of\n\nthe IEPs. Indeed, the IEPs proposed for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000\n\nschool years could have been adequate, but Mrs. B. still would not have\n\nto reimburse Rome the tuition money it paid for those years.       See\n\nBurlington II, 736 F.3d at 800-01 (school is estopped from seeking\n\nreimbursement from parent for school year covered by agency's decision\n\nordering reimbursement).1    Because there is no controversy as to\n\nreimbursement, the adequacy of past IEPs is not before us. There is a\n\nquestion, then, as to what remains before us.\n\n          We do not view the question of the IEP or the payment for the\n\ncurrent school year (2000-2001) as properly before us, as all of the\n\nrecord evidence concerns a dispute about the prior two years.\n\nNonetheless, both parties assume that this court's view of the adequacy\n\nof the IEPs for the two years, 1998-99 and 1999-2000, will have a\n\nmaterial bearing on any questions as to obligations of the school\n\nsystem for the year 2000-2001, which soon concludes, and possibly\n\n\n     1     Put another way, neither the district court nor the hearing\nofficer concluded that the reason Rome should bear the costs for the\ntwo years of residential placement was that this placement was the\nrequired \"free appropriate public education\" for DC. The reimbursement\norder was based on different grounds and has not been appealed. Even if\nthe reimbursement order had been appealed, the issue identified above\nwould not have necessarily been resolved.\n\n                                 -4-\n\ffuture years.\n\n          Issues arising from past IEPs often circumvent the mootness\n\ndoctrine because fundamental disputes over the correct interpretation\n\nof the IDEA as to a particular student are \"capable of repetition as to\n\nthe parties before it yet evading review.\" Board of Educ. v. Rowley,\n\n458 U.S. 176, 186 n.9 (1982); see also Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of\n\nEduc., 874 F.2d 1036, 1041 (5th Cir. 1989) (\"Given the parties\n\nirreconcilable views on the issue, whether to and to what extent to\n\nmainstream [the child] will be an issue every time [the school\n\ndistrict] prepares a new placement or IEP or proposes to change an\n\nexisting one.\") (citing Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318-20 (1988));\n\nSacramento City Unified Sch. Dist., Bd. of Educ. v. Rachel H., 14 F.3d\n\n1398, 1403 (9th Cir. 1994). Such controversies are likely to evade\n\nreview because the \"administrative and judicial review of an IEP is\n\n'ponderous' and usually will not be complete until a year after the IEP\n\nhas expired.\" Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1041 (citing Burlington, 471\n\nU.S. at 370).2\n\n          A common feature of these cases involving IDEA disputes\n\ncapable of repetition yet evading review is the possibility that the\n\n\n     2    The question of the procedural irregularities found by the\nhearing officer and discounted by the district court will not recur.\nNonetheless, we comment that the hearing officer appears to have\nimproperly read Maine procedural law.\n     We have considered Mrs. B.'s argument that the district court\nunlawfully referred her case for a recommended decision by the\nmagistrate judge, but we found it to be utterly without merit.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fschool district would continue to adhere to a policy that violates the\n\nIDEA.   In Daniel R.R., for example, the court resolved differing\n\ninterpretations of the IDEA's requirement that learning disabled\n\nstudents should be educated in the general curriculum -- the\n\n\"mainstreaming requirement.\" 874 F.2d at 1040-41. In Honig, the\n\nSupreme Court ruled that an action concerning whether a school had\n\nauthority under the Act to unilaterally change a student's placement\n\nwas not moot because there was \"a sufficient likelihood\" that the\n\ncontroversy would recur.     484 U.S. at 322-23.\n\n          The core of the controversy between Mrs. B. and Rome over the\n\nadequacy of the IEP involves the extent of DC's needs for behavior\n\nmanagement services, a dispute which includes both questions of fact\n\nand interpretations of the IDEA. The contours of any factual dispute\n\nchange shape as the years go on. Indeed, the IDEA recognizes that\n\nchildren's needs change over time, and it thus requires annual\n\nevaluation and development of an IEP for each school year. But the\n\nparties' irreconcilable views on the extent to which the IDEA requires\n\na school to provide services to address a learning disabled child's\n\nbehavior problems is a controversy that is likely to recur as Rome\n\nproposes new IEPs. Thus, we pause briefly to clarify a few points, not\n\nas a ruling on the merits of past IEPs nor as a suggestion of a proper\n\nplacement for future school years, but to indicate the factors to be\n\nincluded in a proper analysis under the IDEA.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          States accepting federal funding must assure all learning\n\ndisabled children the right to a \"free appropriate public education,\"\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A), by providing \"access to specialized\n\ninstruction and related services . . . individually designed to provide\n\neducational benefit to the handicapped child,\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 201.\n\nUnder the requirement of access to \"related services,\" a school\n\ndistrict's special education program must include psychological\n\nservices if a learning disabled child's emotional disturbances\n\ninterfere with his ability to learn. See Roland M. v. Concord Sch.\n\nComm., 910 F.2d 983, 991-92 (1st Cir. 1990); 20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)\n\n(defining the term \"child with a disability\"); 20 U.S.C. § 1401(22)\n\n(listing \"psychological services, . . . social work services, [and]\n\ncounseling services\" as \"related services\"). The IDEA recognizes that\n\na \"serious emotional disturbance\" constitutes a disability if \"by\n\nreason thereof, [the child] needs special education and related\n\nservices.\"   Id. § 1401(3)(A).\n\n          The hearing officer and the magistrate judge recognized that\n\nbehavior management services fall within the scope of services a school\n\ndistrict may be required to provide under the IDEA. But they differed\n\non the question whether DC's behavior interfered with his ability to\n\nobtain educational benefit, and therefore the proper level of services\n\nthat should be addressed to DC's behavior needs. The magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that DC's behavior problems manifest themselves most\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffrequently outside of school, and thus found adequate the level of\n\nbehavior management services in Rome's special education program.\n\n          There are some facts in the record, important to the hearing\n\nofficer, not accounted for in the magistrate judge's legal conclusions.\n\nThe district court must consider the state agency's findings carefully\n\nand \"endeavor to respond to the hearing officer's resolution of each\n\nmaterial issue.\" Burlington II, 736 F.2d at 792. For example, there\n\nis ample evidence that DC's behavior problems did spill over into\n\nschool, interfering with his ability to obtain educational benefit.\n\nIndeed, DC's third-grade teacher in April 1997 was so concerned about\n\nDC's behavior management that he requested DC be given a one-to-one\n\naide for those purposes. The hearing officer cited several instances\n\nof aggressive behavior by DC while in school, including hitting other\n\nstudents, destroying property (including destroying playground\n\nequipment with the consequent risk of injury to others), and, most\n\nalarming, twice bringing a nine-inch buck knife to school.        That\n\nevidence factored heavily in the hearing officer's decisions and was\n\nrelevant to the determination of whether the services offered in Rome's\n\nproposed IEPs were adequate. If the failure of the magistrate judge to\n\naddress in the legal analysis these aspects of DC's behavior issues\n\nreflected a view that this evidence was not relevant, 3 then that view\n\n     3    Language in the magistrate judge's opinion suggests the view\nthat unless the child \"was uncontrollable both in and out of school,\"\nthus \"rendering him uneducable,\" the behavior does not need to be\n\n                                 -8-\n\fwas in error.\n\n          Unless DC has made progress on managing his behavior from the\n\nprior years, it is likely that any IEP must define the related services\n\nDC requires in order to receive a free appropriate public education.4\n\nThere is a built-in flexibility in the statute's lack of precision, and\n\nthese types of determinations are better made by those involved in\n\ndesigning a program tailored to meet a child's unique needs: the\n\nmembers of the pupil evaluation team and Mrs. B.\n\n          Still, this does not mean the residential placement Mrs. B.\n\nhas settled on is required or that any residential placement is\n\nrequired. Both the hearing officer and the district court concluded\n\nthat the placement at this residential school was not required. Even\n\nif DC has since made academic progress at his residential school, that\n\nfact does not establish that such a placement comprises \"the requisite\n\nadequate and appropriate education.\"      Roland M., 910 F.2d at 990\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). All the school system must provide\n\n\n\naddressed in the IEP. We know of no such rule. The question is\nwhether these behavioral disturbances interfered with the child's\nability to learn. See Roland M., 910 F.2d at 991-92.\n     4       Before the state hearing on the 1999-2000 IEP, an\nalternative placement for DC became available at the Swasey School, a\nprivate, state-approved special education school in Maine. The Swasey\nSchool provides access to the general curriculum to students who are\nexperiencing difficulties (similar to DC's) in their present\neducational setting and focuses on treating those behaviors that\ninterfere with the child's ability to learn. The parties have not yet\nhad the opportunity to fully consider that option.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fis an IEP which is \"reasonably calculated\" to provide an \"appropriate\"\n\neducation, as defined by the common standard in Maine and federal law.\n\nId. at 992.   And within that context, Congress has in the IDEA\n\nexpressed a preference for mainstreaming. \"Mainstreaming may not be\n\nignored, even to fulfill substantive educational criteria.\" Id. at\n\n992-93.\n\n           The child, DC, is now in a different position than in\n\nprevious proceedings: the IDEA's \"stay put\" provision, a preference for\n\nmaintaining a child in his current placement throughout both the\n\nadministrative and judicial proceedings challenging a placement\n\ndecision, no longer applies because this judicial proceeding terminates\n\nwith this opinion. See Doe v. Brookline Sch. Comm., 722 F.2d 910, 915\n\n(1st Cir. 1983).5 The IDEA requires Rome to generate an annual IEP\n\nbased on DC's current needs. If the parties cannot reach an agreement,\n\n\n\n     5     The hearing officer endorsed Mrs. B.'s unilateral placement\nof DC only after finding that Rome had failed to provide DC with an\nadequate educational program. That is a different issue, and one\nviewed more favorably to the parent, than the question whether this\nresidential placement was required in order to provide a free\nappropriate education to DC. See Burlington II, 736 F.2d at 799-801;\nFlorence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 12-13 (1993).\nWe note that our decision in Burlington II rested on our determination\nthat retrospective reimbursement by parents is not \"appropriate\" relief\navailable under the IDEA where parents have relied on an agency's\ndecision in their favor. Otherwise, \"parents will be placed in the\ndifficult position of having to choose between the state directive to\nmaintain the child in the private placement at the risk of ultimately\nusing their own funds, or of moving the child to the town's placement\nwhich the state agency has determined to be inadequate,\" which would\ncontravene the IDEA's stay-put provision. 736 F.2d at 800.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthey may then pursue the appropriate remedies as provided by the IDEA.\n\n          We make one final point. Congress mandated a system under\n\nthe IDEA of considerable involvement by parents together with school\n\nsystems in formulating IEPs. Judges are not experts on educational\n\ntheory. The education of DC will be best served by Mrs. B. and Rome\n\nworking together.\n\n          We dismiss Mrs. B.'s appeal.      No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

That IEP instead proposed mainstreaming the child into the local school for the 1998-99 school year. A hearing officer found the proposed IEP from the Rome School Committee for that year as well as the IEP proposed for the 1999-2000 school year to be inadequate under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1400-1491, and ordered Rome to reimburse Mrs. B. for the private school placement for those two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the school system's suit challenging the hearing officer's determination, the district court concluded, as had the reviewing magistrate judge, that the hearing officer was wrong on the substance -- that the IEPs were adequate. Nonetheless, the district court, following precedent that a parent may rely on the hearing officer's determination, held that Mrs. B. did not have to reimburse Rome for payments it had made for the tuition and related expenses in those two years.

The school system has not. And DC, apparently, continues at the private school, although we have nothing in the record on that point or on any later IEPs the school system may have proposed. The purpose of Mrs. B.'s appeal, in large part, is to be certain Rome cannot obtain reimbursement from her for the two school years, 1998-2000. But there is no issue as to that, because Rome does not appeal. Reimbursement is a different question than the merits of the IEPs. Indeed, the IEPs proposed for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 school years could have been adequate, but Mrs. B. still would not have to reimburse Rome the tuition money it paid for those years. See Burlington II, 736 F.3d at 800-01 (school is estopped from seeking reimbursement from parent for school year covered by agency's decision ordering reimbursement).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because there is no controversy as to reimbursement, the adequacy of past IEPs is not before us.

The contours of any factual dispute change shape as the years go on. Indeed, the IDEA recognizes that children's needs change over time, and it thus requires annual evaluation and development of an IEP for each school year. But the parties' irreconcilable views on the extent to which the IDEA requires a school to provide services to address a learning disabled child's behavior problems is a controversy that is likely to recur as Rome proposes new IEPs. Thus, we pause briefly to clarify a few points, not as a ruling on the merits of past IEPs nor as a suggestion of a proper placement for future school years, but to indicate the factors to be included in a proper analysis under the IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">States accepting federal funding must assure all learning disabled children the right to a \"free appropriate public education,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(A), by providing \"access to specialized instruction and related services . . . individually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child,\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 201.

Otherwise, \"parents will be placed in the difficult position of having to choose between the state directive to maintain the child in the private placement at the risk of ultimately using their own funds, or of moving the child to the town's placement which the state agency has determined to be inadequate,\" which would contravene the IDEA's stay-put provision. 736 F.2d at 800.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
