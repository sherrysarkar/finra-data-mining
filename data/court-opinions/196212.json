Factual Background and Initial Sentencing\r                                                        \r\n\n          Appellee Bennett abused positions of  trust with Daniel\r\n\nWebster  Mortgage Company, Inc.  (\"Daniel Webster\"), by obtaining\r\n\nmore  than ten  fraudulent  real  estate  loans based  on  Daniel\r\n\nWebster's  lines of  credit  with Plymouth  Federal Savings  Bank\r\n\n(\"Plymouth  Federal\") and  New Bedford  Institution  for Savings,\r\n\nwhich Bennett  applied toward the development  of real properties\r\n\nheld  in trust  for the  benefit of  himself and  his wife.   The\r\n\nfraudulent borrowing scheme  involved aliases,  false loan  docu-\r\n\nments and concealment.   Following its  discovery by the  Federal\r\n\nDeposit Insurance  Corporation during the spring  of 1990, Daniel\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nWebster  and Plymouth Federal sued Bennett.  On February 1, 1991,\r\n\nthe  parties  entered  into  a  settlement  agreement,  requiring\r\n\nBennett  to turn over cash and  other property, including certain\r\n\nimproved properties which remained in his possession.  \r\n\n          In  late  1991, Bennett  was  indicted  on nine  felony\r\n\ncounts for  fraudulently  obtaining  $900,000  from  a  financial\r\n\ninstitution,  see  18 U.S.C.     20  (1988) (defining  \"financial\r                           \r\n\ninstitution\"),  between August  1988 and  October  1989.   See 18\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   1344.  Following his trial and conviction on  all charg-\r\n\nes, the district  court calculated the  total loss occasioned  by\r\n\nBennett  at  $900,000, see  U.S.S.G.     2F1.1(b), rejecting  the\r                                    \r\n\ngovernment's contention  that the  total loss should  include, as\r\n\nrelevant conduct, amounts  fraudulently borrowed but  not charged\r\n\nin  the indictment.   The  district court  then deducted  (1) the\r\n\n$589,000  Bennett had repaid on the indictment loans prior to the\r\n\ndiscovery of his  crimes, and (2) the value to  Daniel Webster   \r\n\n\"at least  $660,000\"     of the civil  suit settlement  agreement\r\n\nentered into after Bennett's crimes had been discovered.\r\n\n          Having determined  that no loss had  been occasioned by\r\n\nBennett's fraud, the district court  ruled that Bennett merited a\r\n\ntwo-level downward  adjustment, see U.S.S.G.    3E1.1, for accep-\r                                             \r\n\ntance  of responsibility  by  agreeing to  settle the  indictment\r\n\nloans in full.  The resulting Total Offense Level (\"TOL\") of  8,1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  TOL  calculations  at  the first  sentencing  were  as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n            2F1.1 (base offense level)                 6\r\n            2F1.1(b)(1) (zero loss)                    0\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ntogether with a Criminal History Category of I, produced a GSR of\r\n\nfrom 2 to  8 months'  imprisonment, 24 to  36 months'  supervised\r\n\nrelease,  and a  $5,000  to $50,000  fine.   The  district  court\r\n\nsentenced Bennett to  24 months' probation  and six months'  home\r\n\ndetention, special assessments totaling $450, and no fine. \r\n\nB.   Bennett I\r          B.

The valuation of the proper-\r\n\nty Bennett agreed to surrender under  the terms of the civil suit\r\n\nsettlement  was disputed  at  the initial  sentencing; viz.,  the\r\n\ngovernment contending for $431,024.16, Bennett $684,000.  At that\r\n\ntime, Bennett maintained  that a slumping economy had reduced the\r\n\nvalue  of the settlement  after the banks  took title to  the im-\r                                         \r\n\nproved properties  and other  assets tendered  by  Bennett.   The\r\n\ndistrict court accordingly rejected the lower valuation propound-\r\n\ned  by the government, and  found the settlement  worth \"at least\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n$660,000.\"  Subsequently, at resentencing, it placed the value of\r\n\nBennett's \"extraordinary act\" at $694,000.  \r\n\n          Thus, not only did  Bennett not proffer record evidence\r\n\nof a  sudden, unforeseen  downturn in  the regional economy  that\r\n\nsignificantly lowered  the value of the  properties financed with\r\n\nhis  illegal  borrowings, but  throughout  both prior  sentencing\r\n\nproceedings he  maintained that  market factors had  not affected\r\n\nthese properties.  We therefore hold both that the \"multiple loss\r\n\ncausation\" claim  has not  been preserved,  see United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDietz, 950 F.2d  50, 55  (1st Cir. 1991)  (\"[I]n connection  with\r               \r\n\nsentencing  as in other contexts  . . .  arguments not seasonably\r\n\naddressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time\r\n\nin  an appellate venue.\"), and  that it is  unsupported    indeed\r\n\ncontradicted    by the record.  \r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          As all available avenues  for a downward departure have\r\n\nbeen  foreclosed, we vacate  the second  sentence imposed  by the\r\n\ndistrict court  and remand for resentencing  within the guideline\r\n\nsentencing range  prescribed by the total  offense level recalcu-\r\n\nlated by the district court at the first resentencing.\r\n\n          SO ORDERED.\r                    SO ORDERED.\r                              \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n",

Factual Background and Initial Sentencing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee Bennett abused positions of trust with Daniel Webster Mortgage Company, Inc.  (\"Daniel Webster\"), by obtaining more than ten fraudulent real estate loans based on Daniel Webster's lines of credit with Plymouth Federal Savings Bank (\"Plymouth Federal\") and New Bedford Institution for Savings, which Bennett applied toward the development of real properties held in trust for the benefit of himself and his wife.  The fraudulent borrowing scheme involved aliases, false loan documents and concealment.  Following its discovery by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the spring of 1990, Daniel Webster and Plymouth Federal sued Bennett.  On February 1, 1991, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, requiring Bennett to turn over cash and other property, including certain improved properties which remained in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1991, Bennett was indicted on nine felony counts for fraudulently obtaining $900,000 from a financial institution, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 20 (1988) (defining \"financial institution\"), between August 1988 and October 1989.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344.  Following his trial and conviction on all charges, the district court calculated the total loss occasioned by Bennett at $900,000, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b), rejecting the government's contention that the total loss should include, as relevant conduct, amounts fraudulently borrowed but not charged in the indictment.  The district court then deducted (1) the $589,000 Bennett had repaid on the indictment loans prior to the discovery of his crimes, and (2) the value to Daniel Webster--\"at least $660,000\"--of the civil suit settlement agreement entered into after Bennett's crimes had been discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that no loss had been occasioned by Bennett's fraud, the district court ruled that Bennett merited a two-level downward adjustment, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility by agreeing to settle the indictment loans in full.  The resulting Total Offense Level (\"TOL\") of 8,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> together with a Criminal History Category of I, produced a GSR of from 2 to 8 months' imprisonment, 24 to 36 months' supervised release, and a $5,000 to $50,000 fine.  The district court sentenced Bennett to 24 months' probation and six months' home detention, special assessments totaling $450, and no fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Bennett I</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal in Bennett I we held that the district court had erred in excluding from the total loss calculation under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1), as relevant conduct, the losses resulting from fraudulent borrowings not charged in the indictment, Bennett I, 37 F.3d at 694, and in crediting Bennett with \"at least $660,000\" for the civil suit settlement entered into after his crimes had been discovered.  Id. at 695 (\" '[T]he loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to secure the loan.' \")  (citing U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, n. 7(b)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Finally, Bennett I held that the two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was clear error, since Bennett had neither demonstrated genuine contrition nor made voluntary restitution by settling the civil suit, nor pled guilty to the charges in the indictment, but instead denied the essential factual elements of the charges throughout trial and at sentencing by maintaining that he had never intended to defraud the banks.  See id. at 696-98.   We therefore vacated the first sentence and remanded for resentencing.  Id. at 700.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Sec. 3553(b), the district court identified two factors ostensibly warranting a departure from the GSR.  First, Bennett had already served a portion of the original sentence, including the entire six months' home detention term.  Second, the civil suit settlement constituted \"an extraordinary act that seldom occurs in the criminal courts....\"  Accordingly, the district court granted a six-month downward departure from the recalculated 27-month GSR minimum, based on the six months' home detention term already served, combined with a further 15-month downward departure for the \"extraordinary act\" of entering into the civil suit settlement agreement to repay $694,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court then imposed the minimum six-month prison term now under challenge on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States contends that Bennett I foreclosed both a downward adjustment and a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility based on the civil settlement and Bennett's belated expression of contrition at sentencing.

Sec. 2F1.1, n. 7(b) (1994), or on the ground of multiple loss causation.  See, e.g., United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 405 (1st Cir.1995) (acknowledging that a downward departure may be warranted in the \"few instances\" where \"... a misrepresentation ... is not the sole cause of the loss....\") (citing U.S.S.G.

The valuation of the property Bennett agreed to surrender under the terms of the civil suit settlement was disputed at the initial sentencing;  viz., the government contending for $431,024.16, Bennett $684,000.  At that time, Bennett maintained that a slumping economy had reduced the value of the settlement after the banks took title to the improved properties and other assets tendered by Bennett.  The district court accordingly rejected the lower valuation propounded by the government, and found the settlement worth \"at least $660,000.\"   Subsequently, at resentencing, it placed the value of Bennett's \"extraordinary act\" at $694,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, not only did Bennett not proffer record evidence of a sudden, unforeseen downturn in the regional economy that significantly lowered the value of the properties financed with his illegal borrowings, but throughout both prior sentencing proceedings he maintained that market factors had not affected these properties.  We therefore hold both that the \"multiple loss causation\" claim has not been preserved, see United States v.

Factual Background and Initial Sentencing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee Bennett abused positions of trust with Daniel Webster Mortgage Company, Inc.  (\"Daniel Webster\"), by obtaining more than ten fraudulent real estate loans based on Daniel Webster's lines of credit with Plymouth Federal Savings Bank (\"Plymouth Federal\") and New Bedford Institution for Savings, which Bennett applied toward the development of real properties held in trust for the benefit of himself and his wife.  The fraudulent borrowing scheme involved aliases, false loan documents and concealment.  Following its discovery by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the spring of 1990, Daniel Webster and Plymouth Federal sued Bennett.  On February 1, 1991, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, requiring Bennett to turn over cash and other property, including certain improved properties which remained in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1991, Bennett was indicted on nine felony counts for fraudulently obtaining $900,000 from a financial institution, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 20 (1988) (defining \"financial institution\"), between August 1988 and October 1989.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344.  Following his trial and conviction on all charges, the district court calculated the total loss occasioned by Bennett at $900,000, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b), rejecting the government's contention that the total loss should include, as relevant conduct, amounts fraudulently borrowed but not charged in the indictment.  The district court then deducted (1) the $589,000 Bennett had repaid on the indictment loans prior to the discovery of his crimes, and (2) the value to Daniel Webster--\"at least $660,000\"--of the civil suit settlement agreement entered into after Bennett's crimes had been discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that no loss had been occasioned by Bennett's fraud, the district court ruled that Bennett merited a two-level downward adjustment, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility by agreeing to settle the indictment loans in full.  The resulting Total Offense Level (\"TOL\") of 8,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> together with a Criminal History Category of I, produced a GSR of from 2 to 8 months' imprisonment, 24 to 36 months' supervised release, and a $5,000 to $50,000 fine.  The district court sentenced Bennett to 24 months' probation and six months' home detention, special assessments totaling $450, and no fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Bennett I</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal in Bennett I we held that the district court had erred in excluding from the total loss calculation under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1), as relevant conduct, the losses resulting from fraudulent borrowings not charged in the indictment, Bennett I, 37 F.3d at 694, and in crediting Bennett with \"at least $660,000\" for the civil suit settlement entered into after his crimes had been discovered.  Id. at 695 (\" '[T]he loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to secure the loan.' \")  (citing U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, n. 7(b)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Finally, Bennett I held that the two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was clear error, since Bennett had neither demonstrated genuine contrition nor made voluntary restitution by settling the civil suit, nor pled guilty to the charges in the indictment, but instead denied the essential factual elements of the charges throughout trial and at sentencing by maintaining that he had never intended to defraud the banks.  See id. at 696-98.   We therefore vacated the first sentence and remanded for resentencing.  Id. at 700.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Sec. 3553(b), the district court identified two factors ostensibly warranting a departure from the GSR.  First, Bennett had already served a portion of the original sentence, including the entire six months' home detention term.  Second, the civil suit settlement constituted \"an extraordinary act that seldom occurs in the criminal courts....\"  Accordingly, the district court granted a six-month downward departure from the recalculated 27-month GSR minimum, based on the six months' home detention term already served, combined with a further 15-month downward departure for the \"extraordinary act\" of entering into the civil suit settlement agreement to repay $694,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court then imposed the minimum six-month prison term now under challenge on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States contends that Bennett I foreclosed both a downward adjustment and a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility based on the civil settlement and Bennett's belated expression of contrition at sentencing.
