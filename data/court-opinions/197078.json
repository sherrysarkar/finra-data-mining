BACKGROUND\r                                   II.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The principal facts of this  case are summarized in the\r\n\nopinion of the  state Supreme  Court on direct  review, State  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPettiway,  657 A.2d  161  (R.I. 1995),  and  the opinion  of  the\r                  \r\n\nfederal district  court on  collateral review, Pettiway  v. Vose,\r                                                                          \r\n\n921 F. Supp. 61, 61-62 (D. R.I. 1996), therefore, we present only\r\n\na brief  factual review.  At trial, Pettiway was not permitted to\r\n\nenter into  evidence  a report  of  the Department  of  Children,\r\n\nYouth, and Families (\"DCYF\")  which included allegations that the\r\n\nvictim had been  sexually abused by two other men whom her mother\r\n\nhad brought home.   These  incidents were alleged  to have  taken\r\n\nplace  subsequent  to  the abuse  by  defendant.    See State  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPettiway,  657 A.2d at 163.  In  addition to the testimony of the\r                  \r\n\nvictim,  the prosecution relied  on a written  confession and the\r\n\ntestimony of  two police detectives who stated that Pettiway made\r\n\nan oral confession.  Such other facts as may be pertinent will be\r\n\ndiscussed as they arise in this opinion.\r\n\n                       III.  LEGAL ANALYSIS\r                                 III.  LEGAL ANALYSIS\r\n\n          On direct review, the  Rhode Island Supreme Court held,\r\n\nand  neither  party  disputes,  that  the  trial  court's  ruling\r\n\nlimiting  Pettiway's  ability  to cross-examine  the  complaining\r\n\nwitness    violated   Pettiway's   Sixth   Amendment   right   to\r\n\nconfrontation.  See  State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d  at 163-64.  The\r                                                \r\n\nstate Supreme Court also  concluded, however, that the denial  of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nPettiway'sright to confrontation was harmless error.  Id. at 164.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          We now  review Pettiway's  petition for  habeas corpus.\r\n\nIn order  to  prevail  Pettiway  must show  that  the  trial-type\r\n\nconstitutional  error, considered  in light  of the  record  as a\r\n\nwhole, had a \"'substantial and  injurious effect or influence  in\r\n\ndetermining the jury's verdict.'\"  Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n619, 623 (1993)  (quoting Kotteakos  v. United  States, 328  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n750,  776 (1946)).   In  Bowling v.  Vose, 3  F.3d 559  (1st Cir.\r                                                   \r\n\n1993),   this  Court   stated   that  \"the   inquiry  entails   a\r\n\ndetermination  of the  exact nature and  force of  [the] proposed\r\n\ntestimony  and an  effort  to place  [the]  testimony within  the\r\n\ncontext of  the evidence  as a  whole.  In  short, the  weight of\r\n\n[the] testimony  must  be  balanced against  the  weight  of  the\r\n\ninculpatory  evidence.\"   Id. at  563.1   Relevant factors  to be\r                                       \r\n\nconsidered  in determining  whether  the  jury was  substantially\r\n\nswayed by the  error include: \"(1) the extent to  which the error\r\n\npermeated  the  proceeding,  (2)  the  centrality  of  the  issue\r\n\naffected by the error to the  case as actually tried, and (3) the\r\n\nrelative strength  of the  properly admitted evidence  of guilt.\"\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Neither party mentioned  in its brief or at oral  argument the\r\nAntiterrorism and Effective  Death Penalty Act  of 1996, Pub.  L.\r\nNo.  104-132, 110  Stat.  1218, which  amends  the habeas  corpus\r\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C.   2254.  We need not, however, attempt to\r\nnavigate  the amended  statute  in this  case.   Using  the  pre-\r\namendment habeas corpus  requirements established by this  Court,\r\nwe  find that  defendant-appellant's request  for relief  must be\r\ndenied.  Because  the amendments make  habeas corpus relief  more\r\ndifficult to obtain, the result would be the same whether  or not\r\nthe  amendments are relevant to this case and whether or not they\r\naffect our inquiry.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nLevasseur, 70 F.3d  at 193.  We will  follow the approach adopted\r                   \r\n\nin Levasseur, considering each of the factors in turn.\r                      \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n                          IV. DISCUSSION\r                                    IV. DISCUSSION\r\n\n          A.  Prevalence of the error\r                    A.  Prevalence of the error\r\n\n          The  constitutional  error   in  this   case  was   the\r\n\nlimitation of Pettiway's  right to cross-examine the victim.  The\r\n\nvictim was interviewed by a child protective investigator for the\r\n\nDCYF  in September  1992, after  the indictment of  Pettiway, but\r\n\nprior to his trial.  During that interview, she reported that she\r\n\nhad been  sexually abused by  two other  men that her  mother had\r\n\nbrought home.  These incidents occurred subsequent to the alleged\r\n\nsexual abuse by  Pettiway, and have  been neither prosecuted  nor\r\n\nproven false.   See State v.  Pettiway, 657  A.2d 161, 163  (R.I.\r                                                \r\n\n1995).\r\n\n          Pettiway was not permitted to introduce the DCYF report\r\n\nat  trial, nor was he permitted to cross-examine the victim about\r\n\nthe allegations contained therein.  Id.  Defendant-appellant was,\r                                                 \r\n\nhowever, permitted to\r\n\n            confront   Melissa,   his  accuser,   and\r\n            challenge her  credibility.  Indeed . . .\r\n            [the] trial justice gave  defense counsel\r\n            wide  latitude  to cross-examine  Melissa\r\n            fully   in  regard  to  the  matters  she\r\n            testified  to  on direct-examination  and\r\n            . . .  to  explore  in   depth  Melissa's\r\n            memory about the  incidents of abuse  and\r\n            her reasons  for not reporting  the abuse\r\n            sooner.\r\n\nId. at 164.\r             \r\n\n          Pettiway claims that  the excluded evidence  would have\r\n\nenabled  him  to  challenge  the credibility  of  the  victim  by\r\n\ndemonstrating a  pattern of  accusing her mother's  boyfriends of\r\n\nsexual abuse.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          B.  Centrality of the issue affected by the error\r                    B.  Centrality of the issue affected by the error\r\n\n          By  limiting  the  cross  examination  of  the  victim,\r\n\nPettiway claims, the trial justice affected the defense's ability\r\n\nto challenge her credibility.   We recognize that this  case was,\r\n\nin part, a credibility contest  between the victim and  Pettiway.\r\n\nIn  this sense, the right to  confront and attempt to impeach the\r\n\nvictim was central to the defense.  Our inquiry does not end with\r\n\nthis determination, however.  It is not enough to simply say that\r\n\ncredibility was an important question,  we must also consider the\r\n\nimpact of the error on the credibility issue.\r\n\n          We are not persuaded that  testimony to the effect that\r\n\nthe  victim  claimed  to have  been  abused by  other  men  -- an\r\n\nallegation  that   is  very  possibly  truthful   --  would  have\r\n\nsubstantially   affected   the  jury's   credibility  assessment.\r\n\nIndeed, it  is possible that such testimony would have emphasized\r\n\nto the jury the lack of parental supervision in the household and\r\n\nmade them more inclined  to believe the testimony of  the victim.\r                        \r\n\nFurthermore,  Pettiway has pointed to no place in the record, and\r\n\nhas made no argument, to the  effect that the allegations made by\r\n\nthe victim  were false.  Nor  did he give any  indication that he\r\n\nintended to  discredit those allegations  in court.   His current\r\n\nposition appears to be that the mere mention of other allegations\r\n\nof abuse, without any evidence that those allegations were false,\r\n\nwould  sway  the jury  to the  point  of disregarding  the entire\r\n\ntestimony of the victim.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          We  also note  that  Pettiway was  not foreclosed  from\r\n\nchallenging the victim's credibility, but was only prevented from\r\n\npursuing  questions pertinent to the  DCYF report.   It is simply\r\n\ntoo large an inferential leap for this Court to conclude that the\r\n\nadmission of  this  evidence could  have had  a \"substantial  and\r\n\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"\r\n\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1992).\r                              \r\n\n          C.  Relative Strength of the properly admitted evidence\r                    C.  Relative Strength of the properly admitted evidence\r\n\n          The final factor  in the Levasseur test  requires us to\r                                                      \r\n\nexamine the  strength of the properly admitted  evidence of guilt\r\n\nand determine whether \"the error substantially affected the jury.\r\n\nWas the properly admitted evidence so strong that  it overwhelmed\r\n\nthe  impact of  the [error]?\"   Levasseur,  70 F.3d  at 195.   We\r                                                   \r\n\nconclude that it was.   The evidence admitted at  trial consisted\r\n\nof: (1)  the testimony of  the victim; (2)  the testimony of  two\r\n\npolice officers that defendant  made an oral confession;  and (3)\r\n\ndefendant's written  confession.   See Pettiway v.  Vose, 921  F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. at 63.\r\n\n          The  victim testified  to  eleven incidents  of  sexual\r\n\nmolestation.   She  detailed one  incident during  which Pettiway\r\n\ntouched her  breast and penetrated  her vagina with  his fingers,\r\n\nand  she mentioned  several  other, more  general allegations  of\r\n\nmolestation.    Id.    Both detectives  testified  that  Pettiway\r                             \r\n\nadmitted  to  sexually  touching  and digitally  penetrating  the\r\n\nvictim.  Id.  In his written confession, Pettiway admitted to one\r                      \r\n\nact  of touching the victim's  breast and one  act of penetrating\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nher  vagina,  and  stated that  he  touched  her  on three  other\r\n\noccasions.   The important point for present purposes is the fact\r\n\nthat the  confessions and the  victim's testimony all  relate the\r\n\nsame  incidents  of touching  in detail  --  one touching  of the\r\n\nbreast  and one  act of  vaginal penetration.   Beyond  these two\r\n\nevents, the testimony and the written confession are both vague.\r\n\n          The court submitted five counts of  sexual abuse to the\r\n\njury, and the jury returned  guilty verdicts on two.  Id.  at 64.\r                                                                   \r\n\nPettiway points out that the  jury's verdict mirrors the victim's\r\n\ntestimony  and contends  that  the  jury  relied solely  on  this\r\n\ntestimony and  disregarded the allegedly coerced  confession.  In\r\n\nlight  of  this  fact,  the  defendant's  theory  goes, an  error\r\n\nlimiting his  ability to  impeach the  credibility of the  victim\r\n\ncannot be  harmless.   Appellee  responds that  the jury  verdict\r\n\nmirrors  the written  confession  and  claims  that  it  is  this\r\n\nevidence that the jury  found compelling.  As a  result, appellee\r\n\nargues,  the error  is harmless  because it  relates only  to the\r\n\ntestimony of the victim.\r\n\n          We disagree  that the verdict reflects  a disregard for\r\n\nPettiway's  confession.     The  written  confession,   the  oral\r\n\nconfession, and  the testimony  of the victim  were substantially\r\n\nsimilar.   This collection of evidence from the two most reliable\r\n\nsources  possible -- the victim  and the accused  -- is extremely\r\n\npersuasive and the error in this case is simply not consequential\r\n\nenough  to undermine this evidence.  First, as pointed out above,\r\n\nthere  is serious doubt about the probative value of the evidence\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthat Pettiway sought to  introduce.  Second, even if  some doubts\r\n\nabout  credibility could  have been  placed in  the minds  of the\r\n\njury, the  oral  and  written  confessions cannot  so  easily  be\r\n\novercome.  They provide substantial corroboration of the victim's\r\n\ntestimony and  strong  support for  the verdict  returned by  the\r\n\njury.  Despite the attempts of both parties to present the jury's\r\n\ndeliberations as focusing on  only one piece of evidence,  we see\r\n\nno reason why this must be  so.  The evidence, taken as  a whole,\r\n\nis consistent and strongly supports the guilty verdicts.  Even if\r\n\nthe  victim's testimony  had  been  called  into question  --  an\r\n\noutcome  that  strikes us  as unlikely  --  the oral  and written\r\n\nconfessions   provide   sufficient    evidence   of   guilt   and\r\n\ncorroboration of  the testimony  to conclude  that the error  was\r\n\nharmless.\r\n\n          We also feel compelled to address Pettiway's claim that\r\n\nthe  oral and written confessions  were coerced.   This issue was\r\n\nspecifically  addressed by the  state court.   The trial justice,\r\n\nafter a detailed  inquiry into  the claim of  coercion and  after\r\n\nhearing evidence on the issue from both sides, wrote:\r\n\n               I  do not believe  that this defendant\r\n            asked   for   an    attorney   in    that\r\n            interrogation room.   I don't  believe he\r\n            asked for  a  telephone call,  nor  do  I\r\n            believe    he    asked   to    stop   the\r\n            interrogation.\r\n               I  find   .  .  .  first   the  verbal\r\n            statements, then  the written statements,\r\n            were made with  full consent of the  will\r\n            and  knowingly  and intelligently  waving\r\n            [sic] all his  constitutional rights  and\r\n            that  the State  has  now  in my  opinion\r\n            proven .  . . beyond  a reasonable  doubt\r\n            . . . [that]  the statements attributable\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n            to the defendant  were voluntarily  [sic]\r\n            and not  of any coercion and  that he was\r\n            afforded all of his constitutional rights\r\n            and  he knowingly,  intelligently, waived\r\n            his rights.\r\n\nTrial Transcript I at 133-34.\r\n\n          Such a finding of  fact by the state court  is entitled\r\n\nto  great deference.  See 28 U.S.C. 2254(d); Tart v. Commonwealth\r                                                                           \r\n\nof Massachusetts, 949 F.2d  490, 504 (1st Cir. 1990);  Tavares v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHolbrook,  779 F.2d  1,  3 (1st  Cir. 1985).

Pettiway  claims that he  was\r\n\n\"under a lot of  pressure . . .  from the doctor\" because he  had\r\n\n\"adult  acne\"  and  was taking  tetracycline,  yet  he  failed to\r\n\nintroduce  any evidence  that  this medication  would affect  his\r\n\njudgment.   At trial, he admitted that he was told of his Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nrights, and that he understood that he did not have to answer any\r\n\nquestions.   Despite the fact that he understood these rights, he\r\n\ntestified that he began  to write the written confession  only \"a\r\n\ncouple of minutes\"  after being  advised of those  rights.   With\r\n\nreference to  the written  confession, he  stated that he  \"wrote\r\n\neverything that they told [him] to write.\"  Trial Transcript I at\r\n\n103.   Yet only a  few pages later  in the transcript,  he states\r\n\nthat  he \"can't even be sure\" that  he wrote the confession.  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 106.   If the defendant was aware of his rights, why was it so\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\neasy for the  detectives to coerce his confession?   How could it\r\n\nbe that \"his  will was completely overborne,\"  Brief of Appellant\r\n\nat 4, when the entire interrogation  lasted only one hour?  If he\r\n\nclaimed to have been coerced into writing the confession, why did\r\n\nhe then  express doubt about having  written it?  Upon  review of\r\n\nthe record, we conclude that there is ample support in the record\r\n\nfor  the findings of the  trial court with  respect to Pettiway's\r\n\nallegation of a coerced confession.\r\n\n                          V.  CONCLUSION\r                                    V.

The  oral confession,\r\n\nthe written confession, and the testimony of the victim amount to\r\n\na  powerful  body  of  evidence.   We  do  not  believe  that the\r\n\nadmission of allegations made by the victim about other incidents\r\n\nof abuse  could have overcome this  evidence.

Laws &#167; 11-37-8.1, and one count of second degree child molestation sexual assault, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 1137-8.3.  He was also acquitted of two counts of first degree and one count of second degree child molestation sexual assault.  Pettiway unsuccessfully appealed his conviction to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d 161 (R.I.1995), and then filed for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Pettiway v. Vose, 921 F.Supp. 61 (D.R.I.1996).  When the district court denied the writ, Pettiway filed this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a harmless error determination on habeas corpus review is de novo.  See Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1994) (\"mixed questions of law and fact arising in section 2254 cases are ordinarily subject to de novo review\");  Levasseur v. Pepe, 70 F.3d 187, 193 (1st Cir.1995) (\"a harmless error determination on habeas corpus review is a mixed question of law and fact [and] we examine this issue de novo \").  Findings of fact by the state court, however, are entitled to great deference on federal habeas review.  See 28 U.S.C. 2254(d);  Tart v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 949 F.2d 490, 504 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal facts of this case are summarized in the opinion of the state Supreme Court on direct review, State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d 161 (R.I.1995), and the opinion of the federal district court on collateral review, Pettiway v. Vose, 921 F.Supp. 61, 61-62 (D.R.I.1996), therefore, we present only a brief factual review.  At trial, Pettiway was not permitted to enter into evidence a report of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (\"DCYF\") which included allegations that the victim had been sexually abused by two other men whom her mother had brought home.  These incidents were alleged to have taken place subsequent to the abuse by defendant.  See State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d at 163.   In addition to the testimony of the victim, the prosecution relied on a written confession and the testimony of two police detectives who stated that Pettiway made an oral confession.  Such other facts as may be pertinent will be discussed as they arise in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct review, the Rhode Island Supreme Court held, and neither party disputes, that the trial court's ruling limiting Pettiway's ability to cross-examine the complaining witness violated Pettiway's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.  See State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d at 163-64.   The state Supreme Court also concluded, however, that the denial of Pettiway's right to confrontation was harmless error.  Id. at 164.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now review Pettiway's petition for habeas corpus.  In order to prevail Pettiway must show that the trial-type constitutional error, considered in light of the record as a whole, had a \" 'substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \"  Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1714, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).  In Bowling v. Vose, 3 F.3d 559 (1st Cir.1993), this Court stated that \"the inquiry entails a determination of the exact nature and force of [the] proposed testimony and an effort to place [the] testimony within the context of the evidence as a whole.  In short, the weight of [the] testimony must be balanced against the weight of the inculpatory evidence.\"  Id. at 563.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Relevant factors to be considered in determining whether the jury was substantially swayed by the error include:  \"(1) the extent to which the error permeated the proceeding, (2) the centrality of the issue affected by the error to the case as actually tried, and (3) the relative strength of the properly admitted evidence of guilt.\"  Levasseur, 70 F.3d at 193.   We will follow the approach adopted in Levasseur, considering each of the factors in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Prevalence of the error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional error in this case was the limitation of Pettiway's right to cross-examine the victim.  The victim was interviewed by a child protective investigator for the DCYF in September 1992, after the indictment of Pettiway, but prior to his trial.  During that interview, she reported that she had been sexually abused by two other men that her mother had brought home.  These incidents occurred subsequent to the alleged sexual abuse by Pettiway, and have been neither prosecuted nor proven false.  See State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d 161, 163 (R.I.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pettiway was not permitted to introduce the DCYF report at trial, nor was he permitted to cross-examine the victim about the allegations contained therein.  Id. Defendant-appellant was, however, permitted to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>confront Melissa, his accuser, and challenge her credibility.  Indeed ... [the] trial justice gave defense counsel wide latitude to cross-examine Melissa fully in regard to the matters she testified to on direct-examination and ... to explore in depth Melissa's memory about the incidents of abuse and her reasons for not reporting the abuse sooner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 164.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pettiway claims that the excluded evidence would have enabled him to challenge the credibility of the victim by demonstrating a pattern of accusing her mother's boyfriends of sexual abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Centrality of the issue affected by the error</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By limiting the cross examination of the victim, Pettiway claims, the trial justice affected the defense's ability to challenge her credibility.  We recognize that this case was, in part, a credibility contest between the victim and Pettiway.  In this sense, the right to confront and attempt to impeach the victim was central to the defense.  Our inquiry does not end with this determination, however.  It is not enough to simply say that credibility was an important question, we must also consider the impact of the error on the credibility issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded that testimony to the effect that the victim claimed to have been abused by other men--an allegation that is very possibly truthful--would have substantially affected the jury's credibility assessment.  Indeed, it is possible that such testimony would have emphasized to the jury the lack of parental supervision in the household and made them more inclined to believe the testimony of the victim.  Furthermore, Pettiway has pointed to no place in the record, and has made no argument, to the effect that the allegations made by the victim were false.  Nor did he give any indication that he intended to discredit those allegations in court.  His current position appears to be that the mere mention of other allegations of abuse, without any evidence that those allegations were false, would sway the jury to the point of disregarding the entire testimony of the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that Pettiway was not foreclosed from challenging the victim's credibility, but was only prevented from pursuing questions pertinent to the DCYF report.  It is simply too large an inferential leap for this Court to conclude that the admission of this evidence could have had a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"  Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Relative Strength of the properly admitted evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final factor in the Levasseur test requires us to examine the strength of the properly admitted evidence of guilt and determine whether \"the error substantially affected the jury.  Was the properly admitted evidence so strong that it overwhelmed the impact of the [error]?\"  Levasseur, 70 F.3d at 195.   We conclude that it was.  The evidence admitted at trial consisted of:  (1) the testimony of the victim;  (2) the testimony of two police officers that defendant made an oral confession;  and (3) defendant's written confession.  See Pettiway v. Vose, 921 F.Supp. at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victim testified to eleven incidents of sexual molestation.  She detailed one incident during which Pettiway touched her breast and penetrated her vagina with his fingers, and she mentioned several other, more general allegations of molestation.  Id. Both detectives testified that Pettiway admitted to sexually touching and digitally penetrating the victim.  Id. In his written confession, Pettiway admitted to one act of touching the victim's breast and one act of penetrating her vagina, and stated that he touched her on three other occasions.  The important point for present purposes is the fact that the confessions and the victim's testimony all relate the same incidents of touching in detail--one touching of the breast and one act of vaginal penetration.  Beyond these two events, the testimony and the written confession are both vague.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court submitted five counts of sexual abuse to the jury, and the jury returned guilty verdicts on two.  Id. at 64.   Pettiway points out that the jury's verdict mirrors the victim's testimony and contends that the jury relied solely on this testimony and disregarded the allegedly coerced confession.  In light of this fact, the defendant's theory goes, an error limiting his ability to impeach the credibility of the victim cannot be harmless.  Appellee responds that the jury verdict mirrors the written confession and claims that it is this evidence that the jury found compelling.  As a result, appellee argues, the error is harmless because it relates only to the testimony of the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that the verdict reflects a disregard for Pettiway's confession.  The written confession, the oral confession, and the testimony of the victim were substantially similar.  This collection of evidence from the two most reliable sources possible--the victim and the accused--is extremely persuasive and the error in this case is simply not consequential enough to undermine this evidence.  First, as pointed out above, there is serious doubt about the probative value of the evidence that Pettiway sought to introduce.  Second, even if some doubts about credibility could have been placed in the minds of the jury, the oral and written confessions cannot so easily be overcome.  They provide substantial corroboration of the victim's testimony and strong support for the verdict returned by the jury.  Despite the attempts of both parties to present the jury's deliberations as focusing on only one piece of evidence, we see no reason why this must be so.  The evidence, taken as a whole, is consistent and strongly supports the guilty verdicts.  Even if the victim's testimony had been called into question--an outcome that strikes us as unlikely--the oral and written confessions provide sufficient evidence of guilt and corroboration of the testimony to conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also feel compelled to address Pettiway's claim that the oral and written confessions were coerced.  This issue was specifically addressed by the state court.  The trial justice, after a detailed inquiry into the claim of coercion and after hearing evidence on the issue from both sides, wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not believe that this defendant asked for an attorney in that interrogation room.  I don't believe he asked for a telephone call, nor do I believe he asked to stop the interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find ... first the verbal statements, then the written statements, were made with full consent of the will and knowingly and intelligently waving [sic] all his constitutional rights and that the State has now in my opinion proven ... beyond a reasonable doubt ... [that] the statements attributable to the defendant were voluntarily [sic] and not of any coercion and that he was afforded all of his constitutional rights and he knowingly, intelligently, waived his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript I at 133-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a finding of fact by the state court is entitled to great deference.  See 28 U.S.C. 2254(d);  Tart v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 949 F.2d 490, 504 (1st Cir.1991);  Tavares v. Holbrook, 779 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1985).  On habeas corpus review, we overturn such a finding of fact only if we \"conclude[ ] that such factual determination is not fairly supported by the record.\"  28 U.S.C. 2254(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find, upon our own review of the record, that we must adopt this finding of fact.  Pettiway claims that he was \"under a lot of pressure ... from the doctor\" because he had \"adult acne\" and was taking tetracycline, yet he failed to introduce any evidence that this medication would affect his judgment.  At trial, he admitted that he was told of his Miranda rights, and that he understood that he did not have to answer any questions.  Despite the fact that he understood these rights, he testified that he began to write the written confession only \"a couple of minutes\" after being advised of those rights.  With reference to the written confession, he stated that he \"wrote everything that they told [him] to write.\"   Trial Transcript I at 103.  Yet only a few pages later in the transcript, he states that he \"can't even be sure\" that he wrote the confession.  Id. at 106.   If the defendant was aware of his rights, why was it so easy for the detectives to coerce his confession?   How could it be that \"his will was completely overborne,\" Brief of Appellant at 4, when the entire interrogation lasted only one hour?   If he claimed to have been coerced into writing the confession, why did he then express doubt about having written it?   Upon review of the record, we conclude that there is ample support in the record for the findings of the trial court with respect to Pettiway's allegation of a coerced confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the Sixth Amendment violation was harmless error and we affirm the district court's dismissal of the habeas corpus petition.  The oral confession, the written confession, and the testimony of the victim amount to a powerful body of evidence.  We do not believe that the admission of allegations made by the victim about other incidents of abuse could have overcome this evidence.  The error did not have a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"  Brecht, 507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. at 1714.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither party mentioned in its brief or at oral argument the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L.No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1218, which amends the habeas corpus provisions of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal facts of this case are summarized in the opinion of the state Supreme Court on direct review, State v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></span>, 61-62 (D.R.I.1996), therefore, we present only a brief factual review.  At trial, Pettiway was not permitted to enter into evidence a report of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (\"DCYF\") which included allegations that the victim had been sexually abused by two other men whom her mother had brought home.  These incidents were alleged to have taken place subsequent to the abuse by defendant.  See State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d at 163.   In addition to the testimony of the victim, the prosecution relied on a written confession and the testimony of two police detectives who stated that Pettiway made an oral confession.  Such other facts as may be pertinent will be discussed as they arise in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct review, the Rhode Island Supreme Court held, and neither party disputes, that the trial court's ruling limiting Pettiway's ability to cross-examine the complaining witness violated Pettiway's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.  See State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d at 163-64.   The state Supreme Court also concluded, however, that the denial of Pettiway's right to confrontation was harmless error.  Id. at 164.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now review Pettiway's petition for habeas corpus.  In order to prevail Pettiway must show that the trial-type constitutional error, considered in light of the record as a whole, had a \" 'substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \"  Brecht v.

We will follow the approach adopted in Levasseur, considering each of the factors in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Prevalence of the error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional error in this case was the limitation of Pettiway's right to cross-examine the victim.  The victim was interviewed by a child protective investigator for the DCYF in September 1992, after the indictment of Pettiway, but prior to his trial.  During that interview, she reported that she had been sexually abused by two other men that her mother had brought home.  These incidents occurred subsequent to the alleged sexual abuse by Pettiway, and have been neither prosecuted nor proven false.  See State v. Pettiway, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403874\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403874/state-v-pettiway/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 163 (R.I.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pettiway was not permitted to introduce the DCYF report at trial, nor was he permitted to cross-examine the victim about the allegations contained therein.  Id. Defendant-appellant was, however, permitted to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>confront Melissa, his accuser, and challenge her credibility.  Indeed ... [the] trial justice gave defense counsel wide latitude to cross-examine Melissa fully in regard to the matters she testified to on direct-examination and ... to explore in depth Melissa's memory about the incidents of abuse and her reasons for not reporting the abuse sooner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 164.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pettiway claims that the excluded evidence would have enabled him to challenge the credibility of the victim by demonstrating a pattern of accusing her mother's boyfriends of sexual abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Centrality of the issue affected by the error</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By limiting the cross examination of the victim, Pettiway claims, the trial justice affected the defense's ability to challenge her credibility.  We recognize that this case was, in part, a credibility contest between the victim and Pettiway.  In this sense, the right to confront and attempt to impeach the victim was central to the defense.  Our inquiry does not end with this determination, however.  It is not enough to simply say that credibility was an important question, we must also consider the impact of the error on the credibility issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded that testimony to the effect that the victim claimed to have been abused by other men--an allegation that is very possibly truthful--would have substantially affected the jury's credibility assessment.  Indeed, it is possible that such testimony would have emphasized to the jury the lack of parental supervision in the household and made them more inclined to believe the testimony of the victim.  Furthermore, Pettiway has pointed to no place in the record, and has made no argument, to the effect that the allegations made by the victim were false.  Nor did he give any indication that he intended to discredit those allegations in court.  His current position appears to be that the mere mention of other allegations of abuse, without any evidence that those allegations were false, would sway the jury to the point of disregarding the entire testimony of the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that Pettiway was not foreclosed from challenging the victim's credibility, but was only prevented from pursuing questions pertinent to the DCYF report.  It is simply too large an inferential leap for this Court to conclude that the admission of this evidence could have had a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"  Brecht v. Abrahamson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 637, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Relative Strength of the properly admitted evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final factor in the Levasseur test requires us to examine the strength of the properly admitted evidence of guilt and determine whether \"the error substantially affected the jury.  Was the properly admitted evidence so strong that it overwhelmed the impact of the [error]?\"  Levasseur, 70 F.3d at 195.   We conclude that it was.  The evidence admitted at trial consisted of:  (1) the testimony of the victim;  (2) the testimony of two police officers that defendant made an oral confession;  and (3) defendant's written confession.  See Pettiway v. Vose, 921 F.Supp. at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The victim testified to eleven incidents of sexual molestation.  She detailed one incident during which Pettiway touched her breast and penetrated her vagina with his fingers, and she mentioned several other, more general allegations of molestation.  Id. Both detectives testified that Pettiway admitted to sexually touching and digitally penetrating the victim.  Id. In his written confession, Pettiway admitted to one act of touching the victim's breast and one act of penetrating her vagina, and stated that he touched her on three other occasions.  The important point for present purposes is the fact that the confessions and the victim's testimony all relate the same incidents of touching in detail--one touching of the breast and one act of vaginal penetration.  Beyond these two events, the testimony and the written confession are both vague.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court submitted five counts of sexual abuse to the jury, and the jury returned guilty verdicts on two.  Id. at 64.   Pettiway points out that the jury's verdict mirrors the victim's testimony and contends that the jury relied solely on this testimony and disregarded the allegedly coerced confession.  In light of this fact, the defendant's theory goes, an error limiting his ability to impeach the credibility of the victim cannot be harmless.  Appellee responds that the jury verdict mirrors the written confession and claims that it is this evidence that the jury found compelling.  As a result, appellee argues, the error is harmless because it relates only to the testimony of the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree that the verdict reflects a disregard for Pettiway's confession.  The written confession, the oral confession, and the testimony of the victim were substantially similar.  This collection of evidence from the two most reliable sources possible--the victim and the accused--is extremely persuasive and the error in this case is simply not consequential enough to undermine this evidence.  First, as pointed out above, there is serious doubt about the probative value of the evidence that Pettiway sought to introduce.  Second, even if some doubts about credibility could have been placed in the minds of the jury, the oral and written confessions cannot so easily be overcome.  They provide substantial corroboration of the victim's testimony and strong support for the verdict returned by the jury.  Despite the attempts of both parties to present the jury's deliberations as focusing on only one piece of evidence, we see no reason why this must be so.  The evidence, taken as a whole, is consistent and strongly supports the guilty verdicts.  Even if the victim's testimony had been called into question--an outcome that strikes us as unlikely--the oral and written confessions provide sufficient evidence of guilt and corroboration of the testimony to conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also feel compelled to address Pettiway's claim that the oral and written confessions were coerced.  This issue was specifically addressed by the state court.  The trial justice, after a detailed inquiry into the claim of coercion and after hearing evidence on the issue from both sides, wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not believe that this defendant asked for an attorney in that interrogation room.

[that] the statements attributable to the defendant were voluntarily [sic] and not of any coercion and that he was afforded all of his constitutional rights and he knowingly, intelligently, waived his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript I at 133-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a finding of fact by the state court is entitled to great deference.  See 28 U.S.C. 2254(d);  Tart v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572407\"><a href=\"/opinion/572407/wesley-p-tart-v-commonwealth-of-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 504 (1st Cir.1991);  Tavares v.

On habeas corpus review, we overturn such a finding of fact only if we \"conclude[ ] that such factual determination is not fairly supported by the record.\"  28 U.S.C. 2254(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find, upon our own review of the record, that we must adopt this finding of fact.  Pettiway claims that he was \"under a lot of pressure ... from the doctor\" because he had \"adult acne\" and was taking tetracycline, yet he failed to introduce any evidence that this medication would affect his judgment.  At trial, he admitted that he was told of his Miranda rights, and that he understood that he did not have to answer any questions.  Despite the fact that he understood these rights, he testified that he began to write the written confession only \"a couple of minutes\" after being advised of those rights.  With reference to the written confession, he stated that he \"wrote everything that they told [him] to write.\"   Trial Transcript I at 103.  Yet only a few pages later in the transcript, he states that he \"can't even be sure\" that he wrote the confession.  Id. at 106.   If the defendant was aware of his rights, why was it so easy for the detectives to coerce his confession?   How could it be that \"his will was completely overborne,\" Brief of Appellant at 4, when the entire interrogation lasted only one hour?   If he claimed to have been coerced into writing the confession, why did he then express doubt about having written it?   Upon review of the record, we conclude that there is ample support in the record for the findings of the trial court with respect to Pettiway's allegation of a coerced confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the Sixth Amendment violation was harmless error and we affirm the district court's dismissal of the habeas corpus petition.  The oral confession, the written confession, and the testimony of the victim amount to a powerful body of evidence.  We do not believe that the admission of allegations made by the victim about other incidents of abuse could have overcome this evidence.  The error did not have a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"  Brecht, 507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. at 1714.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither party mentioned in its brief or at oral argument the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L.No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1218, which amends the habeas corpus provisions of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.  We need not, however, attempt to navigate the amended statute in this case.  Using the pre-amendment habeas corpus requirements established by this Court, we find that defendant-appellant's request for relief must be denied.
