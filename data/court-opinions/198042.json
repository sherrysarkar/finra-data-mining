MARY ANN COHEN, CHIEF JUDGE]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Albert Newell on brief for appellants.\r\n Loretta C. Argrett, Assistant Attorney General, Tamara W.\r\nAshford and Teresa E. McLaughlin, Attorneys, Tax Division,\r\nDepartment of Justice, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 1, 1998\r\n\n         Per Curiam.  Essentially for the reasons stated by\r\nthe tax court in its order of dismissal for lack of\r\njurisdiction, appellants' petition properly was dismissed as\r\nuntimely under 26 U.S.C.  6213(a).  We are not persuaded by\r\nappellants' argument that the 1994 notice of deficiency was\r\nrescinded.\r\n         Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
