Claimant Natividad Mercado Ayala\r\nappeals from the judgment of the district court which\r\ndetermined that the decision of the Commissioner of Social\r\nSecurity that claimant was not under a disability was supported\r\nby substantial evidence.  After carefully reviewing the\r\nparties' briefs and the record, we affirm the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court for essentially the reasons stated in its\r\nJudgment, dated July 15, 1998.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1. \r\n\n                           -2-\n",
