Because  we find that\r\n\nappellant's claim for  injunctive relief became moot  when he\r\n\ngraduated, we now vacate  the judgment of the district  court\r\n\nand dismiss the appeal without reaching the merits.\r\n\n                         BACKGROUND \r                                     BACKGROUND \r\n\n          Appellant Thomas R.W. (Thomas) is a  fourteen-year-\r\n\nold, special education student who has ataxia telangiectasia,\r\n\na congenital, progressive  neurological disorder that results\r\n\nin  loss of mobility  control.  As a  student at the private,\r\n\nnon-sectarian  Greenfield Center  School since  kindergarten,\r\n\nThomas  had  received   physical,  occupational,  and  speech\r\n\ntherapy services  as part  of his  individual education  plan\r\n\n(IEP).   Appellees Massachusetts Department  of Education and\r\n\nMohawk  Trail Regional  School District, the  local education\r\n\nagency  (collectively  \"LEA\"),  provided  these  services  to\r\n\nThomas at the private Greenfield School.\r\n\n          Because  of  his   ongoing  physical  difficulties,\r\n\nThomas came to require the full-time help of an instructional\r\n\naide to  assist him in  the classroom.  Although  his parents\r\n\nand the LEA both agreed with the necessity  of an aide, their\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ndispute centered on whether the LEA would fund an aide at the\r\n\nprivate school.   The  parents wanted the  LEA to  provide an\r\n\naide  for Thomas  at the private  Greenfield School;  the LEA\r\n\noffered to pay for  an aide only at the  local public school,\r\n\nColrain.   Rejecting the IEP that  called for an aide  at the\r\n\npublic  school,  Thomas's   parents  (with  assistance   from\r\n\nGreenfield) assumed the cost of  an aide for on-site  special\r\n\neducation  services   at  the  private  school,   and  sought\r\n\ninjunctive relief against the LEA  in an appeal to the Bureau\r\n\nof Special Education Appeals (BSEA).\r\n\n          At  the hearing before the BSEA, Thomas argued that\r\n\nthe LEA was not only permitted to fund an aide at the private\r\n\nschool, but that  the IDEA required such  funding for on-site\r\n\nservices,  relying  on  Zobrest v.  Catalina  Foothills  Sch.\r                                                                         \r\n\nDist.,  509  U.S.   1  (1993)  (providing  a   sign  language\r                 \r\n\ninterpreter at parochial  school under IDEA does  not violate\r\n\nestablishment clause).  The LEA maintained that its statutory\r\n\nobligations  under the IDEA were fulfilled by offering Thomas\r\n\na  \"genuine  opportunity   for  equitable  participation\"  in\r\n\nspecial education  services available  at the public  school.\r\n\nThe BSEA hearing  officer ruled that the LEA  was not legally\r\n\nobligated  to fund  an  aide at  the  private school  because\r\n\nThomas's  IEP, which  made  an aide  available at  the public\r\n\nschool, provided  for  a free  appropriate  public  education\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n(FAPE), thereby satisfying the LEA's responsibility under the\r\n\nIDEA.\r\n\n          Thomas  sought review of  the BSEA decision  in the\r\n\ndistrict court (Neiman, U.S.M.J. presiding), which found that\r\n\nThomas's   parents   \"ha[d]  not   borne   their  burden   of\r\n\ndemonstrating  the central  element  of  their  case  --  the\r\n\ninappropriateness  of the  IEP.\"   The  district court  found\r\n\nthat, to establish  a claim under the IDEA,  a plaintiff must\r\n\nfirst   make   a   threshold  showing   that   the   IEP  was\r\n\ninappropriate.   An  IEP is  inappropriate  if it  denies the\r\n\nstudent a FAPE.   See School Comm. of Burlington v.  Dep't of\r                                                                         \r\n\nEduc., 471 U.S. 359, 374  (1985) (\"If a handicapped child has\r                 \r\n\navailable a free appropriate public education and the parents\r\n\nchoose to  place the child  in a private school  or facility,\r\n\nthe  public  agency is  not required  .  . .  to pay  for the\r\n\nchild's  education at the  private school or  facility.\"); 34\r\n\nC.F.R.   300.403  (1984).  In fact, the  BSEA hearing officer\r\n\nhad determined that  neither the appropriateness of  the IEP,\r\n\nnor the ability  and willingness of the LEA  to implement it,\r\n\nwas  in dispute.   Because  Thomas failed  to establish  this\r\n\nessential  element   of  his  claim  --  that   his  IEP  was\r\n\ninappropriate  -- the  magistrate judge  recommended granting\r\n\ndefendant LEA's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\n          Upon  de novo review,  the district  court (Ponsor,\r\n\nJ.),  adopted the  magistrate's recommendation,  holding that\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nThomas had failed to show as a matter of law that his IEP was\r\n\ninadequate to provide  him with a FAPE.   In entering summary\r\n\njudgment for the  LEA, the district court  prudently declined\r\n\nto address the constitutional issues regarding Zobrest raised\r                                                                  \r\n\nin dicta by the magistrate.  Thomas filed this appeal.   \r\n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We  review  a  district court's  grant  of  summary\r\n\njudgment de  novo, affirming only where there are no disputed\r\n\nissues of material  fact and the moving party  is entitled to\r\n\njudgment as a matter of law.

For a\r\n\ncase to be justiciable, \"an actual controversy  must exist at\r\n\nall stages of appellate . .  . review, and not simply at  the\r\n\ndate the  action is initiated.\"   Roe v.

A case becomes moot \"when  the issues presented\r\n\nare no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable\r\n\ninterest in  the outcome,  or alternatively,  when the  party\r\n\ninvoking  federal court jurisdiction no longer has a personal\r\n\nstake in the  outcome of the controversy.\"   Boston and Maine\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp. v.

Tribe, American Constitutional Law   3-11,  at 83\r\n\n(2d ed. 1988) (internal quotations omitted).  \r\n\n          Thomas's  graduation  from the  private  Greenfield\r\n\nSchool  last spring, and matriculation into the public Mohawk\r\n\nTrail Regional High  School this fall,  mooted the issue  for\r\n\nwhich  he sought  relief.   Since  his graduation,  Thomas no\r\n\nlonger  meets the  live case  or  controversy requirement  of\r\n\nArticle  III,     2.   In  the  absence  of  a  live case  or\r\n\ncontroversy,  this  case  is  moot  and  therefore,  we  lack\r\n\njurisdiction to rule on the merits of appellant's claim.     \r\n\n          The  rationale   for  the   mootness  doctrine   is\r\n\npredicated on  judicial  economy --  saving  the use  of  the\r\n\ncourt's scarce resources for the resolution of real disputes.\r\n\nTo  avoid the  relitigation of  an  otherwise moot  question,\r\n\nhowever,  the mootness doctrine countenances an exception for\r\n\nissues \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"  Roe, 410\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at  125.   To preserve a  case from mootness  under this\r\n\nexception,  two requirements must be met: \"(1) the challenged\r\n\naction was  in its duration  too short to be  fully litigated\r\n\nprior to  its cessation  or expiration, and  (2) there  was a\r\n\nreasonable expectation that the same complaining party  would\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nbe subjected to the same action again.\"  Pallazola v.

The possibility  that\r                    \r\n\nother parties may subsequently bring a similar claim does not\r\n\nsave a case  from mootness.  Lane v.

Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318 (1988), Thomas\r                                       \r\n\nhas  not demonstrated a  \"sufficient likelihood that  he will\r\n\nagain be wronged  in a similar way.\"  Id. at 323 (quoting Los\r                                                                         \r\n\nAngeles v.

There,  given  the  erratic  nature  of  plaintiff's\r\n\ndisability,  it was reasonably  expected that plaintiff would\r\n\nagain be  subjected to a   violation of the  IDEA for conduct\r\n\nrelated to his disability.   Id. at 319-20.  Thomas, however,\r                                            \r\n\nhas  not adduced  any evidence  to conclude  that there  is a\r\n\nreasonable  expectation  that   his  situation  will   recur.\r\n\nBecause  Thomas cannot reasonably be expected to re-enroll at\r\n\nthe Greenfield  School, nor has  he declared an  intention to\r\n\ntransfer to  a private high  school, this case does  not fall\r\n\nwithin an exception to the mootness doctrine. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Although  appellant concedes  that \"the  injunctive\r\n\nrelief  originally sought . . . is  now moot,\" he argues that\r\n\nhis claim for  reimbursement preserves the case.   If pled in\r\n\nthe  alternative or  otherwise evident  from  the record,  \"a\r\n\nclaim for damages  will keep a case from  becoming moot where\r\n\nequitable  relief  no  longer  forms  the  basis  of  a  live\r\n\ncontroversy.\"  Tribe, supra at 84.  A review of the record on\r                                       \r\n\nappeal,   however,  demonstrates   that   Thomas  failed   to\r\n\narticulate a claim for  damages in the district  court, where\r\n\nhe sought only injunctive and declaratory relief.  \r\n\n          Appellant's  scant two  paragraph argument  seeking\r\n\nreimbursement  -- first  raised in his  reply brief  -- falls\r\n\nshort of the requisite  timeliness and formulation  necessary\r\n\nto preserve  a claim for  damages.  Arguments raised  for the\r\n\nfirst time in a reply brief filed in this court come too late\r\n\nto be preserved on appeal.   Because \"an appellee is entitled\r\n\nto rely on the content of appellant's brief for  the scope of\r\n\nthe  issues  appealed,  an[]  appellant  generally  may   not\r\n\npreserve a claim  merely by referring to it in  a reply brief\r\n\nor at oral argument.\"   Pignons S.A. de Mecanique v.

Because  we find that\r\n\nappellant's claim for  injunctive relief became moot  when he\r\n\ngraduated, we now vacate  the judgment of the district  court\r\n\nand dismiss the appeal without reaching the merits.\r\n\n                         BACKGROUND \r                                     BACKGROUND \r\n\n          Appellant Thomas R.W. (Thomas) is a  fourteen-year-\r\n\nold, special education student who has ataxia telangiectasia,\r\n\na congenital, progressive  neurological disorder that results\r\n\nin  loss of mobility  control.  As a  student at the private,\r\n\nnon-sectarian  Greenfield Center  School since  kindergarten,\r\n\nThomas  had  received   physical,  occupational,  and  speech\r\n\ntherapy services  as part  of his  individual education  plan\r\n\n(IEP).   Appellees Massachusetts Department  of Education and\r\n\nMohawk  Trail Regional  School District, the  local education\r\n\nagency  (collectively  \"LEA\"),  provided  these  services  to\r\n\nThomas at the private Greenfield School.\r\n\n          Because  of  his   ongoing  physical  difficulties,\r\n\nThomas came to require the full-time help of an instructional\r\n\naide to  assist him in  the classroom.  Although  his parents\r\n\nand the LEA both agreed with the necessity  of an aide, their\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ndispute centered on whether the LEA would fund an aide at the\r\n\nprivate school.   The  parents wanted the  LEA to  provide an\r\n\naide  for Thomas  at the private  Greenfield School;  the LEA\r\n\noffered to pay for  an aide only at the  local public school,\r\n\nColrain.   Rejecting the IEP that  called for an aide  at the\r\n\npublic  school,  Thomas's   parents  (with  assistance   from\r\n\nGreenfield) assumed the cost of  an aide for on-site  special\r\n\neducation  services   at  the  private  school,   and  sought\r\n\ninjunctive relief against the LEA  in an appeal to the Bureau\r\n\nof Special Education Appeals (BSEA).\r\n\n          At  the hearing before the BSEA, Thomas argued that\r\n\nthe LEA was not only permitted to fund an aide at the private\r\n\nschool, but that  the IDEA required such  funding for on-site\r\n\nservices,  relying  on  Zobrest v.  Catalina  Foothills  Sch.\r                                                                         \r\n\nDist.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112887\"><a href=\"/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1993)  (providing  a   sign  language\r                 \r\n\ninterpreter at parochial  school under IDEA does  not violate\r\n\nestablishment clause).  The LEA maintained that its statutory\r\n\nobligations  under the IDEA were fulfilled by offering Thomas\r\n\na  \"genuine  opportunity   for  equitable  participation\"  in\r\n\nspecial education  services available  at the public  school.\r\n\nThe BSEA hearing  officer ruled that the LEA  was not legally\r\n\nobligated  to fund  an  aide at  the  private school  because\r\n\nThomas's  IEP, which  made  an aide  available at  the public\r\n\nschool, provided  for  a free  appropriate  public  education\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n(FAPE), thereby satisfying the LEA's responsibility under the\r\n\nIDEA.\r\n\n          Thomas  sought review of  the BSEA decision  in the\r\n\ndistrict court (Neiman, U.S.M.J. presiding), which found that\r\n\nThomas's   parents   \"ha[d]  not   borne   their  burden   of\r\n\ndemonstrating  the central  element  of  their  case  --  the\r\n\ninappropriateness  of the  IEP.\"   The  district court  found\r\n\nthat, to establish  a claim under the IDEA,  a plaintiff must\r\n\nfirst   make   a   threshold  showing   that   the   IEP  was\r\n\ninappropriate.   An  IEP is  inappropriate  if it  denies the\r\n\nstudent a FAPE.   See School Comm. of Burlington v.

In fact, the  BSEA hearing officer\r\n\nhad determined that  neither the appropriateness of  the IEP,\r\n\nnor the ability  and willingness of the LEA  to implement it,\r\n\nwas  in dispute.   Because  Thomas failed  to establish  this\r\n\nessential  element   of  his  claim  --  that   his  IEP  was\r\n\ninappropriate  -- the  magistrate judge  recommended granting\r\n\ndefendant LEA's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\n          Upon  de novo review,  the district  court (Ponsor,\r\n\nJ.),  adopted the  magistrate's recommendation,  holding that\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nThomas had failed to show as a matter of law that his IEP was\r\n\ninadequate to provide  him with a FAPE.

Thomas, however,\r                                            \r\n\nhas  not adduced  any evidence  to conclude  that there  is a\r\n\nreasonable  expectation  that   his  situation  will   recur.\r\n\nBecause  Thomas cannot reasonably be expected to re-enroll at\r\n\nthe Greenfield  School, nor has  he declared an  intention to\r\n\ntransfer to  a private high  school, this case does  not fall\r\n\nwithin an exception to the mootness doctrine. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Although  appellant concedes  that \"the  injunctive\r\n\nrelief  originally sought . . . is  now moot,\" he argues that\r\n\nhis claim for  reimbursement preserves the case.

A review of the record on\r                                       \r\n\nappeal,   however,  demonstrates   that   Thomas  failed   to\r\n\narticulate a claim for  damages in the district  court, where\r\n\nhe sought only injunctive and declaratory relief.  \r\n\n          Appellant's  scant two  paragraph argument  seeking\r\n\nreimbursement  -- first  raised in his  reply brief  -- falls\r\n\nshort of the requisite  timeliness and formulation  necessary\r\n\nto preserve  a claim for  damages.
