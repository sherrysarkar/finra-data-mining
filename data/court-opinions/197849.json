Pierce and\r\nCancio, Nadal, Rivera &amp; Daz, were on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n               March 17, 1998\r\n                                          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Israel Ganapolsky (\"Ganapolsky\"), a\r\nmedical doctor from Puerto Rico, filed this action against his\r\ninsurer, Boston Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"Boston Mutual\"),\r\nto recover under an accidental death and dismemberment policy for\r\nthe partial amputation of his left foot.  Boston Mutual had\r\ndenied Ganapolsky's claim for the loss.  On a stipulated record,\r\nthe district court entered judgment in favor of Boston Mutual,\r\nand Ganapolsky appeals.  We affirm.\r\nThe following facts are essentially undisputed.  On June 5, 1992,\r\nwhile in New York City, Ganapolsky accidentally injured his left\r\nfoot when he tripped on a two-inch step at the entrance to the\r\nmen's room of a theater.  The next day, Ganapolsky continued with\r\nhis planned trips to Turkey and Israel, but was forced to cut his\r\ntravel short and return to Puerto Rico after approximately two\r\nweeks due to increasing problems with his foot.  At the hospital\r\nin Puerto Rico where he was admitted, Ganapolsky was diagnosed\r\nwith gangrene in his left foot and a below-the-knee amputation\r\nwas recommended.  In addition, for the first time, it was\r\ndiscovered that Ganapolsky had diabetes.  Ganapolsky travelled to\r\nUnion Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland to seek treatment\r\nfor his foot.  There, his doctor performed a \"Chopart\"\r\namputation, which, as the district court aptly observed, \"can\r\nbest be visualized as a cut going from the point on top of the\r\nfoot approximately where a man's shoelace is knotted down to the\r\nbottom of the foot, leaving the heel.\"  Ganapolsky v. Boston Mut.\r\nLife Ins. Co., Civ. No. 94-2229, slip op. at 2 (D.P.R. July 3,\r\n1996).\r\n\nThereafter, Ganapolsky filed a claim with Boston Mutual for\r\nbenefits under a group accidental death and dismemberment policy\r\n(the \"policy\") for the Chopart amputation of his left foot. \r\nBoston Mutual denied the claim for the following reasons:  first,\r\nthe policy required that the loss of a foot be a complete\r\nseverance through or above the ankle joint, and Ganapolsky's\r\namputation was not one through or above the ankle joint; and\r\nsecond, the policy excludes loss resulting from sickness, disease\r\nor bodily infirmity, and in the instant case, diabetes and\r\ndiabetic neuropathy were instrumental causes of the eventual\r\namputation.\r\nWe review a district court's factual determinations for clear\r\nerror, see Sullivan v. Young Bros. &amp; Co., Inc., 91 F.3d 242, 246-\r\n47 (1st Cir. 1996), and its legal determinations de novo, seeBercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 147 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).  The insurance policy at issue provides in relevant part:\r\nWe agree to pay benefits for loss from bodily injuries:\r\n\n  a) caused by an accident which happens while an insured\r\n     is covered by this policy; and\r\n\n  b) which, directly and from no other causes, result in a\r\n     covered loss.\r\n\n(Emphasis added.)  The policy also excludes coverage for \"loss\r\nresulting from . . . [s]ickness, disease or bodily infirmity.\" \r\nBoston Mutual argues that this policy exclusion applies to the\r\ninstant case, and thus, that it properly denied coverage.  We\r\nagree.  The trial judge concluded that the amputation did not\r\ncome from the foot injury within the meaning of the policy\r\nlanguage of 'directly and from no other causes.'\"\r\nIn this action based on diversity jurisdiction, the substantive\r\nlaw of Puerto Rico governs.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304\r\nU.S. 64 (1938).  Under Puerto Rico law, an exclusion clause in an\r\ninsurance contract is strictly construed and any ambiguity is\r\nresolved in favor of the insured.  See Pagn Caraballo v. Silva\r\nDelgado, 122 P.R. Dec. 105, 110-11 (1988).  However, where the\r\nlanguage of the exclusion unambiguously supports the insurer, the\r\ncourt need not strain to find a construction favoring the\r\ninsured.  See Marn v. American Int'l Ins. Co. of P.R., 137 P.R.\r\nDec.   , 94 J.T.S. 132 (Oct. 28, 1994).\r\nUnder the policy, as we previously noted, covered losses are only\r\nthose resulting directly from accidents and \"from no other\r\ncauses.\"  The exclusion clause specifically bars coverage for\r\nlosses resulting from sickness, disease or bodily infirmity. \r\nAccording to Couch on Insurance 2d  41:74, at 112 (Rev. ed.\r\n1982),\r\nIf a disease or bodily condition exists and an accident\r\noccurs, . . . it is sufficient if the accidental means\r\nwould have solely caused some considerable injury had\r\nthe disease or bodily condition not existed.  But if no\r\nconsiderable injury at all would have resulted had the\r\ninsured not been afflicted with the existing disease or\r\ncondition, the accidental means are not the sole cause\r\nof the injury.\r\n\nId.  Here, we find that the worst possible injury Ganapolsky\r\nwould have sustained from the accident, if he had not been a\r\ndiabetic, was a fracture and dislocation of the foot.  However,\r\nbecause of his disease, Ganapolsky's initial trauma to the foot\r\nprogressed to gangrene, requiring the Chopart amputation of his\r\nfoot.  The record reflects that gangrene in the lower extremities\r\nis one hundred times more common in diabetics than in non-\r\ndiabetics.  Ganapolsky cannot escape the fact that his diabetes\r\nsubstantially contributed to his loss.\r\nAs the district court observed, Ganapolsky's argument that \"but\r\nfor\" the accident, he would not have suffered the loss of his\r\nfoot is unconvincing because, if that were the rule, \"there could\r\nnever be a causal contribution to injury by preexisting\r\ndiseases.\"  Ganapolsky, Civ. No. 94-2229, slip op. at 3.  We\r\napply instead Puerto Rico's concept of adequate causation. \r\n\"Under Puerto Rico law, the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico, 26\r\nL.P.R.A.  101, et seq., controls the interpretation of\r\ninsurance contracts.\"  Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co.,\r\n964 F.2d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1992).  However, since the Insurance\r\nCode fails to provide a causation test, we turn to the Civil Code\r\nfor guidance.  See id. (observing that when Insurance Code fails\r\nto provide an interpretative approach for particular situation,\r\nCivil Code supplements it).  Under the Civil Code, the concept of\r\nadequate causation is applicable to Puerto Rico tort law.  SeeSoto Cabral v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 138 P.R. Dec.   , 95\r\nJ.T.S. 49 (April 21, 1995).  A condition is an adequate cause if\r\nit ordinarily can be expected to produce the result at issue. \r\nSee id.  Ganapolsky's accident was not an adequate cause of his\r\ngangrene, since such an infection normally does not arise from\r\ntripping on a step.\r\nFor the first time on appeal, Ganapolsky contends that the\r\nexception to the sickness, disease or bodily infirmity exclusion\r\napplies.  That exception states that \"[b]acterial infection\r\nresulting from an accidental cut or wound . . . are not\r\nexcluded.\"  Ganapolsky's argument is that the general exclusion\r\ndid not apply because of the exception to it for bacterial\r\ninfections; his accident, he says, caused a bacterial infection\r\nwhich caused the gangrene, which led to the amputation.  However,\r\n\"[i]f any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that,\r\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not\r\nraised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the\r\nfirst time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Local No. 59 v. Superline\r\nTransp. Co., Inc., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).  Therefore,\r\nwe decline to address this argument.\r\nIn addition, having found that Ganapolsky's loss is not covered\r\nunder the terms of the insurance contract, we need not discuss\r\nwhether the Chopart amputation of his foot constituted a loss\r\nunder the policy. \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's opinion\r\nand judgment is affirmed.\r\nCosts to be assessed against appellant.\r\n",
