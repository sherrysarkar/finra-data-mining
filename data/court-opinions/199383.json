After resigning because of his\n\nemployer's failure to accommodate his back condition, Lutgardo Acevedo\n\nLópez sued the Police Department of Puerto Rico, alleging disability\n\ndiscrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 12101-12771, and Puerto Rico law, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1541.\n\nSpecifically, Acevedo sued under Title I of the ADA, which authorizes\n\nmoney damages for illegal employment actions.1 The statute prohibits\n\ndiscrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities who can\n\nperform the essential functions of a job, with or without reasonable\n\naccommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).

Supp. 2d at 297. We affirm the district court's\n\nsummary judgment ruling on a different ground -- Puerto Rico's Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity from suit for money damages under the ADA.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Acevedo López commenced service in the Puerto Rico police\n\ndepartment in April 1993. In October 1994, Acevedo hurt his back while\n\nmaking an arrest, which resulted in a diagnosis of spondylolysis, a\n\ncondition causing pain, inflammation, spasms and stiffness in the lower\n\nback. Although he was treated for his injury and returned to work, he\n\nrelapsed in 1997 and sought medical treatment. Acevedo stopped working\n\nfrom November 13, 1997 to June 10, 1998, when a state insurance fund\n\nphysician found him to be in good condition once again.\n\n          When Acevedo reported back to work, he notified the police\n\ndepartment that his disability prevented him from traveling long\n\ndistances by car. Acevedo requested transfer to a precinct closer to\n\nhis home near Moca (a similar reassignment request had been granted in\n\n1994). Nonetheless, the police department assigned Acevedo to Arecibo,\n\nwhich is about one hour by car from his home. Because Acevedo felt he\n\ncould not make this commute without discomfort, he submitted his\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fresignation on June 12, 1998. Six months after Acevedo's resignation,\n\nthe state insurance fund issued a certificate stating that Acevedo\n\nshould avoid long trips due to his back condition.      He filed this\n\nlawsuit on March 26, 1999.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Eleventh Amendment immunity can be raised at any time because\n\nof its jurisdictional implications. See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp.\n\nv. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99 n.8 (1984). In the appeal to this court,\n\nthe Police Department of Puerto Rico raised the Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity issue for the first time. See U.S. Const. Amend. XI. The\n\npolice department is an entity of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n\"Puerto Rico, despite the lack of formal statehood, enjoys the shelter\n\nof the Eleventh Amendment in all respects.\" Ramírez v. Puerto Rico\n\nFire Service, 715 F. 2d 694, 697 (1st Cir. 1983); see also Figueroa-\n\nRodriguez v. Aquino, 863 F.2d 1037, 1044 (1st Cir. 1988). Recognizing\n\nthat the issue of whether a state could be sued by an individual for\n\ndamages under the ADA was before the Supreme Court, we issued an order\n\non December 18, 2000, following oral arguments, staying the case until\n\na decision was rendered.\n\n          The Supreme Court decided University of Alabama Board of\n\nTrustees v. Garrett, 121 S.Ct. 955 (2001), on February 21, 2001,\n\nholding that suits in federal court by state employees to recover money\n\ndamages for a state's non-compliance with Title I of the ADA are barred\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fby the Eleventh Amendment. It reached this conclusion by invalidating\n\nthe abrogation of the states' immunity by Congress pursuant to § 5 of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.     See id. at 967-68.\n\n          In the wake of Garrett, we directed the parties to submit\n\nsupplemental briefs assessing its impact on this case. The police\n\ndepartment asserts that the Supreme Court's ruling bars \"[p]laintiff-\n\nappellant's claim that the Puerto Rico Police Department did not\n\naccommodate his alleged disability\" under Title I of the ADA and that\n\nthe district court's dismissal of the suit must be affirmed. Acevedo\n\nargues that his suit survives because, based on the Commonwealth's own\n\ndisability discrimination law, Law 44, Puerto Rico has waived its\n\nimmunity from suit under the ADA.\n\n          \"The Court has held that, absent waiver by the State or valid\n\ncongressional override, the Eleventh Amendment bars a damages action\n\nagainst a State in federal court.\" Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159,\n\n169 (1985). The test for finding that a state has waived its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity is a stringent one. See Atascadero State Hosp. v.\n\nScanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241 (1985). A state's consent to suit in the\n\nfederal courts must be \"unequivocally expressed.\" Pennhurst, 465 U.S.\n\nat 99. It must be \"stated by the most express language or by such\n\noverwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any\n\nother reasonable construction.\" Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673\n\n(1974) (quotations omitted).     Furthermore, \"in order for a state\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fstatute or constitutional provision to constitute a waiver of Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity, it must specify the state's intention to subject\n\nitself to suit in federal court.\"      Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 241.\n\n          Given these rigid requirements, we are not remotely persuaded\n\nthat Law 44 of Puerto Rico, codified at 1 P.R. Laws Ann. § 501, et.\n\nseq., constitutes a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit\n\nunder the ADA.     While the Commonwealth prohibits employment\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in a similar fashion as the\n\nADA, there is no specific language indicating that Puerto Rico intends\n\nto make itself subject to damages suits in federal court for\n\ndisability-based employment discrimination. Because Congress did not\n\nhave valid authority to abrogate the states' immunity and because\n\nPuerto Rico has not waived its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity,\n\nthe Title I ADA claim for employment discrimination against the Police\n\nDepartment of Puerto Rico cannot survive.\n\n                                III.\n\n          This suit included actions against three officers of the\n\nPuerto Rico Police Department in their personal, as well as official,\n\ncapacities. However, the basis for this personal capacity claim was\n\nnever articulated in the plaintiff's briefs, at oral argument, or in\n\nhis supplemental brief filed after Garrett. Because this personal\n\ncapacity claim is completely undeveloped, we will not consider it. See\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.\") We simply note that we\n\nhave not resolved the question of whether personal capacity suits can\n\nbe sustained under the ADA. However, several other circuit courts and\n\nthree district courts within this circuit have held \"that individuals\n\nare not subject to suit under [] the ADA.\" See Quiron v. L.N. Violette\n\nCo., Inc., 897 F. Supp. 18, 19 (D. Me. 1995); Vicenty Martell v. Estado\n\nLibre Asociado de P.R., 48 F. Supp. 2d 81, 87 (D.P.R. 1999); Miller v.\n\nCBC Companies, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 1054, 1065 (D.N.H. 1995); see also\n\nButler v. City of Prairie Village, 172 F.3d 736, 744 (10th Cir. 1999);\n\nEEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, 55 F.3d 1276, 1282 (7th Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment and its dismissal of Acevedo's ADA claim against\n\nthe Police Department of Puerto Rico.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

Because Congress did not\n\nhave valid authority to abrogate the states' immunity and because\n\nPuerto Rico has not waived its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity,\n\nthe Title I ADA claim for employment discrimination against the Police\n\nDepartment of Puerto Rico cannot survive.\n\n                                III.\n\n          This suit included actions against three officers of the\n\nPuerto Rico Police Department in their personal, as well as official,\n\ncapacities. However, the basis for this personal capacity claim was\n\nnever articulated in the plaintiff's briefs, at oral argument, or in\n\nhis supplemental brief filed after Garrett. Because this personal\n\ncapacity claim is completely undeveloped, we will not consider it. See\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.\") We simply note that we\n\nhave not resolved the question of whether personal capacity suits can\n\nbe sustained under the ADA.
