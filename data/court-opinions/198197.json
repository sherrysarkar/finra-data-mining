Graham, Jr., by appointment of the Court, with whom\r\nGraham &amp; Graham was on brief, for appellant.\r\nAriane D. Vuono, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n              November 6, 1998\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Jess Paredes-Rodrguez was\r\nconvicted on charges that he conspired to possess cocaine with\r\nintent to distribute, and that he carried a firearm in connection\r\nwith drug trafficking.  He was sentenced to 121 months in prison\r\nand five years of supervised release.  He now appeals his\r\nconviction, claiming that the jury instructions were misleading,\r\nthat the indictment was constructively amended by evidence that\r\nalso constituted a prejudicial variance from the conduct charged in\r\nthe indictment, and that two police officers were erroneously\r\npermitted to testify.  We affirm his conviction.\r\nI.  Background\r\nOn an appeal from a criminal conviction, we view the\r\nfacts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United\r\nStates v. Shea, 150 F.3d 44, 46 (1st Cir. 1998).  On the evening of\r\nNovember 15, 1994, defendant-appellant Jess Paredes-Rodrguez was\r\ndriving a car down Merwin Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.  He\r\nwas accompanied by Carlos Antigua-Herrera, who was sitting on the\r\nfront passenger seat.  The car was stopped by state law enforcement\r\nofficers assigned to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's Western\r\nMassachusetts Task Force, and both driver and passenger were\r\narrested.  During the arrest, Paredes attempted to draw a loaded\r\n.38 caliber semi-automatic pistol from his pockets, but was\r\nforcibly restrained from doing so.  The officers searched the car,\r\nand found 119 grams of crack cocaine under the passenger's seat.\r\nThe arrest was not random.  An undercover state police\r\nofficer, Trooper Juan Coln, had negotiated for delivery of cocaine\r\non three previous occasions with the main target of the\r\ninvestigation, a certain Jos Reyes, also known as Rafi.  On\r\nOctober 12, October 18, and November 2, 1994, Rafi delivered crack\r\ncocaine to Coln at the same location on Merwin Street where\r\nParedes was later arrested.  During the first transaction, on\r\nOctober 12, Rafi brought the crack by himself and then sold it to\r\nColn.  On October 18, Rafi arrived alone without the crack, but a\r\nfew moments later, an individual known as Flaco arrived carrying\r\nthe cocaine that Rafi then sold to Coln.  On November 2, Rafi\r\nagain arrived alone and without the cocaine, entered Coln's car,\r\nand sat down on the front passenger seat.  Soon afterwards, the\r\nappellant in this case, Paredes, walked by and handed Rafi through\r\nthe car's open window a one-ounce package of crack cocaine that\r\nRafi then sold to Coln for $750.\r\nParedes' arrest followed the fourth transaction between\r\nRafi and Coln.  On November 14, Rafi agreed to sell Coln four\r\nounces of crack cocaine for $3,000.  The following day, Rafi told\r\nColn that at approximately 7:15 p.m., two people in a black\r\nOldsmobile would arrive at the same location on Merwin street to\r\ndeliver the crack.  It was precisely 7:15 p.m. when Paredes and\r\nAntigua arrived at the designated location in their car, carrying\r\n119 grams (approximately 4.2 ounces) of crack cocaine.\r\nAfter his arrest, Paredes waived his Miranda rights, seeMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), admitted that he was\r\ndelivering cocaine, and then led the arresting officers to the\r\nbuilding where Rafi had given him the crack cocaine.  However,\r\nParedes subsequently retracted his confession and denied having\r\ntaken part in or even having had knowledge of the drug transaction. \r\nHe explained that he showed the police where Rafi lived merely\r\nbecause he was trying to be helpful.  He also simultaneously\r\nasserted, inconsistently, that he had no knowledge of the cocaine\r\nthat was found in his car, and that the cocaine belonged to Rafi. \r\nParedes further stated that Rafi had given him the gun, and told\r\nhim to deliver the gun and the car to a friend who would be waiting\r\nfor him on Merwin Street.  He admitted, however, that he had\r\noriginally told the police that he found the gun under some leaves.\r\nParedes' trial before the U.S. District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts began on November 4, 1996, and continued\r\nuntil November 12.  On that date, the jury returned a verdict\r\nfinding Paredes guilty on all three counts of the indictment.  On\r\nFebruary 24, 1997, Paredes was sentenced as described above. \r\nJudgment was entered on February 25, and Paredes filed a notice of\r\nappeal on April 19, 1997.\r\nII.  Analysis\r\nA.  Jury Instructions\r\nIf objections to the jury instructions have been properly\r\npreserved, we review the trial judge's choice of wording in the\r\ninstructions only for abuse of discretion.  See United States v.\r\nSmith, 145 F.3d 458, 460 (1st Cir. 1998).  In order to determine\r\nwhether or not the court abused its discretion, we first \"'must\r\nlook at the instructions in light of the evidence and determine\r\nwhether they fairly and adequately submit the issues in the case to\r\nthe jury.'\"  Id. (quoting United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800,\r\n809 (1st Cir. 1996)).  Even if we find the instructions erroneous,\r\nany such errors that are not of constitutional magnitude are\r\nreviewed for harmlessness.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a); Koonce v.\r\nPepe, 99 F.3d 469, 473 (1st Cir. 1996).   Pursuant to harmless\r\nerror review, \"[t]he only question for us is whether the ailing\r\ninstruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the\r\nresulting conviction violates due process.\"  Id. (quoting Estellev. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72 (1991)).  Accordingly, \"[w]e must\r\naddress the instruction 'in the context of the instructions as a\r\nwhole and the trial record,' and 'inquire whether there is a\r\nreasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged\r\ninstruction in a way that violates the [constitutional right to due\r\nprocess.]'\"  Koonce, 99 F.3d at 473 (quoting Estelle, 502 U.S. at\r\n72) (other citations omitted).\r\nAs noted earlier, Paredes was indicted on three counts:\r\nconspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, possession\r\nof cocaine with intent to distribute, and carrying a firearm in\r\nconnection with a drug-trafficking crime.  Although he acknowledges\r\nthat there was other evidence that could support his conviction on\r\nthe conspiracy count, Paredes contends that the possession count\r\nwas the cornerstone of the indictment because evidence that he was\r\nin possession of the cocaine was the strongest evidence for a\r\nconviction on the conspiracy and weapons counts.  \r\nParedes claims that, since the cocaine was found in a\r\nplastic bag beneath a towel underneath the front passenger seat,\r\nsome distance from the reach of his outstretched hand, he could not\r\nbe said to be in actual possession of the cocaine.  In order to\r\nconvict him on the possession count, he claims, the jury had to\r\nfind that he was in constructive possession of the cocaine. \r\nHowever, Paredes objects to the court's wording of the instruction\r\non constructive possession, specifically challenging the omission \r\nof any explicit mention of an intent requirement.  He cites the\r\nrelevant portion of the court's instructions:  \"If an individual\r\nhas the ability to exercise substantial control over an object that\r\nhe does not have in his physical custody, then he is in possession\r\nof that item.\"  He further contends that the subsequent instruction\r\nthat possession must be knowing in order to be criminal does not\r\ncure the effect of the omission of an intent requirement, because\r\nit allegedly permits conviction of a person who knows that an item\r\nin proximity to him contains cocaine, even though that person does\r\nnot intend to exercise control over the item.  \r\nAssuming for the sake of argument that Paredes is correct\r\nthat the evidence did not permit a finding that he was in actualpossession of the cocaine, the first question before us is whether\r\nthe district court's instructions to the jury, taken as a whole,\r\ncorrectly conveyed the law as to constructive possession.  Paredes\r\nis correct in asserting that intent is an element of constructive\r\npossession, which \"exists when a person 'knowingly has the power\r\nand intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over\r\nan object, either directly or through others.'\"  United States v.\r\nTorres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 102 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United\r\nStates v. Garca, 983 F.2d 1160, 1164 (1st Cir. 1993)).  Upon\r\nexamining the instructions as a whole, however, we find that,\r\nnotwithstanding the absence of a explicit mention of an intent\r\nrequirement, the same is implicit in the instructions.  \r\nAlthough the omission of an explicit reference to intent\r\nis a less than ideal way of explaining constructive possession to\r\na jury, the other instructions given by the court helped\r\nsubstantially to prevent the prejudice adverted to by Paredes.  For\r\nexample, the court also instructed:\r\nThe possession of a controlled substance\r\ncannot be found solely on the basis that\r\nthe defendant was near or close to the\r\ncontrolled substance.  Nor can it be found\r\nsimply because the defendant was present\r\nat a scene where controlled substances\r\nwere involved, or solely because the\r\ndefendant associated with a person who\r\ncontrolled the substance where it was\r\nfound.\r\n\nThis instruction, in combination with certain illustrative examples\r\nof constructive possession given by the court and subsequent\r\ninstructions on the intent-to-distribute aspect of the crime\r\ncharged, effectively conveyed the notion that the jury had to find\r\nthat Paredes' possession of the cocaine was knowing and\r\nintentional.  As a prior panel of this court stated, \r\n[the appellant's argument] ignores the\r\nnature of the crime with which he was\r\ncharged.  In directing his entire argument\r\nat alleged error in the definition of\r\n'possession,' the defendant forgets that\r\nhe was charged not with simple possession,\r\nbut possession with intent to distribute.\r\n. . . [His] argument is that the jury\r\nfound he possessed [certain containers]\r\nwithout knowing they contained cocaine,\r\nbut went on to find that he intended to\r\ndistribute the cocaine that was in them. \r\nNo reasonable jury could make such a\r\nfinding.\r\n\nUnited States v. Hallock, 941 F.2d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nSimilarly, in the case before us, it simply makes no sense to\r\nassert that the same jury that found that Paredes intended to\r\ndistribute the cocaine could have simultaneously found that he did\r\nnot intend to possess it.\r\nB.  The Indictment\r\nParedes raises two separate but related claims regarding\r\nthe indictment.  One is his claim that the charges were\r\nconstructively and improperly amended by the admission of evidence\r\nthat he delivered cocaine to Rafi on November 2, because that\r\nevidence allowed the jury to convict him of a conspiracy that was\r\nnot charged in the indictment.  The other is his argument that\r\nthere was a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof\r\noffered by the government at trial.  Reviewing both contentions for\r\nplain error, we find them without merit.\r\nWhen an amendment of the indictment occurs in the middle\r\nof trial, it is considered per se prejudicial for a number of\r\nreasons:  \"to preserve the right of the person accused of an\r\ninfamous crime to have a grand jury vote on the indictment, to\r\nprevent reprosecution for the same offense, and to protect the\r\nright of the accused to be informed of all charges,\" so as to be\r\nable to adequately prepare his defense.  United States v. Vavlitis,\r\n9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir. 1993).  A constructive amendment of the\r\nindictment \"occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\r\naltered, . . . in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand\r\njury has last passed upon them.\"  United States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d\r\n30, 35 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting Gaither v. United States, 413 F.2d\r\n1061, 1071-72 (D.C. Cir. 1969)); see also Vavlitis, 9 F.3d at 210. \r\nFor example, an indictment is constructively amended by \"a jury\r\ninstruction which modifies the offense charged in the indictment,\r\n. . . or the admission of evidence of an offense not charged by the\r\ngrand jury.\"  Dunn, 758 F.2d at 35. \r\nNotwithstanding Paredes' contentions, the admission of\r\nevidence of the November 2 delivery did not constructively amend\r\nthe indictment.  The conspiracy count charged Paredes with\r\nparticipating in a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to\r\ndistribute \"on or around November 15, 1995.\"  During trial, the\r\ngovernment introduced evidence that Coln purchased cocaine from\r\nRafi on three occasions prior to the November 15 transaction, and\r\nthat Paredes acted as Rafi's courier on one of those occasions.\r\nThe problem with Paredes' argument is that it is based on\r\na misconception of the scope of the conspiracy charged in the\r\nindictment.  He does not question that the indictment charged him\r\nwith conspiring with Rafi and others to possess and sell cocaine. \r\nHe does argue, however, that because the indictment refers to a\r\nconspiracy \"on or about November 15,\" the conspiracy charge is\r\nnecessarily limited to the events that occurred on November 15, and\r\ntherefore, that the evidence as to the other transactions is\r\nevidence of other, uncharged conspiracies.  Unfortunately for his\r\nargument, this circuit has previously held that \"the setting forth,\r\nin approximate form, of [a] date on in the indictment does not\r\npreclude the admission of evidence relating to events which\r\noccurred earlier.\"  United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 461 n.12\r\n(1st Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Bello-Prez, 977 F.2d\r\n664, 669 n.4 (1st Cir. 1992).  The evidence as to the earlier\r\ntransactions is certainly relevant to the November 15 transaction,\r\nbecause it provides an explanation of his presence on Merwin Street\r\non the day of his arrest.  Furthermore, any potential prejudice was\r\nprevented by the district court's careful instruction to the jury -\r\nwhich we have no reason to fear was ignored by the jury - that the\r\ndefendant was on trial only for the events of November 15, and none\r\nother.\r\nThe argument with regard to the alleged variance in proof\r\nis quite similar to the constructive amendment argument.  \"A\r\nvariance occurs when the proof differs from the allegations in the\r\nindictment.\"  Vavlitis, 9 F.3d at 210.  However, \"[a] variance is\r\nmaterial and reversible only if it has affected the defendant's\r\nsubstantial rights . . . to be informed of the charges and to\r\nprevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\"  Id.  Paredes\r\nclaims that the evidence introduced at trial regarding the\r\nNovember 2 transaction created a prejudicial variance between the\r\nproof and the indictment.  As noted above, however, the reference\r\nto approximate dates in an indictment is not binding and thus the\r\nscope of the indictment may cover prior events.  See Fisher, 3 F.3d\r\nat 461 n.12.  Accordingly, the evidence as to the prior\r\ntransactions between Rafi and Coln, and Paredes' participation in\r\none of those transactions is not materially different from the\r\nconduct charged in the indictment.\r\nMoreover, even assuming that the evidence of prior\r\ntransactions was sufficiently different from the acts charged in\r\nthe indictment to constitute a variance, the evidence did not\r\nprejudice Paredes' substantial rights.  He was certainly able to\r\nprepare an adequate defense, since he was on notice that the\r\ngovernment would seek to introduce such evidence.  Additionally,\r\nany danger that Paredes could be convicted on the basis of the\r\nevidence of the November 2 transaction was sufficiently mitigated\r\nby the court's instruction to the jury that the evidence as to the\r\nearlier transactions should be considered only as evidence that\r\nmight be probative of his participation in a conspiracy on\r\nNovember 15, and not as proof of his participation in an earlier\r\nconspiracy.\r\nC.  Evidentiary Rulings\r\nParedes objects to the trial court's admission of Coln's\r\ntestimony as to statements made by Rafi in his presence during\r\ntheir negotiations for the November 15 transaction.  He also\r\nobjects to the admission of the testimony of the law enforcement\r\nofficer in charge of the investigation as to what was said to him\r\nby two other officers.  Neither objection is well-founded.\r\nUnder Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), a defendant's\r\ncoconspirator's statements are admissible if the prosecution proves\r\nto the trial judge by a preponderance of the evidence that there\r\nwas a conspiracy, that the defendant was part of the conspiracy,\r\nand that the statements were made by the coconspirator during the\r\ncourse and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See Bourjaily v.\r\nUnited States, 483 U.S. 171, 176 (1987); see also United States v.\r\nPetrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977) (explaining that\r\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 104(a), trial judge rather than jury has duty\r\nto hear evidence and determine admissibility of coconspirator\r\nstatements).  Moreover, after some debate among the circuit courts\r\nof appeals, see, e.g., Petrozziello, 548 F.2d at 23 n.2, the\r\nSupreme Court declared that trial courts may consider any non-\r\nprivileged evidence, regardless of its admissibility, in making\r\nRule 801(d)(2)(E) determinations, see Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 178-79\r\n(harmonizing Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) procedures and Rule 801(d)(2)(E)\r\ndeterminations).\r\nThus, for example, in determining whether or not to\r\npermit the introduction of evidence as to the statements of an\r\nalleged coconspirator, the trial judge may consider hearsay\r\nevidence, including the very coconspirator statement whose\r\nintroduction is being sought.  As the Court explained, \"there is\r\nlittle doubt that a coconspirator's statements could themselves be\r\nprobative of the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of\r\nboth the defendant and the declarant in the conspiracy.\"  Id. at\r\n180.\r\nIn the case before us, the district court conducted a\r\nPetrozziello hearing during which he reviewed the available\r\nevidence, including but not limited to Coln's testimony as to what\r\nRafi had stated.  The court concluded that the government had\r\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence that there had been\r\na conspiracy, that Paredes and Rafi had been part of the\r\nconspiracy, and that Rafi's statements were made during and in\r\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.  In making its determination, the\r\ncourt emphasized Coln's testimony that Paredes handed Rafi the\r\ncrack cocaine during the November 2 transaction, and the fact that\r\nParedes was arrested while in possession of four ounces of crack\r\ncocaine at the time and place Rafi had said his courier would\r\ndeliver four ounces of crack cocaine.  Viewing this evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the guilty verdict, we discern no error in\r\nthe district court's determination.\r\nParedes' response is to raise, once more, the argument\r\nthat the conspiracy charged did not include the prior transactions,\r\nbut only the November 15 transaction, and thus, that Rafi's\r\nstatements were made in the course of a prior conspiracy, and not\r\nthe one at issue.  This is an argument we have considered and\r\nrejected above, and thus we merely repeat that the scope of the\r\nconspiracy charged in the indictment is broad enough to cover the\r\nearlier transactions between Rafi and Coln.\r\nParedes also argues that the court erred in deciding to\r\npermit Sgt. Neil Maloney, the agent in charge of the investigation,\r\nto testify as to what other officers told him during the course of\r\nthe investigation.  Maloney testified that officers under his\r\ncommand told him that they saw someone leave Paredes' residence on\r\nTilton Street in a brown Toyota, proceed to Belmont Street, where\r\nboth driver and passenger exchanged the Toyota for a dark Buick,\r\nand then proceed Merwin Street driving the same Buick.  Paredes\r\nobjected to this testimony on hearsay grounds, but the judge\r\noverruled the objection, stating that he would allow the testimony\r\nfor the limited purpose of explaining how the surveillance reports\r\nprompted Maloney to take subsequent action, rather than to\r\nestablish the truth of the reports.  Given that the Federal Rules\r\nof Evidence define hearsay as \"a statement, other than one made by\r\nthe declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\r\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\" Fed. R. Evid.\r\n801(c), the court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion.  Most\r\nimportantly, any error would have been harmless, because Maloney's\r\ntestimony as to the car switch was of only tangential importance to\r\nthe ultimate issue of whether Paredes committed the acts he was\r\ncharged with.\r\nFinally, Paredes objects to the district court's decision\r\nto permit Maloney to testify as to Coln's out-of-court\r\nidentification of Paredes, as well as the comments that Coln made\r\nat the time.  Based on a photo taken of Paredes after his arrest on\r\nNovember 15, Coln identified him as the courier who delivered the\r\ncrack during the November 2 transaction.  Coln had testified\r\nearlier during the trial as to the same incident, and, according to\r\nParedes, Coln's identification at trial was very shaky.  Paredes\r\nthus claims that he was prejudiced by the admission of Maloney's\r\ntestimony because its effect was to bolster Coln's identification. \r\nRule 801(d)(1)(C), however, declares that \"[a] statement is not\r\nhearsay if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing\r\nand is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and\r\nthe statement is . . . one of identification of a person made after\r\nperceiving the person.\"  Cf. United States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554,\r\n564 (1988) (Rule 801(d)(1)(C) exception applicable to evidence of\r\nwitness's prior identification of defendant, even though by the\r\ntime of trial, witness was unable to remember identification). \r\nIndeed, \"[t]he premise for Rule 801(d)(1)(C) was that, given\r\nadequate safeguards against suggestiveness, out-of-court\r\nidentifications were generally preferable to courtroom\r\nidentifications,\" because of the problem of fading memories.  Id.at 563.  Thus, even assuming that Coln's identification of Paredes\r\nat trial was less emphatic than his earlier identification in the\r\npresence of Maloney, this would merely confirm the validity of the\r\npremise underlying Rule 801(d)(1)(C).\r\nIII.  Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we affirm the\r\nappellant's conviction.\n",

Jess Paredes-Rodrguez was\r\nconvicted on charges that he conspired to possess cocaine with\r\nintent to distribute, and that he carried a firearm in connection\r\nwith drug trafficking.  He was sentenced to 121 months in prison\r\nand five years of supervised release.  He now appeals his\r\nconviction, claiming that the jury instructions were misleading,\r\nthat the indictment was constructively amended by evidence that\r\nalso constituted a prejudicial variance from the conduct charged in\r\nthe indictment, and that two police officers were erroneously\r\npermitted to testify.  We affirm his conviction.\r\nI.  Background\r\nOn an appeal from a criminal conviction, we view the\r\nfacts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United\r\nStates v. Shea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198068\"><a href=\"/opinion/198068/united-states-v-shea/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (1st Cir. 1998).  On the evening of\r\nNovember 15, 1994, defendant-appellant Jess Paredes-Rodrguez was\r\ndriving a car down Merwin Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.  He\r\nwas accompanied by Carlos Antigua-Herrera, who was sitting on the\r\nfront passenger seat.  The car was stopped by state law enforcement\r\nofficers assigned to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's Western\r\nMassachusetts Task Force, and both driver and passenger were\r\narrested.  During the arrest, Paredes attempted to draw a loaded\r\n.38 caliber semi-automatic pistol from his pockets, but was\r\nforcibly restrained from doing so.  The officers searched the car,\r\nand found 119 grams of crack cocaine under the passenger's seat.\r\nThe arrest was not random.  An undercover state police\r\nofficer, Trooper Juan Coln, had negotiated for delivery of cocaine\r\non three previous occasions with the main target of the\r\ninvestigation, a certain Jos Reyes, also known as Rafi.  On\r\nOctober 12, October 18, and November 2, 1994, Rafi delivered crack\r\ncocaine to Coln at the same location on Merwin Street where\r\nParedes was later arrested.  During the first transaction, on\r\nOctober 12, Rafi brought the crack by himself and then sold it to\r\nColn.  On October 18, Rafi arrived alone without the crack, but a\r\nfew moments later, an individual known as Flaco arrived carrying\r\nthe cocaine that Rafi then sold to Coln.  On November 2, Rafi\r\nagain arrived alone and without the cocaine, entered Coln's car,\r\nand sat down on the front passenger seat.  Soon afterwards, the\r\nappellant in this case, Paredes, walked by and handed Rafi through\r\nthe car's open window a one-ounce package of crack cocaine that\r\nRafi then sold to Coln for $750.\r\nParedes' arrest followed the fourth transaction between\r\nRafi and Coln.  On November 14, Rafi agreed to sell Coln four\r\nounces of crack cocaine for $3,000.  The following day, Rafi told\r\nColn that at approximately 7:15 p.m., two people in a black\r\nOldsmobile would arrive at the same location on Merwin street to\r\ndeliver the crack.  It was precisely 7:15 p.m. when Paredes and\r\nAntigua arrived at the designated location in their car, carrying\r\n119 grams (approximately 4.2 ounces) of crack cocaine.\r\nAfter his arrest, Paredes waived his Miranda rights, seeMiranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), admitted that he was\r\ndelivering cocaine, and then led the arresting officers to the\r\nbuilding where Rafi had given him the crack cocaine.  However,\r\nParedes subsequently retracted his confession and denied having\r\ntaken part in or even having had knowledge of the drug transaction. \r\nHe explained that he showed the police where Rafi lived merely\r\nbecause he was trying to be helpful.  He also simultaneously\r\nasserted, inconsistently, that he had no knowledge of the cocaine\r\nthat was found in his car, and that the cocaine belonged to Rafi. \r\nParedes further stated that Rafi had given him the gun, and told\r\nhim to deliver the gun and the car to a friend who would be waiting\r\nfor him on Merwin Street.  He admitted, however, that he had\r\noriginally told the police that he found the gun under some leaves.\r\nParedes' trial before the U.S. District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts began on November 4, 1996, and continued\r\nuntil November 12.  On that date, the jury returned a verdict\r\nfinding Paredes guilty on all three counts of the indictment.  On\r\nFebruary 24, 1997, Paredes was sentenced as described above. \r\nJudgment was entered on February 25, and Paredes filed a notice of\r\nappeal on April 19, 1997.\r\nII.  Analysis\r\nA.  Jury Instructions\r\nIf objections to the jury instructions have been properly\r\npreserved, we review the trial judge's choice of wording in the\r\ninstructions only for abuse of discretion.  See United States v.\r\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198012\"><a href=\"/opinion/198012/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1st Cir. 1998).  In order to determine\r\nwhether or not the court abused its discretion, we first \"'must\r\nlook at the instructions in light of the evidence and determine\r\nwhether they fairly and adequately submit the issues in the case to\r\nthe jury.'\"  Id. (quoting United States v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196797\"><a href=\"/opinion/196797/united-states-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n809 (1st Cir. 1996)).  Even if we find the instructions erroneous,\r\nany such errors that are not of constitutional magnitude are\r\nreviewed for harmlessness.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a); Koonce v.\r\nPepe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197064\"><a href=\"/opinion/197064/koonce-v-pepe-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 473 (1st Cir. 1996).   Pursuant to harmless\r\nerror review, \"[t]he only question for us is whether the ailing\r\ninstruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the\r\nresulting conviction violates due process.\"  Id. (quoting Estellev. McGuire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112660\"><a href=\"/opinion/112660/estelle-v-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1991)).  Accordingly, \"[w]e must\r\naddress the instruction 'in the context of the instructions as a\r\nwhole and the trial record,' and 'inquire whether there is a\r\nreasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged\r\ninstruction in a way that violates the [constitutional right to due\r\nprocess.]'\"  Koonce, 99 F.3d at 473 (quoting Estelle, 502 U.S. at\r\n72) (other citations omitted).\r\nAs noted earlier, Paredes was indicted on three counts:\r\nconspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, possession\r\nof cocaine with intent to distribute, and carrying a firearm in\r\nconnection with a drug-trafficking crime.  Although he acknowledges\r\nthat there was other evidence that could support his conviction on\r\nthe conspiracy count, Paredes contends that the possession count\r\nwas the cornerstone of the indictment because evidence that he was\r\nin possession of the cocaine was the strongest evidence for a\r\nconviction on the conspiracy and weapons counts.  \r\nParedes claims that, since the cocaine was found in a\r\nplastic bag beneath a towel underneath the front passenger seat,\r\nsome distance from the reach of his outstretched hand, he could not\r\nbe said to be in actual possession of the cocaine.  In order to\r\nconvict him on the possession count, he claims, the jury had to\r\nfind that he was in constructive possession of the cocaine. \r\nHowever, Paredes objects to the court's wording of the instruction\r\non constructive possession, specifically challenging the omission \r\nof any explicit mention of an intent requirement.  He cites the\r\nrelevant portion of the court's instructions:  \"If an individual\r\nhas the ability to exercise substantial control over an object that\r\nhe does not have in his physical custody, then he is in possession\r\nof that item.\"  He further contends that the subsequent instruction\r\nthat possession must be knowing in order to be criminal does not\r\ncure the effect of the omission of an intent requirement, because\r\nit allegedly permits conviction of a person who knows that an item\r\nin proximity to him contains cocaine, even though that person does\r\nnot intend to exercise control over the item.  \r\nAssuming for the sake of argument that Paredes is correct\r\nthat the evidence did not permit a finding that he was in actualpossession of the cocaine, the first question before us is whether\r\nthe district court's instructions to the jury, taken as a whole,\r\ncorrectly conveyed the law as to constructive possession.  Paredes\r\nis correct in asserting that intent is an element of constructive\r\npossession, which \"exists when a person 'knowingly has the power\r\nand intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over\r\nan object, either directly or through others.'\"  United States v.\r\nTorres-Maldonado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195153\"><a href=\"/opinion/195153/united-states-v-torres-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United\r\nStates v. Garca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598972\"><a href=\"/opinion/598972/united-states-v-jose-a-garcia-united-states-v-pablo-h-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1164 (1st Cir. 1993)).  Upon\r\nexamining the instructions as a whole, however, we find that,\r\nnotwithstanding the absence of a explicit mention of an intent\r\nrequirement, the same is implicit in the instructions.  \r\nAlthough the omission of an explicit reference to intent\r\nis a less than ideal way of explaining constructive possession to\r\na jury, the other instructions given by the court helped\r\nsubstantially to prevent the prejudice adverted to by Paredes.  For\r\nexample, the court also instructed:\r\nThe possession of a controlled substance\r\ncannot be found solely on the basis that\r\nthe defendant was near or close to the\r\ncontrolled substance.  Nor can it be found\r\nsimply because the defendant was present\r\nat a scene where controlled substances\r\nwere involved, or solely because the\r\ndefendant associated with a person who\r\ncontrolled the substance where it was\r\nfound.\r\n\nThis instruction, in combination with certain illustrative examples\r\nof constructive possession given by the court and subsequent\r\ninstructions on the intent-to-distribute aspect of the crime\r\ncharged, effectively conveyed the notion that the jury had to find\r\nthat Paredes' possession of the cocaine was knowing and\r\nintentional.  As a prior panel of this court stated, \r\n[the appellant's argument] ignores the\r\nnature of the crime with which he was\r\ncharged.  In directing his entire argument\r\nat alleged error in the definition of\r\n'possession,' the defendant forgets that\r\nhe was charged not with simple possession,\r\nbut possession with intent to distribute.\r\n. . . [His] argument is that the jury\r\nfound he possessed [certain containers]\r\nwithout knowing they contained cocaine,\r\nbut went on to find that he intended to\r\ndistribute the cocaine that was in them. \r\nNo reasonable jury could make such a\r\nfinding.\r\n\nUnited States v. Hallock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566307\"><a href=\"/opinion/566307/united-states-v-carl-hallock/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nSimilarly, in the case before us, it simply makes no sense to\r\nassert that the same jury that found that Paredes intended to\r\ndistribute the cocaine could have simultaneously found that he did\r\nnot intend to possess it.\r\nB.  The Indictment\r\nParedes raises two separate but related claims regarding\r\nthe indictment.  One is his claim that the charges were\r\nconstructively and improperly amended by the admission of evidence\r\nthat he delivered cocaine to Rafi on November 2, because that\r\nevidence allowed the jury to convict him of a conspiracy that was\r\nnot charged in the indictment.  The other is his argument that\r\nthere was a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof\r\noffered by the government at trial.  Reviewing both contentions for\r\nplain error, we find them without merit.\r\nWhen an amendment of the indictment occurs in the middle\r\nof trial, it is considered per se prejudicial for a number of\r\nreasons:  \"to preserve the right of the person accused of an\r\ninfamous crime to have a grand jury vote on the indictment, to\r\nprevent reprosecution for the same offense, and to protect the\r\nright of the accused to be informed of all charges,\" so as to be\r\nable to adequately prepare his defense.  United States v. Vavlitis,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195045\"><a href=\"/opinion/195045/united-states-v-vavlitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (1st Cir. 1993).  A constructive amendment of the\r\nindictment \"occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\r\naltered, . . . in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand\r\njury has last passed upon them.\"  United States v. Dunn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449678\"><a href=\"/opinion/449678/united-states-v-john-f-dunn-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting Gaither v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"285846\"><a href=\"/opinion/285846/tyrone-gaither-v-united-states-of-america-charles-tatum-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1061</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1071-72 (D.C. Cir. 1969)); see also Vavlitis, 9 F.3d at 210. \r\nFor example, an indictment is constructively amended by \"a jury\r\ninstruction which modifies the offense charged in the indictment,\r\n. . . or the admission of evidence of an offense not charged by the\r\ngrand jury.\"  Dunn, 758 F.2d at 35. \r\nNotwithstanding Paredes' contentions, the admission of\r\nevidence of the November 2 delivery did not constructively amend\r\nthe indictment.  The conspiracy count charged Paredes with\r\nparticipating in a conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to\r\ndistribute \"on or around November 15, 1995.\"  During trial, the\r\ngovernment introduced evidence that Coln purchased cocaine from\r\nRafi on three occasions prior to the November 15 transaction, and\r\nthat Paredes acted as Rafi's courier on one of those occasions.\r\nThe problem with Paredes' argument is that it is based on\r\na misconception of the scope of the conspiracy charged in the\r\nindictment.  He does not question that the indictment charged him\r\nwith conspiring with Rafi and others to possess and sell cocaine. \r\nHe does argue, however, that because the indictment refers to a\r\nconspiracy \"on or about November 15,\" the conspiracy charge is\r\nnecessarily limited to the events that occurred on November 15, and\r\ntherefore, that the evidence as to the other transactions is\r\nevidence of other, uncharged conspiracies.  Unfortunately for his\r\nargument, this circuit has previously held that \"the setting forth,\r\nin approximate form, of [a] date on in the indictment does not\r\npreclude the admission of evidence relating to events which\r\noccurred earlier.\"  United States v. Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194868\"><a href=\"/opinion/194868/united-states-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 n.12\r\n(1st Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Bello-Prez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593168\"><a href=\"/opinion/593168/united-states-v-andres-gabriel-bello-perez-aka-garby/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 n.4 (1st Cir. 1992).  The evidence as to the earlier\r\ntransactions is certainly relevant to the November 15 transaction,\r\nbecause it provides an explanation of his presence on Merwin Street\r\non the day of his arrest.  Furthermore, any potential prejudice was\r\nprevented by the district court's careful instruction to the jury -\r\nwhich we have no reason to fear was ignored by the jury - that the\r\ndefendant was on trial only for the events of November 15, and none\r\nother.\r\nThe argument with regard to the alleged variance in proof\r\nis quite similar to the constructive amendment argument.  \"A\r\nvariance occurs when the proof differs from the allegations in the\r\nindictment.\"  Vavlitis, 9 F.3d at 210.  However, \"[a] variance is\r\nmaterial and reversible only if it has affected the defendant's\r\nsubstantial rights . . . to be informed of the charges and to\r\nprevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\"  Id.  Paredes\r\nclaims that the evidence introduced at trial regarding the\r\nNovember 2 transaction created a prejudicial variance between the\r\nproof and the indictment.  As noted above, however, the reference\r\nto approximate dates in an indictment is not binding and thus the\r\nscope of the indictment may cover prior events.  See Fisher, 3 F.3d\r\nat 461 n.12.  Accordingly, the evidence as to the prior\r\ntransactions between Rafi and Coln, and Paredes' participation in\r\none of those transactions is not materially different from the\r\nconduct charged in the indictment.\r\nMoreover, even assuming that the evidence of prior\r\ntransactions was sufficiently different from the acts charged in\r\nthe indictment to constitute a variance, the evidence did not\r\nprejudice Paredes' substantial rights.  He was certainly able to\r\nprepare an adequate defense, since he was on notice that the\r\ngovernment would seek to introduce such evidence.  Additionally,\r\nany danger that Paredes could be convicted on the basis of the\r\nevidence of the November 2 transaction was sufficiently mitigated\r\nby the court's instruction to the jury that the evidence as to the\r\nearlier transactions should be considered only as evidence that\r\nmight be probative of his participation in a conspiracy on\r\nNovember 15, and not as proof of his participation in an earlier\r\nconspiracy.\r\nC.  Evidentiary Rulings\r\nParedes objects to the trial court's admission of Coln's\r\ntestimony as to statements made by Rafi in his presence during\r\ntheir negotiations for the November 15 transaction.  He also\r\nobjects to the admission of the testimony of the law enforcement\r\nofficer in charge of the investigation as to what was said to him\r\nby two other officers.  Neither objection is well-founded.\r\nUnder Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), a defendant's\r\ncoconspirator's statements are admissible if the prosecution proves\r\nto the trial judge by a preponderance of the evidence that there\r\nwas a conspiracy, that the defendant was part of the conspiracy,\r\nand that the statements were made by the coconspirator during the\r\ncourse and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See Bourjaily v.\r\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (1987); see also United States v.\r\nPetrozziello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 1977) (explaining that\r\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 104(a), trial judge rather than jury has duty\r\nto hear evidence and determine admissibility of coconspirator\r\nstatements).  Moreover, after some debate among the circuit courts\r\nof appeals, see, e.g., Petrozziello, 548 F.2d at 23 n.2, the\r\nSupreme Court declared that trial courts may consider any non-\r\nprivileged evidence, regardless of its admissibility, in making\r\nRule 801(d)(2)(E) determinations, see Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 178-79\r\n(harmonizing Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) procedures and Rule 801(d)(2)(E)\r\ndeterminations).\r\nThus, for example, in determining whether or not to\r\npermit the introduction of evidence as to the statements of an\r\nalleged coconspirator, the trial judge may consider hearsay\r\nevidence, including the very coconspirator statement whose\r\nintroduction is being sought.  As the Court explained, \"there is\r\nlittle doubt that a coconspirator's statements could themselves be\r\nprobative of the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of\r\nboth the defendant and the declarant in the conspiracy.\"  Id. at\r\n180.\r\nIn the case before us, the district court conducted a\r\nPetrozziello hearing during which he reviewed the available\r\nevidence, including but not limited to Coln's testimony as to what\r\nRafi had stated.  The court concluded that the government had\r\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence that there had been\r\na conspiracy, that Paredes and Rafi had been part of the\r\nconspiracy, and that Rafi's statements were made during and in\r\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.  In making its determination, the\r\ncourt emphasized Coln's testimony that Paredes handed Rafi the\r\ncrack cocaine during the November 2 transaction, and the fact that\r\nParedes was arrested while in possession of four ounces of crack\r\ncocaine at the time and place Rafi had said his courier would\r\ndeliver four ounces of crack cocaine.  Viewing this evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the guilty verdict, we discern no error in\r\nthe district court's determination.\r\nParedes' response is to raise, once more, the argument\r\nthat the conspiracy charged did not include the prior transactions,\r\nbut only the November 15 transaction, and thus, that Rafi's\r\nstatements were made in the course of a prior conspiracy, and not\r\nthe one at issue.  This is an argument we have considered and\r\nrejected above, and thus we merely repeat that the scope of the\r\nconspiracy charged in the indictment is broad enough to cover the\r\nearlier transactions between Rafi and Coln.\r\nParedes also argues that the court erred in deciding to\r\npermit Sgt. Neil Maloney, the agent in charge of the investigation,\r\nto testify as to what other officers told him during the course of\r\nthe investigation.  Maloney testified that officers under his\r\ncommand told him that they saw someone leave Paredes' residence on\r\nTilton Street in a brown Toyota, proceed to Belmont Street, where\r\nboth driver and passenger exchanged the Toyota for a dark Buick,\r\nand then proceed Merwin Street driving the same Buick.  Paredes\r\nobjected to this testimony on hearsay grounds, but the judge\r\noverruled the objection, stating that he would allow the testimony\r\nfor the limited purpose of explaining how the surveillance reports\r\nprompted Maloney to take subsequent action, rather than to\r\nestablish the truth of the reports.  Given that the Federal Rules\r\nof Evidence define hearsay as \"a statement, other than one made by\r\nthe declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\r\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\" Fed. R. Evid.\r\n801(c), the court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion.  Most\r\nimportantly, any error would have been harmless, because Maloney's\r\ntestimony as to the car switch was of only tangential importance to\r\nthe ultimate issue of whether Paredes committed the acts he was\r\ncharged with.\r\nFinally, Paredes objects to the district court's decision\r\nto permit Maloney to testify as to Coln's out-of-court\r\nidentification of Paredes, as well as the comments that Coln made\r\nat the time.  Based on a photo taken of Paredes after his arrest on\r\nNovember 15, Coln identified him as the courier who delivered the\r\ncrack during the November 2 transaction.  Coln had testified\r\nearlier during the trial as to the same incident, and, according to\r\nParedes, Coln's identification at trial was very shaky.  Paredes\r\nthus claims that he was prejudiced by the admission of Maloney's\r\ntestimony because its effect was to bolster Coln's identification. \r\nRule 801(d)(1)(C), however, declares that \"[a] statement is not\r\nhearsay if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing\r\nand is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and\r\nthe statement is . . . one of identification of a person made after\r\nperceiving the person.\"  Cf. United States v. Owens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111992\"><a href=\"/opinion/111992/united-states-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n564 (1988) (Rule 801(d)(1)(C) exception applicable to evidence of\r\nwitness's prior identification of defendant, even though by the\r\ntime of trial, witness was unable to remember identification). \r\nIndeed, \"[t]he premise for Rule 801(d)(1)(C) was that, given\r\nadequate safeguards against suggestiveness, out-of-court\r\nidentifications were generally preferable to courtroom\r\nidentifications,\" because of the problem of fading memories.  Id.at 563.  Thus, even assuming that Coln's identification of Paredes\r\nat trial was less emphatic than his earlier identification in the\r\npresence of Maloney, this would merely confirm the validity of the\r\npremise underlying Rule 801(d)(1)(C).\r\nIII.  Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we affirm the\r\nappellant's conviction.\n</pre>",
