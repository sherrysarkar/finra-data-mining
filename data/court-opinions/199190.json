Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David Michaud on brief pro se.\n     Donald E. Gardner and Devine, Millimet & Branch on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       December 11, 2000\n\f               Per Curiam. Pro se appellant David Michaud appeals\n\n from the dismissal of his complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n for     failure    to    state     a     claim.        In     a     report     and\n\n recommendation      dated      March     8,   2000,   a     magistrate       judge\n\n recommended dismissal on the ground that the claims were\n\n untimely.      See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a) & (b) (providing for\n\n preliminary review of prisoner complaints against government\n\n officers or employees and for dismissal if they fail to\n\n state a claim for relief).               After reviewing an objection\n\n filed    by    appellant,        the    district      court       approved     the\n\n recommendation      in    an     order    dated    March      20,    2000,     and\n\n dismissed the complaint.               We have carefully reviewed the\n\n record and the parties' arguments and affirm substantially\n\n for the reasons given in the magistrate judge's report,\n\n which    was   accepted     by    the    district      court,       and   in   the\n\n appellees' brief.1        On appeal, appellant alleges that state\n\n courts     fraudulently        concealed       information          from       him,\n\n contending, apparently, that he would have timely discovered\n\n his claims if he had received the information in question.\n\n\n\n    1We note that, given the early dismissal of the complaint,\nappellees were never served with process in the district court.\nAfter being notified of the appeal, however, they filed a brief\nand appendix. We deny appellant's motion to strike the brief\nand appendix.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fBut   his   allegations    and   the    materials   he   submitted   in\n\nsupport thereof do not show any misconduct by the courts or\n\nany other basis for finding his claims to be timely.\n\n\n\n\n            Affirmed.     See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f [cc: Mr. Michaud, Mr. Gardner, Certified Copies to:\n\nHonorable Steven J. McAuliffe, Mr. Starr, Clerk, U.S.\n\n         District Court of New Hampshire.]\n\n\n\n\n                         -4-\n\f",
