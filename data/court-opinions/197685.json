Flibotte saw his  apparent victory\r\n\nturn  to ashes  when the  district  court entered  judgment as  a\r\n\nmatter of law  in favor of defendant-appellee  Pennsylvania Truck\r\n\nLines,  Inc. (PTL)  on the  ground that  Flibotte's   claims were\r\n\npreempted by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of\r\n\n1947, 29 U.S.C.   185 (1994).  Flibotte beseeches us to reinstate\r\n\nthe jury verdict.  We are unable to do so.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          Flibotte,  a member of Teamsters Local 25, spent almost\r\n\nthree decades in PTL's employ.  This relationship persisted until\r\n\nPTL terminated  him in 1987 for  his refusal to participate  in a\r\n\ndrug  testing procedure    a  refusal that, under  the applicable\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement, \"constitute[d]  a presumption of\r\n\nintoxication.\"   National Master Freight Agreement, Art. 35, Sec.\r\n\n3  (NMFA).   Local  25  filed a  grievance  on Flibotte's  behalf\r\n\npursuant  to the  NMFA and  eventually took  the case  to binding\r\n\narbitration.  The arbitrator found that Flibotte's ouster did not\r\n\nviolate  the   collective  bargaining  pact   and  rejected   the\r\n\ngrievance.\r\n\n          Flibotte subsequently  filed a civil action against PTL\r\n\nin  a Massachusetts  state court.   In  addition to  a derivative\r\n\nclaim  for loss  of consortium  on behalf  of Mrs.  Flibotte, the\r\n\ncomplaint contained counts  for negligence, invasion of  privacy,\r\n\nimpairment  of civil rights,  defamation, negligent infliction of\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nemotional  distress,  and  intentional  infliction  of  emotional\r\n\ndistress.   Flibotte  alleged that  PTL  notified a  group of  37\r\n\nemployees, himself included, to report on March 13, 1987, for the\r\n\nbiennial  physical  examination  and  drug  test  required  under\r\n\nfederal  motor  carrier  safety  regulations;  that   he  refused\r\n\n\"because  his  examination  was  not  yet  due  and  because  the\r\n\n[designated examination site] was rat-infested\"; that, within one\r\n\nweek after he boycotted the scheduled test, he  took and passed a\r\n\ndrug  test  administered  by  his  own  physician;  and  that PTL\r\n\nnonetheless  discharged him  summarily  on March  18,  1987.   He\r\n\nclaimed  that  in   so  doing,  PTL  wrongfully   terminated  his\r\n\nemployment  and,  in  the  bargain,  breached  various  state-law\r\n\nduties.\r\n\n          PTL  removed the  case to  the  United States  District\r\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts  on dual bases (diversity\r\n\nof citizenship and  the existence of a federal  question).  After\r\n\nthe usual  preliminaries   including  the denial of  PTL's motion\r\n\nfor summary judgment    the case proceeded to  trial before Judge\r\n\nNelson and a jury.  During the ensuing eight-day trial, PTL twice\r\n\nmoved for judgment  as a matter of  law on the ground  of section\r\n\n301 preemption.   Judge Nelson denied one such motion  at the end\r\n\nof  the plaintiff's case  and the other  at the close  of all the\r\n\nevidence.    In due  season,  the  jury  returned a  verdict  for\r\n\nFlibotte  on three counts    negligence, negligent  infliction of\r\n\nemotional  distress,  and  intentional  infliction  of  emotional\r\n\ndistress   and awarded him $625,000 in damages.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          Like the mills of the  gods, the mills of the judiciary\r\n\nsometimes grind exceedingly slow.  On November 20, 1991, PTL made\r\n\na timely motion for judgment as a matter of law, see Fed. R. Civ.\r                                                              \r\n\nP. 50(b), in which it again  hawked section 301 preemption.   The\r\n\nmotion  sat unresolved  when, in  April of  1992, PTL  sought the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's  protection under Chapter  11, thus triggering\r\n\nan  automatic stay of proceedings in the  district court.  See 11\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   362 (1990).  Some seventeen months later, the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt confirmed  a plan of reorganization.   PTL's emergence from\r\n\nthe toils  of bankruptcy  cleared the way  for resumption  of the\r\n\ndistrict  court proceedings.  By then,  however, Judge Nelson had\r\n\nbecome disabled and  a considerable period of time elapsed before\r\n\nthe case was reassigned and a  new jurist, Judge Gertner, took up\r\n\nthe outstanding  motion.   She eventually  granted it,  provoking\r\n\nthis appeal.\r\n\n          Flibotte's  objections  possess   both  procedural  and\r\n\nsubstantive  dimensions.   First, he  argues  that Judge  Gertner\r\n\nerred when  she purposed to revisit issues  previously decided by\r\n\nJudge Nelson.  Second, he assails the merits of her determination\r\n\nthat section 301 preempts his  state-law claims.  We address each\r\n\nof these objections in turn.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                         Law of the Case\r                                   Law of the Case\r                                                  \r\n\n          Flibotte's  procedural  objection   has  a  chameleonic\r\n\nquality.   In  one  iteration,  it  implies  that  Judge  Gertner\r\n\nimproperly made fact-based determinations contrary to  those made\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nby her predecessor  and in flagrant disregard of  the truism that\r\n\nthe judge  who actually presides  over a  trial is in  a superior\r\n\nposition  to  make  such determinations.    Without  engaging the\r\n\nmyriad  counter-precedential assumptions  that  are essential  to\r\n\nthis objection,  it suffices to  say that the legal  framework in\r\n\nwhich motions  for judgment  as a matter  of law  exist does  not\r\n\npermit  courts  confronted   with  such  motions  to   engage  in\r\n\ndifferential factfinding, see Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Western Sur.  Co., 936  F.2d  1364, 1383-84  (1st Cir.  1991)\r                               \r\n\n(discussing  applicable standards),  and there  is no  indication\r\n\nhere that Judge Gertner disobeyed these guidelines.\r\n\n          Flibotte's next iteration  of his procedural  objection\r\n\nis no more  rewarding.  He asserts  that a court is  bound by its\r\n\nown  precedents,   and  that,   therefore,   Judge  Gertner   was\r\n\nincompetent  to  revise  Judge  Nelson's  answers  to  the  legal\r\n\nquestions  posed by  the case.    This objection  is an  apparent\r\n\neffort to  employ the venerable  law of the case  doctrine, which\r\n\nstates  in the  large  that,  unless  corrected by  an  appellate\r\n\ntribunal, a  legal  decision made  at  one stage  of a  civil  or\r\n\ncriminal  case constitutes  the  law of  the case  throughout the\r\n\npendency of  the litigation.   See, e.g., United States  v. Bell,\r                                                                          \r\n\n988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1993); Abbadessa v. Moore Bus. Forms,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 987 F.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1993).\r              \r\n\n          This  principle is of  no real assistance  to Flibotte.\r\n\nAlthough  temporally  distant  from  each other,  Judge  Nelson's\r\n\ndenial of PTL's motions for  summary judgment and for judgment as\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\na matter of law, on the one hand, and Judge Gertner's decision to\r\n\ngrant PTL's post-verdict motion for  judgment as a matter of law,\r\n\non the other hand, occurred in the context of a single trial of a\r\n\nsingle case in a single court, with no intervening appeal.  Judge\r\n\nNelson  and Judge Gertner, therefore, play the same institutional\r\n\nrole for the purpose of this litigation.\r\n\n          That confluence  of judicial identities  is dispositive\r\n\nhere.   \"Under the law  of the case  doctrine, as it  is commonly\r\n\nunderstood, it is not improper for a court to depart from a prior\r\n\nholding if convinced that it  is clearly erroneous and would work\r\n\na manifest injustice.\"  Arizona  v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 619\r                                                        \r\n\nn.8 (1983).  Moreover, it is perfectly appropriate for a judge to\r\n\nrefuse to direct  a verdict, permit the jury to  consider a case,\r\n\nand thereafter  to grant  judgment  notwithstanding the  verdict.\r\n\nSee Talbot-Windsor  Corp. v.  Miller, 309 F.2d  68, 69  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1962).  Accordingly,  Judge Nelson would have been  free to grant\r\n\nPTL  the  relief  that  it  sought  in  its  post-verdict  motion\r\n\nnotwithstanding  his  previous rulings;  and  Judge  Gertner, who\r\n\nstood in his shoes, was at liberty to do the same.  Consequently,\r\n\nJudge  Gertner did not arrogate unto  herself any undue authority\r\n\nwhen  she  entertained  PTL's  renewed  post-verdict  motion  for\r\n\njudgment as  a matter of  law and reached a  different conclusion\r\n\nthan had her co-equal predecessor.\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                      Section 301 Preemption\r                                Section 301 Preemption\r                                                      \r\n\n          Having found  no procedural  glitch, we  turn to  Judge\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nGertner's decision.   We review a ruling on a motion for judgment\r\n\nas  a  matter  of  law  de novo,  applying  the  identical  legal\r\n\nstandards that constrain  the district court.   See Colasanto  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nLife Ins.  Co. of  N.

It appears  that Judge\r\nGertner, though new to the case,  ruled on the motion without the\r\nbenefit of a trial transcript,  and a complete transcript has not\r\nbeen prepared to  this date.  We  need not probe too  deeply into\r\nthe question  of which way  the absence of this  transcript cuts.\r\nIn most cases,  a transcript would form  an integral part  of the\r\ncourt's decisional calculus on a post-verdict motion for judgment\r\nas  a  matter  of law.    Here,  however,  the  critical issue   \r\npreemption    embodies  a pure  question  of law  susceptible  to\r\nresolution on the  face of the pleadings (as  supplemented by the\r\ncollective bargaining  agreement).  In  ruling on the  motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law, Judge Gertner hewed to this line and\r\ndid  not make  any extraneous  factual  findings or  assumptions.\r\nBecause the judge's analysis and  decision did not need to engage\r\nany facts derived from trial testimony, this is the rare  case in\r\nwhich  the absence  of a  trial transcript  is immaterial  to the\r\ncorrectness of a ruling on  a post-verdict motion for judgment as\r\na matter of law.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nSupreme  Court  has  placed  a  heavy  gloss  on  this  language,\r\n\nbeginning  with its  holding that  the  statute empowers  federal\r\n\ncourts  to craft  federal  common  law  reasonably  necessary  to\r\n\neffectuate the objectives of section 301.  See Textile Workers v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLincoln  Mills,  353  U.S. 448,  451  (1957).    This substantive\r                        \r\n\nauthority to declare federal common law soon formed the basis for\r\n\nan  emerging jurisprudence of  preemption.  See  Martin v. Shaw's\r                                                                           \r\n\nSupermarkets, Inc.,  105 F.3d  40, 41-42  (1st Cir.)

Today, labor-law preemption casts  a relatively wide\r\n\nnet.

The Court  has\r\n\ncautioned  that \"purely  factual  questions  about an  employee's\r\n\nconduct or  an employer's  conduct and motives  do not  require a\r\n\ncourt   to   interpret  any   term  of   a  collective-bargaining\r\n\nagreement.\"  Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 262\r                                                        \r\n\n(1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).   It also\r\n\nhas warned that  section 301 \"cannot be read  broadly to pre-empt\r\n\nnonnegotiable  rights conferred  on  individual  employees  as  a\r\n\nmatter  of state  law.\"  Livadas  v. Bradshaw, 512  U.S. 107, 123\r                                                       \r\n\n(1994).   Even  so, the  basic  test remains  that prescribed  by\r\n\nLingle and  its progeny:   that section 301 preempts  a state-law\r                \r\n\nclaim, whether founded  upon the state's positive  or common law,\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nif  a court,  in passing  upon the  claim,  would be  required to\r\n\ninterpret  the collective  bargaining  agreement.   See  id.   In\r                                                                      \r\n\npractice, this test  boils down to whether the asserted state-law\r\n\nclaim plausibly can be said to depend upon the meaning of  one or\r\n\nmore provisions within the collective bargaining agreement.\r\n\n          A state-law claim  can \"depend\" on  the \"meaning\" of  a\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement  in two ways.  First,  a claim so\r\n\nqualifies  if  it  alleges conduct  that  arguably  constitutes a\r\n\nbreach of a duty that  arises pursuant to a collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement.  See United Steelworkers  v. Rawson, 495 U.S. 362, 369\r                                                        \r\n\n(1990) (\"[A]  state-law tort action  against an  employer may  be\r\n\npre-empted by   301 if the duty to the employee of which the tort\r\n\nis  a violation is  created by a  collective-bargaining agreement\r\n\nand without existence independent of the agreement.\").  Second, a\r\n\nclaim  so  qualifies if  its resolution  arguably hinges  upon an\r\n\ninterpretation  of  the  collective bargaining  agreement.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAllis-Chalmers Corp. v.

Our review of the\r\n\npleadings,  supplemented by the  items that Flibotte  included in\r\n\nthe record  appendix on appeal (such as the collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement)  confirms that  none of  these  three claims  involves\r\n\nrights that are made non-negotiable  under state law and that all\r\n\nof  them are preempted  by section 301.   For  clarity's sake, we\r\n\nbegin  with   the  negligence  claims  and  then   focus  on  the\r\n\nintentional infliction claim.\r\n\n          1.    Negligence.   If Flibotte's  two negligence-based\r                    1.    Negligence.\r                                    \r\n\nclaims are to  escape preemption, he must establish  that they do\r\n\nnot  spring  from  duties imposed  by  the  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement, but,  rather, that PTL has acted  \"in a way that might\r\n\nviolate  the duty  of reasonable  care  owed to  every person  in\r\n\nsociety.\"  Rawson, 495 U.S. at 371.  This would be  no mean feat.\r                           \r\n\nEven assuming, favorably to Flibotte, that PTL allegedly breached\r\n\nduties   derived  from  a  source  extrinsic  to  the  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement,  the  resolution of  the negligence  claims\r\n\nnonetheless depends  upon the interpretation  of that  agreement.\r\n\nConsequently,  those claims are preempted  under section 301.  We\r\n\nexplain briefly.\r\n\n          Flibotte's damage  claim, as  framed in  his complaint,\r\n\nlinks  both  his  economic  losses  and  his  emotional  distress\r\n\ndirectly  to his  termination.    In order  to  prevail on  these\r\n\nclaims, he must prove that PTL wrongfully discharged him.  If PTL\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nacted within its contractual rights  in severing the tie, then it\r\n\ncould not have breached its general duty of care.  It is clear to\r\n\nus that we  cannot resolve this question, involving the propriety\r\n\nof  Flibotte's  firing,  without  substantial  inquiry  into  the\r\n\nintricacies of the  collective bargaining agreement.   After all,\r\n\nthe appellant concedes that  PTL cashiered him because  he failed\r\n\nto   appear  for  a  scheduled  drug  test,  and  the  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement in force here   the NMFA    governs both the\r\n\nfrequency  of testing, see  NMFA Uniform Testing  Procedure, Sec.\r                                    \r\n\nIIB, and the  consequences of a failure to take  an offered test,\r\n\nsee NMFA, Art.  35, Sec. 3.  Hence, it is impossible to determine\r             \r\n\nPTL's  negligence   without   inquiring  into   its  rights   and\r\n\nobligations as described by the collective bargaining  agreement.\r\n\nThis mandatory consultation separates the instant case from those\r\n\nthat raise purely factual  questions and thus begets  section 301\r\n\npreemption.\r\n\n          If more were needed   and we do  not think that it is  \r\n\nwe   also  would  note  that  Flibotte's  negligence  claims  are\r\n\npreempted to the  extent that they stem from  his contention that\r\n\nthe conditions of the requested test were unsanitary and violated\r\n\nthe  employer's duty to  provide a suitable  hygienic environment\r\n\nfor the  examination.   This  duty  derives from  the  employment\r\n\nrelationship as  defined in the collective  bargaining agreement,\r\n\nand as such,  it cannot form the basis for a  state-law claim.  A\r\n\nplaintiff  cannot  skirt  section 301  preemption  by  the simple\r\n\nexpedient   of   recharacterizing   an   employer's   substandard\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nperformance of duties that devolve  upon it pursuant to the terms\r\n\nof the  collective bargaining agreement  as a tort.   See Rawson,\r                                                                          \r\n\n495 U.S. at 371-72.\r\n\n          2.  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  This\r                    2.  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.\r                                                                    \r\n\nleaves only the  appellant's claim for intentional  infliction of\r\n\nemotional distress.   To prevail  on that claim, Flibotte  had to\r\n\nprove that PTL (1) intended  to inflict emotional distress by (2)\r\n\nundertaking actions that were extreme and outrageous, thereby (3)\r\n\ncausing emotional  distress which (4) was severe.   See Wagenmann\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Adams,  829 F.2d 196, 213-14  (1st Cir. 1987); Agis  v.

Under Massachusetts\r                     \r\n\nlaw, \"extreme  and outrageous  conduct\" is  behavior that is  \"so\r\n\noutrageous  in character,  and so  extreme  in degree,  as to  go\r\n\nbeyond  all possible  bounds of  decency, and  to be  regarded as\r\n\natrocious,  and utterly  intolerable in  a  civilized community.\"\r\n\nFoley v. Polaroid Corp., 508 N.E.2d 72, 82 (Mass. 1987).\r                                 \r\n\n          PTL's  rights  and  obligations  under  the  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement are obviously central not only to an inquiry\r\n\ninto PTL's  intentions, but also  to an inquiry into  whether PTL\r\n\nconducted itself in a sufficiently outrageous manner to give rise\r\n\nto  liability  under  state  tort  law.   It  is  a  well-settled\r\n\nprinciple that  a party cannot be liable if  it does no more than\r\n\n\"insist upon [its] legal rights in a permissible way, even though\r\n\n[it]  was well  aware that  such insistence  is certain  to cause\r\n\nemotional distress.\"  Restatement (Second)  of Torts,   46 cmt. g\r\n\n(1965); see Rush  v. United Technologies, 930 F.2d  453, 456 (6th\r                                                  \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nCir. 1991).  If PTL was within its rights to require  Flibotte to\r\n\ntake a drug test at the designated site and to terminate him when\r\n\nhe  refused to  do  so,  a claim  for  intentional infliction  of\r\n\nemotional distress cannot lie.2  Because the  resolution of these\r\n\nissues necessitates  examination  of  the  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement, the claim is preempted.   See Allis-Chalmers, 471 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 213; see also  Jackson v.

In  addition to  a derivative\r\n\nclaim  for loss  of consortium  on behalf  of Mrs.  Flibotte, the\r\n\ncomplaint contained counts  for negligence, invasion of  privacy,\r\n\nimpairment  of civil rights,  defamation, negligent infliction of\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nemotional  distress,  and  intentional  infliction  of  emotional\r\n\ndistress.   Flibotte  alleged that  PTL  notified a  group of  37\r\n\nemployees, himself included, to report on March 13, 1987, for the\r\n\nbiennial  physical  examination  and  drug  test  required  under\r\n\nfederal  motor  carrier  safety  regulations;  that   he  refused\r\n\n\"because  his  examination  was  not  yet  due  and  because  the\r\n\n[designated examination site] was rat-infested\"; that, within one\r\n\nweek after he boycotted the scheduled test, he  took and passed a\r\n\ndrug  test  administered  by  his  own  physician;  and  that PTL\r\n\nnonetheless  discharged him  summarily  on March  18,  1987.   He\r\n\nclaimed  that  in   so  doing,  PTL  wrongfully   terminated  his\r\n\nemployment  and,  in  the  bargain,  breached  various  state-law\r\n\nduties.\r\n\n          PTL  removed the  case to  the  United States  District\r\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts  on dual bases (diversity\r\n\nof citizenship and  the existence of a federal  question).  After\r\n\nthe usual  preliminaries   including  the denial of  PTL's motion\r\n\nfor summary judgment    the case proceeded to  trial before Judge\r\n\nNelson and a jury.  During the ensuing eight-day trial, PTL twice\r\n\nmoved for judgment  as a matter of  law on the ground  of section\r\n\n301 preemption.   Judge Nelson denied one such motion  at the end\r\n\nof  the plaintiff's case  and the other  at the close  of all the\r\n\nevidence.    In due  season,  the  jury  returned a  verdict  for\r\n\nFlibotte  on three counts    negligence, negligent  infliction of\r\n\nemotional  distress,  and  intentional  infliction  of  emotional\r\n\ndistress   and awarded him $625,000 in damages.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          Like the mills of the  gods, the mills of the judiciary\r\n\nsometimes grind exceedingly slow.  On November 20, 1991, PTL made\r\n\na timely motion for judgment as a matter of law, see Fed. R. Civ.\r                                                              \r\n\nP. 50(b), in which it again  hawked section 301 preemption.   The\r\n\nmotion  sat unresolved  when, in  April of  1992, PTL  sought the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's  protection under Chapter  11, thus triggering\r\n\nan  automatic stay of proceedings in the  district court.  See 11\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   362 (1990).  Some seventeen months later, the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt confirmed  a plan of reorganization.   PTL's emergence from\r\n\nthe toils  of bankruptcy  cleared the way  for resumption  of the\r\n\ndistrict  court proceedings.  By then,  however, Judge Nelson had\r\n\nbecome disabled and  a considerable period of time elapsed before\r\n\nthe case was reassigned and a  new jurist, Judge Gertner, took up\r\n\nthe outstanding  motion.   She eventually  granted it,  provoking\r\n\nthis appeal.\r\n\n          Flibotte's  objections  possess   both  procedural  and\r\n\nsubstantive  dimensions.   First, he  argues  that Judge  Gertner\r\n\nerred when  she purposed to revisit issues  previously decided by\r\n\nJudge Nelson.  Second, he assails the merits of her determination\r\n\nthat section 301 preempts his  state-law claims.  We address each\r\n\nof these objections in turn.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                         Law of the Case\r                                   Law of the Case\r                                                  \r\n\n          Flibotte's  procedural  objection   has  a  chameleonic\r\n\nquality.   In  one  iteration,  it  implies  that  Judge  Gertner\r\n\nimproperly made fact-based determinations contrary to  those made\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nby her predecessor  and in flagrant disregard of  the truism that\r\n\nthe judge  who actually presides  over a  trial is in  a superior\r\n\nposition  to  make  such determinations.    Without  engaging the\r\n\nmyriad  counter-precedential assumptions  that  are essential  to\r\n\nthis objection,  it suffices to  say that the legal  framework in\r\n\nwhich motions  for judgment  as a matter  of law  exist does  not\r\n\npermit  courts  confronted   with  such  motions  to   engage  in\r\n\ndifferential factfinding, see Veranda Beach Club Ltd.

It appears  that Judge\r\nGertner, though new to the case,  ruled on the motion without the\r\nbenefit of a trial transcript,  and a complete transcript has not\r\nbeen prepared to  this date.  We  need not probe too  deeply into\r\nthe question  of which way  the absence of this  transcript cuts.\r\nIn most cases,  a transcript would form  an integral part  of the\r\ncourt's decisional calculus on a post-verdict motion for judgment\r\nas  a  matter  of law.    Here,  however,  the  critical issue   \r\npreemption    embodies  a pure  question  of law  susceptible  to\r\nresolution on the  face of the pleadings (as  supplemented by the\r\ncollective bargaining  agreement).  In  ruling on the  motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law, Judge Gertner hewed to this line and\r\ndid  not make  any extraneous  factual  findings or  assumptions.\r\nBecause the judge's analysis and  decision did not need to engage\r\nany facts derived from trial testimony, this is the rare  case in\r\nwhich  the absence  of a  trial transcript  is immaterial  to the\r\ncorrectness of a ruling on  a post-verdict motion for judgment as\r\na matter of law.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nSupreme  Court  has  placed  a  heavy  gloss  on  this  language,\r\n\nbeginning  with its  holding that  the  statute empowers  federal\r\n\ncourts  to craft  federal  common  law  reasonably  necessary  to\r\n\neffectuate the objectives of section 301.  See Textile Workers v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLincoln  Mills,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105511\"><a href=\"/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  451  (1957).

If a state-law\r\n\nclaim  depends  on  the  meaning  of  the  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement  in either  of these  ways    that  is, under  Rawson's\r                                                                         \r\n\n\"duty\" rubric or under Allis-Chalmers's \"interpretation\" rubric  \r                                               \r\n\nit is preempted.\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r                                            \r\n\n                            The Merits\r                                      The Merits\r                                                \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n          At trial, Flibotte prevailed on three state-law claims:\r\n\nnegligence,  negligent  infliction  of  emotional  distress,  and\r\n\nintentional infliction of  emotional distress.  Our review of the\r\n\npleadings,  supplemented by the  items that Flibotte  included in\r\n\nthe record  appendix on appeal (such as the collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement)  confirms that  none of  these  three claims  involves\r\n\nrights that are made non-negotiable  under state law and that all\r\n\nof  them are preempted  by section 301.   For  clarity's sake, we\r\n\nbegin  with   the  negligence  claims  and  then   focus  on  the\r\n\nintentional infliction claim.\r\n\n          1.    Negligence.   If Flibotte's  two negligence-based\r                    1.    Negligence.\r                                    \r\n\nclaims are to  escape preemption, he must establish  that they do\r\n\nnot  spring  from  duties imposed  by  the  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement, but,  rather, that PTL has acted  \"in a way that might\r\n\nviolate  the duty  of reasonable  care  owed to  every person  in\r\n\nsociety.\"  Rawson, 495 U.S. at 371.  This would be  no mean feat.\r                           \r\n\nEven assuming, favorably to Flibotte, that PTL allegedly breached\r\n\nduties   derived  from  a  source  extrinsic  to  the  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement,  the  resolution of  the negligence  claims\r\n\nnonetheless depends  upon the interpretation  of that  agreement.\r\n\nConsequently,  those claims are preempted  under section 301.  We\r\n\nexplain briefly.\r\n\n          Flibotte's damage  claim, as  framed in  his complaint,\r\n\nlinks  both  his  economic  losses  and  his  emotional  distress\r\n\ndirectly  to his  termination.    In order  to  prevail on  these\r\n\nclaims, he must prove that PTL wrongfully discharged him.  If PTL\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nacted within its contractual rights  in severing the tie, then it\r\n\ncould not have breached its general duty of care.  It is clear to\r\n\nus that we  cannot resolve this question, involving the propriety\r\n\nof  Flibotte's  firing,  without  substantial  inquiry  into  the\r\n\nintricacies of the  collective bargaining agreement.   After all,\r\n\nthe appellant concedes that  PTL cashiered him because  he failed\r\n\nto   appear  for  a  scheduled  drug  test,  and  the  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement in force here   the NMFA    governs both the\r\n\nfrequency  of testing, see  NMFA Uniform Testing  Procedure, Sec.\r                                    \r\n\nIIB, and the  consequences of a failure to take  an offered test,\r\n\nsee NMFA, Art.  35, Sec. 3.  Hence, it is impossible to determine\r             \r\n\nPTL's  negligence   without   inquiring  into   its  rights   and\r\n\nobligations as described by the collective bargaining  agreement.\r\n\nThis mandatory consultation separates the instant case from those\r\n\nthat raise purely factual  questions and thus begets  section 301\r\n\npreemption.\r\n\n          If more were needed   and we do  not think that it is  \r\n\nwe   also  would  note  that  Flibotte's  negligence  claims  are\r\n\npreempted to the  extent that they stem from  his contention that\r\n\nthe conditions of the requested test were unsanitary and violated\r\n\nthe  employer's duty to  provide a suitable  hygienic environment\r\n\nfor the  examination.   This  duty  derives from  the  employment\r\n\nrelationship as  defined in the collective  bargaining agreement,\r\n\nand as such,  it cannot form the basis for a  state-law claim.  A\r\n\nplaintiff  cannot  skirt  section 301  preemption  by  the simple\r\n\nexpedient   of   recharacterizing   an   employer's   substandard\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nperformance of duties that devolve  upon it pursuant to the terms\r\n\nof the  collective bargaining agreement  as a tort.   See Rawson,\r                                                                          \r\n\n495 U.S. at 371-72.\r\n\n          2.  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  This\r                    2.  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.\r                                                                    \r\n\nleaves only the  appellant's claim for intentional  infliction of\r\n\nemotional distress.   To prevail  on that claim, Flibotte  had to\r\n\nprove that PTL (1) intended  to inflict emotional distress by (2)\r\n\nundertaking actions that were extreme and outrageous, thereby (3)\r\n\ncausing emotional  distress which (4) was severe.   See Wagenmann\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

It  is  a  well-settled\r\n\nprinciple that  a party cannot be liable if  it does no more than\r\n\n\"insist upon [its] legal rights in a permissible way, even though\r\n\n[it]  was well  aware that  such insistence  is certain  to cause\r\n\nemotional distress.\"  Restatement (Second)  of Torts,   46 cmt. g\r\n\n(1965); see Rush  v.
