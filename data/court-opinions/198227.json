DeAngelo, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\r\nScott Harshbarger, Attorney General, was on brief for appellant.\r\n\n   Arthur P. Bergeron for appellee.\r\n\n                      December 4, 1998\r\n\n                  \r\n\n   *Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.  BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  The United States\r\nBankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts determined that\r\nRobert P. Coveney was not personally liable for state taxes\r\nincurred by a corporation of which he served as president where the\r\nauthority and responsibility for paying the taxes had been given\r\nexclusively to the treasurer.  The Massachusetts Commissioner of\r\nRevenue (the \"Commissioner\") challenged that conclusion in federal\r\ndistrict court.  The district court affirmed.  The Commissioner now\r\nappeals from the district court's decision to uphold the bankruptcy\r\ncourt's order.  We affirm.\r\n                              I.\r\nOn or about May 5, 1983, Coveney and his long-time friend\r\nLawrence Glynn formed Covynn, Inc. (\"Covynn\"), a Massachusetts\r\ncorporation, to own and operate the Piave Square Pub.  Ownership of\r\nthe real estate was taken in the name of Piave Realty Trust. \r\nCoveney held the title of president of the corporation, while Glynn\r\nserved as the treasurer.  Each of them, including their wives, held\r\nthe office of director and owned one-quarter of the corporate\r\nstock.  An oral agreement   the existence of which is not disputed\r\ngoverned the division of labor between the officers.  Glynn, who\r\nwas a practicing lawyer and certified public accountant, was to be\r\nexclusively responsible for preparing and filing necessary tax\r\nreturns and ensuring that taxes, mortgage, payroll, and insurance\r\npayments were timely made.  Coveney, who had experience in food\r\nservices, would take sole responsibility for the day-to-day\r\nmanagement of the pub, including hiring and firing employees and\r\npaying the pub's suppliers. \r\nIn 1986, the corporation purchased the Oxford Restaurant. \r\nThis restaurant too was operated under the same bifurcated\r\narrangement.  Eventually, Glynn and Coveney decided that the\r\nworkload was too much for Coveney, and that Coveney's duties would\r\nhenceforth be limited to overseeing the Oxford Restaurant.  The\r\ncorporation subsequently leased the Piave Square Pub to two of\r\nGlynn's brothers.  For a few years, the corporation prospered under\r\nthe business arrangement.  Then disaster struck.  Glynn twice\r\nadmitted to Coveney that he had fallen behind in paying state taxes\r\nowed by Covynn, the first time in the spring of 1988 and the second\r\ntime in early 1989.  On each occasion, Coveney accepted Glynn's\r\nsuggestions for keeping the corporation afloat.  In the spring of\r\n1988, Glynn informed Coveney that Covynn owed approximately\r\n$200,000 in back taxes.  On June 6, 1988, Coveney and Glynn\r\nborrowed $200,000 from Glynn's mother to pay off the tax liability. \r\nCoveney and Glynn co-signed a note for $200,000, which was secured\r\nby a mortgage on the property of the Oxford Restaurant.  \r\nBelieving the crisis resolved, Coveney returned to daily\r\nmanagement of the Oxford Restaurant.  During the next several\r\nweeks, Coveney asked Glynn on several occasions whether corporate\r\ntaxes were being kept current.  Each time, Glynn assured Coveney\r\nthat the taxes were being paid on time.  Glynn changed his tune a\r\nfew months later, however, acknowledging that he had again fallen\r\nbehind in paying Covynn's taxes.  In March 1989, Glynn told Coveney\r\nthat he paid the due taxes from an escrow account maintained for\r\nhis non-Covynn legal clients, and that the money had to be\r\nimmediately returned to the fund.  Coveney was shocked at the new\r\ndevelopments, but again agreed to help Glynn out of the\r\npredicament.  The two borrowed an additional $210,000 from Glynn's\r\nmother.  This time, Coveney secured the loan by mortgaging his own\r\nhome.\r\nBy mid-1989, the business had completely unraveled. \r\nCovynn filed for bankruptcy.  Creditors began to sue Covynn, naming\r\nCoveney as a codefendant; protracted bankruptcy proceedings and\r\nrelated litigation commenced.  In April 1994, the Commissioner\r\ninformed Coveney that the Commonwealth deemed him liable for\r\nCovynn's unpaid meals and withholding taxes from January 1, 1988\r\nthrough August 31, 1989.  By this time, Coveney and his wife had\r\nfiled for Chapter 13 protection.  Accordingly, the Commissioner\r\nfiled a proof of claim against Coveney for $63,144.64 and later\r\namended his claim upward.  All told, the Commissioner sought to\r\nrecover $251,527.03 in corporate back taxes from Coveney.\r\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\r\nMassachusetts disallowed the Commissioner's claim, finding that\r\nCoveney had no \"duty to pay over the taxes\" under Massachusetts law\r\nbecause his obligations to the corporation \"were confined to\r\nsupervising the restaurant's operations\" and did not extend to\r\npreparing tax returns or paying taxes.  In re Coveney, 202 B.R.\r\n801, 804 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1996).  The court found Coveney to be a\r\nvictim of \"a callous breach of . . . trust by his business\r\npartner.\"  Id. at 802.  \r\nThe Commissioner subsequently appealed the adverse\r\ndecision to the district court.  The district court held that the\r\nbankruptcy court erred insofar as it refused to look to federal law\r\non the central question of liability, but concluded that the\r\noutcome would have been the same had it done so and affirmed the\r\njudgment.  This appeal ensued.\r\n                             II.\r\nWe review the bankruptcy court's ruling de novo,\r\ndeferring to its factual findings unless they are clearly\r\nerroneous.  See 28 U.S.C.  158(d).  We consider the district\r\ncourt's reasoning where it is persuasive, but otherwise accord no\r\n\"special deference\" to the court's analysis.  See Palmacci v.\r\nUmpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 785 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, an employer who fails to\r\nwithhold or pay employee taxes is liable to the Commonwealth for\r\nthose unpaid taxes.  The term \"employer\" as used in the statute\r\nincludes \"an officer or employee of a corporation . . . who as such\r\nofficer [or] employee . . . is under a duty to withhold and pay\r\nover taxes.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62B,  5 (1988).  In like\r\nfashion, liability for nonpayment of meals taxes may be imposed on\r\nany \"officer or employee of a corporation . . . who as such officer\r\n[or] employee . . . is under a duty to pay over the taxes.\"  Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 64H,  16 (1988). \r\nThe Commissioner has promulgated regulations defining \"a\r\nduty to pay over\" as \r\nan obligation to remit taxes that arises from\r\na person's position, function, or\r\nresponsibility undertaken on behalf of a\r\ncorporation or partnership.  Such obligation\r\nneed not be a legally enforceable agreement\r\nbetween the corporation or partnership and the\r\nresponsible person.  \r\nMass. Regs. Code tit. 830,  62C.31A.1(2) (1998).  Whether a duty\r\nto pay exists must be determined \"based on the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the individual case.\"  Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830,\r\n62C.31A.1(4).  As the bankruptcy court correctly observed, under\r\nthe governing statute and regulations, the mere fact of holding\r\ncorporate office, standing alone, is insufficient to create a duty\r\nto pay.\r\nThere is no comprehensive or uniform set of factors that\r\nmust be evaluated in deciding if an individual has a personal duty\r\nto pay corporate taxes.  In Commissioner v. Brown, 673 N.E.2d 1225\r\n(Mass. 1997), the Supreme Judicial Court recognized the absence of\r\nany \"list[] [of] factors\" bearing on the question of duty and\r\nanalyzed the facts before it in light of the federal law's focus on\r\nwhether the assessed individual \"had the authority to have the\r\ntaxes paid.\"  673 N.E.2d at 1227.  Based on the court's\r\nconsideration of federal law, the Commissioner contends that the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court has fully embraced the federal approach in\r\ninterpreting state tax laws.  Relying on Brown, the Commissioner\r\nseeks the benefit of the federal \"responsible person\" test, which\r\nbroadly extends tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code to\r\n\"all with the responsibility and authority to avoid the default\"\r\nwho wilfully fail to pay.  Vinick v. Commissioner, 110 F.3d 168,\r\n172 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r\nAlthough the court in Brown sought guidance from federal\r\nlaw in interpreting Chapter 62B, section 5 and Chapter 64H, section\r\n16, we must be wary of reading too much into the court's decision\r\nto look to federal cases for the following reasons.  The court did\r\nnot explicitly adopt the federal \"responsible person\" standard. \r\nNor did it say that the phrase \"duty to pay over\" under state law\r\nought to be read as expansively as many federal courts   including\r\nthis Circuit   have construed the \"responsible person\" test. \r\nRather, it observed only that \"there is a close parallel between\r\nthe State and Federal statutes concerning the duty to pay over.\" \r\nBrown, 673 N.E.2d at 1227.  While federal courts often construe the\r\n\"responsible person\" standard quite broadly, treating it as merely\r\na threshold inquiry, Massachusetts courts interpreting their own\r\nlaws have placed a greater emphasis on whether the individual at\r\nissue was responsible for paying the taxes.  Indeed, the Browncourt considered not only whether the assessed individual had the\r\nauthority to pay over the taxes, but also whether it was his\r\nresponsibility either to remit the taxes or to supervise payment of\r\nthe taxes.  See id.\r\nFurther, the usefulness of federal cases may be somewhat\r\ncomplicated by the fact that the federal approach requires an\r\nadditional showing of \"wilfulness,\" which is not required by\r\nMassachusetts law.  The Supreme Judicial Court has not had occasion\r\nto explore this difference in detail.  \r\nFor these reasons, we do not read Brown to adopt federal\r\nlaw wholesale so as to render synonymous the two standards. \r\nInstead, we look to federal cases only for secondary persuasive\r\nauthority.  But we must focus on Massachusetts precedent,\r\nfollowing its lead as to how to apply the \"duty to pay over\"\r\nstandard.  \r\n   In practice, Massachusetts courts have not set forth a\r\nsingle set of factors to be applied in all cases, but instead have\r\nconducted a case-by-case inquiry, weighing a variety of\r\ncircumstances, including the formal governing framework within the\r\ncorporation, whether the alleged debtor bore explicit\r\nresponsibility for paying the taxes, the degree to which the\r\nindividual actually exercised control over the corporation's\r\nfinancial affairs, and whether the assessed individual knew of the\r\ntax default.  See, e.g., Berenson v. Commissioner, 604 N.E.2d 704,\r\n705 (Mass. 1992) (assessed individual was president, treasurer, and\r\n\"the person responsible for paying sales taxes\"); Fox v.\r\nCommissioner, No. 194544, slip op. 688, 700 (Mass. App. Tax Bd.\r\nJune 30, 1998) (imposing personal liability on individual serving\r\nas president and treasurer who exerted control over which creditors\r\nto pay, regularly discussed the companies' sales tax liabilities,\r\nand \"was informed of the companies' cash needs on a daily basis\");\r\ncf. Godfrey v. United States, 748 F.2d 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1984)\r\n(chairman of board not responsible person under federal law in\r\nabsence of evidence that he \"had or exercised control of the\r\ncollection, accounting for, and payment over of taxes\").  \r\n    The recent case of Commissioner v. Brown, 673 N.E.2d\r\n1225, provides the best guidance.  In Brown, the Commissioner\r\nsought to hold the treasurer of a corporation accountable for the\r\ncorporation's unpaid sales taxes.  The Commonwealth's Appellate Tax\r\nBoard rebuffed the Commissioner's efforts, ruling that Brown was\r\nunder no duty to pay over the sales taxes.  On appeal, the Supreme\r\nJudicial Court agreed that Brown was not personally liable for the\r\ntaxes.  Acknowledging that Brown was the corporation's treasurer\r\nand had check-signing authority, the court nevertheless found\r\ndispositive that \"it was not his job to pay over the taxes,\" that\r\nhe did not, in fact, have supervisory responsibility for payment of\r\nthe taxes, and that he \"had no decision-making authority over the\r\ndisbursement of the funds.\"  673 N.E.2d at 1227.\r\n   The reasoning of Brown compels a similar finding of no\r\nliability in this case.  Here, a binding agreement between the two\r\nofficers of the corporation (albeit an oral one) imposed the\r\nexclusive duty to pay the corporation's taxes on Glynn, not\r\nCoveney.  The existence of such an explicit arrangement\r\ndistinguishes this case from the typical case where a duty to pay\r\nover must be inferred from often conflicting circumstances and in\r\nthe absence of a clear delineation of corporate responsibilities. \r\nSee id. at 1227 (\"The answer would be easily arrived at . . . if an\r\nindividual had been given express authority to pay over taxes as\r\npart of his or her regular activities.\").  The officers' oral\r\nagreement here not only placed the tax-paying responsibility\r\nsquarely upon Glynn's shoulders, but by implication, withdrew the\r\nsame authority and responsibility from Coveney.  \"The separation of\r\nauthority within a business enterprise, and the limitation on\r\nauthority held by officers is a practical reality which is\r\nacknowledged and given effect by the courts.\"  O'Connor v. United\r\nStates, 956 F.2d 48, 51 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Godfrey, 748 F.2d\r\nat 1576 (\"The courts recognize the normal division of and\r\nlimitations on authority exercised by various representatives of a\r\nparticular business.\"); Bauer v. United States, 543 F.2d 142, 149\r\n(Ct. Cl. 1976) (same).\r\n   The actual practice of the officers confirms this\r\ndivision of labor.  Each person's corporate duties were strictly\r\nconfined to his area of expertise:  Coveney to food service and\r\nrestaurant management and Glynn to meeting the corporation's\r\ngeneral legal and financial obligations.  Consistent with the\r\ngoverning arrangement, Coveney never prepared or filed a tax return\r\nnor did he sign a single tax check.  Like the corporate officer in\r\nBrown, Coveney had general check-signing authority, but never once\r\nactually exercised that power in connection with or intruded in any\r\nway upon Glynn's exclusive tasks of paying the corporation's\r\nmortgage, tax, and payroll liabilities.  See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at\r\n51 (\"Most corporate officers probably do have the authority to make\r\ndisbursements . . . .  The focus must instead be on substance\r\nrather than form.\").  Moreover, the two officers did not routinely\r\ndiscuss the corporation's tax liability.  Coveney was kept in the\r\ndark about the corporation's dire financial straits until disaster\r\nloomed.  See Fox, slip op. at 700.  Virtually all of the relevant\r\ntax, payroll, mortgage, and insurance records were maintained by\r\nGlynn off-site.  These circumstances amply support the bankruptcy\r\ncourt's determination that Coveney had no duty to pay over the\r\ntaxes. \r\n   We would reach the same conclusion even if we were to\r\nrely more heavily on federal case law.  The Commissioner cites\r\nvarious federal cases for the proposition that a responsible person\r\nmay not delegate the duty to pay taxes to another.  See, e.g.,\r\nKeller v. United States, 46 F.3d 851, 854 (8th Cir. 1995).  That\r\nprinciple, however, assumes a preexisting duty to pay.  We find no\r\nsuch obligation here.  The cases cited by the Commissioner,\r\nmoreover, involved corporate officers who possessed \"significant\"\r\nor \"ultimate\" control over the corporate finances such that the\r\nperson \"can fairly be said to be responsible for the corporation's\r\nfailure to pay over its taxes.\"  Kinnie v. United States, 994 F.2d\r\n279, 283 (6th Cir. 1993).  By contrast, Coveney's authority over\r\nfinancial affairs was strictly limited to paying suppliers. \r\nDespite his title as president, he owned no more stock than any of\r\nthe other directors; he did not reserve power over other corporate\r\nmatters; and he never expanded his discrete authority by involving\r\nhimself more deeply in the corporation's legal and financial\r\nobligations.  Coveney did not have final authority over the\r\ncorporation's finances or sufficient responsibility for paying\r\ntaxes such that he \"can fairly be said\" to have \"had the authority\r\nto have the taxes paid.\"  Brown, 673 N.E.2d at 1227. \r\n   The Commissioner, turning to what he believes to be his\r\nace-in-the-hole, urges us to draw an adverse inference from\r\nCoveney's willingness to twice remedy the corporation's tax deficit\r\nif we were to accept the Commissioner's version of the facts,\r\nCoveney's actions would show that he had taken on an individual\r\nduty to pay the corporation's taxes.  Neither the bankruptcy court\r\nnor the district court saw fit to draw such a conclusion, however,\r\nand we see no error in their refusal to make such an inferential\r\nleap.  To us, Coveney's decision to place his personal finances at\r\ngreater risk reveals nothing more than his natural desire to\r\nmaintain the financial viability of the corporation of which he was\r\na co-founder.  He was not fulfilling Glynn's corporate functions or\r\nundertaking new ones. \r\nWe believe the bankruptcy court correctly held that\r\nCoveney had no individual duty under state law to pay corporate\r\nwithholding and meals taxes to the Commonwealth. \r\nAffirmed.  Costs on appeal awarded to appellee. \n",

See, e.g., Berenson v. Commissioner, 413 Mass. 831, 604 N.E.2d 704, 705 (Mass.1992) (assessed individual was president, treasurer, and \"the person responsible for paying sales taxes\");  Fox v. Commissioner, No. 194544, slip op. 688, 700, 1998 WL 391429 (Mass.App. Tax Bd. June 30, 1998) (imposing personal liability on individual serving as president and treasurer who exerted control over which creditors to pay, regularly discussed the companies' sales tax liabilities, and \"was informed of the companies' cash needs on a daily basis\");  cf.  Godfrey v. United States, 748 F.2d 1568 (Fed.Cir.1984) (chairman of board not responsible person under federal law in absence of evidence that he \"had or exercised control of the collection, accounting for, and payment over of taxes\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recent case of Commissioner v. Brown, 424 Mass. 42, 673 N.E.2d 1225, provides the best guidance.  In Brown, the Commissioner sought to hold the treasurer of a corporation accountable for the corporation's unpaid sales taxes.  The Commonwealth's Appellate Tax Board rebuffed the Commissioner's efforts, ruling that Brown was under no duty to pay over the sales taxes.  On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court agreed that Brown was not personally liable for the taxes.  Acknowledging that Brown was the corporation's treasurer and had check-signing authority, the court nevertheless found dispositive that \"it was not his job to pay over the taxes,\" that he did not, in fact, have supervisory responsibility for payment of the taxes, and that he \"had no decision-making authority over the disbursement of the funds.\"  673 N.E.2d at 1227.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning of Brown compels a similar finding of no liability in this case.  Here, a binding agreement between the two officers of the corporation (albeit an oral one) imposed the exclusive duty to pay the corporation's taxes on Glynn, not Coveney.  The existence of such an explicit arrangement distinguishes this case from the typical case where a duty to pay over must be inferred from often conflicting circumstances and in the absence of a clear delineation of corporate responsibilities.  See id. at 1227 (\"The answer would be easily arrived at ... if an individual had been given express authority to pay over taxes as part of his or her regular activities.\").  The officers' oral agreement here not only placed the tax-paying responsibility squarely upon Glynn's shoulders, but by implication, withdrew the same authority and responsibility from Coveney.  \"The separation of authority within a business enterprise, and the limitation on authority held by officers is a practical reality which is acknowledged and given effect by the courts.\"  O'Connor v. United States, 956 F.2d 48, 51 (4th Cir.1992);  see also Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576 (\"The courts recognize the normal division of and limitations on authority exercised by various representatives of a particular business.\");  Bauer v. United States, 211 Ct.Cl. 276, 543 F.2d 142, 149 (Ct.Cl.1976) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual practice of the officers confirms this division of labor.  Each person's corporate duties were strictly confined to his area of expertise:  Coveney to food service and restaurant management and Glynn to meeting the corporation's general legal and financial obligations.  Consistent with the governing arrangement, Coveney never prepared or filed a tax return nor did he sign a single tax check.  Like the corporate officer in Brown, Coveney had general check-signing authority, but never once actually exercised that power in connection with or intruded in any way upon Glynn's exclusive tasks of paying the corporation's mortgage, tax, and payroll liabilities.  See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51 (\"Most corporate officers probably do have the authority to make disbursements....  The focus must instead be on substance rather than form.\").  Moreover, the two officers did not routinely discuss the corporation's tax liability.  Coveney was kept in the dark about the corporation's dire financial straits until disaster loomed.  See Fox, slip op. at 700, 1998 WL 391429.   Virtually all of the relevant tax, payroll, mortgage, and insurance records were maintained by Glynn off-site.  These circumstances amply support the bankruptcy court's determination that Coveney had no duty to pay over the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would reach the same conclusion even if we were to rely more heavily on federal case law.  The Commissioner cites various federal cases for the proposition that a responsible person may not delegate the duty to pay taxes to another.  See, e.g., Keller v. United States, 46 F.3d 851, 854 (8th Cir.1995).  That principle, however, assumes a preexisting duty to pay.  We find no such obligation here.  The cases cited by the Commissioner, moreover, involved corporate officers who possessed \"significant\" or \"ultimate\" control over the corporate finances such that the person \"can fairly be said to be responsible for the corporation's failure to pay over its taxes.\"  Kinnie v. United States, 994 F.2d 279, 283 (6th Cir.1993).  By contrast, Coveney's authority over financial affairs was strictly limited to paying suppliers.  Despite his title as president, he owned no more stock than any of the other directors;  he did not reserve power over other corporate matters;  and he never expanded his discrete authority by involving himself more deeply in the corporation's legal and financial obligations.  Coveney did not have final authority over the corporation's finances or sufficient responsibility for paying taxes such that he \"can fairly be said\" to have \"had the authority to have the taxes paid.\"  Brown, 673 N.E.2d at 1227.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner, turning to what he believes to be his ace-in-the-hole, urges us to draw an adverse inference from Coveney's willingness to twice remedy the corporation's tax deficit--if we were to accept the Commissioner's version of the facts, Coveney's actions would show that he had taken on an individual duty to pay the corporation's taxes.  Neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court saw fit to draw such a conclusion, however, and we see no error in their refusal to make such an inferential leap.  To us, Coveney's decision to place his personal finances at greater risk reveals nothing more than his natural desire to maintain the financial viability of the corporation of which he was a co-founder.  He was not fulfilling Glynn's corporate functions or undertaking new ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the bankruptcy court correctly held that Coveney had no individual duty under state law to pay corporate withholding and meals taxes to the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Coveney was not personally liable for state taxes incurred by a corporation of which he served as president where the authority and responsibility for paying the taxes had been given exclusively to the treasurer.  The Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue (the \"Commissioner\") challenged that conclusion in federal district court.  The district court affirmed.  The Commissioner now appeals from the district court's decision to uphold the bankruptcy court's order.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about May 5, 1983, Coveney and his long-time friend Lawrence Glynn formed Covynn, Inc.  (\"Covynn\"), a Massachusetts corporation, to own and operate the Piave Square Pub. Ownership of the real estate was taken in the name of Piave Realty Trust.  Coveney held the title of president of the corporation, while Glynn served as the treasurer.  Each of them, including their wives, held the office of director and owned one-quarter of the corporate stock.  An oral agreement--the existence of which is not disputed--governed the division of labor between the officers.  Glynn, who was a practicing lawyer and certified public accountant, was to be exclusively responsible for preparing and filing necessary tax returns and ensuring that taxes, mortgage, payroll, and insurance payments were timely made.  Coveney, who had experience in food services, would take sole responsibility for the day-to-day management of the pub, including hiring and firing employees and paying the pub's suppliers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, the corporation purchased the Oxford Restaurant.  This restaurant too was operated under the same bifurcated arrangement.  Eventually, Glynn and Coveney decided that the workload was too much for Coveney, and that Coveney's duties would henceforth be limited to overseeing the Oxford Restaurant.  The corporation subsequently leased the Piave Square Pub to two of Glynn's brothers.  For a few years, the corporation prospered under the business arrangement.  Then disaster struck.  Glynn twice admitted to Coveney that he had fallen behind in paying state taxes owed by Covynn, the first time in the spring of 1988 and the second time in early 1989.  On each occasion, Coveney accepted Glynn's suggestions for keeping the corporation afloat.  In the spring of 1988, Glynn informed Coveney that Covynn owed approximately $200,000 in back taxes.  On June 6, 1988, Coveney and Glynn borrowed $200,000 from Glynn's mother to pay off the tax liability.  Coveney and Glynn co-signed a note for $200,000, which was secured by a mortgage on the property of the Oxford Restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Believing the crisis resolved, Coveney returned to daily management of the Oxford Restaurant.  During the next several weeks, Coveney asked Glynn on several occasions whether corporate taxes were being kept current.  Each time, Glynn assured Coveney that the taxes were being paid on time.  Glynn changed his tune a few months later, however, acknowledging that he had again fallen behind in paying Covynn's taxes.  In March 1989, Glynn told Coveney that he paid the due taxes from an escrow account maintained for his non-Covynn legal clients, and that the money had to be immediately returned to the fund.  Coveney was shocked at the new developments, but again agreed to help Glynn out of the predicament.  The two borrowed an additional $210,000 from Glynn's mother.  This time, Coveney secured the loan by mortgaging his own home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By mid-1989, the business had completely unraveled.  Covynn filed for bankruptcy.  Creditors began to sue Covynn, naming Coveney as a codefendant;  protracted bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation commenced.  In April 1994, the Commissioner informed Coveney that the Commonwealth deemed him liable for Covynn's unpaid meals and withholding taxes from January 1, 1988 through August 31, 1989.  By this time, Coveney and his wife had filed for Chapter 13 protection.  Accordingly, the Commissioner filed a proof of claim against Coveney for $63,144.64 and later amended his claim upward.  All told, the Commissioner sought to recover $251,527.03 in corporate back taxes from Coveney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts disallowed the Commissioner's claim, finding that Coveney had no \"duty to pay over the taxes\" under Massachusetts law because his obligations to the corporation \"were confined to supervising the restaurant's operations\" and did not extend to preparing tax returns or paying taxes.  In re Coveney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1933716\"><a href=\"/opinion/1933716/in-re-coveney/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span>, 804 (Bankr.D.Mass.1996).

Commissioner, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></span>, 705 (Mass.1992) (assessed individual was president, treasurer, and \"the person responsible for paying sales taxes\");  Fox v.

Brown, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1225</span></span>, provides the best guidance.  In Brown, the Commissioner sought to hold the treasurer of a corporation accountable for the corporation's unpaid sales taxes.  The Commonwealth's Appellate Tax Board rebuffed the Commissioner's efforts, ruling that Brown was under no duty to pay over the sales taxes.  On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court agreed that Brown was not personally liable for the taxes.  Acknowledging that Brown was the corporation's treasurer and had check-signing authority, the court nevertheless found dispositive that \"it was not his job to pay over the taxes,\" that he did not, in fact, have supervisory responsibility for payment of the taxes, and that he \"had no decision-making authority over the disbursement of the funds.\"  673 N.E.2d at 1227.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning of Brown compels a similar finding of no liability in this case.  Here, a binding agreement between the two officers of the corporation (albeit an oral one) imposed the exclusive duty to pay the corporation's taxes on Glynn, not Coveney.  The existence of such an explicit arrangement distinguishes this case from the typical case where a duty to pay over must be inferred from often conflicting circumstances and in the absence of a clear delineation of corporate responsibilities.  See id. at 1227 (\"The answer would be easily arrived at ... if an individual had been given express authority to pay over taxes as part of his or her regular activities.\").  The officers' oral agreement here not only placed the tax-paying responsibility squarely upon Glynn's shoulders, but by implication, withdrew the same authority and responsibility from Coveney.  \"The separation of authority within a business enterprise, and the limitation on authority held by officers is a practical reality which is acknowledged and given effect by the courts.\"  O'Connor v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577206\"><a href=\"/opinion/577206/james-m-oconnor-v-united-states-of-america-third-party-v-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 51 (4th Cir.1992);  see also Godfrey, 748 F.2d at 1576 (\"The courts recognize the normal division of and limitations on authority exercised by various representatives of a particular business.\");  Bauer v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></span>, 149 (Ct.Cl.1976) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual practice of the officers confirms this division of labor.  Each person's corporate duties were strictly confined to his area of expertise:  Coveney to food service and restaurant management and Glynn to meeting the corporation's general legal and financial obligations.  Consistent with the governing arrangement, Coveney never prepared or filed a tax return nor did he sign a single tax check.  Like the corporate officer in Brown, Coveney had general check-signing authority, but never once actually exercised that power in connection with or intruded in any way upon Glynn's exclusive tasks of paying the corporation's mortgage, tax, and payroll liabilities.  See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51 (\"Most corporate officers probably do have the authority to make disbursements....  The focus must instead be on substance rather than form.\").  Moreover, the two officers did not routinely discuss the corporation's tax liability.  Coveney was kept in the dark about the corporation's dire financial straits until disaster loomed.  See Fox, slip op. at 700, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">391429</span></span>.   Virtually all of the relevant tax, payroll, mortgage, and insurance records were maintained by Glynn off-site.  These circumstances amply support the bankruptcy court's determination that Coveney had no duty to pay over the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would reach the same conclusion even if we were to rely more heavily on federal case law.  The Commissioner cites various federal cases for the proposition that a responsible person may not delegate the duty to pay taxes to another.  See, e.g., Keller v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687678\"><a href=\"/opinion/687678/joseph-keller-v-united-states-v-lillian-halstead/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>, 854 (8th Cir.1995).  That principle, however, assumes a preexisting duty to pay.  We find no such obligation here.  The cases cited by the Commissioner, moreover, involved corporate officers who possessed \"significant\" or \"ultimate\" control over the corporate finances such that the person \"can fairly be said to be responsible for the corporation's failure to pay over its taxes.\"  Kinnie v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607895\"><a href=\"/opinion/607895/william-a-kinnie-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 283 (6th Cir.1993).  By contrast, Coveney's authority over financial affairs was strictly limited to paying suppliers.  Despite his title as president, he owned no more stock than any of the other directors;  he did not reserve power over other corporate matters;  and he never expanded his discrete authority by involving himself more deeply in the corporation's legal and financial obligations.  Coveney did not have final authority over the corporation's finances or sufficient responsibility for paying taxes such that he \"can fairly be said\" to have \"had the authority to have the taxes paid.\"  Brown, 673 N.E.2d at 1227.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner, turning to what he believes to be his ace-in-the-hole, urges us to draw an adverse inference from Coveney's willingness to twice remedy the corporation's tax deficit--if we were to accept the Commissioner's version of the facts, Coveney's actions would show that he had taken on an individual duty to pay the corporation's taxes.  Neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court saw fit to draw such a conclusion, however, and we see no error in their refusal to make such an inferential leap.  To us, Coveney's decision to place his personal finances at greater risk reveals nothing more than his natural desire to maintain the financial viability of the corporation of which he was a co-founder.  He was not fulfilling Glynn's corporate functions or undertaking new ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the bankruptcy court correctly held that Coveney had no individual duty under state law to pay corporate withholding and meals taxes to the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
