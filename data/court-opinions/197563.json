Associated Fisheries of Maine\r\n\n(AFM) and its amicus, the Seafarers International Union, warn that\r\n\nthe final version of a fishery management plan promulgated by the\r\n\nSecretary of Commerce (the Secretary) could have significant\r\n\nadverse effects on the fishing industry in the Northeast and that\r\n\nfishermen caught in the regulatory net will not be able to survive\r\n\nfinancially. They unsuccessfully asked the district court to\r\n\ninvalidate the Secretary's final rulemaking and thereby avert this\r\n\npotential calamity. They now ask us for the same relief, urging\r\n\nthat the Secretary failed to comply with both the Magnuson Act, 16\r\n\nU.S.C. SS 1801-1882 (1994), and the Regulatory Flexibility Act\r\n\n(RFA), 5 U.S.C.A. SS 601-612 (1994 &amp; Supp. 1997). Although we have\r\n\nconsiderable empathy for the fishermens' concerns, we conclude,\r\n\nafter wading through an administrative record which comprises\r\n\nroughly 30,000 pages, that the Secretary acted within his lawful\r\n\npurview.\r\n\nI. THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r\n\n          Responding to depletion of the nation's fish stocks due\r\n\nto overfishing, Congress enacted the Magnuson Act in 1976 to\r\n\nprotect fishery resources.   See 16 U.S.C. S 1801(a).   The Act\r\n\ncreated eight regional fishery management councils, each of which\r\n\nhas responsibility for fashioning a fishery management plan (FMP)\r\n\n     After this litigation had begun, Congress passed the\r\nSustainable Fisheries Act, which amended the Magnuson Act (referred\r\nto now as the Magnuson-Stevens Act). See Pub. L. No. 104-297, 110\r\nStat. 3559 (Oct. 11, 1996). All references herein are to the\r\nMagnuson Act, which was in effect when the challenged rules were\r\npromulgated, not to the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nto regulate commercial fishing within a particular geographic\r\n\nregion.  See id. SS 1852(a)(1)-(8), 1852(h)(1). When a proposed\r\n\nFMP (or a plan amendment) is developed, the council must submit it\r\n\nto the Secretary for review.   See id. S 1853(c). The Secretary\r\n\nthen determines whether the proposed FMP is consistent not only\r\n\nwith the Magnuson Act's seven national standards for fishery\r\n\nconservation and management, see  id. S 1851(a)(1)-(7), but also\r\n\nwith other applicable law, including the RFA,        see  id. SS\r\n\n1854(a)(1)(B), 1855(e). In making this determination, the\r\n\nSecretary must publish an appropriate notice,        see  id. S\r\n\n1854(a)(1)(C), consider the comments engendered in response\r\n\nthereto, \r                  see \r                      id. S 1854(a)(2)(A), and consult with the Coast Guard\r\n\nanent enforcement, see  id. S 1854(a)(2)(C). If the Secretary\r\n\napproves the amendment, he then promulgates final implementing\r\n\nregulations, which are subject to judicial review.     See id. S\r\n\n1855(b).\r\n\nII. THE COURSE OF EVENTS\r\n\n          The New England Fishery Management Council (the Council)\r\n\nhas authority over commercial fishing in the Atlantic Ocean off the\r\n\nNew England coast.  See id. S 1852(a)(1). Under its aegis, the\r\n\nmanagement and conservation of the New England Groundfish Fishery\r\n\nhas had a tangled history. See \r                                        generally Peter Shelley et al., \r                                                                        The\r\n\nNew England Fisheries Crisis:\r                                        \r                                        What Have We Learned?\r                                                            , 9 Tul. Envtl.\r\n\nL.J. 221, 223-33 (1996).  When less intrusive efforts did not\r\n\n     Groundfish include cod, haddock, flounder, and other species\r\nthat dwell near the ocean floor. \r                                          See Shelley, \r                                                       supra, 9 Tul. Envtl.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nprevent overfishing, the Council developed the Northeast\r\n\nMultispecies Fishery Management Plan in 1985. The Secretary\r\n\napproved it only as a stopgap. Four amendments to the interim rule\r\n\nfollowed, none of which proved adequate.    See Conservation \r                                                                        Law\r\n\nFound. \r                 of \r                    New \r                        Eng., \r                              Inc. v.  Franklin, 989 F.2d 54, 58 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1993). Litigation over the last of these amendments resulted in a\r\n\nconsent decree. The decree established a timetable for adopting an\r\n\nFMP that would reverse the continuing depletion of cod, flounder,\r\n\nand haddock stocks within specified periods.  See id.\r\n\n          In 1994, the Council recommended, and the Secretary,\r\n\nacting through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the\r\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, approved Amendment\r\n\n5. This amendment sought to eliminate overfishing of cod, haddock,\r\n\nand yellowtail flounder stocks by sharply reducing permissible\r\n\nfishing over a five to seven year period.  See 59 Fed. Reg. 9872\r\n\n(1994) (final rule). To achieve this goal, the amendment proposed\r\n\na gradual reduction in the annual number of working days at sea\r\n\n(DAS) for certain fishing vessels and created three classes of\r\n\npermits. See 50 C.F.R. SS 651.22, 651.4 (1995). The class that is\r\n\nrelevant here comprises limited access multispecies permits (which,\r\n\nin turn, are subdivided into fleet and individual permits).\r\n\nAmendment 5 sets up a DAS notification program that requires\r\n\nvessels covered by fleet permits to notify the NMFS of departure\r\n\nand arrival times.  See id. S 651.29. In addition, the amendment\r\n\nL.J. at 223 &amp; n.4 (listing the 13 species included in the\r\ngroundfish management plan).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nestablishes a vessel tracking system (VTS) that is intended to\r\n\nfunction by means of electronic devices installed on board vessels\r\n\nwith individual permits. See \r                                       id. S 651.28. Because the VTS is not\r\n\nyet operational, both classes of permit holders must satisfy the\r\n\ncall-in requirements of the DAS notification program for the time\r\n\nbeing.  See id. S 651.29(a)(2).\r\n\n          Dismayed by the Secretary's handiwork, AFM challenged\r\n\nAmendment 5 in Maine's federal district court. By that time,\r\n\nhowever, haddock and yellowtail stocks had collapsed, and cod\r\n\nstocks were near collapse. See NMFS, \r                                               Report of the 18th Northeast\r\n\nRegional Stock Assessment Workshop (18th SAW):  The Plenary 53-54\r\n\n(1994). In light of this troubling new information, Amendment 5\r\n\nseemed inadequate either to protect or rebuild these stocks, and\r\n\nNMFS's Stock Assessment Review Committee recommended that the\r\n\nCouncil reduce ichthyic mortality to as low a level as possible.\r\n\nSee id. at 53. In response, the Council adopted Amendment 6 (an\r\n\nemergency measure designed to protect haddock,  see 59 Fed. Reg.\r\n\n32,134 (1994)) and thereafter developed Amendment 7.\r\n\n          The Secretary promulgated Amendment 7 as a final rule\r\n\nafter notice and comment. See 61 Fed. Reg. 8540 (proposed rule) &amp;\r\n\n27,710 (1996) (final rule) (to be codified at 50 C.F.R. pt. 651).\r\n\nAmong other things, Amendment 7 seeks to reduce ichthyic mortality\r\n\nrates and rebuild multispecies stocks by (1) setting annual\r\n\n\"allowable catch\" targets for regulated species, (2) orchestrating\r\n\nnew area closures, and (3) implementing further DAS cutbacks\r\n\n(including acceleration of the reduction schedule originally\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nestablished in Amendment 5). Although the Secretary acknowledged\r\n\nthe significant negative economic impacts (especially on trawl\r\n\nvessels) which Amendment 7 would invite, he concluded that\r\n\nconservation of the fishery would yield greater long-term benefits.\r\n\nSee 61 Fed. Reg. at 27,731.\r\n\n          Unmollified, AFM amended its pending judicial complaint\r\n\nto challenge Amendment 7 as well as Amendment 5. It alleged, inter\r\n\nalia, that both amendments violated the Magnuson Act and the RFA.\r\n\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district\r\n\ncourt then held a one-day informational hearing, during which the\r\n\nparties' experts explained their respective positions on\r\n\nscientific, economic, and ecological principles.\r\n\n          In the end, the court granted summary judgment in the\r\n\nSecretary's favor. See \r                                 Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc.\r                                                                  v. \r                                                                     Daley,\r\n\n954 F. Supp. 383 (D. Me. 1997). As to issues that are relevant in\r\n\nthis appeal, the court held that the newly enacted judicial review\r\n\nprovisions of the RFA did not apply retroactively, and that, in all\r\n\nevents, the Secretary had complied with the RFA.  See id. at 386-\r\n\n87. The court also held that the Secretary's rulemaking did not\r\n\nrun afoul of the Magnuson Act.     See id. at 388-90. AFM now\r\n\n     Because the Secretary recognized his inability to foresee the\r\neffect of various measures with certitude, he inserted in Amendment\r\n7, as in Amendment 5, a process that allows him to adjust DAS\r\nallocations and requirements as stocks recover or as other\r\ncircumstances change.  See 50 C.F.R. S 651.40.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nappeals.\r\n\nIII. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\r\n\nnovo.  See Coyne v. Taber \r                                    Partners \r                                             I, 53 F.3d 454, 457 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1995); \r                Massachusetts Dept. of Pub. Welfare\r                                                    v. \r                                                       Secretary of Agric.\r                                                                          ,\r\n\n984 F.2d 514, 520 (1st Cir. 1993). This rubric has a special twist\r\n\nin the administrative law context. The Magnuson Act incorporates\r\n\nthe familiar standard of review associated with the Administrative\r\n\nProcedure Act (APA).   See 16 U.S.C. S 1855(b). Where the APA\r\n\nstandard obtains, a court may set aside an administrative action\r\n\nonly if that action is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary\r\n\nto law.  See 5 U.S.C. S 706(2)(A)-(D). Because the APA standard\r\n\naffords great deference to agency decisionmaking and because the\r\n\nSecretary's action is presumed valid, judicial review, even at the\r\n\nsummary judgment stage, is narrow.     See Citizens  \r                                                               to  \r                                                                   Preserve\r\n\nOverton \r                  Park, \r                        Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415-16 (1971);  Sierra\r\n\nClub v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 769 (1st Cir. 1992). Consequently,\r\n\nour brief   like that of the district court   is only to determine\r\n\nwhether the Secretary's decision to promulgate the fishery\r\n\nregulation was consonant with his statutory powers, reasoned, and\r\n\n     In the district court, AFM advanced claims under various other\r\nstatutory provisions, as well as claims implicating constitutional\r\nstandards and executive orders. None was successful.          See\r\nAssociated \r                     Fisheries, 954 F. Supp. at 385 &amp; n.3. AFM does not\r\npursue any of these theories on appeal, and we express no opinion\r\non them.\r\n          We note, moreover, that in this court, as below, AFM\r\nchallenges Amendment 5, as modified by Amendment 7. For\r\nsimplicity's sake, we refer mainly to the latter.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.

Kreps, 563 F.2d 1052, 1055\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1977).\r\n\n          An agency rule is arbitrary and capricious if the agency\r\n\nlacks a rational basis for adopting it   for example, if the agency\r\n\nrelied on improper factors, failed to consider pertinent aspects of\r\n\nthe problem, offered a rationale contradicting the evidence before\r\n\nit, or reached a conclusion so implausible that it cannot be\r\n\nattributed to a difference of opinion or the application of agency\r\n\nexpertise. See \r                         Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass'n\r                                                    v. \r                                                       State Farm Mut.

Even if a reviewing court\r\n\ndisagrees with the agency's conclusions, it cannot substitute its\r\n\njudgment for that of the agency.   See Overton \r                                                         Park, 401 U.S. at\r\n\n416; Kreps, 563 F.2d at 1055.\r\n\n          Finally, when reviewing agency action, we apply the same\r\n\nlegal standards that pertain in the district court and afford no\r\n\nspecial deference to that court's decision.    See  Massachusetts\r\n\nDept. of Pub. Welfare, 984 F.2d at 521 n.5. This approach is not\r\n\naltered simply because the court held an informational hearing at\r\n\nwhich experts testified. Although some degree of deference may be\r\n\nappropriate if a district court's determination turns on factual\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nfindings, evidence presented by witnesses, or \"even upon lengthy\r\n\ndistrict court proceedings in which knowledgeable counsel explain\r\n\nthe agency's decisionmaking process in detail,\"   Sierra \r                                                                   Club v.\r\n\nMarsh, 769 F.2d 868, 872 (1st Cir. 1985), this case does not\r\n\nimplicate that principle. The district judge made it pellucid that\r\n\nthe dissertations which he entertained \"were not evidence, but\r\n\nrather were advocacy presentations by non-lawyers skilled in their\r\n\nrespective areas and therefore better able to present the material\r\n\nto [the court].\"  Associated \r                                       Fisheries, 954 F. Supp. at 388 n.9.\r\n\nA presentation which serves only to educate the district court, not\r\n\nto enlarge the administrative record, does not affect the standard\r\n\nof judicial review. See \r                                  Fisherman's Dock Coop., Inc.\r                                                               v. \r                                                                  Brown, 75\r\n\nF.3d 164, 168 (4th Cir. 1996).\r\n\nIV. CLAIMS IMPLICATING THE MAGNUSON ACT\r\n\n          AFM asseverates that Amendment 7 violates the Magnuson\r\n\nAct because the regulation is unnecessary to achieve the\r\n\nSecretary's stated goals and inconsistent with the national\r\n\nstandards embodied in the Act. Neither asseveration holds water.\r\n\n                  A.  The Need for Amendment 7.\r\n\n          The record contradicts AFM's assertion that Amendment 7\r\n\nis not necessary to achieve a rebuilding of groundfish stock\r\n\nbecause the status quo suffices. The Secretary was presented with\r\n\nreliable scientific data indicating that stocks had collapsed; he\r\n\nwas advised that the prophylactic measures specified in Amendment\r\n\n5 were clearly inadequate to alleviate the steadily worsening\r\n\nplight; and he also was told that certain ichthyic mortality rates\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nought to be reduced significantly. Responding to this influx of\r\n\nnew information, the Council conducted extensive scientific\r\n\nanalyses and devised Amendment 7 as a means of ensuring the long-\r\n\nterm stability of the fishery. The Secretary studied the data,\r\n\nweighed plethoric comments, and decided to promulgate the rule.\r\n\n          Having carefully reviewed the record, we cannot say that\r\n\nthe Secretary exercised his discretion in an irrational, mindless,\r\n\nor whimsical manner. When an agency is faced with conflicting\r\n\nscientific views and chooses among them, its decision cannot be\r\n\ntermed arbitrary or capricious. Indeed, a reviewing court must\r\n\nafford special deference to an agency's scientific expertise where,\r\n\nas here, that expertise is applied in areas within the agency's\r\n\nspecialized field of competence. See \r                                               Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co.\r                                                                         v.\r\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 103 (1983);\r\n\nUnited \r                 States v. Members \r                                   of \r                                      Estate \r                                             of \r                                                Boothby, 16 F.3d 19, 21-22\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n             B.  Compliance with National Standards.\r\n\n          The Magnuson Act sets up a series of seven national\r\n\nstandards.  See 16 U.S.C. S 1851(a)(1)-(7). To ensure compliance\r\n\nwith these standards, the responsible agency must perform a\r\n\ncost/benefit analysis ancillary to the promulgation of an FMP.\r\n\nHere, the analysis for Amendment 7 showed a projected net benefit\r\n\nof $18 million over the ten-year rebuilding period. AFM insists\r\n\nthat the Secretary put his thumb on the scale when conducting this\r\n\nanalysis, and that Amendment 7 therefore fails to satisfy the\r\n\nnational standards. Specifically, AFM charges that the Secretary\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\narbitrarily disregarded certain enforcement and compliance expenses\r\n\nwhich, when properly included, would demonstrate that the likely\r\n\ncosts of Amendment 7 substantially exceed the likely benefits.\r\n\n          The Magnuson Act defines \"optimum yield\" as the amount of\r\n\nfish which will secure the greatest overall benefit to the nation\r\n\nbased on the maximum sustainable yield from a fishery, as modified\r\n\nby relevant economic, social, or ecological factors.   See id. S\r\n\n1802(21). The bedrock principle of National Standard 1 is that\r\n\nconservation and resource management measures, such as Amendment 7,\r\n\n\"shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis,\r\n\nthe optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing\r\n\nindustry.\"  Id. S 1851(a)(1). Relatedly, National Standard 7\r\n\nrequires that \"[c]onservation and management measures shall, where\r\n\npracticable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.\"\r\n\nId. S 1851(a)(7). In pursuance of his statutory duty,  see id. S\r\n\n1851(b), the Secretary established regulatory guidelines to assure\r\n\nthat FMPs would be developed in accordance with these national\r\n\nstandards.   See 50 C.F.R. pt. 602 (1995). The regulatory\r\n\nguidelines make it plain that the agency should weigh the costs\r\n\nassociated with an FMP (including industry compliance and\r\n\nenforcement costs) against the forecasted benefits.    See id. S\r\n\n602.17(b)(2)(vii), (d).\r\n\n          In this case, the Secretary excluded Coast Guard\r\n\nenforcement costs from the calculus. AFM terms this exclusion\r\n\narbitrary, but the administrative record belies that\r\n\ncharacterization. The Secretary specifically addressed this issue\r\n\n                               12\r\r\n\nand the documentation supporting the final rules contains a\r\n\nrational explanation for his decision. Although the Coast Guard\r\n\nestimated that Amendment 7 would increase enforcement costs by\r\n\napproximately $20,800,000 per year, its estimate assumed sea-based\r\n\nenforcement whereas Amendment 7, as drafted, relied primarily on\r\n\nland-based enforcement through the notification and tracking\r\n\nsystems.  See 61 Fed. Reg. at 27,719. Even if certain sea-based\r\n\ncosts occurred under Amendment 7, the Secretary explained, they\r\n\nwould not comprise increases in overall costs because they would\r\n\n\"actually represent programmatic improvements that could also be\r\n\nexpected to be made in the out years of [Amendment 5].\"  Id. For\r\n\nthis reason, the Secretary's cost/benefit analysis explicitly\r\n\nassumed that Amendment 7 would not yield enforcement costs greater\r\n\nthan those which would have been borne under Amendment 5.  See 61\r\n\nFed. Reg. at 27,719, &amp; 27,722.\r\n\n          In our view, this explanation is sufficiently logical,\r\n\nand sufficiently rooted in the record, to dispose of AFM's argument\r\n\nconcerning Coast Guard enforcement costs. It also answers AFM's\r\n\nadditional argument that the Secretary improperly excluded the\r\n\ncosts of industry compliance with Amendment 7. The Secretary's\r\n\nassumption   that compliance costs will not vary materially as\r\n\n     Moreover, as alluded to in agency correspondence and further\r\nexplicated during the informational hearing held by the district\r\ncourt, the Secretary considered the Coast Guard's estimate to be\r\nbudgetary in nature and not rooted in cost increases which were\r\nlikely to accompany the implementation of Amendment 7. The\r\nSecretary must be accorded some latitude to make such judgment\r\ncalls.  Cf. Sierra Club, 976 F.2d at 771.\r\n\n                               13\r\r\n\nbetween Amendment 5 and Amendment 7   flows rationally from\r\n\nAmendment 7's retention of the enforcement mechanism established\r\n\nunder Amendment 5.  See 50 C.F.R. S 651.29. Consequently, since\r\n\nAmendment 7 does not alter the taxonomy that determines which\r\n\nvessels will require VTS installations, AFM's claim that the new\r\n\nregulation fails to account for added VTS-related costs lacks\r\n\nforce.\r\n\n          To recapitulate, the record reveals that the Secretary\r\n\ncarefully considered the enforcement measures associated with\r\n\nAmendment 7 and, consistent with the evidence before him, concluded\r\n\n(1) that the Coast Guard estimate was largely a figment of\r\n\nbureaucratic imagination which did not track the actual enforcement\r\n\nmechanism needed for the FMP, and therefore did not warrant\r\n\ninclusion in the calculus of likely costs and benefits, and (2)\r\n\nthat compliance costs for the fishing industry would remain roughly\r\n\nthe same under Amendment 7. Whether or not we, if writing on a\r\n\npristine page, would have reached the same set of conclusions is\r\n\nnot the issue. What matters is that the administrative judgment,\r\n\nright or wrong, derives from the record, possesses a rational\r\n\nbasis, and evinces no mistake of law. Consequently, it merits our\r\n\napprobation.  See State \r                                  Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; Kreps, 563 F.2d at\r\n\n1056.\r\n\n          The sockdolager, of course, is the enormous difficulty of\r\n\nestimating enforcement costs in advance.       Administrative\r\n\n     The agency discussed this difficulty in the final\r\nenvironmental impact statement and noted that it was compounded\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\ndecisionmaking is not an exact science, and judicial review must\r\n\nrecognize that some arbitrariness is inherent in the exercise of\r\n\ndiscretion amid uncertainty. Accordingly, courts reviewing this\r\n\ntype of administrative decision must leave room for a certain\r\n\namount of play in the joints.   See Fisherman's \r                                                          Dock, 75 F.3d at\r\n\n171-72; Alaska Factory Trawler Ass'n v. Baldridge, 831 F.2d 1456,\r\n\n1460 (9th Cir. 1987) (per curiam). Here, the reasons offered to\r\n\nexplain the Secretary's determination that Amendment 7 is\r\n\nconsistent with the national standards reflect an understanding of\r\n\nanalytical factors and constitute a rational exercise of\r\n\ndeliberative decisionmaking. Hence, we cannot say that this\r\n\ndetermination offends the applicable standard of review.\r\n\nV. CLAIMS IMPLICATING THE REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT\r\n\n          An FMP (or a plan amendment) promulgated pursuant to the\r\n\nMagnuson Act must be consistent with the RFA.   See 16 U.S.C. SS\r\n\n1854(a)(1)(B), 1855(e). AFM next charges that the Secretary failed\r\n\nto meet this obligation when promulgating Amendment 7.\r\n\n          Some background may prove helpful. Congress enacted the\r\n\nRFA to encourage administrative agencies to consider the potential\r\n\nimpact of nascent federal regulations on small businesses.    See\r\n\nPub. L. No. 96-354, S 2(b), 94 Stat. 1164, 1165 (1980) (statement\r\n\nof purpose); \r                      see \r                          generally Paul R. Verkuil, \r                                                    A Critical Guide to the\r\n\nRegulatory \r                     Flexibility \r                                 Act, 1982 Duke L.J. 213, 215-26 (1982).\r\n\nUnder the RFA, an agency that publishes a notice of proposed\r\n\nhere because enforcement resources are shared among several\r\nmanagement plans.\r\n\n                               15\r\r\n\nrulemaking must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis\r\n\n(IRFA) describing the effect of the proposed rule on small\r\n\nbusinesses and discussing alternatives that might minimize adverse\r\n\neconomic consequences.  See 5 U.S.C. S 603. When promulgating a\r\n\nfinal rule, the agency not only must prepare a final regulatory\r\n\nflexibility analysis (FRFA) but also must make copies available to\r\n\nmembers of the public and publish directions for obtaining such\r\n\ncopies.  See id. S 604.\r\n\n          The Secretary promulgated Amendment 7 on May 31, 1996.\r\n\nAt that time, the law expressly prohibited judicial review of\r\n\nagency compliance with sections 603 and 604.  See id. S 611;  see\r\n\nalso Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d 401, 404-05 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\r\n\nApproximately two months earlier, however, Congress had amended the\r\n\nRFA by enacting the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness\r\n\nAct (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, tit. II, 110 Stat. 857, 864-68\r\n\n(1996). The 1996 Amendments reshaped the contours of the mandated\r\n\nflexibility analysis and provided for judicial review of the\r\n\nagency's product.   See  id. SS 241, 242, 110 Stat. at 864-66\r\n\n(codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. SS 604(a), 611(a)(1) (Supp.\r\n\n1997)). Because Congress delayed the effective date of these\r\n\namendments until ninety days after passage,  see  id. S 245, 110\r\n\nStat. at 868, they were not in effect when the Secretary\r\n\npromulgated Amendment 7.\r\n\n                      A.  Judicial Review.\r\n\n          The threshold question is whether we have jurisdiction to\r\n\nreview AFM's claim under the RFA. This question depends on whether\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nthe judicial review provision contained in the 1996 Amendments\r\n\napplies retrospectively.\r\n\n          AFM argues that the judicial review provision should be\r\n\naccorded retroactive application under \r                                                Landgraf v. \r                                                           USI Film Prods.\r                                                                          ,\r\n\n511 U.S. 244 (1994). Judge Hornby concluded otherwise, remarking\r\n\nthe absence of any express legislative intent to apply the SBREFA\r\n\nretroactively, and reasoning that, inasmuch as the 1996 Amendments\r\n\nwere \"one legislative package,\" \"[i]t would be anomalous to apply\r\n\nthe judicial review portion of the 1996 amendments to past agency\r\n\nactions but at the same time not apply the substance of those\r\n\namendments.\"  Associated Fisheries, 954 F. Supp. at 387.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court decision in      Landgraf and, more\r\n\nrecently, the decisions in \r                                    Lindh v. \r                                            Murphy, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997),\r\n\nand Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, 117 S. Ct. 1871 (1997),\r\n\nprovide a roadmap for deciding questions of retroactivity. The\r\n\nroadmap is not easy to use, and in this case the guideposts point\r\n\nin more than one direction. On one hand, the delayed effective\r\n\ndate points toward prospective application, \r                                                    see \r                                                        Wright v. \r                                                                  FEMA, 913\r\n\nF.2d 1566, 1572 &amp; n.13 (11th Cir. 1990); \r                                                 Criger v. \r                                                           Becton, 902 F.2d\r\n\n1348, 1351 (8th Cir. 1990), and the legislative history of the 1996\r\n\nAmendments points the same way,   see 142 Cong. Rec. E571, E574\r\n\n(daily ed. Apr. 19, 1996) (statement of Rep. Hyde) (twice\r\n\nindicating that judicial review would be available for rules\r\n\npromulgated after the effective date). On the other hand, the new\r\n\njudicial review provision does not affect substantive rights but\r\n\nmerely confers jurisdiction, and courts often give retroactive\r\n\n                               17\r\r\n\neffect to such statutes.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 274; but  see\r\n\nHughes Aircraft\r                        , 117 S. Ct. at 1878 (drawing a distinction between\r\n\nan amendment which merely allocates jurisdiction among fora and one\r\n\nwhich creates jurisdiction where none previously existed, and\r\n\nstating that the latter is subject to the presumption against\r\n\nretroactivity). Moreover, the Third Circuit, contradicting Judge\r\n\nHornby's \"one legislative package\" rationale, recently held that\r\n\nthe 1996 Amendments were severable and that the judicial review\r\n\nprovision could be applied to a legislative rule promulgated before\r\n\ntheir effective date.   See Southwestern \r                                                    Pa. \r                                                        Growth \r                                                               Alliance v.\r\n\nBrowner,     F.3d    ,     (3d Cir. 1997) [No. 96-3364, 1997 WL\r\n\n418420, at *15-16].\r\n\n          In the last analysis, it is unnecessary to decide the\r\n\nretroactivity question here. We have long adhered to the practice\r\n\nthat, when an appeal presents a jurisdictional riddle, yet the\r\n\nmerits of the underlying issue are readily resolved in favor of the\r\n\nparty challenging jurisdiction, a court may sidestep the quandary\r\n\nand simply dispose of the appeal on the merits. See \r                                                              United States\r\n\nv. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 715 (1st Cir.) (collecting cases), cert.\r\n\ndenied, 117 S. Ct. 378 (1996). We follow that praxis today.\r\n\n                 B.  The Renovated Section 604.\r\n\n          By electing to reach the merits,  we do not avoid the\r\n\n     Our task is made much easier because the lower court, though\r\nconcluding that the judicial review provision did not apply,\r\nnonetheless proceeded to reach the merits and, in an alternate\r\nholding, laid out a blueprint that makes very good sense.     See\r\nAssociated \r                     Fisheries, 954 F. Supp. at 386-87. We commend Judge\r\nHornby for his prudent belt-and-suspenders approach.\r\n\n                               18\r\r\n\nquestion of retroactivity entirely. AFM contends that the\r\n\nSecretary failed to comply with section 604 of the RFA both in its\r\n\noriginal and renovated incarnations. As our next order of\r\n\nbusiness, we address whether the amended version applies\r\n\nretroactively to this case.\r\n\n          We hold that the Secretary's compliance with the RFA\r\n\nshould be measured against the original requirements of section\r\n\n604, that is, against the law as it read when the Secretary\r\n\npromulgated Amendment 7. The 1996 Amendments substantively altered\r\n\nsection 604 by reformulating and augmenting the required content of\r\n\nan FRFA.  See 5 U.S.C.A. S 604(a) (Supp. 1997). The renovated\r\n\nversion now requires that an FRFA contain the following:\r\n\n               (1) a succinct statement of the need for,\r\n          and objectives of, the rule;\r\n               (2) a summary of the significant issues\r\n          raised by the public comments in response to\r\n          the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, a\r\n          summary of the assessment of the agency of\r\n          such issues, and a statement of any changes\r\n          made in the proposed rule as a result of such\r\n          comments;\r\n               (3) a description of and an estimate of\r\n          the number of small entities to which the rule\r\n          will apply or an explanation of why no such\r\n          estimate is available;\r\n               (4) a description of the projected\r\n          reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance\r\n          requirements of the rule, including an\r\n          estimate of the classes of small entities\r\n          which will be subject to the requirement and\r\n          the type of professional skills necessary for\r\n          preparation of the report or record; and\r\n               (5) a description of the steps the agency\r\n          has taken to minimize the significant economic\r\n          impact on small entities consistent with the\r\n          stated objectives of applicable statutes,\r\n          including a statement of the factual, policy,\r\n          and legal reasons for selecting the\r\n          alternative adopted in the final rule and why\r\n          each one of the other significant alternatives\r\n\n                               19\r\r\n\n          to the rule considered by the agency which\r\n          affect the impact on small entities was\r\n          rejected.\r\n\n5 U.S.C.A. S 604(a) (Supp. 1997).\r\n\n          A comparison of this iteration with the prior version, 5\r\n\nU.S.C. S 604(a) (1994), reveals that subsections (3) and (4) are\r\n\nbrand new insofar as FRFAs are concerned, and that subsection (5),\r\n\nmodifying the former subsection (3), imposes more specific content\r\n\nrequirements. Since the Secretary completed the FRFA and\r\n\npromulgated Amendment 7 before the effective date of the 1996\r\n\nAmendments, applying the neoteric version of section 604 would\r\n\nimpose new strictures with respect to matters already completed,\r\n\nand, thus, would contravene the rule against retroactivity.   See\r\n\nLandgraf, 511 U.S. at 280.\r\n\n          AFM offers only a weak rejoinder. It says that\r\n\nretroactive application would not impose new duties because\r\n\nCongress passed the 1996 Amendments before the agency prepared the\r\n\nFRFA. That is so   but it is beside the point. SBREFA's effective\r\n\ndate constitutes the cut-off point, and the Secretary had completed\r\n\nand published both the FRFA and the final rule prior to that time.\r\n\nThus, imposing incremental requirements on these actions would have\r\n\nan impermissible retroactive effect.  See id.\r\n\n                  C.  The Original Section 604.\r\n\n          Having determined that the original version of section\r\n\n604 governs our RFA-related review of Amendment 7, we turn to that\r\n\nproviso. Under it, an FRFA must contain three elements:\r\n\n               (1) a succinct statement of the need for,\r\n          and the objectives of, the rule;\r\n\n                               20\r\r\n\n               (2) a summary of the issues raised by the\r\n          public comments in response to the initial\r\n          regulatory flexibility analysis, a summary of\r\n          the assessment of the agency of such issues,\r\n          and a statement of any changes made in the\r\n          proposed rule as a result of such comments;\r\n          and\r\n               (3) a description of each of the\r\n          significant alternatives to the rule\r\n          consistent with the stated objectives of\r\n          applicable statutes and designed to minimize\r\n          any significant economic impact of the rule on\r\n          small entities which was considered by the\r\n          agency, and a statement of the reasons why\r\n          each one of such alternatives was rejected.\r\n\n5 U.S.C. S 604(a) (1994). Congress designed this provision \"to\r\n\nassure that agencies engage in principled decision-making.\" 126\r\n\nCong. Rec. S21,448 &amp; 21,459 (daily ed.

See 126 Cong. Rec. at S21,459-60; \r                                                           see \r                                                               also S. Rep.\r\n\n     RFA traveled a somewhat unconventional route in its march\r\ntowards passage. The Senate rejected the Senate bill, S. 299, as\r\nreported by the Judiciary Committee, and adopted Senator Culver's\r\nsubstitute bill. See 126 Cong. Rec. S21,449-51 (daily ed. Aug. 6,\r\n1980). The House passed the bill without either amendment or\r\nseparate hearings, and endorsed the Senate's section-by-section\r\nanalysis.  See  Thompson, 741 F.2d at 406 (tracing legislative\r\nhistory); see generally Verkuil, supra, at 226-27. We therefore\r\nexamine the substitute bill and its accompanying analysis as the\r\nrelevant guide to legislative intent.\r\n\n                               21\r\r\n\nNo. 96-878, supra, at 10, 14, 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2797, 2801.\r\n\nThus, section 604 does not command an agency to take specific\r\n\nsubstantive measures, but, rather, only to give explicit\r\n\nconsideration to less onerous options:\r\n\n          [T]his provision does not require that an\r\n          agency adopt a rule establishing differing\r\n          compliance standards, exemptions, or any other\r\n          alternative to the proposed rule. It requires\r\n          that an agency, having identified and analyzed\r\n          significant alternative proposals, describe\r\n          those it considered and explain its rejection\r\n          of any which, if adopted, would have been\r\n          substantially less burdensome on the specified\r\n          entities. Evidence that such an alternative\r\n          would not have accomplished the stated\r\n          objectives of the applicable statutes would\r\n          sufficiently justify the rejection of the\r\n          alternative.\r\n\n126 Cong. Rec. at S21,459-60; see also S. Rep. No. 96-878, supra,\r\n\nat 14, 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2801.\r\n\n          We think that a useful parallel can be drawn between RFA\r\n\nS 604 and the National Environmental Protection Act, which furthers\r\n\na similar objective by requiring the preparation of an\r\n\nenvironmental impact statement (EIS). See 42 U.S.C. S 4332 (1994).\r\n\nThe EIS requirement is meant to inform the agency and the public\r\n\nabout potential adverse ecological effects and about the\r\n\navailability, if any, of less harmful alternatives prior to a final\r\n\ndecision on the fate of a particular project or rule.         See\r\n\nRobertson v. Methow \r                               Valley \r                                      Citizens \r                                               Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349\r\n\n(1989); \r                 Valley Citizens for a Safe Env't\r                                                 v. \r                                                    Aldridge, 886 F.2d 458,\r\n\n459-60 (1st Cir. 1989). In light of this purpose, courts do not\r\n\nreview challenges to the adequacy of an EIS under a standard of\r\n\nmathematical exactitude but under a standard of reasonableness.\r\n\n                               22\r\r\n\nSee \r             Aldridge, 886 F.2d at 459; \r                                       Conservation Law Found. of New Eng.,\r\n\nInc. v. \r                 Andrus, 623 F.2d 712, 719 (1st Cir. 1979). Recognizing the\r\n\nanalogous objectives of the two acts, we believe that the same rule\r\n\nof reason should apply to judicial review of challenges under RFA\r\n\nS 604. Thus, we proceed to examine whether the Secretary made a\r\n\nreasonable, good-faith effort to carry out the mandate of section\r\n\n604.\r\n\n          In this instance, NMFS prepared an FRFA consisting of its\r\n\ninitial workup (the IRFA) and its responses to submitted comments.\r\n\nSee 61 Fed. Reg. at 27,730-31;  see also 59 Fed. Reg. 9872, 9883\r\n\n(1994) (final rule, Amendment 5). AFM contends that this proffer\r\n\nmisfires for two reasons. First, AFM maintains that dressing up an\r\n\nIRFA by tacking on responses to comments does not comply with the\r\n\nstatutory directive that the agency prepare an FRFA. Second, AFM\r\n\nasserts that the Secretary failed sufficiently to identify, and\r\n\nadequately to explain his rejection of, alternatives designed to\r\n\nminimize deleterious economic effects on small businesses. We\r\n\naddress these objections in turn.\r\n\n                               1.\r\n\n          We reject AFM's charge that the FRFA is inadequate on its\r\n\nface. Section 604 prescribes the content of an FRFA, but it does\r\n\nnot demand a particular mode of presentation. To disregard\r\n\notherwise compliant analysis simply because it is not ensconced in\r\n\n     Since an EIS, unlike an FRFA, must contain a \"detailed\"\r\nstatement, 42 U.S.C. S 4332(2)(C), the analogy seems more than fair\r\nto AFM.\r\n\n                               23\r\r\n\na specific format would be inconsistent both with the RFA's\r\n\nexplicit authorization to avoid duplicative or unnecessary\r\n\nanalyses, see 5 U.S.C. S 605(a), and with the legislative\r\n\nconcession that an agency \"may incorporate in a regulatory\r\n\nflexibility analysis any data or analysis contained in any other\r\n\nimpact statement or analysis required by law,\" 126 Cong. Rec. at\r\n\nS21,460. Accordingly, we hold that an agency can satisfy section\r\n\n604 as long as it compiles a meaningful, easily understood analysis\r\n\nthat covers each requisite component dictated by the statute and\r\n\nmakes the end product   whatever form it reasonably may take  \r\n\nreadily available to the public.\r\n\n          We do not mean to suggest that the combination of an IRFA\r\n\nand responses to comments always   or even often   will pass\r\n\nmuster. But in the absence of a statutory or regulatory directive\r\n\nspecifying the form of document to be produced, the preparing\r\n\nagency must be accorded ample latitude in making the choice.  See\r\n\nTown \r               of \r                  Orangetown v.  Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 29, 40 (2d Cir. 1983).\r\n\nThis precept is especially pertinent here, since the IRFA was\r\n\nreasonably extensive, the wide range of comments anent the proposed\r\n\nrule (many of which were submitted by small businesses or proxies\r\n\n      In pressing for a contrary result, the appellant relies\r\nheavily on a letter written to NMFS by the Small Business\r\nAdministration (SBA) criticizing the agency's earlier efforts to\r\ncomply with the RFA in the development of Amendment 5. We give\r\nlittle, if any, weight to the letter. For one thing, it is\r\ndirected only to compliance vis-a-vis Amendment 5. For another\r\nthing, although the RFA authorizes the SBA to appear as an amicus\r\ncuriae, see 5 U.S.C.A. S 612(b) (1994 &amp; Supp. 1997), the SBA has\r\nchosen not to exercise that prerogative in respect to Amendment 7.\r\n\n                               24\r\r\n\non their behalf) provided a natural forum for the Secretary in\r\n\nstriving to fulfill his section 604 obligation, and the agency\r\n\npunctiliously complied with the notice requirements of RFA S\r\n\n604(b). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Secretary\r\n\nacted within his proper province in designating the IRFA and the\r\n\nresponses to comments as the FRFA required by the statute.\r\n\n                               2.\r\n\n          We turn now from form to substance and inspect the\r\n\nadequacy of the FRFA's contents. We preface this discussion by\r\n\nremarking two important considerations. First, section 604 does\r\n\nnot require that an FRFA address every alternative, but only that\r\n\nit address significant ones.  See 5 U.S.C. S 604(a)(3). Second,\r\n\nthe majority of commercial fishing vessels in the Northeast are\r\n\ndeemed small businesses for purposes of the RFA.  See 5 U.S.C. S\r\n\n601(3); 13 C.F.R. S 121.601 (1995); \r                                             see \r                                                also 61 Fed. Reg. at 27,731\r\n\n(memorializing the Secretary's recognition of this reality). It\r\n\nfollows that any attempt to reduce the adverse economic impacts of\r\n\na regulation aimed at rebuilding stocks in this fishery is\r\n\nnecessarily an attempt to minimize the negative effects of the\r\n\nregulation on small businesses. To that extent, Congress' desire\r\n\nto have agencies write rules that distinguish (where desirable)\r\n\nbetween big and small businesses has diminished relevance.\r\n\n      Citing 5 U.S.C. S 608(b), AFM argues that failure to prepare\r\na suitable FRFA caused Amendment 7 to lapse. This argument is\r\njejune. The lapse provision applies only to delayed compliance\r\nfollowing the promulgation of emergency rules.  See Thompson, 741\r\nF.2d at 407-08. That is not the situation here.\r\n\n                               25\r\r\n\n          After poring over the FRFA, we conclude that the\r\n\nSecretary fulfilled his substantive obligation under section 604.\r\n\nThe agency's reply to a comment which suggested that the final rule\r\n\nviolates the spirit of the RFA demonstrates a keen understanding of\r\n\nthe RFA's objectives and states the parameters of the Secretary's\r\n\nobligation quite well:\r\n\n          The intent of the RFA is not to limit\r\n          regulations having adverse economic impacts on\r\n          small entities, rather the intent is to have\r\n          the agency focus special attention on the\r\n          impacts its proposed actions would have on\r\n          small entities, to disclose to the public\r\n          which alternatives it considered to lessen\r\n          adverse impacts, to require the agency to\r\n          consider public comments on impacts and\r\n          alternatives, and to require the agency to\r\n          state its reasons for not adopting an\r\n          alternative having less of an adverse impact\r\n          on small entities.\r\n\n61 Fed. Reg. at 27,721. The analysis that the agency undertook is\r\n\nfully consonant with this aspirational language.\r\n\n          To begin with, the IRFA (incorporated into the FRFA)\r\n\ndescribes several possible alternatives and summarizes the\r\n\npotential economic impact of each. The agency concluded that each\r\n\nof these scenarios would have a greater negative impact on the\r\n\nfishing industry than would the proposed rule. For example, the\r\n\nagency rejected Alternative 1 (which included a ban on fishing with\r\n\ncertain gear until the spawning stock biomass reached a minimum\r\n\nthreshold level) because it would result in unacceptably high\r\n\nlevels of foregone income; it rejected Alternative 2 (which\r\n\nproposed closing half of certain fishing areas and placing\r\n\nrestrictions in open areas) on the basis that it would be massively\r\n\n                               26\r\r\n\ninefficient and would dramatically increase vessel operating costs;\r\n\nand it rejected Alternative 4 (which favored a quota system) for\r\n\nmuch the same reasons.\r\n\n          The responses to submitted comments (which also form a\r\n\npart of the FRFA) discuss and dismiss additional alternatives. For\r\n\nexample, responding to a comment that characterized closures in the\r\n\nGulf of Maine as detrimental to the industry, NMFS explained that\r\n\nthis was a temporary default measure to reduce ichthyic mortality\r\n\nin situations where DAS reductions were insufficient. In that\r\n\nregard, the FRFA noted that the Council had considered reducing DAS\r\n\nallotments but declined to pursue that alternative after receiving\r\n\nindustry comment indicating a preference for flexibility.  See 61\r\n\nFed. Reg. at 27,714-15. By like token, the agency explicated its\r\n\nrejection of the status quo alternative, reiterating that Amendment\r\n\n5 had been conceived as a means of arresting the decline in\r\n\nspawning stock biomass, whereas Amendment 7 responded to a new,\r\n\nemerging need and purposed to rebuild the biomass to levels which\r\n\nwould ensure stability.   See  id. at 27,721. The agency also\r\n\nexplained why some DAS exemptions under the status quo alternative,\r\n\nwhich had the capacity partially to alleviate burdens on small\r\n\nvessels, could not be retained under the more rigorous conservation\r\n\ngoals of Amendment 7.  See id. at 27,715.\r\n\n          We think it is noteworthy, too, that the RFA identifies\r\n\nsteps taken for the express purpose of mitigating adverse economic\r\n\nimpacts on small fishing businesses. In this vein, the Secretary\r\n\neliminated a provision requiring layover days, thereby easing the\r\n\n                               27\r\r\n\nconcerns of smaller vessels (which are more sensitive to inclement\r\n\nweather).  See 61 Fed. Reg. at 27,717. Similarly, the Secretary\r\n\nphased in the DAS reduction schedule over two years instead of one\r\n\nbecause, though conservationists recommended an 80 percent\r\n\nreduction in mortality rates, the Secretary feared that vessels\r\n\ncould not financially weather a DAS reduction greater than 50\r\n\npercent. The Secretary also moved to establish a vessel buyout\r\n\nprogram reducing the socioeconomic burden on small entities.  See\r\n\nid. at 27,731.\r\n\n          We think that these selected examples convey the flavor\r\n\nof the FRFA as a whole. The point is not whether the Secretary's\r\n\njudgments are beyond reproach, but whether he made a reasonable,\r\n\ngood-faith effort to canvass major options and weigh their probable\r\n\neffects. Here, the record reveals that the Secretary explicitly\r\n\nconsidered numerous alternatives, exhibited a fair degree of\r\n\nsensitivity concerning the need to alleviate the regulatory burden\r\n\non small entities within the fishing industry, adopted some\r\n\nsalutary measures designed to ease that burden, and satisfactorily\r\n\nexplained his reasons for rejecting others. The fact that AFM has\r\n\npointed to no \r                       significant alternative that escaped the Secretary's\r\n\nnotice attests to the thoroughness of the Secretary's efforts.\r\n\nBecause the Secretary's specification and discussion of significant\r\n\nalternatives was reasonable, it fulfilled the substantive\r\n\nrequirements of section 604.\r\n\n          AFM makes one last-ditch argument in respect to section\r\n\n604. It carps that the Secretary failed to develop an alternative\r\n\n                               28\r\r\n\nthat substantially lessens the economic impact on small entities.\r\n\nThis puts the catch before the cast and, in the bargain, confuses\r\n\nwhat the fishermen desire with what the statute obliges the\r\n\nSecretary to do. An adequate discussion of alternatives in an FRFA\r\n\nis context-specific. Of necessity, given the distressed condition\r\n\nof groundfish stocks in this fishery, any alternative consistent\r\n\nwith the Secretary's conservation mandate under the Magnuson Act\r\n\nwill produce economic hardships for the industry. The FRFA reveals\r\n\nthat the Secretary assessed the potential impact of Amendment 7 on\r\n\nsmall businesses, mulled other options in good faith, and sought to\r\n\nstrike the best available balance between conservation goals and\r\n\nthe legitimate concerns of the fishing community. No more is\r\n\nexigible.\r\n\n                        D.  Section 609.\r\n\n          Section 609 of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. S 609, directs agencies\r\n\nto assure that small entities are given an opportunity to\r\n\nparticipate in the rulemaking process for any rule that is likely\r\n\nto produce significant economic impacts.   AFM claims that the\r\n\nSecretary improperly limited participation in the process and\r\n\nfailed to provide adequate assistance to small entities in\r\n\n      The 1996 Amendments provide that agency compliance with\r\nsection 609 is subject to judicial review in conjunction with\r\njudicial review of challenges under amended section 604.   See 5\r\nU.S.C.A. S 609 (Supp. 1997). Noting that the substantive\r\nalterations to section 609 effected by the 1996 Amendments are of\r\nlittle significance to this appeal, AFM does not pursue its\r\nretroactivity argument with regard to section 609. Accordingly, we\r\ntest compliance against the language of the provision as it stood\r\non May 31, 1996 (the date the Secretary promulgated Amendment 7).\r\n\n                               29\r\r\n\nevaluating agency reports. We do not agree.\r\n\n          While section 609 instructs the Secretary to assure\r\n\nparticipation, the method and manner of doing so is left primarily\r\n\nto the Secretary's sound discretion. In this situation, we are\r\n\nsatisfied that the Secretary provided adequate participatory\r\n\nopportunities for small businesses.\r\n\n          Council meetings were open to all interested parties and\r\n\nwere well-attended. Public hearings were held in six states.\r\n\nScientific data was broadly disseminated through open workshops and\r\n\notherwise.  See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. at 27,714 &amp; 27,720 &amp; 27,723.\r\n\nSeveral representatives of small entities participated in a\r\n\nregional stock assessment workshop, at which scientific data was\r\n\npresented and peer-reviewed. The nature and volume of the\r\n\nsubmitted comments is emblematic of a very high level of public\r\n\nparticipation. Furthermore, the substance of the comments leaves\r\n\nno doubt but that small fishing businesses were intimately familiar\r\n\nwith the crisis and were well aware of the potential significance\r\n\nof the management efforts that were being studied.   See 61 Fed.\r\n\nReg. at 27,712-29.\r\n\n          To be sure, the development of Amendment 7 involved\r\n\ndaunting scientific complexities. That stems from the intrinsic\r\n\nnature of the problem, not from some fault on the Secretary's part.\r\n\nSince the Secretary provided repeated and varied opportunities for\r\n\nmeaningful participation by small entities, he met the relatively\r\n\nmodest demands that section 609 imposes.\r\n\n          The complaint that the Secretary did too little to assist\r\n\n                               30\r\r\n\nsmall entities wishing to participate in the process is equally\r\n\nunavailing. Section 609 does not mandate specific types of\r\n\nassistance. Rather, it offers a list of suggested techniques to\r\n\nassure participation.  The legislative history confirms the\r\n\npurport of the statutory language; agencies have the discretion to\r\n\nselect among various methods of outreach.  See 126 Cong. Rec. at\r\n\nS21,460. Here, the record discloses that the Secretary handled the\r\n\nmatter in a perfectly reasonable way.\r\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\r\n\n          To sum up, it is evident that rapidly deteriorating\r\n\nconditions required the Secretary to fish in troubled waters. The\r\n\nimmediacy of the need to rebuild groundfish stocks left him no easy\r\n\nway out. In the absence of a perfect (or even near-perfect)\r\n\nsolution, he reasoned his way to a decision that balanced the\r\n\nsignificant adverse impacts that Amendment 7 would have on the\r\n\n      In pertinent part, the statute directs that the promulgating\r\nagency\r\n\n          shall assure that small entities have been\r\n          given an opportunity to participate in the\r\n          rulemaking for the rule through techniques\r\n          such as  \r\n               (1) the inclusion in an advanced\r\n               notice of proposed rulemaking, if\r\n               issued, of a statement that the\r\n               proposed rule may have a significant\r\n               economic effect on a substantial\r\n               number of small entities;\r\n               . . .\r\n               (4) the conduct of open conferences\r\n               or public hearings concerning the\r\n               rule for small entities; and\r\n               . . . .\r\n\n5 U.S.C.

Having carefully reviewed the administrative record,\r\n\nwe conclude that the product of his labors   Amendment 7   is\r\n\nrational and fairly supported by the record.\r\n\n          We need go no further. Although we are not unsympathetic\r\n\nto the plight of the individuals who will suffer adverse\r\n\nconsequences from the choices embodied in the final rule, we must\r\n\nuphold the balance struck by the Secretary among competing\r\n\nconcerns.

They unsuccessfully asked the district court to invalidate the Secretary's final rulemaking and thereby avert this potential calamity.  They now ask us for the same relief, urging that the Secretary failed to comply with both the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1801-1882 (1994), and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 601-612 (1994 &amp; Supp.1997).  Although we have considerable empathy for the fishermens' concerns, we conclude, after wading through an administrative record which comprises roughly 30,000 pages, that the Secretary acted within his lawful purview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Responding to depletion of the nation's fish stocks due to overfishing, Congress enacted the Magnuson Act in 1976 to protect fishery resources.  See 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1801(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Act created eight regional fishery management councils, each of which has responsibility for fashioning a fishery management plan (FMP) to regulate commercial fishing within a particular geographic region.  See id. &#167;&#167; 1852(a)(1)-(8), 1852(h)(1).  When a proposed FMP (or a plan amendment) is developed, the council must submit it to the Secretary for review.  See id. &#167; 1853(c).  The Secretary then determines whether the proposed FMP is consistent not only with the Magnuson Act's seven national standards for fishery conservation and management, see id. &#167; 1851(a)(1)-(7), but also with other applicable law, including the RFA, see id. &#167;&#167; 1854(a)(1)(B), 1855(e).  In making this determination, the Secretary must publish an appropriate notice, see id. &#167; 1854(a)(1)(C), consider the comments engendered in response thereto, see id. &#167; 1854(a)(2)(A), and consult with the Coast Guard anent enforcement, see id. &#167; 1854(a)(2)(C).  If the Secretary approves the amendment, he then promulgates final implementing regulations, which are subject to judicial review.  See id. &#167; 1855(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COURSE OF EVENTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New England Fishery Management Council (the Council) has authority over commercial fishing in the Atlantic Ocean off the New England coast.  See id. &#167; 1852(a)(1).  Under its aegis, the management and conservation of the New England Groundfish Fishery has had a tangled history.  See generally Peter Shelley et al., The New England Fisheries Crisis:  What Have We Learned?, 9 Tul.Envtl.L.J. 221, 223-33 (1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  When less intrusive efforts did not prevent overfishing, the Council developed the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan in 1985.  The Secretary approved it only as a stopgap.  Four amendments to the interim rule followed, none of which proved adequate.  See Conservation Law Found. of New Eng., Inc. v. Franklin, 989 F.2d 54, 58 (1st Cir.1993).  Litigation over the last of these amendments resulted in a consent decree.  The decree established a timetable for adopting an FMP that would reverse the continuing depletion of cod, flounder, and haddock stocks within specified periods.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, the Council recommended, and the Secretary, acting through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, approved Amendment 5. This amendment sought to eliminate overfishing of cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder stocks by sharply reducing permissible fishing over a five to seven year period.  See 59 Fed.Reg. 9872 (1994) (final rule).  To achieve this goal, the amendment proposed a gradual reduction in the annual number of working days at sea (DAS) for certain fishing vessels and created three classes of permits.  See 50 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 651.22, 651.4 (1995).  The class that is relevant here comprises limited access multispecies permits (which, in turn, are subdivided into fleet and individual permits).  Amendment 5 sets up a DAS notification program that requires vessels covered by fleet permits to notify the NMFS of departure and arrival times.  See id. &#167; 651.29.  In addition, the amendment establishes a vessel tracking system (VTS) that is intended to function by means of electronic devices installed on board vessels with individual permits.  See id. &#167; 651.28.  Because the VTS is not yet operational, both classes of permit holders must satisfy the call-in requirements of the DAS notification program for the time being.  See id. &#167; 651.29(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by the Secretary's handiwork, AFM challenged Amendment 5 in Maine's federal district court.  By that time, however, haddock and yellowtail stocks had collapsed, and cod stocks were near collapse.  See NMFS, Report of the 18th Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop (18th SAW):  The Plenary 53-54 (1994).  In light of this troubling new information, Amendment 5 seemed inadequate either to protect or rebuild these stocks, and NMFS's Stock Assessment Review Committee recommended that the Council reduce ichthyic mortality to as low a level as possible.  See id. at 53.   In response, the Council adopted Amendment 6 (an emergency measure designed to protect haddock, see 59 Fed.Reg. 32,134 (1994)) and thereafter developed Amendment 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary promulgated Amendment 7 as a final rule after notice and comment.  See 61 Fed.Reg. 8540 (proposed rule) &amp; 27,710 (1996) (final rule) (to be codified at 50 C.F.R. pt. 651).  Among other things, Amendment 7 seeks to reduce ichthyic mortality rates and rebuild multispecies stocks by (1) setting annual \"allowable catch\" targets for regulated species, (2) orchestrating new area closures, and (3) implementing further DAS cutbacks (including acceleration of the reduction schedule originally established in Amendment 5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Although the Secretary acknowledged the significant negative economic impacts (especially on trawl vessels) which Amendment 7 would invite, he concluded that conservation of the fishery would yield greater long-term benefits.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unmollified, AFM amended its pending judicial complaint to challenge Amendment 7 as well as Amendment 5. It alleged, inter alia, that both amendments violated the Magnuson Act and the RFA.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The district court then held a one-day informational hearing, during which the parties' experts explained their respective positions on scientific, economic, and ecological principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the court granted summary judgment in the Secretary's favor.  See Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 954 F.Supp. 383 (D.Me.1997).  As to issues that are relevant in this appeal, the court held that the newly enacted judicial review provisions of the RFA did not apply retroactively, and that, in all events, the Secretary had complied with the RFA.  See id. at 386-87.   The court also held that the Secretary's rulemaking did not run afoul of the Magnuson Act.  See id. at 388-90.   AFM now appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>III. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.  See Coyne v. Taber Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 457 (1st Cir.1995);  Massachusetts, Dept. of Pub. Welfare v. Secretary of Agric., 984 F.2d 514, 520 (1st Cir.1993).  This rubric has a special twist in the administrative law context.  The Magnuson Act incorporates the familiar standard of review associated with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  See 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1855(b).  Where the APA standard obtains, a court may set aside an administrative action only if that action is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A)-(D).  Because the APA standard affords great deference to agency decisionmaking and because the Secretary's action is presumed valid, judicial review, even at the summary judgment stage, is narrow.  See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415-16, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971);  Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 769 (1st Cir.1992).  Consequently, our brief--like that of the district court--is only to determine whether the Secretary's decision to promulgate the fishery regulation was consonant with his statutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record.  See Alliance Against IFQs v. Brown, 84 F.3d 343, 345 (9th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1467, 137 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997);  C &amp; W Fish Co. v. Fox, 931 F.2d 1556, 1562 (D.C.Cir.1991);  Maine v. Kreps, 563 F.2d 1052, 1055 (1st Cir.1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An agency rule is arbitrary and capricious if the agency lacks a rational basis for adopting it--for example, if the agency relied on improper factors, failed to consider pertinent aspects of the problem, offered a rationale contradicting the evidence before it, or reached a conclusion so implausible that it cannot be attributed to a difference of opinion or the application of agency expertise.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2866-67, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983);  Rhode Island Higher Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Secretary of Educ., 929 F.2d 844, 855 (1st Cir.1991).  Subject, of course, to statutory constraints, policy choices are for the agency, not the court, to make.  Even if a reviewing court disagrees with the agency's conclusions, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency.  See Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 823-24;  Kreps, 563 F.2d at 1055.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, when reviewing agency action, we apply the same legal standards that pertain in the district court and afford no special deference to that court's decision.  See Massachusetts Dept. of Pub. Welfare, 984 F.2d at 521 n. 5. This approach is not altered simply because the court held an informational hearing at which experts testified.  Although some degree of deference may be appropriate if a district court's determination turns on factual findings, evidence presented by witnesses, or \"even upon lengthy district court proceedings in which knowledgeable counsel explain the agency's decisionmaking process in detail,\" Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 770 (1st Cir.1985), this case does not implicate that principle.  The district judge made it pellucid that the dissertations which he entertained \"were not evidence, but rather were advocacy presentations by non-lawyers skilled in their respective areas and therefore better able to present the material to [the court].\"  Associated Fisheries, 954 F.Supp. at 388 n. 9. A presentation which serves only to educate the district court, not to enlarge the administrative record, does not affect the standard of judicial review.  See Fishermen's Dock Coop., Inc. v. Brown, 75 F.3d 164, 168 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CLAIMS IMPLICATING THE MAGNUSON ACT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFM asseverates that Amendment 7 violates the Magnuson Act because the regulation is unnecessary to achieve the Secretary's stated goals and inconsistent with the national standards embodied in the Act.  Neither asseveration holds water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>A. The Need for Amendment 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contradicts AFM's assertion that Amendment 7 is not necessary to achieve a rebuilding of groundfish stock because the status quo suffices.  The Secretary was presented with reliable scientific data indicating that stocks had collapsed;  he was advised that the prophylactic measures specified in Amendment 5 were clearly inadequate to alleviate the steadily worsening plight;  and he also was told that certain ichthyic mortality rates ought to be reduced significantly.  Responding to this influx of new information, the Council conducted extensive scientific analyses and devised Amendment 7 as a means of ensuring the longterm stability of the fishery.  The Secretary studied the data, weighed plethoric comments, and decided to promulgate the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we cannot say that the Secretary exercised his discretion in an irrational, mindless, or whimsical manner.  When an agency is faced with conflicting scientific views and chooses among them, its decision cannot be termed arbitrary or capricious.  Indeed, a reviewing court must afford special deference to an agency's scientific expertise where, as here, that expertise is applied in areas within the agency's specialized field of competence.  See Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 103, 103 S.Ct. 2246, 2255, 76 L.Ed.2d 437 (1983);  United States v. Members of Estate of Boothby, 16 F.3d 19, 21-22 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>B. Compliance with National Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Magnuson Act sets up a series of seven national standards.  See 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(1)-(7).  To ensure compliance with these standards, the responsible agency must perform a cost/benefit analysis ancillary to the promulgation of an FMP. Here, the analysis for Amendment 7 showed a projected net benefit of $18 million over the ten-year rebuilding period.  AFM insists that the Secretary put his thumb on the scale when conducting this analysis, and that Amendment 7 therefore fails to satisfy the national standards.  Specifically, AFM charges that the Secretary arbitrarily disregarded certain enforcement and compliance expenses which, when properly included, would demonstrate that the likely costs of Amendment 7 substantially exceed the likely benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Magnuson Act defines \"optimum yield\" as the amount of fish which will secure the greatest overall benefit to the nation based on the maximum sustainable yield from a fishery, as modified by relevant economic, social, or ecological factors.  See id. &#167; 1802(21).  The bedrock principle of National Standard 1 is that conservation and resource management measures, such as Amendment 7, \"shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing industry.\"  Id. &#167; 1851(a)(1).  Relatedly, National Standard 7 requires that \"[c]onservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.\"  Id. &#167; 1851(a)(7).  In pursuance of his statutory duty, see id. &#167; 1851(b), the Secretary established regulatory guidelines to assure that FMPs would be developed in accordance with these national standards.  See 50 C.F.R. pt. 602 (1995).  The regulatory guidelines make it plain that the agency should weigh the costs associated with an FMP (including industry compliance and enforcement costs) against the forecasted benefits.  See id. &#167; 602.17(b)(2)(vii), (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Secretary excluded Coast Guard enforcement costs from the calculus.  AFM terms this exclusion arbitrary, but the administrative record belies that characterization.  The Secretary specifically addressed this issue and the documentation supporting the final rules contains a rational explanation for his decision.  Although the Coast Guard estimated that Amendment 7 would increase enforcement costs by approximately $20,800,000 per year, its estimate assumed sea-based enforcement whereas Amendment 7, as drafted, relied primarily on land-based enforcement through the notification and tracking systems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,719.   Even if certain sea-based costs occurred under Amendment 7, the Secretary explained, they would not comprise increases in overall costs because they would \"actually represent programmatic improvements that could also be expected to be made in the out years of [Amendment 5].\" Id.  For this reason, the Secretary's cost/benefit analysis explicitly assumed that Amendment 7 would not yield enforcement costs greater than those which would have been borne under Amendment 5. See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,719, &amp; 27,722.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this explanation is sufficiently logical, and sufficiently rooted in the record, to dispose of AFM's argument concerning Coast Guard enforcement costs.  It also answers AFM's additional argument that the Secretary improperly excluded the costs of industry compliance with Amendment 7. The Secretary's assumption--that compliance costs will not vary materially as between Amendment 5 and Amendment 7--flows rationally from Amendment 7's retention of the enforcement mechanism established under Amendment 5. See 50 C.F.R. &#167; 651.29.  Consequently, since Amendment 7 does not alter the taxonomy that determines which vessels will require VTS installations, AFM's claim that the new regulation fails to account for added VTS-related costs lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the record reveals that the Secretary carefully considered the enforcement measures associated with Amendment 7 and, consistent with the evidence before him, concluded (1) that the Coast Guard estimate was largely a figment of bureaucratic imagination which did not track the actual enforcement mechanism needed for the FMP, and therefore did not warrant inclusion in the calculus of likely costs and benefits, and (2) that compliance costs for the fishing industry would remain roughly the same under Amendment 7. Whether or not we, if writing on a pristine page, would have reached the same set of conclusions is not the issue.  What matters is that the administrative judgment, right or wrong, derives from the record, possesses a rational basis, and evinces no mistake of law.  Consequently, it merits our approbation.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. at 2866-67;  Kreps, 563 F.2d at 1056.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager, of course, is the enormous difficulty of estimating enforcement costs in advance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Administrative decisionmaking is not an exact science, and judicial review must recognize that some arbitrariness is inherent in the exercise of discretion amid uncertainty.  Accordingly, courts reviewing this type of administrative decision must leave room for a certain amount of play in the joints.

Here, the reasons offered to explain the Secretary's determination that Amendment 7 is consistent with the national standards reflect an understanding of analytical factors and constitute a rational exercise of deliberative decisionmaking.  Hence, we cannot say that this determination offends the applicable standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>V.

Congress enacted the RFA to encourage administrative agencies to consider the potential impact of nascent federal regulations on small businesses.  See Pub.L. No. 96-354, &#167; 2(b), 94 Stat. 1164, 1165 (1980) (statement of purpose);  see generally Paul R. Verkuil, A Critical Guide to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 1982 Duke L.J. 213, 215-26 (1982).  Under the RFA, an agency that publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) describing the effect of the proposed rule on small businesses and discussing alternatives that might minimize adverse economic consequences.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 603.  When promulgating a final rule, the agency not only must prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) but also must make copies available to members of the public and publish directions for obtaining such copies.  See id. &#167; 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary promulgated Amendment 7 on May 31, 1996.  At that time, the law expressly prohibited judicial review of agency compliance with sections 603 and 604.  See id. &#167; 611;  see also Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d 401, 404-05 (D.C.Cir.1984).  Approximately two months earlier, however, Congress had amended the RFA by enacting the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), Pub.L. No. 104-121, tit.  II, 110 Stat. 857, 864-68 (1996).  The 1996 Amendments reshaped the contours of the mandated flexibility analysis and provided for judicial review of the agency's product.  See id. &#167;&#167; 241, 242, 110 Stat. at 864-66 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 604(a), 611(a)(1) (Supp.1997)).  Because Congress delayed the effective date of these amendments until ninety days after passage, see id. &#167; 245, 110 Stat. at 868, they were not in effect when the Secretary promulgated Amendment 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>A.

Judge Hornby concluded otherwise, remarking the absence of any express legislative intent to apply the SBREFA retroactively, and reasoning that, inasmuch as the 1996 Amendments were \"one legislative package,\" \"[i]t would be anomalous to apply the judicial review portion of the 1996 amendments to past agency actions but at the same time not apply the substance of those amendments.\"  Associated Fisheries, 954 F.Supp. at 387.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court decision in Landgraf and, more recently, the decisions in Lindh v.

United States, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1871, 138 L.Ed.2d 135 (1997), provide a roadmap for deciding questions of retroactivity.  The roadmap is not easy to use, and in this case the guideposts point in more than one direction.  On one hand, the delayed effective date points toward prospective application, see Wright v. FEMA, 913 F.2d 1566, 1572 &amp; n. 13 (11th Cir.1990);  Criger v. Becton, 902 F.2d 1348, 1351 (8th Cir.1990), and the legislative history of the 1996 Amendments points the same way, see 142 Cong.  Rec. E571, E574 (daily ed. Apr. 19, 1996) (statement of Rep.  Hyde) (twice indicating that judicial review would be available for rules promulgated after the effective date).  On the other hand, the new judicial review provision does not affect substantive rights but merely confers jurisdiction, and courts often give retroactive effect to such statutes.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 274, 114 S.Ct. at 1501-02;  but see Hughes Aircraft, --- U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1878 (drawing a distinction between an amendment which merely allocates jurisdiction among fora and one which creates jurisdiction where none previously existed, and stating that the latter is subject to the presumption against retroactivity).  Moreover, the Third Circuit, contradicting Judge Hornby's \"one legislative package\" rationale, recently held that the 1996 Amendments were severable and that the judicial review provision could be applied to a legislative rule promulgated before their effective date.  See Southwestern Pa.  Growth Alliance v.

We have long adhered to the practice that, when an appeal presents a jurisdictional riddle, yet the merits of the underlying issue are readily resolved in favor of the party challenging jurisdiction, a court may sidestep the quandary and simply dispose of the appeal on the merits.

The 1996 Amendments substantively altered section 604 by reformulating and augmenting the required content of an FRFA.  See 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 604(a) (Supp.1997).

Since the Secretary completed the FRFA and promulgated Amendment 7 before the effective date of the 1996 Amendments, applying the neoteric version of section 604 would impose new strictures with respect to matters already completed, and, thus, would contravene the rule against retroactivity.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. at 1505.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFM offers only a weak rejoinder.  It says that retroactive application would not impose new duties because Congress passed the 1996 Amendments before the agency prepared the FRFA.  That is so--but it is beside the point.  SBREFA's effective date constitutes the cut-off point, and the Secretary had completed and published both the FRFA and the final rule prior to that time.  Thus, imposing incremental requirements on these actions would have an impermissible retroactive effect.

See id. at S21,460;  see also S.Rep.

See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332 (1994).  The EIS requirement is meant to inform the agency and the public about potential adverse ecological effects and about the availability, if any, of less harmful alternatives prior to a final decision on the fate of a particular project or rule.  See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 349, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 1845, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989);  Valley Citizens for a Safe Env't v. Aldridge, 886 F.2d 458, 459-60 (1st Cir.1989).  In light of this purpose, courts do not review challenges to the adequacy of an EIS under a standard of mathematical exactitude but under a standard of reasonableness.  See Aldridge, 886 F.2d at 459;  Conservation Law Found. of New Eng., Inc. v. Andrus, 623 F.2d 712, 719 (1st Cir.1979).  Recognizing the analogous objectives of the two acts, we believe that the same rule of reason should apply to judicial review of challenges under RFA &#167; 604.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, we proceed to examine whether the Secretary made a reasonable, good-faith effort to carry out the mandate of section 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, NMFS prepared an FRFA consisting of its initial workup (the IRFA) and its responses to submitted comments.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,730-31;  see also 59 Fed.Reg. 9872, 9883 (1994) (final rule, Amendment 5).  AFM contends that this proffer misfires for two reasons.  First, AFM maintains that dressing up an IRFA by tacking on responses to comments does not comply with the statutory directive that the agency prepare an FRFA.  Second, AFM asserts that the Secretary failed sufficiently to identify, and adequately to explain his rejection of, alternatives designed to minimize deleterious economic effects on small businesses.  We address these objections in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject AFM's charge that the FRFA is inadequate on its face.  Section 604 prescribes the content of an FRFA, but it does not demand a particular mode of presentation.  To disregard otherwise compliant analysis simply because it is not ensconced in a specific format would be inconsistent both with the RFA's explicit authorization to avoid duplicative or unnecessary analyses, see 5 U.S.C. &#167; 605(a), and with the legislative concession that an agency \"may incorporate in a regulatory flexibility analysis any data or analysis contained in any other impact statement or analysis required by law,\" 126 Cong.  Rec. at S21,460.  Accordingly, we hold that an agency can satisfy section 604 as long as it compiles a meaningful, easily understood analysis that covers each requisite component dictated by the statute and makes the end product--whatever form it reasonably may take--readily available to the public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to suggest that the combination of an IRFA and responses to comments always--or even often--will pass muster.  But in the absence of a statutory or regulatory directive specifying the form of document to be produced, the preparing agency must be accorded ample latitude in making the choice.  See Town of Orangetown v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 29, 40 (2d Cir.1983).  This precept is especially pertinent here, since the IRFA was reasonably extensive, the wide range of comments anent the proposed rule (many of which were submitted by small businesses or proxies on their behalf) provided a natural forum for the Secretary in striving to fulfill his section 604 obligation, and the agency punctiliously complied with the notice requirements of RFA &#167; 604(b).  Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Secretary acted within his proper province in designating the IRFA and the responses to comments as the FRFA required by the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now from form to substance and inspect the adequacy of the FRFA's contents.  We preface this discussion by remarking two important considerations.  First, section 604 does not require that an FRFA address every alternative, but only that it address significant ones.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 604(a)(3).  Second, the majority of commercial fishing vessels in the Northeast are deemed small businesses for purposes of the RFA.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 601(3);  13 C.F.R. &#167; 121.601 (1995);  see also 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,731 (memorializing the Secretary's recognition of this reality).  It follows that any attempt to reduce the adverse economic impacts of a regulation aimed at rebuilding stocks in this fishery is necessarily an attempt to minimize the negative effects of the regulation on small businesses.  To that extent, Congress' desire to have agencies write rules that distinguish (where desirable) between big and small businesses has diminished relevance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After poring over the FRFA, we conclude that the Secretary fulfilled his substantive obligation under section 604.  The agency's reply to a comment which suggested that the final rule violates the spirit of the RFA demonstrates a keen understanding of the RFA's objectives and states the parameters of the Secretary's obligation quite well:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>The intent of the RFA is not to limit regulations having adverse economic impacts on small entities, rather the intent is to have the agency focus special attention on the impacts its proposed actions would have on small entities, to disclose to the public which alternatives it considered to lessen adverse impacts, to require the agency to consider public comments on impacts and alternatives, and to require the agency to state its reasons for not adopting an alternative having less of an adverse impact on small entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">61 Fed.Reg. at 27,721.   The analysis that the agency undertook is fully consonant with this aspirational language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, the IRFA (incorporated into the FRFA) describes several possible alternatives and summarizes the potential economic impact of each.  The agency concluded that each of these scenarios would have a greater negative impact on the fishing industry than would the proposed rule.  For example, the agency rejected Alternative 1 (which included a ban on fishing with certain gear until the spawning stock biomass reached a minimum threshold level) because it would result in unacceptably high levels of foregone income;  it rejected Alternative 2 (which proposed closing half of certain fishing areas and placing restrictions in open areas) on the basis that it would be massively inefficient and would dramatically increase vessel operating costs;  and it rejected Alternative 4 (which favored a quota system) for much the same reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The responses to submitted comments (which also form a part of the FRFA) discuss and dismiss additional alternatives.  For example, responding to a comment that characterized closures in the Gulf of Maine as detrimental to the industry, NMFS explained that this was a temporary default measure to reduce ichthyic mortality in situations where DAS reductions were insufficient.  In that regard, the FRFA noted that the Council had considered reducing DAS allotments but declined to pursue that alternative after receiving industry comment indicating a preference for flexibility.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,714-15.   By like token, the agency explicated its rejection of the status quo alternative, reiterating that Amendment 5 had been conceived as a means of arresting the decline in spawning stock biomass, whereas Amendment 7 responded to a new, emerging need and purposed to rebuild the biomass to levels which would ensure stability.  See id. at 27,721.   The agency also explained why some DAS exemptions under the status quo alternative, which had the capacity partially to alleviate burdens on small vessels, could not be retained under the more rigorous conservation goals of Amendment 7. See id. at 27,715.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is noteworthy, too, that the RFA identifies steps taken for the express purpose of mitigating adverse economic impacts on small fishing businesses.  In this vein, the Secretary eliminated a provision requiring layover days, thereby easing the concerns of smaller vessels (which are more sensitive to inclement weather).  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,717.   Similarly, the Secretary phased in the DAS reduction schedule over two years instead of one because, though conservationists recommended an 80 percent reduction in mortality rates, the Secretary feared that vessels could not financially weather a DAS reduction greater than 50 percent.  The Secretary also moved to establish a vessel buyout program reducing the socioeconomic burden on small entities.  See id. at 27,731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that these selected examples convey the flavor of the FRFA as a whole.  The point is not whether the Secretary's judgments are beyond reproach, but whether he made a reasonable, good-faith effort to canvass major options and weigh their probable effects.  Here, the record reveals that the Secretary explicitly considered numerous alternatives, exhibited a fair degree of sensitivity concerning the need to alleviate the regulatory burden on small entities within the fishing industry, adopted some salutary measures designed to ease that burden, and satisfactorily explained his reasons for rejecting others.  The fact that AFM has pointed to no significant alternative that escaped the Secretary's notice attests to the thoroughness of the Secretary's efforts.  Because the Secretary's specification and discussion of significant alternatives was reasonable, it fulfilled the substantive requirements of section 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFM makes one last-ditch argument in respect to section 604.  It carps that the Secretary failed to develop an alternative that substantially lessens the economic impact on small entities.  This puts the catch before the cast and, in the bargain, confuses what the fishermen desire with what the statute obliges the Secretary to do.  An adequate discussion of alternatives in an FRFA is context-specific.  Of necessity, given the distressed condition of groundfish stocks in this fishery, any alternative consistent with the Secretary's conservation mandate under the Magnuson Act will produce economic hardships for the industry.  The FRFA reveals that the Secretary assessed the potential impact of Amendment 7 on small businesses, mulled other options in good faith, and sought to strike the best available balance between conservation goals and the legitimate concerns of the fishing community.  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>D. Section 609.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 609 of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 609, directs agencies to assure that small entities are given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process for any rule that is likely to produce significant economic impacts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  AFM claims that the Secretary improperly limited participation in the process and failed to provide adequate assistance to small entities in evaluating agency reports.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While section 609 instructs the Secretary to assure participation, the method and manner of doing so is left primarily to the Secretary's sound discretion.  In this situation, we are satisfied that the Secretary provided adequate participatory opportunities for small businesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Council meetings were open to all interested parties and were well-attended.  Public hearings were held in six states.  Scientific data was broadly disseminated through open workshops and otherwise.  See, e.g., 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,714 &amp; 27,720 &amp; 27,723.   Several representatives of small entities participated in a regional stock assessment workshop, at which scientific data was presented and peer-reviewed.  The nature and volume of the submitted comments is emblematic of a very high level of public participation.  Furthermore, the substance of the comments leaves no doubt but that small fishing businesses were intimately familiar with the crisis and were well aware of the potential significance of the management efforts that were being studied.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,712-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the development of Amendment 7 involved daunting scientific complexities.  That stems from the intrinsic nature of the problem, not from some fault on the Secretary's part.  Since the Secretary provided repeated and varied opportunities for meaningful participation by small entities, he met the relatively modest demands that section 609 imposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint that the Secretary did too little to assist small entities wishing to participate in the process is equally unavailing.  Section 609 does not mandate specific types of assistance.  Rather, it offers a list of suggested techniques to assure participation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The legislative history confirms the purport of the statutory language;  agencies have the discretion to select among various methods of outreach.  See 126 Cong.  Rec. at S21,460.  Here, the record discloses that the Secretary handled the matter in a perfectly reasonable way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, it is evident that rapidly deteriorating conditions required the Secretary to fish in troubled waters.  The immediacy of the need to rebuild groundfish stocks left him no easy way out.  In the absence of a perfect (or even near-perfect) solution, he reasoned his way to a decision that balanced the significant adverse impacts that Amendment 7 would have on the industry against the severe depletion which plagued this fishery and the legal obligation to develop an FMP that would eliminate overfishing.  Having carefully reviewed the administrative record, we conclude that the product of his labors--Amendment 7--is rational and fairly supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Although we are not unsympathetic to the plight of the individuals who will suffer adverse consequences from the choices embodied in the final rule, we must uphold the balance struck by the Secretary among competing concerns.

For another thing, although the RFA authorizes the SBA to appear as an amicus curiae, see 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 612(b) (1994 &amp; Supp.1997), the SBA has chosen not to exercise that prerogative in respect to Amendment 7</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Citing 5 U.S.C. &#167; 608(b), AFM argues that failure to prepare a suitable FRFA caused Amendment 7 to lapse.

They unsuccessfully asked the district court to invalidate the Secretary's final rulemaking and thereby avert this potential calamity.  They now ask us for the same relief, urging that the Secretary failed to comply with both the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1801-1882 (1994), and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 601-612 (1994 &amp; Supp.1997).  Although we have considerable empathy for the fishermens' concerns, we conclude, after wading through an administrative record which comprises roughly 30,000 pages, that the Secretary acted within his lawful purview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Responding to depletion of the nation's fish stocks due to overfishing, Congress enacted the Magnuson Act in 1976 to protect fishery resources.  See 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1801(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Act created eight regional fishery management councils, each of which has responsibility for fashioning a fishery management plan (FMP) to regulate commercial fishing within a particular geographic region.  See id. &#167;&#167; 1852(a)(1)-(8), 1852(h)(1).  When a proposed FMP (or a plan amendment) is developed, the council must submit it to the Secretary for review.  See id. &#167; 1853(c).  The Secretary then determines whether the proposed FMP is consistent not only with the Magnuson Act's seven national standards for fishery conservation and management, see id. &#167; 1851(a)(1)-(7), but also with other applicable law, including the RFA, see id. &#167;&#167; 1854(a)(1)(B), 1855(e).  In making this determination, the Secretary must publish an appropriate notice, see id. &#167; 1854(a)(1)(C), consider the comments engendered in response thereto, see id. &#167; 1854(a)(2)(A), and consult with the Coast Guard anent enforcement, see id. &#167; 1854(a)(2)(C).  If the Secretary approves the amendment, he then promulgates final implementing regulations, which are subject to judicial review.  See id. &#167; 1855(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE COURSE OF EVENTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New England Fishery Management Council (the Council) has authority over commercial fishing in the Atlantic Ocean off the New England coast.  See id. &#167; 1852(a)(1).  Under its aegis, the management and conservation of the New England Groundfish Fishery has had a tangled history.  See generally Peter Shelley et al., The New England Fisheries Crisis:  What Have We Learned?, 9 Tul.Envtl.L.J. 221, 223-33 (1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  When less intrusive efforts did not prevent overfishing, the Council developed the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan in 1985.  The Secretary approved it only as a stopgap.  Four amendments to the interim rule followed, none of which proved adequate.  See Conservation Law Found. of New Eng., Inc. v. Franklin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602839\"><a href=\"/opinion/602839/conservation-law-foundation-of-new-england-inc-v-barbara-h-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1993).  Litigation over the last of these amendments resulted in a consent decree.  The decree established a timetable for adopting an FMP that would reverse the continuing depletion of cod, flounder, and haddock stocks within specified periods.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, the Council recommended, and the Secretary, acting through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, approved Amendment 5. This amendment sought to eliminate overfishing of cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder stocks by sharply reducing permissible fishing over a five to seven year period.  See 59 Fed.Reg. 9872 (1994) (final rule).  To achieve this goal, the amendment proposed a gradual reduction in the annual number of working days at sea (DAS) for certain fishing vessels and created three classes of permits.  See 50 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 651.22, 651.4 (1995).  The class that is relevant here comprises limited access multispecies permits (which, in turn, are subdivided into fleet and individual permits).  Amendment 5 sets up a DAS notification program that requires vessels covered by fleet permits to notify the NMFS of departure and arrival times.  See id. &#167; 651.29.  In addition, the amendment establishes a vessel tracking system (VTS) that is intended to function by means of electronic devices installed on board vessels with individual permits.  See id. &#167; 651.28.  Because the VTS is not yet operational, both classes of permit holders must satisfy the call-in requirements of the DAS notification program for the time being.  See id. &#167; 651.29(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by the Secretary's handiwork, AFM challenged Amendment 5 in Maine's federal district court.  By that time, however, haddock and yellowtail stocks had collapsed, and cod stocks were near collapse.  See NMFS, Report of the 18th Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop (18th SAW):  The Plenary 53-54 (1994).  In light of this troubling new information, Amendment 5 seemed inadequate either to protect or rebuild these stocks, and NMFS's Stock Assessment Review Committee recommended that the Council reduce ichthyic mortality to as low a level as possible.  See id. at 53.   In response, the Council adopted Amendment 6 (an emergency measure designed to protect haddock, see 59 Fed.Reg. 32,134 (1994)) and thereafter developed Amendment 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary promulgated Amendment 7 as a final rule after notice and comment.  See 61 Fed.Reg. 8540 (proposed rule) &amp; 27,710 (1996) (final rule) (to be codified at 50 C.F.R. pt. 651).  Among other things, Amendment 7 seeks to reduce ichthyic mortality rates and rebuild multispecies stocks by (1) setting annual \"allowable catch\" targets for regulated species, (2) orchestrating new area closures, and (3) implementing further DAS cutbacks (including acceleration of the reduction schedule originally established in Amendment 5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Although the Secretary acknowledged the significant negative economic impacts (especially on trawl vessels) which Amendment 7 would invite, he concluded that conservation of the fishery would yield greater long-term benefits.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unmollified, AFM amended its pending judicial complaint to challenge Amendment 7 as well as Amendment 5. It alleged, inter alia, that both amendments violated the Magnuson Act and the RFA.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The district court then held a one-day informational hearing, during which the parties' experts explained their respective positions on scientific, economic, and ecological principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the court granted summary judgment in the Secretary's favor.  See Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span> (D.Me.1997).  As to issues that are relevant in this appeal, the court held that the newly enacted judicial review provisions of the RFA did not apply retroactively, and that, in all events, the Secretary had complied with the RFA.  See id. at 386-87.   The court also held that the Secretary's rulemaking did not run afoul of the Magnuson Act.  See id. at 388-90.   AFM now appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>III. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.

This rubric has a special twist in the administrative law context.  The Magnuson Act incorporates the familiar standard of review associated with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  See 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1855(b).  Where the APA standard obtains, a court may set aside an administrative action only if that action is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A)-(D).  Because the APA standard affords great deference to agency decisionmaking and because the Secretary's action is presumed valid, judicial review, even at the summary judgment stage, is narrow.

The Secretary was presented with reliable scientific data indicating that stocks had collapsed;  he was advised that the prophylactic measures specified in Amendment 5 were clearly inadequate to alleviate the steadily worsening plight;  and he also was told that certain ichthyic mortality rates ought to be reduced significantly.  Responding to this influx of new information, the Council conducted extensive scientific analyses and devised Amendment 7 as a means of ensuring the longterm stability of the fishery.  The Secretary studied the data, weighed plethoric comments, and decided to promulgate the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we cannot say that the Secretary exercised his discretion in an irrational, mindless, or whimsical manner.  When an agency is faced with conflicting scientific views and chooses among them, its decision cannot be termed arbitrary or capricious.  Indeed, a reviewing court must afford special deference to an agency's scientific expertise where, as here, that expertise is applied in areas within the agency's specialized field of competence.

Compliance with National Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Magnuson Act sets up a series of seven national standards.  See 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(1)-(7).  To ensure compliance with these standards, the responsible agency must perform a cost/benefit analysis ancillary to the promulgation of an FMP. Here, the analysis for Amendment 7 showed a projected net benefit of $18 million over the ten-year rebuilding period.  AFM insists that the Secretary put his thumb on the scale when conducting this analysis, and that Amendment 7 therefore fails to satisfy the national standards.  Specifically, AFM charges that the Secretary arbitrarily disregarded certain enforcement and compliance expenses which, when properly included, would demonstrate that the likely costs of Amendment 7 substantially exceed the likely benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Magnuson Act defines \"optimum yield\" as the amount of fish which will secure the greatest overall benefit to the nation based on the maximum sustainable yield from a fishery, as modified by relevant economic, social, or ecological factors.  See id. &#167; 1802(21).  The bedrock principle of National Standard 1 is that conservation and resource management measures, such as Amendment 7, \"shall prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the United States fishing industry.\"  Id. &#167; 1851(a)(1).  Relatedly, National Standard 7 requires that \"[c]onservation and management measures shall, where practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.\"  Id. &#167; 1851(a)(7).  In pursuance of his statutory duty, see id. &#167; 1851(b), the Secretary established regulatory guidelines to assure that FMPs would be developed in accordance with these national standards.  See 50 C.F.R. pt. 602 (1995).  The regulatory guidelines make it plain that the agency should weigh the costs associated with an FMP (including industry compliance and enforcement costs) against the forecasted benefits.  See id. &#167; 602.17(b)(2)(vii), (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Secretary excluded Coast Guard enforcement costs from the calculus.  AFM terms this exclusion arbitrary, but the administrative record belies that characterization.  The Secretary specifically addressed this issue and the documentation supporting the final rules contains a rational explanation for his decision.  Although the Coast Guard estimated that Amendment 7 would increase enforcement costs by approximately $20,800,000 per year, its estimate assumed sea-based enforcement whereas Amendment 7, as drafted, relied primarily on land-based enforcement through the notification and tracking systems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,719.   Even if certain sea-based costs occurred under Amendment 7, the Secretary explained, they would not comprise increases in overall costs because they would \"actually represent programmatic improvements that could also be expected to be made in the out years of [Amendment 5].\" Id.  For this reason, the Secretary's cost/benefit analysis explicitly assumed that Amendment 7 would not yield enforcement costs greater than those which would have been borne under Amendment 5. See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,719, &amp; 27,722.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this explanation is sufficiently logical, and sufficiently rooted in the record, to dispose of AFM's argument concerning Coast Guard enforcement costs.  It also answers AFM's additional argument that the Secretary improperly excluded the costs of industry compliance with Amendment 7. The Secretary's assumption--that compliance costs will not vary materially as between Amendment 5 and Amendment 7--flows rationally from Amendment 7's retention of the enforcement mechanism established under Amendment 5. See 50 C.F.R. &#167; 651.29.  Consequently, since Amendment 7 does not alter the taxonomy that determines which vessels will require VTS installations, AFM's claim that the new regulation fails to account for added VTS-related costs lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the record reveals that the Secretary carefully considered the enforcement measures associated with Amendment 7 and, consistent with the evidence before him, concluded (1) that the Coast Guard estimate was largely a figment of bureaucratic imagination which did not track the actual enforcement mechanism needed for the FMP, and therefore did not warrant inclusion in the calculus of likely costs and benefits, and (2) that compliance costs for the fishing industry would remain roughly the same under Amendment 7. Whether or not we, if writing on a pristine page, would have reached the same set of conclusions is not the issue.  What matters is that the administrative judgment, right or wrong, derives from the record, possesses a rational basis, and evinces no mistake of law.  Consequently, it merits our approbation.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. at 2866-67;  Kreps, 563 F.2d at 1056.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager, of course, is the enormous difficulty of estimating enforcement costs in advance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Administrative decisionmaking is not an exact science, and judicial review must recognize that some arbitrariness is inherent in the exercise of discretion amid uncertainty.  Accordingly, courts reviewing this type of administrative decision must leave room for a certain amount of play in the joints.  See Fishermen's Dock, 75 F.3d at 171-72;  Alaska Factory Trawler Ass'n v. Baldridge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496622\"><a href=\"/opinion/496622/alaska-factory-trawler-association-v-malcolm-baldridge-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1456</span></a></span>, 1460 (9th Cir.1987) (per curiam).  Here, the reasons offered to explain the Secretary's determination that Amendment 7 is consistent with the national standards reflect an understanding of analytical factors and constitute a rational exercise of deliberative decisionmaking.  Hence, we cannot say that this determination offends the applicable standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>V.

See 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1854(a)(1)(B), 1855(e).

Congress enacted the RFA to encourage administrative agencies to consider the potential impact of nascent federal regulations on small businesses.  See Pub.L. No. 96-354, &#167; 2(b), 94 Stat. 1164, 1165 (1980) (statement of purpose);  see generally Paul R. Verkuil, A Critical Guide to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 1982 Duke L.J. 213, 215-26 (1982).  Under the RFA, an agency that publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) describing the effect of the proposed rule on small businesses and discussing alternatives that might minimize adverse economic consequences.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 603.  When promulgating a final rule, the agency not only must prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) but also must make copies available to members of the public and publish directions for obtaining such copies.  See id. &#167; 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary promulgated Amendment 7 on May 31, 1996.  At that time, the law expressly prohibited judicial review of agency compliance with sections 603 and 604.  See id. &#167; 611;  see also Thompson v.

Approximately two months earlier, however, Congress had amended the RFA by enacting the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), Pub.L. No. 104-121, tit.  II, 110 Stat. 857, 864-68 (1996).  The 1996 Amendments reshaped the contours of the mandated flexibility analysis and provided for judicial review of the agency's product.  See id. &#167;&#167; 241, 242, 110 Stat. at 864-66 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 604(a), 611(a)(1) (Supp.1997)).  Because Congress delayed the effective date of these amendments until ninety days after passage, see id. &#167; 245, 110 Stat. at 868, they were not in effect when the Secretary promulgated Amendment 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>A.

Rec. E571, E574 (daily ed. Apr. 19, 1996) (statement of Rep.  Hyde) (twice indicating that judicial review would be available for rules promulgated after the effective date).  On the other hand, the new judicial review provision does not affect substantive rights but merely confers jurisdiction, and courts often give retroactive effect to such statutes.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 274, 114 S.Ct. at 1501-02;  but see Hughes Aircraft, --- U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1878 (drawing a distinction between an amendment which merely allocates jurisdiction among fora and one which creates jurisdiction where none previously existed, and stating that the latter is subject to the presumption against retroactivity).  Moreover, the Third Circuit, contradicting Judge Hornby's \"one legislative package\" rationale, recently held that the 1996 Amendments were severable and that the judicial review provision could be applied to a legislative rule promulgated before their effective date.  See Southwestern Pa.  Growth Alliance v.

The 1996 Amendments substantively altered section 604 by reformulating and augmenting the required content of an FRFA.  See 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 604(a) (Supp.1997).  The renovated version now requires that an FRFA contain the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) a succinct statement of the need for, and objectives of, the rule;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) a summary of the significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, a summary of the assessment of the agency of such issues, and a statement of any changes made in the proposed rule as a result of such comments;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) a description of and an estimate of the number of small entities to which the rule will apply or an explanation of why no such estimate is available;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) a description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) a description of the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, including a statement of the factual, policy, and legal reasons for selecting the alternative adopted in the final rule and why each one of the other significant alternatives to the rule considered by the agency which affect the impact on small entities was rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 604(a) (Supp.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A comparison of this iteration with the prior version, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 604(a) (1994), reveals that subsections (3) and (4) are brand new insofar as FRFAs are concerned, and that subsection (5), modifying the former subsection (3), imposes more specific content requirements.  Since the Secretary completed the FRFA and promulgated Amendment 7 before the effective date of the 1996 Amendments, applying the neoteric version of section 604 would impose new strictures with respect to matters already completed, and, thus, would contravene the rule against retroactivity.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. at 1505.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFM offers only a weak rejoinder.  It says that retroactive application would not impose new duties because Congress passed the 1996 Amendments before the agency prepared the FRFA.  That is so--but it is beside the point.  SBREFA's effective date constitutes the cut-off point, and the Secretary had completed and published both the FRFA and the final rule prior to that time.  Thus, imposing incremental requirements on these actions would have an impermissible retroactive effect.

Aug. 6, 1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Legislative history confirms that Congress, in enacting section 604, intended to compel administrative agencies to explain the bases for their actions and to ensure that alternative proposals receive serious consideration at the agency level.  See id. at S21,460;  see also S.Rep. No. 96-878, at 13-14 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2788, 2800-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this intention, Congress emphasized that the RFA should not be construed to undermine other legislatively mandated goals.

Thus, section 604 does not command an agency to take specific substantive measures, but, rather, only to give explicit consideration to less onerous options:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>[T]his provision does not require that an agency adopt a rule establishing differing compliance standards, exemptions, or any other alternative to the proposed rule.  It requires that an agency, having identified and analyzed significant alternative proposals, describe those it considered and explain its rejection of any which, if adopted, would have been substantially less burdensome on the specified entities.  Evidence that such an alternative would not have accomplished the stated objectives of the applicable statutes would sufficiently justify the rejection of the alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">126 Cong.

See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332 (1994).  The EIS requirement is meant to inform the agency and the public about potential adverse ecological effects and about the availability, if any, of less harmful alternatives prior to a final decision on the fate of a particular project or rule.

In light of this purpose, courts do not review challenges to the adequacy of an EIS under a standard of mathematical exactitude but under a standard of reasonableness.  See Aldridge, 886 F.2d at 459;  Conservation Law Found. of New Eng., Inc. v. Andrus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379194\"><a href=\"/opinion/379194/conservation-law-foundation-of-new-england-inc-v-cecil-d-andrus-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 719 (1st Cir.1979).  Recognizing the analogous objectives of the two acts, we believe that the same rule of reason should apply to judicial review of challenges under RFA &#167; 604.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, we proceed to examine whether the Secretary made a reasonable, good-faith effort to carry out the mandate of section 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, NMFS prepared an FRFA consisting of its initial workup (the IRFA) and its responses to submitted comments.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,730-31;  see also 59 Fed.Reg. 9872, 9883 (1994) (final rule, Amendment 5).  AFM contends that this proffer misfires for two reasons.  First, AFM maintains that dressing up an IRFA by tacking on responses to comments does not comply with the statutory directive that the agency prepare an FRFA.  Second, AFM asserts that the Secretary failed sufficiently to identify, and adequately to explain his rejection of, alternatives designed to minimize deleterious economic effects on small businesses.  We address these objections in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject AFM's charge that the FRFA is inadequate on its face.  Section 604 prescribes the content of an FRFA, but it does not demand a particular mode of presentation.  To disregard otherwise compliant analysis simply because it is not ensconced in a specific format would be inconsistent both with the RFA's explicit authorization to avoid duplicative or unnecessary analyses, see 5 U.S.C. &#167; 605(a), and with the legislative concession that an agency \"may incorporate in a regulatory flexibility analysis any data or analysis contained in any other impact statement or analysis required by law,\" 126 Cong.  Rec. at S21,460.  Accordingly, we hold that an agency can satisfy section 604 as long as it compiles a meaningful, easily understood analysis that covers each requisite component dictated by the statute and makes the end product--whatever form it reasonably may take--readily available to the public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to suggest that the combination of an IRFA and responses to comments always--or even often--will pass muster.  But in the absence of a statutory or regulatory directive specifying the form of document to be produced, the preparing agency must be accorded ample latitude in making the choice.  See Town of Orangetown v. Gorsuch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"425099\"><a href=\"/opinion/425099/town-of-orangetown-v-anne-gorsuch-individually-and-as-administrator-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 40 (2d Cir.1983).  This precept is especially pertinent here, since the IRFA was reasonably extensive, the wide range of comments anent the proposed rule (many of which were submitted by small businesses or proxies on their behalf) provided a natural forum for the Secretary in striving to fulfill his section 604 obligation, and the agency punctiliously complied with the notice requirements of RFA &#167; 604(b).  Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Secretary acted within his proper province in designating the IRFA and the responses to comments as the FRFA required by the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now from form to substance and inspect the adequacy of the FRFA's contents.  We preface this discussion by remarking two important considerations.  First, section 604 does not require that an FRFA address every alternative, but only that it address significant ones.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 604(a)(3).  Second, the majority of commercial fishing vessels in the Northeast are deemed small businesses for purposes of the RFA.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 601(3);  13 C.F.R. &#167; 121.601 (1995);  see also 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,731 (memorializing the Secretary's recognition of this reality).  It follows that any attempt to reduce the adverse economic impacts of a regulation aimed at rebuilding stocks in this fishery is necessarily an attempt to minimize the negative effects of the regulation on small businesses.  To that extent, Congress' desire to have agencies write rules that distinguish (where desirable) between big and small businesses has diminished relevance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After poring over the FRFA, we conclude that the Secretary fulfilled his substantive obligation under section 604.  The agency's reply to a comment which suggested that the final rule violates the spirit of the RFA demonstrates a keen understanding of the RFA's objectives and states the parameters of the Secretary's obligation quite well:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>The intent of the RFA is not to limit regulations having adverse economic impacts on small entities, rather the intent is to have the agency focus special attention on the impacts its proposed actions would have on small entities, to disclose to the public which alternatives it considered to lessen adverse impacts, to require the agency to consider public comments on impacts and alternatives, and to require the agency to state its reasons for not adopting an alternative having less of an adverse impact on small entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">61 Fed.Reg. at 27,721.   The analysis that the agency undertook is fully consonant with this aspirational language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, the IRFA (incorporated into the FRFA) describes several possible alternatives and summarizes the potential economic impact of each.  The agency concluded that each of these scenarios would have a greater negative impact on the fishing industry than would the proposed rule.  For example, the agency rejected Alternative 1 (which included a ban on fishing with certain gear until the spawning stock biomass reached a minimum threshold level) because it would result in unacceptably high levels of foregone income;  it rejected Alternative 2 (which proposed closing half of certain fishing areas and placing restrictions in open areas) on the basis that it would be massively inefficient and would dramatically increase vessel operating costs;  and it rejected Alternative 4 (which favored a quota system) for much the same reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The responses to submitted comments (which also form a part of the FRFA) discuss and dismiss additional alternatives.  For example, responding to a comment that characterized closures in the Gulf of Maine as detrimental to the industry, NMFS explained that this was a temporary default measure to reduce ichthyic mortality in situations where DAS reductions were insufficient.  In that regard, the FRFA noted that the Council had considered reducing DAS allotments but declined to pursue that alternative after receiving industry comment indicating a preference for flexibility.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,714-15.   By like token, the agency explicated its rejection of the status quo alternative, reiterating that Amendment 5 had been conceived as a means of arresting the decline in spawning stock biomass, whereas Amendment 7 responded to a new, emerging need and purposed to rebuild the biomass to levels which would ensure stability.  See id. at 27,721.   The agency also explained why some DAS exemptions under the status quo alternative, which had the capacity partially to alleviate burdens on small vessels, could not be retained under the more rigorous conservation goals of Amendment 7. See id. at 27,715.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is noteworthy, too, that the RFA identifies steps taken for the express purpose of mitigating adverse economic impacts on small fishing businesses.  In this vein, the Secretary eliminated a provision requiring layover days, thereby easing the concerns of smaller vessels (which are more sensitive to inclement weather).  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,717.   Similarly, the Secretary phased in the DAS reduction schedule over two years instead of one because, though conservationists recommended an 80 percent reduction in mortality rates, the Secretary feared that vessels could not financially weather a DAS reduction greater than 50 percent.  The Secretary also moved to establish a vessel buyout program reducing the socioeconomic burden on small entities.  See id. at 27,731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that these selected examples convey the flavor of the FRFA as a whole.  The point is not whether the Secretary's judgments are beyond reproach, but whether he made a reasonable, good-faith effort to canvass major options and weigh their probable effects.  Here, the record reveals that the Secretary explicitly considered numerous alternatives, exhibited a fair degree of sensitivity concerning the need to alleviate the regulatory burden on small entities within the fishing industry, adopted some salutary measures designed to ease that burden, and satisfactorily explained his reasons for rejecting others.  The fact that AFM has pointed to no significant alternative that escaped the Secretary's notice attests to the thoroughness of the Secretary's efforts.  Because the Secretary's specification and discussion of significant alternatives was reasonable, it fulfilled the substantive requirements of section 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFM makes one last-ditch argument in respect to section 604.  It carps that the Secretary failed to develop an alternative that substantially lessens the economic impact on small entities.  This puts the catch before the cast and, in the bargain, confuses what the fishermen desire with what the statute obliges the Secretary to do.  An adequate discussion of alternatives in an FRFA is context-specific.  Of necessity, given the distressed condition of groundfish stocks in this fishery, any alternative consistent with the Secretary's conservation mandate under the Magnuson Act will produce economic hardships for the industry.  The FRFA reveals that the Secretary assessed the potential impact of Amendment 7 on small businesses, mulled other options in good faith, and sought to strike the best available balance between conservation goals and the legitimate concerns of the fishing community.  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>D. Section 609.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 609 of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 609, directs agencies to assure that small entities are given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process for any rule that is likely to produce significant economic impacts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  AFM claims that the Secretary improperly limited participation in the process and failed to provide adequate assistance to small entities in evaluating agency reports.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While section 609 instructs the Secretary to assure participation, the method and manner of doing so is left primarily to the Secretary's sound discretion.  In this situation, we are satisfied that the Secretary provided adequate participatory opportunities for small businesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Council meetings were open to all interested parties and were well-attended.  Public hearings were held in six states.  Scientific data was broadly disseminated through open workshops and otherwise.  See, e.g., 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,714 &amp; 27,720 &amp; 27,723.   Several representatives of small entities participated in a regional stock assessment workshop, at which scientific data was presented and peer-reviewed.  The nature and volume of the submitted comments is emblematic of a very high level of public participation.  Furthermore, the substance of the comments leaves no doubt but that small fishing businesses were intimately familiar with the crisis and were well aware of the potential significance of the management efforts that were being studied.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 27,712-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the development of Amendment 7 involved daunting scientific complexities.  That stems from the intrinsic nature of the problem, not from some fault on the Secretary's part.  Since the Secretary provided repeated and varied opportunities for meaningful participation by small entities, he met the relatively modest demands that section 609 imposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint that the Secretary did too little to assist small entities wishing to participate in the process is equally unavailing.  Section 609 does not mandate specific types of assistance.  Rather, it offers a list of suggested techniques to assure participation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The legislative history confirms the purport of the statutory language;  agencies have the discretion to select among various methods of outreach.  See 126 Cong.  Rec. at S21,460.  Here, the record discloses that the Secretary handled the matter in a perfectly reasonable way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, it is evident that rapidly deteriorating conditions required the Secretary to fish in troubled waters.  The immediacy of the need to rebuild groundfish stocks left him no easy way out.  In the absence of a perfect (or even near-perfect) solution, he reasoned his way to a decision that balanced the significant adverse impacts that Amendment 7 would have on the industry against the severe depletion which plagued this fishery and the legal obligation to develop an FMP that would eliminate overfishing.  Having carefully reviewed the administrative record, we conclude that the product of his labors--Amendment 7--is rational and fairly supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Although we are not unsympathetic to the plight of the individuals who will suffer adverse consequences from the choices embodied in the final rule, we must uphold the balance struck by the Secretary among competing concerns.

See Pub.L. No. 104-297, 110 Stat. 3559 (Oct. 11, 1996).  All references herein are to the Magnuson Act, which was in effect when the challenged rules were promulgated, not to the Magnuson-Stevens Act</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Groundfish include cod, haddock, flounder, and other species that dwell near the ocean floor.  See Shelley, supra, 9 Tul.  Envtl.  L.J. at 223 &amp; n. 4 (listing the 13 species included in the groundfish management plan)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because the Secretary recognized his inability to foresee the effect of various measures with certitude, he inserted in Amendment 7, as in Amendment 5, a process that allows him to adjust DAS allocations and requirements as stocks recover or as other circumstances change.  See 50 C.F.R. &#167; 651.40</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In the district court, AFM advanced claims under various other statutory provisions, as well as claims implicating constitutional standards and executive orders.  None was successful.  See Associated Fisheries, 954 F.Supp. at 385 &amp; n. 3. AFM does not pursue any of these theories on appeal, and we express no opinion on them</p>\n        <p>We note, moreover, that in this court, as below, AFM challenges Amendment 5, as modified by Amendment 7. For simplicity's sake, we refer mainly to the latter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Moreover, as alluded to in agency correspondence and further explicated during the informational hearing held by the district court, the Secretary considered the Coast Guard's estimate to be budgetary in nature and not rooted in cost increases which were likely to accompany the implementation of Amendment 7. The Secretary must be accorded some latitude to make such judgment calls.  Cf. Sierra Club, 976 F.2d at 771</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The agency discussed this difficulty in the final environmental impact statement and noted that it was compounded here because enforcement resources are shared among several management plans</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Our task is made much easier because the lower court, though concluding that the judicial review provision did not apply, nonetheless proceeded to reach the merits and, in an alternate holding, laid out a blueprint that makes very good sense.  See Associated Fisheries, 954 F.Supp. at 386-87.   We commend Judge Hornby for his prudent belt-and-suspenders approach</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> RFA traveled a somewhat unconventional route in its march towards passage.  The Senate rejected the Senate bill, S. 299, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, and adopted Senator Culver's substitute bill.  See 126 Cong.  Rec. S21,449-51 (daily ed.  Aug. 6, 1980).  The House passed the bill without either amendment or separate hearings, and endorsed the Senate's section-by-section analysis.  See Thompson, 741 F.2d at 406 (tracing legislative history);  see generally Verkuil, supra, at 226-27.   We therefore examine the substitute bill and its accompanying analysis as the relevant guide to legislative intent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Since an EIS, unlike an FRFA, must contain a \"detailed\" statement, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2)(C), the analogy seems more than fair to AFM</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In pressing for a contrary result, the appellant relies heavily on a letter written to NMFS by the Small Business Administration (SBA) criticizing the agency's earlier efforts to comply with the RFA in the development of Amendment 5. We give little, if any, weight to the letter.  For one thing, it is directed only to compliance vis-a-vis Amendment 5. For another thing, although the RFA authorizes the SBA to appear as an amicus curiae, see 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 612(b) (1994 &amp; Supp.1997), the SBA has chosen not to exercise that prerogative in respect to Amendment 7</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Citing 5 U.S.C. &#167; 608(b), AFM argues that failure to prepare a suitable FRFA caused Amendment 7 to lapse.  This argument is jejune.  The lapse provision applies only to delayed compliance following the promulgation of emergency rules.  See Thompson, 741 F.2d at 407-08.   That is not the situation here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The 1996 Amendments provide that agency compliance with section 609 is subject to judicial review in conjunction with judicial review of challenges under amended section 604.  See 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 609 (Supp.1997).  Noting that the substantive alterations to section 609 effected by the 1996 Amendments are of little significance to this appeal, AFM does not pursue its retroactivity argument with regard to section 609.  Accordingly, we test compliance against the language of the provision as it stood on May 31, 1996 (the date the Secretary promulgated Amendment 7)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, the statute directs that the promulgating agency</p>\n        <p>shall assure that small entities have been given an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking for the rule through techniques such as--</p>\n        <p>(1) the inclusion in an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, if issued, of a statement that the proposed rule may have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities;</p>\n        <p>...</p>\n        <p>(4) the conduct of open conferences or public hearings concerning the rule for small entities;  and</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>5 U.S.C. &#167; 609 (1994).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
