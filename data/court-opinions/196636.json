Appellant, a  citizen of the\r                                            \r\n\nDominican  Republic, who  had been  convicted of  a Puerto  Rican\r\n\nfelony of  possession of a controlled  substance and subsequently\r\n\ndeported, appeals  from his federal conviction  of reentering the\r\n\nUnited  States without  permission  of the  Attorney General,  in\r\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C.   1326(b)(2).\r\n\n     Appellant  served  almost a  year in  prison in  Puerto Rico\r\n\nafter conviction in 1991.   He was deported on  July 7, 1992.   A\r\n\nmonth later, he  returned to Puerto  Rico in a yawl,  telling the\r\n\ncourt  at sentencing  that he  did not  know he was  forbidden to\r\n\nreturn.  He  remained in Puerto Rico, working on a farm, and,  in\r\n\nApril of 1993, married.   He returned  to Santo Domingo in  1994.\r\n\nHis  wife, a  United States  citizen, requested  a visa  for him,\r\n\nwhich the American Consulate  in Santo Domingo issued on  May 24,\r\n\n1994. \r\n\n     In  the  application  he  denied having  been  deported  and\r\n\nfalsely averred  that he  had lived continuously  in Puerto  Rico\r\n\nfrom 1986  through 1994.    He did  not  report his  Puerto  Rico\r\n\nconviction,  but  attached  to  his application  a  good  conduct\r\n\ncertificate issued by the Puerto Rico police.1\r\n\n     On  the  day  after issuance  of  the  visa,  May 25,  1994,\r\n\nappellant arrived at the  Luis Munoz Marin International Airport,\r\n\npresented his  visa  and passport,  and,  when a  computer  check\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  The certificate was issued to one Nerly Osmard-Silvestre.\r\nAs the  government points out,  appellant's name is  Nerly Osmard\r\nSilvestre, his true  last name being Silvestre, Osmard  not being\r\nhis paternal last name.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nrevealed an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) look-out\r\n\nfor him,  underwent further examination.   When asked  whether he\r\n\nhad  violated any immigration laws, he  was evasive.  Questioning\r\n\ncontinued  after   a  computer  check  had   revealed  his  prior\r\n\ndeportation and  after  appellant's rights  had been  read and  a\r\n\nWaiver  of Rights form signed.   Appellant then  admitted that he\r\n\nhad been deported and that  he had not acknowledged this  fact in\r\n\napplying for his visa.\r\n\n     After a jury trial, appellant was convicted and sentenced to\r\n\na  term  of sixty-three  months'  imprisonment plus  a  period of\r\n\nsupervised release and a monetary assessment.\r\n\n     On appeal,  appellant raises three  issues.  The  first, his\r\n\nclaim that the district  court erred in allowing a  sixteen point\r\n\noffense  level enhancement  by  reason of  considering his  prior\r\n\nPuerto  Rican felony  conviction one  for an  \"aggravated felony\"\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2), was acknowledged by counsel at oral\r\n\nargument to be foreclosed by our recent decision in United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Restrepo- Aguilar, 74 F.3d 361 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                              \r\n\n     Appellant's  second claim is that  he was entitled  to a two\r\n\npoint  reduction  in  his   offense  level  because  he  accepted\r\n\nresponsibility by admitting the  facts constituting the  elements\r\n\nof the crime for  which he was being prosecuted.   His contention\r\n\nin his brief on appeal is that he was simply presenting the legal\r\n\nissue whether a visa or \"permission from the state department was\r\n\nequivalent to the Attorney General's consent.\"  This dresses up a\r\n\nbit  the theory advanced by trial counsel in opening: \"therefore,\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nby giving the visa, they receive the permission from the Attorney\r\n\nGeneral  . . . .\"  Counsel then seemed to be under the impression\r\n\nthat  only the INS, an  agency within the  Department of Justice,\r\n\nwas involved in the issuance of visas.\r\n\n     In either version this claim has the merit of ingenuity, but\r\n\nthat is its extent.  Preliminarily, we observe that we review for\r\n\nclear  error only.  See United States v. Iguaran-Palmar, 926 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n7, 9  (1st Cir. 1991).   We begin with the  inconsistency between\r\n\nappellant's statement at sentencing that he did not know, when he\r\n\nmade  his trip  by yawl,  that there  were any restraints  on his\r\n\nright   to  reenter  the  United  States.    Not  only  was  this\r\n\ninconsistent with his surreptitious mode of reentry, but with his\r\n\nlater successful effort to obtain a visa. \r\n\n     Of greater moment is the fact that the  visa was obtained by\r\n\nmisrepresentation.   Appellant's legal theory, even if it were to\r\n\nbe accepted, is nevertheless  predicated upon the lawful issuance\r\n\nof  a  visa,   not  its  procurement  by  fraud   and  chicanery.\r\n\nAppellant's  position is  like that  of a  defendant defending  a\r\n\nlarceny  conviction who admitted all of the elements of the crime\r\n\nsuch as the taking and the intent to keep, but maintains that the\r\n\nvictim gave  the property  to him.   If, however, the  \"gift\" had\r\n\nbeen procured  through misrepresentation  or coercion,  any claim\r\n\nthat  defendant   would  have   been  deemed  to   have  accepted\r\n\nresponsibility would be bizarre.\r\n\n     Indeed,  the  claim  would  turn  a   vice  into  a  virtue.\r\n\nAppellant's   conduct  in   obtaining   a  visa   through   false\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nrepresentation  is within  the spirit  if not  the letter  of the\r\n\nstrictures of  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1 relating  to the  obstruction of\r\n\njustice.   Application  Note 3(b)  refers to  committing perjury;\r\n\n3(c) refers to  producing a  false document or  record during  an\r\n\nofficial  investigation;  and  3(g)  consists  of  \"providing   a\r\n\nmaterially  false statement  to  a law  enforcement officer  that\r\n\nsignificantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or\r\n\nprosecution of the  instant offense.\"  In other  words, appellant\r\n\nseeks to  parlay conduct  which might  conceivably support  a two\r\n\npoint increase in his offense level into a two point decrease.  \r                                                                       \r\n\n     Appellant's third  issue, that  the court erred  in allowing\r\n\nimproper  closing references  by  the prosecutor  to  appellant's\r\n\nstatements as  \"lies,\"  requires  little  discussion.    Although\r\n\nappellant  in his brief  asserts that objection  was timely made,\r\n\nthe only effort to  object was made after the  prosecutor's final\r\n\nremarks,  when counsel said merely,  \"I have an  objection to the\r\n\nclosing argument.\"   Assuming arguendo that the brevity  (two and\r\n\none half pages  of transcript)  of the closing  argument and  its\r\n\nfocus  on appellant's misrepresentations sufficiently alerted the\r\n\ncourt to the basis of objection, we find no error.\r\n\n     Here  the  prosecutor referred  on  three  occasions to  the\r\n\nstatements  made  in  applying for  the  visa  as  lies or  false\r\n\nstatements.   It is  hard for us  to see any  dereliction of duty\r\n\nhere,  even though  we have  been alert to  prosecutorial excess.\r\n\nAppellant based his defense on having obtained a  visa.  The fact\r\n\nthat his success was brought about by misrepresentations was both\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nrelevant and undisputed.  There is no hint here of the prosecutor\r\n\ninjecting his own  opinion.  Nor, indeed,  could these references\r\n\nhave added anything to what was already conceded before the jury.\r\n\n     AFFIRMED.       \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n",

Appellant then admitted that he had been deported and that he had not acknowledged this fact in applying for his visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury trial, appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term of sixty-three months' imprisonment plus a period of supervised release and a monetary assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant raises three issues.   The first, his claim that the district court erred in allowing a sixteen point offense level enhancement by reason of considering his prior Puerto Rican felony conviction one for an \"aggravated felony\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2), was acknowledged by counsel at oral argument to be foreclosed by our recent decision in United States v. RestrepoAguilar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196539\"><a href=\"/opinion/196539/united-states-v-restrepo-aguilar/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's second claim is that he was entitled to a two point reduction in his offense level because he accepted responsibility by admitting the facts constituting the elements of the crime for which he was being prosecuted.   His contention in his brief on appeal is that he was simply presenting the legal issue whether a visa or \"permission from the state department was equivalent to the Attorney General's consent.\"   This dresses up a bit the theory advanced by trial counsel in opening:  \"therefore, by giving the visa, they receive the permission from the Attorney General....\"  Counsel then seemed to be under the impression that only the INS, an agency within the Department of Justice, was involved in the issuance of visas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In either version this claim has the merit of ingenuity, but that is its extent.   Preliminarily, we observe that we review for clear error only.  See United States v. Iguaran-Palmar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556385\"><a href=\"/opinion/556385/united-states-v-john-iguaran-palmar/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1991).   We begin with the inconsistency between appellant's statement at sentencing that he did not know, when he made his trip by yawl, that there were any restraints on his right to reenter the United States.   Not only was this inconsistent with his surreptitious mode of reentry, but with his later successful effort to obtain a visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of greater moment is the fact that the visa was obtained by misrepresentation.   Appellant's legal theory, even if it were to be accepted, is nevertheless predicated upon the lawful issuance of a visa, not its procurement by fraud and chicanery.   Appellant's position is like that of a defendant defending a larceny conviction who admitted all of the elements of the crime such as the taking and the intent to keep, but maintains that the victim gave the property to him.   If, however, the \"gift\" had been procured through misrepresentation or coercion, any claim that defendant would have been deemed to have accepted responsibility would be bizarre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the claim would turn a vice into a virtue.   Appellant's conduct in obtaining a visa through false representation is within the spirit if not the letter of the strictures of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 relating to the obstruction of justice.   Application Note 3(b) refers to committing perjury;  3(c) refers to producing a false document or record during an official investigation;  and 3(g) consists of \"providing a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\"   In other words, appellant seeks to parlay conduct which might conceivably support a two point increase in his offense level into a two point decrease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's third issue, that the court erred in allowing improper closing references by the prosecutor to appellant's statements as \"lies,\" requires little discussion.   Although appellant in his brief asserts that objection was timely made, the only effort to object was made after the prosecutor's final remarks, when counsel said merely, \"I have an objection to the closing argument.\"   Assuming arguendo that the brevity (two and one half pages of transcript) of the closing argument and its focus on appellant's misrepresentations sufficiently alerted the court to the basis of objection, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the prosecutor referred on three occasions to the statements made in applying for the visa as lies or false statements.   It is hard for us to see any dereliction of duty here, even though we have been alert to prosecutorial excess.   Appellant based his defense on having obtained a visa.   The fact that his success was brought about by misrepresentations was both relevant and undisputed.   There is no hint here of the prosecutor injecting his own opinion.   Nor, indeed, could these references have added anything to what was already conceded before the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The certificate was issued to one Nerly Osmard-Silvestre.   As the government points out, appellant's name is Nerly Osmard Silvestre, his true last name being Silvestre, Osmard not being his paternal last name</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
