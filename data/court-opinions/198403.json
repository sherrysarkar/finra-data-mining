Hagley, Attorney, Federal Labor Relations Authority,\r\nwith whom David M. Smith, Solicitor, and William R. Tobey, Deputy\r\nSolicitor, Federal Labor Relations Authority, were on brief, for\r\nrespondent.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n               April 1, 1999\r\n                                           CUDAHY, Senior Circuit Judge.  New Hampshire takes\r\npolitics seriously.  Every four years, presidential hopefuls\r\ncoffee-and-chili their way through the Granite State, giving New\r\nHampshirites unparalleled personal access to the political elite. \r\nThe local chapter of the Association of Civilian Technicians (the\r\nUnion) apparently wanted a piece of this action and, during\r\ncollective bargaining negotiations with the New Hampshire National\r\nGuard in 1996, submitted a proposal which would have allowed union\r\nrepresentatives to lobby these and other politicians:\r\nAssociation officials will be granted not to\r\nexceed two days annually, official time to\r\nrepresent the bargaining unit by visiting,\r\nphoning, and writing to elected\r\nrepresentatives in support of or opposition to\r\npending desired legislation which would impact\r\nthe working conditions of employees\r\nrepresented by the [union].\r\n\nThe Union cited 5 U.S.C.  7102(1) and 7131(d) (effective Jan. 11,\r\n1979) as support for their proposal.  Section 7102(1) provides in\r\npertinent part that unionized government employees have the right\r\nto act for a labor organization in the\r\ncapacity of a representative and the right, in\r\nthat capacity, to present the views of the\r\nlabor organization to heads of agencies and\r\nother officials of the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment, the Congress, or other appropriate\r\nauthorities.\r\n\nSection 7131(d), which defines permissible uses of \"official time,\"\r\nfurther provides that any employee:\r\nin connection with any other matter covered by\r\nthis chapter . . . shall be granted official\r\ntime in any amount the agency and the [union]\r\nagree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the\r\npublic interest.\r\n\nThe Union claimed these provisions read together guaranteed its\r\nrepresentatives a reasonable amount of official time to lobby. \r\nThe National Guard refused to bargain over the proposal,\r\nalso citing statutory support for its decision.  Specifically, it\r\nargued that pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  7117(a)(1) its obligation to\r\nnegotiate did not extend to proposals which violated the law.  The\r\nGuard contended that the Union's request, if granted, would violate\r\nthree separate anti-lobbying statutory provisions -- sections 8001\r\nand 8015 of the 1996 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.\r\nL. No. 104-61, 109 Stat. 636, 651, 654 (1996) (the Act) and 18\r\nU.S.C.  1913.  The Union filed an unfair labor practice claim,\r\ncharging failure to bargain in good faith, which the parties\r\nsubmitted to the Federal Labor Relations Authority (the Authority)\r\non stipulated facts.\r\nThe Authority dismissed the complaint with one member\r\ndissenting.  See Office of the Adjutant General, New Hampshire\r\nNational Guard, 54 F.L.R.A. 301 (1998) (slip op.).  It first found\r\nthat the Union's proposal was consistent with both  1913 and\r\n8001.   The Authority did find, however, that the proposal\r\nconflicted with  8015, which provides in pertinent part:\r\nNone of the funds made available by this Act\r\nshall be used in any way, directly or\r\nindirectly, to influence congressional action\r\non any legislation or appropriation matters\r\npending before the Congress.\r\n\nThe Authority held that the unambiguous and unqualified language of\r\nthis section barred official- time lobbying by Department of\r\nDefense employees in 1996.  It also rejected as inapposite the\r\ndissenting member's reliance on General Accounting Office (GAO)\r\ninterpretations of other similar provisions and determined that\r\nresort to other indicia of Congressional intent was unnecessary\r\ngiven the clarity of  8015's language.  See New Hampshire National\r\nGuard, slip op. at 10-13.  Because the Union's proposal conflicted\r\nwith  8015, the National Guard was under no obligation to\r\nnegotiate over it, and the Authority therefore dismissed the\r\ncomplaint.  \r\nThe Union appeals, and, as an initial matter, the parties\r\ncontest our standard of review.  The Union argues that because the\r\nAuthority has no special competence interpreting Department of\r\nDefense appropriations acts, its construction of the Act is due no\r\ndeference.  Review should be de novo, the Union concludes.  The\r\nAuthority claims that our review is more limited; we should\r\n\"respect\" its reading of the Act and defer to it so long as it is\r\nreasonable.  Frequently, the resolution of this standards debate\r\ndisposes of the substantive issue.  Not so here:  whatever standard\r\nwe apply, we reach the conclusion that the Authority's decision was\r\nnot in error.\r\nWe begin with the elementary proposition that one\r\nCongress is not bound by the decisions of a previous Congress. \r\nSee, e.g., Reichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U.S. 315, 318 (1932);\r\nPassamaquoddy Tribe v. Maine, 75 F.3d 784, 789 (1st Cir. 1996). \r\nTimes change, and  Congress repeals some laws, adjusts others and\r\npasses new legislation to meet the challenges of the day and of its\r\nown policy preferences.  In most instances, Congress is explicit\r\nabout its intent to change the law.  In other cases, however,\r\nCongress is not so clear; the repeal is not explicit.  Although\r\nrepeal by implication is disfavored, especially in instances in\r\nwhich an appropriations bill is claimed to have repealed\r\nsubstantive law, United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 221-22\r\n(1980), it is not forbidden.  See id. at 222-24; Metlife Capital\r\nCorp. v. M/V Emily S., 132 F.3d 818, 821-22 (1st Cir. 1997).  If\r\none Congress clearly and manifestly makes known its intent to\r\nsupplant an existing law, a court can find repeal by implication. \r\nSee, e.g., Metlife Capital, 132 F.3d at 822.  Where, for example,\r\ntwo statutes are in irreconcilable conflict, the later law, in\r\nwhole or in part, constitutes a repeal of the former.  See id.  \r\nThis is such a case.  The 104th Congress picked its terms\r\ncarefully, and we must give them their full effect.  See, e.g., BFPv. Resolution Trust Corp., 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994).  It chose\r\nunambiguous and unqualified language -- \"none,\" \"in any way,\"\r\n\"directly or indirectly.\"  This pleonasm leaves no room for doubt;\r\nCongress simply changed its mind.  The presence of exceptions in\r\nother anti-lobbying provisions, including 18 U.S.C.  1913 and\r\n8001 of the Act, only bolsters this conclusion.  See, e.g.,\r\nUnited Technologies Corp. v. Browning-Ferris Ind., Inc., 33 F.3d\r\n96, 100-101 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nEven after some prodding at oral argument, neither the\r\nAuthority (for reasons we do not fully understand) nor the Union\r\n(because it would lose) fully endorsed this conclusion.   Instead,\r\nthe parties bickered over which statute was more specific (and\r\nwhich two should be compared), whether reliance on sources other\r\nthan the statutory language might compel a different result and\r\nwhether the case implicated constitutional concerns.  These\r\narguments are red herrings.  Whether  8015 is more specific than\r\n7102 -- and in one sense it is -- is part-and-parcel of the\r\ninitial textual inquiry.  Section 8015's specificity is a clear and\r\nmanifest expression of Congress's intent to repeal the Union's\r\nright to lobby.  The Union also argues that Congress was not\r\nconcerned about unions lobbying, pointing to the legislative\r\nhistory of  8015 and GAO interpretations of similar provisions\r\nwhich suggest that Congress intended  8015 to bar only defense\r\ncontractors from lobbying the Department for more funds.  None of\r\nthese sources, however, can explain the absence of any\r\nqualifications in the clear language of  8015; Congress plainly\r\ndid not distinguish between defense contractors and unions\r\nconsisting of Defense Department employees.  And, in any event, we\r\nneed not consult extrinsic sources when the plain meaning of the\r\nstatutory language is clear.  See, e.g., Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d\r\n53, 67 (1st Cir. 1994).  Finally, the Union's derivative\r\nconstitutional arguments are unpersuasive.\r\nIn 1996, Congress decided that Department of Defense\r\nfunds should not be used for lobbying and drafted and passed an\r\nappropriations act to make this clear.  For that fiscal year,\r\n8015 repealed the Union's right to lobby Congress on official\r\ntime as otherwise guaranteed by 5 U.S.C.  7102.  Thus, the Union's\r\nproposal conflicted with  8015; the National Guard was under no\r\nobligation to negotiate over the proposal; and the Authority's\r\ndismissal of the unfair labor practice charge is AFFIRMED.\n",
