Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n                   Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Fuste,* U.S. District Judge.\r\n\n   Antonio Moreda-Toledo with whom Moreda &amp; Moreda, Fernandez\r\nCollins &amp; Rivero-Vergne, and Jose Luis Rivero-Vergne, were on\r\nbrief, for appellants.\r\n   Luis F. Antonetti-Zequeira, with whom Aida Barrios-\r\nCastellanos, and Goldman Antonetti &amp; Cordova, were on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nMAY 22, 1998\r\n\n                   \r\n*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.  Per curiam.  Plaintiffs-appellants Mario Alegre and Ana\r\nFuentes (individually and as a conjugal partnership) appeal from\r\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment against them and in\r\nfavor of defendant-appellee Schering Plough Del Caribe, Inc., on\r\nclaims of age discrimination brought under federal and Commonwealth\r\nlaw.  The district court explained its ruling in a comprehensive\r\nand cogently reasoned decision, see 975 F. Supp. 153 (D. P.R.\r\n1997), and our review of the record persuades us that a second,\r\nfull-blown opinion would serve no useful purpose, see, e.g.,\r\nSunview Condominium Assoc. v. Flexel Int'l, Ltd., 116 F.3d 962, 965\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  We therefore affirm the judgment largely on the\r\nbasis of the lower court opinion, adding a few comments and\r\nmodifying the judgment in one respect.\r\n1.  Plaintiffs strive to convince us that the lower court\r\nerred in concluding that plaintiff Alegre was not \"replaced\" by the\r\nyounger Marie Caballero because some of Alegre's job duties also\r\nwere assumed by Rafael Rivera.  In support of this argument,\r\nplaintiffs point to evidence which can be taken to demonstrate that\r\nMs. Caballero, and Ms. Caballero alone, assumed Alegre's duties. \r\nBe that as it may, plaintiffs overlook the fact that before the\r\nreduction-in-force (RIF) which resulted in the elimination of\r\nAlegre's position, there had been three persons performing the\r\nduties of the Health Care Sales Manager (Alegre's position),\r\nBusiness Development Manager (Rivera's position), and Product\r\nManager (Caballero's position).  Yet after the RIF, there were only\r\ntwo persons performing the duties previously associated with these\r\nthree positions.  Thus, regardless of how Alegre's former duties\r\nwere reallocated after the RIF, the lower court correctly concluded\r\nthat there was no trialworthy issue as to whether Alegre was, in\r\nfact, replaced.  See LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d\r\n836, 846 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"A discharged employee is not replaced\r\nwhen another employee is assigned to perform the plaintiff's duties\r\nin addition to other duties, or when the work is redistributed\r\namong other existing employees already performing related work.\")\r\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n2.  Having failed to demonstrate a trialworthy issue as\r\nto whether Alegre was replaced, and thereby having failed to\r\nestablish as possibly pretextual Schering's assertion that Alegre's\r\nposition was eliminated as part of an economically-driven RIF,\r\nplaintiffs were required to establish a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to whether Schering failed treat age neutrally in\r\nimplementing the RIF.  See Pages-Cahue v. Iberia Lineas Aereas\r\nEspana, 82 F.3d 533,  536 (1st Cir. 1996) (describing the prima\r\nfacie burden facing age discrimination plaintiffs who challenge\r\nemployment actions taken pursuant to a true RIF).  Plaintiffs did\r\nadduce evidence that awareness of the possibility of a lawsuit\r\nmight have prompted Schering not to change Ms. Caballero's title\r\nwhen she assumed duties and responsibilities that had been Alegre's\r\nprior to the RIF; that the decisionmaker, Roberto Mercade, had made\r\ncomments strongly suggestive of an interest in purging Schering of\r\nolder employees; that the decision to terminate Alegre was\r\nMercade's and Mercade's alone; and that Schering refused Alegre's\r\npost-termination request that he be retained in a lesser position\r\nat reduced compensation.  Nonetheless, plaintiffs adduced no\r\nevidence to counter Schering's proffer that, because of the\r\neconomics of the situation, either Alegre or Rivera (who is the\r\nsame age as Alegre) had to go, and that Rivera was retained because\r\nhe had more expansive duties and responsibilities, as well as\r\ngreater seniority, than did Alegre.  Absent such evidence, no\r\nrational factfinder could conclude that Alegre's age prompted the\r\ndecision that is the subject of this lawsuit   the elimination of\r\nAlegre's position pursuant to the RIF.\r\n3.  As we stated at the outset, in addition to their\r\nfederal claim, plaintiffs brought supplemental (yet not legally\r\nparallel) Commonwealth law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1367(a). \r\nSchering's motion for summary judgment did not seek a judgment on\r\nthe merits of these claims; nor did the district court make\r\nreference to them in its opinion.  Nonetheless, the judgment in\r\nthis case states that plaintiffs' complaint is dismissed \"with\r\nprejudice.\"  As Schering effectively concedes in its appellate\r\nbrief, no intention to dismiss the Commonwealth law claims with\r\nprejudice can be inferred from this record.  Rather, it is clear\r\nthat, having dismissed the federal claim relatively early in the\r\nproceedings, the district court intended simply to decline to\r\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.  See28 U.S.C.  1367(c)(3); see also Flynn v. City of Boston, No. 97-\r\n1076, slip op. at 14 (1st Cir. May 12, 1998) (advising dismissal\r\nwithout prejudice of the state claims in circumstances such as\r\nthese).  We therefore modify the judgment to reflect that\r\nplaintiffs' Commonwealth law claims have been dismissed without\r\nprejudice.  See 28 U.S.C.  2106.\r\nAffirmed as modified.
