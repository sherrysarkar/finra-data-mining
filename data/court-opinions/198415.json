COWHIG,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n            TOGO WEST, SECRETARY OF THE ARMY,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n         [Hon. Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Edward D. Cowhig on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Michael J.\r\nPineault, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nApril 2, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Having scrutinized the record and the\r\nparties' submissions, we affirm the order of dismissal and the\r\ninjunction against further filings essentially for the reasons\r\nrecited by the district court.  We add only the following\r\ncomments.  \r\n    It is well established that courts have the power to issue\r\ninjunctions \"barring a party ... from filing and processing\r\nfrivolous and vexatious lawsuits.\"  Gordon v. United States\r\nDep't of Justice, 558 F.2d 618, 618 (1st Cir. 1977) (per\r\ncuriam).  While such measures are \"the exception to the general\r\nrule of free access to the courts,\" Pavilonis v. King, 626 F.2d\r\n1075, 1079 (1st Cir. 1980), the district court was justified\r\nhere in concluding that injunctive relief was warranted. \r\nPlaintiff has now filed five meritless actions in the District\r\nof Massachusetts, and at least two others elsewhere, pertaining\r\nto the same incident--his 1962 discharge from the Army.  Where\r\na litigant has demonstrated a \"propensity to file repeated\r\nsuits ... involving the same or similar claims\" of a \"frivolous\r\nor vexatious nature,\" a bar on further filings is appropriate. \r\nCastro v. United States, 775 F.2d 399, 409 (1st Cir. 1985) (per\r\ncuriam); accord, e.g., Pavilonis, 626 F.2d at 1078 (noting that\r\n\"plaintiffs bent on reopening closed cases\" fit into \"classic\r\nmold\" for injunctive relief). \r\n    Nor does the injunction here suffer from any of the\r\ndeficiencies that have been cited in other cases.  Plaintiff\r\nwas given ample \"notice that filing restrictions were\r\ncontemplated.\"  Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island, 985 F.2d\r\n32, 35 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam).  The court made adequate\r\nfindings demonstrating the need for an injunction, and the\r\nrecord was \"sufficiently developed\" to support those findings. \r\nId.  And the injunction was \"narrowly drawn to fit the specific\r\nvice encountered.\"  Castro, 775 F.2d at 410.  For example, it\r\npertains only to filings in the local district court, brought\r\nagainst the United States or an agency or employee thereof,\r\ninvolving the 1962 discharge.  And it allows plaintiff, with\r\nleave of court, to make new filings upon a showing that they\r\nare not barred by res judicata.\r\n    Filing restrictions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. \r\nSee, e.g., id. at 408.  No abuse of discretion being apparent,\r\nthe judgment is summarily affirmed.\r\n    Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
