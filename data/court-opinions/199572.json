FITZGERALD,\n\n                           Trustee.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL\n\n                     OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n        [Hon. James A. Goodman, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\n      [Hon. James B. Haines, Jr., U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\n    [Hon. Gerardo A. Carlo-Altieri, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\n\f                            Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     James Long, Jr. on brief pro se.\n     Jonathan D. White and White and White on brief for appellee\nMatrix Capital Bank.\n\n\n\n\n                        August 20, 2001\n\f             Per Curiam.    After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm, essentially for\n\nthe reasons set out in the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel’s\n\ndecision dated March 31, 2000.        We add only that with regard\n\nto the property tax portion of the claim, the mortgage\n\nclearly allows the mortgagee to pay taxes “[i]f . . . there\n\nis a legal proceeding that may significantly affect Lender’s\n\nrights in the Property.”       Bankruptcy Appellate Panel Record\n\nAppendix, p. 154.     This provision is in accord with that set\n\nout in the Restatement (Third) of Property § 2.2 (1997)\n\n(“[A] mortgagee may expend funds reasonably necessary for\n\nthe protection of the security, and may add the sums so\n\nexpended to the principal amount secured by the mortgage.\n\nSuch expenditures may be made . . . (2) to protect against\n\nthe assertion of liens having priority over the mortgage.”).\n\n\n\n             So far as we can determine from the record, at the\n\ntime   the   mortgagee     began   paying   property   taxes   on   the\n\nmortgagor’s behalf, the Town of Lexington had notified the\n\nmortgagee that taxes were overdue and that a tax sale of the\n\nproperty was scheduled.       The contract allowed the mortgagee\n\nto pay all taxes due and to add that amount to the loan\n\nbalance where “a legal proceeding that may significantly\n\faffect Lender’s rights in the Property” is instigated.   The\n\nTown may have been wrong, or the information may have been\n\nout-of-date at the time the mortgagee received it, but\n\nclearly the mortgagee was entitled under the contract to pay\n\nthe disputed taxes.    Long makes no claim that the Town’s\n\nactions did not constitute a “legal proceeding.”\n\n         Affirmed.    1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                             -4-\n\f",
