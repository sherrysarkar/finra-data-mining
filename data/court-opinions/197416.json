Kelly  was  on brief  for\r\nappellant.\r\nGeorge  W.  Vien, Assistant  United  States  Attorney, with  whom\r\nDonald K.  Stern, United States Attorney, was on  brief for the United\r\nStates.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n                        June 11, 1997\r\n                                        \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.   Richard Moretto was  convicted in 1991  of\r\n\nconspiracy to  distribute cocaine, 21  U.S.C. S  846, and  of\r\n\nwitness intimidation, 18 U.S.C. S 1512.  At sentencing he was\r\n\nfound to  be a career  offender based  on prior  convictions,\r\n\nU.S.S.G. \r                    S \r                      4B1.1, \r                            and \r                                sentenced to 210 months' imprisonment and\r\n\na term of supervised  release.  This court affirmed both  the\r\n\nconviction and sentence  on direct appeal.  United States  v.\r\n\nElwell, 984 F.2d 1289 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S.  945\r\n\n(1993).\r\n\n     Thereafter, \r                            Moretto succeeded in having a state court set\r\n\naside  two prior  state convictions,  undermining his  career\r\n\noffender status.  He petitioned under 28 U.S.C. S 2255 to set\r\n\naside his original sentence.  The district court agreed  and,\r\n\nafter \r                 further proceedings in June 1996, resentenced Moretto to\r\n\n108 months' imprisonment, a term of supervised release, and a\r\n\nfine of $12,500.  Moretto now appeals from this new sentence,\r\n\narguing \r                   that \r                        the district court miscalculated the sentence and\r\n\nimproperly imposed a fine.\r\n\n     Although \r                         Moretto's \r                                  appeal has been well briefed, we do not\r\n\nthink that  the district  court erred  on any  of the  issues\r\n\npresented in this court.  The only difficult question is  the\r\n\ncalculation  of drugs  attributed  to Moretto,  which  became\r\n\ndecisive after the career offender label was lifted.  The key\r\n\nevidence was the testimony of Moretto's customer that over  a\r\n\nfour \r                to \r                   five \r                       month \r                             period, he had purchased between one and two\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nounces of cocaine from  Moretto every week or other week  \"or\r\n\nso.\"\r\n\n     Averaging, the district court found that it was fair  to\r\n\nattribute to  Moretto  14 deliveries  of 1.5  ounces  apiece.\r\n\nTwenty ounces (rounded down from 21) equates to 567 grams  of\r\n\ncocaine, which  is well  over the  500 gram  minimum used  to\r\n\ndetermine Moretto's base offense level of 26.  U.S.S.G.      \r\n\nS 2D1.1(c)(7).  Moretto argues now, as he did in the district\r\n\ncourt, that such  averaging is forbidden by United States  v.\r\n\nSepulveda\r                    , \r                      15 \r                        F.3d \r                             1161, \r                                   1197-98 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied,\r\n\n512 U.S. 1223 (1994).\r\n\n     In \r                   United \r                         States\r                                \r                                v. \r                                   Webst\r                                        er, 54 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995),\r\n\nthis \r                court \r                      upheld estimates \"drawn from ranges with relatively\r\n\ntight margins,\"  distinguishing Sepulveda  as involving  much\r\n\nwider ranges.  Sepulveda itself made clear that the court was\r\n\nnot adopting a  \"per se rule\" in  favor of selecting the  low\r\n\npoint \r                 in \r                    an \r                       estimated range.  15 F.3d at 1199.  We think there\r\n\nis no magic rule to determine when a mid-range estimate seems\r\n\nto make sense but the use  of such an estimate here does  not\r\n\nappear to us to be clear error.\r\n\n     Further, \r                         the \r                            district \r                                     court attributed to Moretto, but did\r\n\nnot  include in  its calculus,  an additional  ten ounces  of\r\n\ncocaine  provided to  the witness  by another  member of  the\r\n\nconspiracy after  Moretto  had departed  for prison.    Since\r\n\nMoretto had introduced the new seller to the witness for  the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nspecific  purpose  of   continuing  the  sales,  Moretto   is\r\n\npresumptively liable under the relevant conduct guideline for\r\n\nforeseeable \r                       transactions effectively arranged by Moretto while\r\n\nstill a working member of the conspiracy.  U.S.S.G. S 1B1.3 &amp;\r\n\ncomment. \r                    n.2(c)(6).  Even if the district court had arrived at\r\n\na  low-end estimate  of Moretto's  own cocaine  sales to  the\r\n\nwitness, the  inclusion of  this additional  ten ounces  (283\r\n\ngrams) in the  drug quantity calculus would have resulted  in\r\n\nsentencing \r                      at the same base offense level as the court applied\r\n\nbelow.  Id. S 2D1.1(c)(7).\r\n\n     Moretto also objects to the district court's refusal  to\r\n\ntreat him as a minimal or minor participant deserving a four-\r\n\nor two-level downward  adjustment in his  favor on either  of\r\n\nthese grounds.  U.S.S.G. S 3B1.2.  If a lesser member of  the\r\n\nconspiracy were automatically a minimal or minor participant,\r\n\nMoretto \r                   might \r                         have \r                             a \r                               point; but we do not read the guideline in\r\n\nthat  fashion.    Here,  Moretto  played  a  substantial  and\r\n\ncontinuing role in the  conspiracy, and the district  court's\r\n\nrefusal \r                   to \r                      award him \"minimal\" or \"minor\" status was not clear\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court's refusal to depart downward, based on\r\n\ndiminished \r                      capacity, U.S.S.G. S 5K2.13, was a factual judgment\r\n\nnot  infected by  legal error  and therefore  not subject  to\r\n\nreview.  United States v. Robles-Torres, 109 F.3d 83, 87 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1997).  The two-level obstruction of justice  adjustment\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nwas amply  justified on  the facts  and provided  for by  the\r\n\nguidelines.  U.S.S.G. S 3C1.1.  And, there being no  evidence\r\n\nwhatever of vindictiveness, the court had authority to impose\r\n\na fine  on resentencing even though  none was imposed in  the\r\n\ninitial sentence.   North Carolina  v. Pearce,  395 U.S.  711\r\n\n(1969); see also Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794 (1989).\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\n",

Even if the district court had arrived at\r\n\na  low-end estimate  of Moretto's  own cocaine  sales to  the\r\n\nwitness, the  inclusion of  this additional  ten ounces  (283\r\n\ngrams) in the  drug quantity calculus would have resulted  in\r\n\nsentencing \r                      at the same base offense level as the court applied\r\n\nbelow.  Id. S 2D1.1(c)(7).\r\n\n     Moretto also objects to the district court's refusal  to\r\n\ntreat him as a minimal or minor participant deserving a four-\r\n\nor two-level downward  adjustment in his  favor on either  of\r\n\nthese grounds.  U.S.S.G. S 3B1.2.  If a lesser member of  the\r\n\nconspiracy were automatically a minimal or minor participant,\r\n\nMoretto \r                   might \r                         have \r                             a \r                               point; but we do not read the guideline in\r\n\nthat  fashion.    Here,  Moretto  played  a  substantial  and\r\n\ncontinuing role in the  conspiracy, and the district  court's\r\n\nrefusal \r                   to \r                      award him \"minimal\" or \"minor\" status was not clear\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court's refusal to depart downward, based on\r\n\ndiminished \r                      capacity, U.S.S.G. S 5K2.13, was a factual judgment\r\n\nnot  infected by  legal error  and therefore  not subject  to\r\n\nreview.  United States v. Robles-Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197266\"><a href=\"/opinion/197266/united-states-v-robles-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1997).  The two-level obstruction of justice  adjustment\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nwas amply  justified on  the facts  and provided  for by  the\r\n\nguidelines.  U.S.S.G. S 3C1.1.  And, there being no  evidence\r\n\nwhatever of vindictiveness, the court had authority to impose\r\n\na fine  on resentencing even though  none was imposed in  the\r\n\ninitial sentence.
