After   disallowing\n\nappellants’ motion to release the sealed transcript of a hearing\n\nduring which references were made to a confidential settlement\n\nagreement,     the    bankruptcy      court        denied     their   motion      for\n\nreconsideration      as    well.      The      district       court   affirmed     on\n\nintermediate review.          See In re Salem Suede, Inc. (Foreign Car\n\nCtr., Inc. v. The Travelers Indem. Co.), 241 B.R. 780 (D. Mass.\n\n1999).\n\n           Prior to oral argument, we were informed by counsel to\n\nThe Travelers Indemnity Company (“Travelers” or “appellee”) that\n\nthe   sealed    transcript      recently       had     been    released     by    the\n\nbankruptcy court, notwithstanding the sealing order, in response\n\nto a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request by appellants’\n\ncounsel.   Accordingly, we directed that counsel address at oral\n\nargument     whether      the   intervening          release     of   the   sealed\n\ntranscript     effectively      mooted       the   instant     appeal,    see    U.S.\n\nBancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall P’ship, 513 U.S. 18, 21-22\n\n(1994), and, if so, whether the judgments entered below should\n\nbe set aside.     We now remand to the bankruptcy court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                         I\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n           These     chapter     11   reorganization           proceedings       were\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcommenced by Salem Suede on April 30, 1996, in the aftermath of\n\nthe    regulatory       and    financial      difficulties        brought   about   by\n\nenvironmental contamination at its leather processing plant and\n\ntannery       in    Peabody,    Massachusetts.            After    the   chapter    11\n\nproceedings, Travelers commenced an action for interpleader in\n\nMassachusetts           Superior      Court     to   determine       the    rightful\n\nrecipients         of   the   Travelers       insurance    proceeds      payable    in\n\nconnection with the aforementioned environmental contamination.\n\nIts complaint joined not only the judgment creditors (viz.,\n\nappellants), but their respective counsel who had filed attorney\n\nliens against the Travelers insurance proceeds.                     These attorney-\n\nlien       claims    thus     posed   a   barrier    to    disbursement      of     the\n\nTravelers insurance proceeds.\n\n              At oral argument, counsel expressed agreement that the\n\npresent appeal has not been rendered moot by the release of the\n\nsealed transcript in response to the FOIA request. 1                         For its\n\npart, Travelers urged that we affirm the denial of the motion to\n\n\n       1\n     Prior to oral argument in this court, appellants\ncircuitously obtained the sealed transcript through their FOIA\nrequest to the bankruptcy court clerk's office, see 5 U.S.C. §\n552, where an administrative employee apparently released the\ntranscript   without  realizing   that   it   was  under   seal.\nConsequently, even though appellants now possess the transcript,\ntheir appeal is not moot, in that their subsequent use (as well\nas any future use) of the transcript in the state-court\ninterpleader action arguably violated the extant sealing order\nand contravened the judgments presently on appeal. See Cruz v.\nFarquharson, 252 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                          -4-\n\frelease the transcript, particularly since appellants' counsel\n\nhad already submitted the sealed transcript in the related\n\nstate-court interpleader action in apparent disregard of the\n\nsealing order.     For their part, appellants correctly contended,\n\nas they had below, that the subject transcript was excluded from\n\nthe scope of their motion to seal by the following language in\n\nthe Confidentiality Agreement:\n\n            10.   Confidentiality. Except as required by\n                  law or to effectuate the necessary\n                  judicial approvals, to gain releases of\n                  attorneys’ liens, for submission by\n                  Travelers to its insurers, reinsurers\n                  or auditors, or to enforce the terms of\n                  this Agreement, the Parties will use\n                  best    efforts    to    maintain    the\n                  confidentiality    of   the   settlement\n                  amount, the settlement agreement, this\n                  term sheet and the settlement amount,\n                  including but not limited to, jointly\n                  seeking approval of [sic] Bankruptcy\n                  Court   to   place    under   seal   all\n                  settlement agreements and materials\n                  involving    the    parties    who   are\n                  signatories below.\n\n(Emphasis added.)       Thus, the consistent thrust of appellants’\n\nposition from the outset has been that the Confidentiality\n\nAgreement expressly provides that the sealed transcript was to\n\nremain   available     for   their   use   in   securing   “the   necessary\n\njudicial approvals[] [and] to gain releases of attorneys’ liens,\n\nfor submission by Travelers to its insurers, reinsurers or\n\nauditors,    or   to   enforce   the   terms     of   the[ir]     [Security]\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fAgreement.”\n\n                                            II\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n             Notwithstanding the intermediate appeal to the district\n\ncourt, we directly review the bankruptcy court rulings which\n\ndisallowed        appellants’    motions         to    define   the     scope   of   the\n\nsealing order as it pertains to the subject transcript.                              See\n\nStoehr v. Mohamed, 244 F.3d 206, 208 (1st Cir. 2001).                           Absent\n\neither   a    mistake     of    law    or     an      abuse   of   discretion,       the\n\nbankruptcy court ruling must stand.                   See Siedle v. Putnam Invs.,\n\nInc., 147 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1998).                    A bankruptcy court “may\n\nabuse its discretion by ignoring a material factor that deserves\n\nsignificant weight, relying on an improper factor, or, even if\n\nit [considered] only the proper mix of factors, by making a\n\nserious mistake in judgment.”               Id.\n\n             As    the   sealing      order      was    granted    by    endorsement,\n\nwithout elaboration, its intent and scope must be gleaned from\n\nthe motion to seal, in which appellants requested that the\n\nbankruptcy court seal —\n\n             [a]ll documents referring either directly or\n             indirectly    to   any   of  the   terms  and\n             conditions of the settlement agreement\n             entered into by the parties on January 6,\n             1999    (the     “Settlement   Agreement”)[,]\n             including but not limited to the settlement\n             amount,     in     accordance     with    the\n             Confidentiality Provision . . . of the\n\n                                         -6-\n\f            Settlement Agreement.\n\n(Emphasis    added).2    The   Confidentiality   Provision   in    the\n\nSettlement Agreement stated:\n\n            Except as required by law or to effectuate\n            the necessary judicial approvals, to gain\n            releases of attorneys’ liens, for submission\n            by Travelers to its insurers, reinsurers or\n            auditors, or to enforce the terms of this\n            Agreement, the Parties will use best efforts\n            to maintain the confidentiality of the\n            settlement amount, the settlement agreement,\n            . . . the settlement terms, including but\n            not limited to, jointly seeking approval of\n            [the] Bankruptcy Court to place under seal\n            all settlement agreements and materials\n            involving the parties who are signatories\n            below.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n            Appellants accordingly contend, as they did below, that\n\nall “documents” needed “to gain releases of attorneys’ liens,\n\nfor submission by Travelers to its insurers, reinsurers or\n\nauditors,” were outside the scope of the sealing order.           Thus,\n\nappellants correctly insist that the bankruptcy court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying them permission to use the transcript in\n\n\n    2Since the motion to seal plainly reflects that the subject\ntranscript was to have been excepted from the scope of the\nsealing order, as agreed by the parties, see supra, we simply\nassume arguendo, without deciding, that the hearing transcript\nis a “document.”   See, e.g., United States v. Antar, 38 F.3d\n1348, 1360 (3d Cir. 1994) (“Furthermore, at the most basic\nlevel, the transcript at issue is a public judicial document,\ncovered by a presumptive right of access.”) (emphasis added);\nsee generally Random House Dictionary of English Language, at\n578 (2d ed. unabridged) (“a legal or official paper”).\n\n                                 -7-\n\ftheir efforts to secure releases of the various attorneys’\n\nliens, absent which compliance with an essential term of the\n\nSettlement Agreement was impracticable.\n\n             We shall assume arguendo that the courts below were\n\nentitled to make their own assessments as to whether appellants\n\nneeded the transcript in the state-court proceeding.                    Even so,\n\nat the hearing before the bankruptcy judge the appellants did\n\nprovide a fairly straightforward (if summary) statement of their\n\nneed; namely, to counter allegedly mistaken representations\n\nbeing made in the state court about what had occurred in the\n\nbankruptcy proceedings.            Not only was there no direct counter to\n\nappellants' explanation at the hearing, but in denying their\n\nrequest for the transcript the bankruptcy judge simply stated\n\nthat appellants had joined in the original agreement to seal.\n\n             Although the bankruptcy court thereafter entered its\n\nmargin order on the motion for reconsideration, stating that the\n\nneed   had    not     been    adequately      explained,      it    provided    no\n\nexplanation     for    its    determination.          Given   the   appellants'\n\nrepresentation of need, their explanation, and the lack of a\n\ndirect counter, it was an abuse of discretion not to permit\n\nappellants     to     use    the    transcript   as    contemplated      by    the\n\nconfidentiality agreement.\n\n             Moreover, there is a strong common law presumption\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ffavoring public access to judicial proceedings and records.             FTC\n\nv. Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 410 (1st Cir. 1987);\n\nSiedle, 147 F.3d at 9-10.        Accordingly, there may also be some\n\nquestion as to whether the blanket sealing order was granted\n\nwithout adequate consideration of the public interest in such\n\naccess,      regardless    whether   the   parties   to   the   settlement\n\nagreement mutually supported the sealing order.            However, given\n\nthe     confidentiality     provision      already   discussed,    it    is\n\nunnecessary to pursue the public interest issue further in this\n\ncase.     Rather, we mention it in order to flag the matter for\n\nconsideration in future cases.\n\n                                     III\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n             The case is remanded to the bankruptcy court with\n\ndirections to release the subject transcript to appellants for\n\nuse     in    the   state-court      proceedings     pursuant     to    the\n\nconfidentiality agreement.\n\n             SO ORDERED.

After the chapter 11 proceedings, Travelers commenced an action for interpleader in Massachusetts Superior Court to determine the rightful recipients of the Travelers insurance proceeds payable in connection with the aforementioned environmental contamination. Its complaint joined not only the judgment creditors (viz., appellants), but their respective counsel who had filed attorney liens against the Travelers insurance proceeds.

The district court affirmed on intermediate review. See In re Salem Suede, Inc. (Foreign Car Ctr., Inc. v. The Travelers Indem.

Accordingly, we directed that counsel address at oral argument whether the intervening release of the sealed transcript effectively mooted the instant appeal, see U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall P'ship, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21-22 (1994), and, if so, whether the judgments entered below should be set aside. We now remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These chapter 11 reorganization proceedings were commenced by Salem Suede on April 30, 1996, in the aftermath of the regulatory and financial difficulties brought about by environmental contamination at its leather processing plant and tannery in Peabody, Massachusetts. After the chapter 11 proceedings, Travelers commenced an action for interpleader in Massachusetts Superior Court to determine the rightful recipients of the Travelers insurance proceeds payable in connection with the aforementioned environmental contamination. Its complaint joined not only the judgment creditors (viz., appellants), but their respective counsel who had filed attorney liens against the Travelers insurance proceeds. These attorney-lien claims thus posed a barrier to disbursement of the Travelers insurance proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel expressed agreement that the present appeal has not been rendered moot by the release of the sealed transcript in response to the FOIA request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For its part, Travelers urged that we affirm the denial of the motion to release the transcript, particularly since appellants' counsel had already submitted the sealed transcript in the related state-court interpleader action in apparent disregard of the sealing order. For their part, appellants correctly contended, as they had below, that the subject transcript was excluded from the scope of their motion to seal by the following language in the Confidentiality Agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10.  Confidentiality. Except as required by law or to effectuate the necessary judicial approvals, to gain releases of attorneys' liens, for submission by Travelers to its insurers, reinsurers or auditors, or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties will use best efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the settlement amount, the settlement agreement, this term sheet and the settlement amount, including but not limited to, jointly seeking approval of [sic] Bankruptcy Court to place under seal all settlement agreements and materials involving the parties who are signatories below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the consistent thrust of appellants' position from the outset has been that the Confidentiality Agreement expressly provides that the sealed transcript was to remain available for their use in securing \"the necessary judicial approvals[] [and] to gain releases of attorneys' liens, for submission by Travelers to its insurers, reinsurers or auditors, or to enforce the terms of the[ir] [Security] Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the intermediate appeal to the district court, we directly review the bankruptcy court rulings which disallowed appellants' motions to define the scope of the sealing order as it pertains to the subject transcript. See Stoehr v. Mohamed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199350\"><a href=\"/opinion/199350/stoehr-v-prince-mohamed-bin/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 208 (1st Cir. 2001). Absent either a mistake of law or an abuse of discretion, the bankruptcy court ruling must stand. See Siedle v. Putnam Invs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198016\"><a href=\"/opinion/198016/putnam-investments-v-siedle/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 1998).
