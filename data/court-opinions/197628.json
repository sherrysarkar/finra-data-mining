This case comes before us on\r                                           \r\n\na  petition for  review of a  provision of  a final order  of the\r\n\nBenefits  Review Board  (\"Board\") that  awarded  Bath Iron  Works\r\n\n(\"BIW\")  Section 8(f)  relief  under  the  Longshore  and  Harbor\r\n\nWorkers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.    901-950 (1988) (\"LHWCA\").\r\n\nSection 8(f)  of the LHWCA  provides that an employer  obliged to\r\n\npay disability benefits to an  employee may be relieved from full\r\n\nliability  if   the   employee's   compensable   disability   was\r\n\n\"materially and substantially  greater\" as a  result of a  prior,\r\n\nnon-work-related disability.1   The Director, Office  of Workers'\r\n\nCompensation Programs (\"OWCP\"), appeals the Section 8(f) award to\r\n\nBIW on a number of grounds, most  of which are unnecessary for us\r\n\nto reach,  because  we find  that  the Administrative  Law  Judge\r\n\n(\"ALJ\") failed to determine, and the record contains insufficient\r\n\nevidence to show, that  the required standard of  \"materially and\r\n\nsubstantially  greater\" was met.  We therefore grant the petition\r\n\nfor review and reverse the Section 8(f) award.\r\n\n     Claimant Frank H. Johnson worked as a pipe-fitter at the BIW\r\n\nshipyard for  various periods from  1951 until his  retirement in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    The issue  in this  case concerns who  should bear  the\r\nprimary responsibility for  paying compensation to  the claimant.\r\nUnder  the LHWCA,  the employer  pays the  full amount  unless it\r\nmeets the requirements  set forth in Section 8(f),  in which case\r\nits liability for payment to disabled employees is limited to 104\r\nweeks and  any remaining compensation  owed is paid by  a special\r\nsecond injury  fund.  33 U.S.C.    908(f)(1)  &amp; (2)(A).  The fund\r\nconsists  of   contributions  from   carriers  and   self-insured\r\nemployers, and is intended to distribute among all  employers the\r\ncost  of  compensating employees,  while ensuring  that employees\r\nwith disabilities  receive full  benefits for their  work-related\r\ninjuries.  Bath Iron Works Co. v. Director, OWCP, 950 F.2d 56, 58\r                                                          \r\nn.4 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nJanuary 1984.   During his employment  at BIW, he  was exposed to\r\n\nand inhaled asbestos dust and fibers at the shipyard.  Claimant's\r\n\nexposure ended  in 1978 or  1979, when the crumbling  asbestos in\r\n\nhis work area was sealed.  \r\n\n     In 1986 claimant was  diagnosed as suffering from a  twenty-\r\n\nfive  percent impairment due  to asbestosis, and  he successfully\r\n\nfiled  a claim for workers' compensation benefits under the LHWCA\r\n\nbased on that impairment.  The ALJ's award of Section 8(f) relief\r\n\nto  BIW  became a  final  order  for  the purposes  of  obtaining\r\n\njudicial review before  us after the Board failed  to take action\r\n\non the Director's appeal within a year.2\r\n\n     Because  the appropriateness of Section 8(f) relief turns on\r\n\nthe source and nature of claimant's pulmonary impairment, we must\r\n\nexamine closely the medical evidence in the record.  \r\n\n                       THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE\r\n\n     The  earliest  evidence  that   claimant  suffered  from  an\r\n\nasbestos-related lung condition appears to have come in 1982 from\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    Another ALJ initially  awarded BIW Section  8(f) relief\r\nfrom full liability based on evidence that claimant suffered from\r\na  pre-existing   knee  injury,   as  well   as  \"other   medical\r\nconditions,\" all  of which  were  manifest during  the period  of\r\nclaimant's  employment  at  BIW and  contributed  to  his overall\r\ndisability.    The  Director,  OWCP,  successfully  appealed  the\r\nSection 8(f) award, and  the Board remanded the  case, concluding\r\nthat claimant's knee condition could  not be used as a basis  for\r\nrelief because it was unrelated to his pulmonary impairment.  The\r\nBoard directed the  ALJ on remand to consider  whether the \"other\r\nmedical conditions\" by themselves formed a basis for Section 8(f)\r\nrelief.  We review the remand decision here.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\na  routine chest  x-ray  performed prior  to  a knee  operation.3\r\n\nAccording to Dr. Schall, claimant's treating physician, the x-ray\r\n\nrevealed \"interstitial  fibrosis and  pleural plaques  consistent\r\n\nwith asbestosis.\"6   Multiple pulmonary function tests  conducted\r\n\nfrom that  time through 1986 revealed that claimant suffered from\r\n\ndiminished lung function.\r\n\n     Dr.  Schall, in  a letter  dated  December 1983,  summarized\r\n\nclaimant's condition at that time, \r\n\n     His most  recent chest x-ray taken May  19, 1983 showed\r\n     pulmonary  findings of  a  thickened pleura  with  some\r\n     calcific pleuritides  over the diaphragm  and increased\r\n     pulmonary   markings  inferiorly.    He  still  has  no\r\n     significant  complaints  of shortness  of breath.   His\r\n     pulmonary  functions and chest x-rays show a mixture of\r\n     chronic  obstructive pulmonary  disease and  asbestosis\r\n     with   some  restrictive   component.[7]     Certainly,\r\n     asbestosis can be considered a contribution .  . . [to]\r\n     his pulmonary status.  He is currently not disabled  on\r\n     a pulmonary  basis and  would be  capable of  full-time\r\n     regular  employment.     At  the   present  time   it's\r\n     impossible to predict what his prognosis is.  Certainly\r\n     his  chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease is far more\r\n     risky to him and is in a further advanced state than is\r\n     his asbestosis.   He  has the  concomitant problems  of\r\n     obesity, chronic  alcoholism and  severe osteoarthritis\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    Dr. Schall stated that claimant showed some evidence of\r\nasbestos exposure as early as 1978.   As there is no evidence  in\r\nthe  medical record  indicating  physical  damage resulting  from\r\nasbestos   exposure  before  1982,   we  agree  with   the  ALJ's\r\ndetermination that claimant's asbestos-related lung condition  is\r\nproperly dated back to 1982.\r\n\n     6    After  this  diagnosis,  claimant  filed  a  protective\r\nclaim, thereby satisfying the LHWCA's notice requirements.\r\n\n     7    In reporting on claimant's condition, Dr. Schall refers\r\nto   claimant's   \"obstructive\"   pulmonary  function   and   his\r\n\"restrictive\"  pulmonary function.    The  former  is  claimant's\r\ncondition  independent of  asbestosis, while  the  latter is  his\r\nasbestos-related condition.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     of his  knees.   His primary  disabling feature  is his\r\n     knees.8  \r\n\nIn  deposition  testimony  in  1988,  Dr.  Schall  described  the\r\n\nclaimant's condition as \"severe obstructive with mild to moderate\r\n\nrestrictive disease.\"  \r\n\n     Dr.  Killian,  a   physician  specializing  in   respiratory\r\n\nmedicine,  in  a March  1986  letter  reporting  upon his  recent\r\n\nexamination of  claimant, concluded  that claimant suffered  from\r\n\nfive conditions:   asbestosis  of  the left  lower lobe,  pleural\r\n\nplaques,  obesity, hypertension,  and  chest  pain suggestive  of\r\n\nischemic heart disease.  He added that claimant \"does indeed have\r\n\nboth pleural plaques and asbestosis  which is due to his asbestos\r\n\nexposure  occurring at work.   The  degree of  disability present\r\n\nfrom a pulmonary  perspective can be  classified as mild.  . .  .\r\n\n[H]is present  impairment has caused noticeable disability within\r\n\nthe  last  year or  so.\"   In deposition  testimony in  1988, Dr.\r\n\nKillian concluded that claimant's cigarette smoking, his obesity,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8    In  this letter,  Dr. Schall  also  gave the  following\r\nreview of claimant's medical history:\r\n\n     The  man  was   first  seen  in  1978  for   a  routine\r\n     examination prior  to arthroscopic  examination of  his\r\n     knees.   He  had at  that time  a smoking  history that\r\n     included in excess  of 100 pack years but  had been off\r\n     cigarettes  for eight months.   He denied  shortness of\r\n     breath  stating that  his  knees  limited his  physical\r\n     activities.   He had a  history of hypertension.   He's\r\n     worked  as  a  pipe-fitter  and  has  been  exposed  to\r\n     asbestos  through his  work environment.   His physical\r\n     findings at that time showed his chest to be clear with\r\n     a fair  respiratory expansion.   Chest  x-rays at  that\r\n     time  showed some  pulmonary  scarring consistent  with\r\n     asbestosis.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nhis arthritic knees  and lung damage caused  by asbestos exposure\r\n\ncontributed to claimant's overall disability. \r\n\n     In  1987  a  pulmonary   specialist,  Dr.  Corbin,  examined\r\n\nclaimant  and  reviewed   his  pulmonary  function  tests.     He\r\n\nconcluded, \r\n\n     I believe that Mr. Johnson has asbestos-related pleural\r\n     disease and pleural  fibrosis. . . . I  am certain that\r\n     this was related to his exposure to asbestos during the\r\n     time of his employment  at Bath Iron Works. . .  .  Mr.\r\n     Johnson also has restrictive lung disease which is mild\r\n     to moderate  in degree. . . .  I feel certain that this\r\n     is  related to  his pleural fibrosis.   The  patient is\r\n     obese,  but patients  with  obesity alone  rarely  have\r\n     restrictive  pulmonary  function.   As  I  have  stated\r\n     before, I think his pleural fibrosis  is related to his\r\n     employment at Bath Iron Works.  . . . [H]is symptoms of\r\n     shortness  of   breath  and  restricted   activity  are\r\n     significantly   contributed   to    by   his   physical\r\n     deconditioning and obesity.\r\n\n     Another physician, Dr. Schmidt, reviewed claimant's June 11,\r\n\n1982  pulmonary function studies  and concluded that  they showed\r\n\n\"restrictive  lung   disease  and   minimal  obstructive   airway\r\n\ndisease.\"   He  also reported  that claimant's  January  20, 1983\r\n\npulmonary  function  studies   showed  \"mild  obstructive  airway\r\n\ndisease,\" which \"appears to be new since June, 1982.\"\r\n\n     In  1986  claimant, for  the  first time,  was  diagnosed as\r\n\npermanently partially disabled as a  result of asbestosis.  It is\r\n\nundisputed  that  claimant  was  twenty-five  percent   partially\r\n\ndisabled at that time.  No finding was made as to  what amount of\r\n\nthis disability was specifically attributable to asbestosis or to\r\n\nany other kind of pulmonary impairment.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n              ENTITLEMENT TO SECTION 8(f) RELIEF -- \r\n  PERMANENT TOTAL AND PARTIAL DISABILITY CRITERIA DISTINGUISHED\r\n\n     We  review the  Board's  decision for  errors  of law,9  and\r\n\nexamine the record  to determine whether  the ALJ's findings  are\r\n\nsupported by  substantial evidence.   33 U.S.C.    921(b)(3); CNA\r                                                                           \r\n\nInsurance Co. v. Legrow, 935 F.2d 430, 434 (1st Cir. 1991).    \r                                 \r\n\n     This appeal raises  numerous complex  issues concerning  the\r\n\napplication  of  Section 8(f).    We  believe  this case  can  be\r\n\nresolved on  a fairly straightforward  basis not requiring  us to\r\n\nconsider many of  the issues  raised on  appeal.   As we  discuss\r\n\nbelow,  unless  the  employer  establishes  that  the  employee's\r\n\ncompensable permanent  partial  disability  was  \"materially  and\r\n\nsubstantially  greater\"  as a  result  of a  prior  disability, a\r\n\nSection 8(f) award is unavailable to the employer, and no further\r\n\nanalysis  is required.    Because existing  case law  has largely\r\n\nignored  the  clear  threshold  requirements  of  Section   8(f),\r\n\nhowever,  we  think  it helpful  to  clarify  certain preliminary\r\n\nissues in the  Section 8(f) framework.  We  choose, therefore, to\r\n\nreview in detail the initial steps that must be met to support an\r\n\naward of Section  8(f) relief, up to and  including consideration\r\n\nof the \"materially and substantially greater\" standard; we do not\r\n\nconsider issues  raised on appeal that go  beyond these threshold\r\n\nrequirements.  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9    In  this case,  because the  ALJ  order is  final as  a\r\nresult  of the Board's failure  to consider the Director's appeal\r\nwithin  one  year,  we  treat  the ALJ's  order  as  the  Board's\r\ndecision. \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n     The  LHWCA provides compensation for the death or disability\r\n\nof federal maritime employees if the disability or  death results\r\n\nfrom  a work-related  injury.   Under  what has  been termed  the\r\n\n\"aggravation rule,\"  the LHWCA  requires an  employer to  provide\r\n\nfull coverage for a worker's job-related disability even when the\r\n\ndisability resulted from some combination of a current employment\r\n\ninjury  and a pre-existing  condition.  Ceres  Marine Terminal v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDirector, OWCP, 118 F.3d 387,  389 (5th Cir. 1997).  In  response\r                        \r\n\nto concern  that this \"aggravation rule\" would  give the employer\r\n\nan incentive  to discriminate against partially  disabled workers\r\n\nbased on a fear of increased liability, Congress  enacted Section\r\n\n8(f).  Id.;  see also CNA, 935  F.2d at 435 (explaining  that the\r                                   \r\n\nstatute was aimed at encouraging employers to hire or continue to\r\n\nemploy  handicapped   workers  by   limiting   liability  for   a\r\n\nsubsequently incurred  permanent partial  disability attributable\r\n\nin part to a previously existing handicap).  \r\n\n     Section 8(f) provides in relevant part:\r\n\n     (f)  Injury increasing disability:\r\n     (1)  In . . . cases of total permanent disability . . .\r\n     found  not to  be  due  solely to  that  injury, of  an\r\n     employee   having   an   existing   permanent   partial\r\n     disability,   the  employer   shall   provide  .   .  .\r\n     compensation  payments . .  . for one  hundred and four\r\n     weeks only. . . . \r\n          In  .  . .  cases  in  which  the employee  has  a\r\n     permanent  partial disability,  found  not  to  be  due\r\n     solely   to  that  injury,   and  such   disability  is\r\n     materially and  substantially greater  than that  which\r\n     would have  resulted from the  subsequent injury alone,\r\n     the employer shall provide  . . . compensation  for one\r\n     hundred and four weeks only.\r\n\n33 U.S.C.   908(f)(1).\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n     The employer carries  the burden to prove  that the elements\r\n\nof Section 8(f) are met.

(2) that  [claimant]  has\r\n     experienced shortness of breath  and pulmonary problems\r\n     since  at least  May of 1978  as he was  required to be\r\n     examined  by  Dr.  Schall for  pre-operative  clearance\r\n     prior to knee  surgery, (3) that  he has suffered  from\r\n     obesity  and hypertension for  many years, (4)  that he\r\n     had a long history of cigarette smoking, i.e., at least\r\n     1  to 3  packs  per day  for  forty years,  a  habit he\r\n     stopped in  1978, (5) that  Claimant's asbestos-related\r\n     disease was first reported on his chest x-rays in April\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n     of  1982, .  .  . (7)  that  his subsequent  diagnostic\r\n     tests, including  pulmonary function  tests, showed  an\r\n     increase  of   his  asbestos-related   disease  and   a\r\n     worsening  of his  shortness of  breath,  (8) that  Dr.\r\n     Schall,  as of December 5, 1983, opined that Claimant's\r\n     pulmonary impairment was  due to \"a mixture  of chronic\r\n     obstructive pulmonary disease  and asbestosis with some\r\n     restrictive  component,\" (9)  that Claimant's  \"chronic\r\n     obstructive  pulmonary disease is far more risky to him\r\n     and  is  (in) a  further  advanced  state than  is  his\r\n     asbestosis,\" (10) that he \"has the concomitant problems\r\n     of    obesity,    chronic   alcoholism    and    severe\r\n     osteoarthritis of  his  knees,\" .  .  . (12)  that  the\r\n     doctors  are  in  agreement  that Claimant's  permanent\r\n     partial impairment  is due  to the  combination of  his\r\n     asbestos-related  disease,  i.e., his  asbestosis,  his\r\n     hypertension,   his  obesity,   his  cardiac   problems\r\n     diagnosed  as ischemic  heart  disease, (13)  that  the\r\n     doctors reiterated their opinions at their post-hearing\r\n     depositions   .  .  .  ,  [and]  (14)  that  Claimant's\r\n     permanent disability is  the result of the  combination\r\n     of his pre-existing  permanent partial disability (i.e.\r\n     his pulmonary problems since at least May 18, 1978, his\r\n     chronic obesity, his chronic hypertension, his  cardiac\r\n     problems  and his cigarette  smoking habit of  at least\r\n     100 pack years and as  high as 120 pack years) and  his\r\n     work-related asbestosis  . .  . [.   His]  pre-existing\r\n     disability,  in combination  with  the subsequent  work\r\n     injury,  has  contributed  to   a  greater  degree   of\r\n     permanent disability,  according  to  Dr.  Schall,  Dr.\r\n     Corbin and Dr. Killian.

In the\r\nsection  of Adams  quoted  by  the ALJ,  the  Board mentions  the\r                           \r\n\"materially  and substantially greater\"  requirement only as part\r\nof its  general  explanation that this standard  must be met by a\r\npre-existing  disability that impacts  the same type  of physical\r\nfunctioning as does the work-related injury.\r\n\n     12   In  long-latency  disease  cases,  such as  asbestosis,\r\nusing the date of last exposure as the relevant time of injury is\r\ninappropriate  because the  injury arises  years  later when  the\r\ndisease manifests  itself.  See Bath Iron  Works Co., 506 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n163.

The  evidence in  the medical  record supports  the ALJ's\r\n\nconclusion that  these problems, probably  resulting from obesity\r\n\nand  smoking, amounted to  \"the classic condition  of a high-risk\r\n\nemployee whom  a cautious employer  would neither have  hired nor\r\n\nretained in employment due to the increased likelihood that  such\r\n\nan employee would  sustain another occupational disease.\"   While\r\n\nwe need not  reach this issue to conclude this case, we note here\r\n\nthat  we agree  with  the  ALJ's finding  that  claimant met  the\r\n\nSection  8(f) criteria of suffering from a pre-existing permanent\r\n\ndisability prior to his work-related injury. \r\n\n     To  be  entitled to  Section 8(f)  relief, however,  BIW was\r\n\nrequired to  carry the  burden of  demonstrating that  claimant's\r\n\ntwenty-five percent  disability was materially  and substantially\r\n\ngreater  than that  which would have  resulted from  the asbestos\r\n\nexposure alone.  To do this, BIW was required to show  the degree\r\n\nof  disability attributable only  to claimant's asbestosis.

No  evidence of  the  degree  of disability\r\n\nattributable  only to  claimant's asbestosis was  ever presented.\r\n\nNor  can such  disability  be deduced  from  the medical  records\r\n\nrelating to  claimant's non-asbestos-related  injury.   While Dr.\r\n\nSchall did state  that the non-related asbestos  lung disease was\r\n\nin  a  further  advanced state  than  claimant's  asbestosis, Dr.\r\n\nSchall made this diagnosis in  1983.  At that time,  claimant was\r\n\nnot  disabled  as a  result  of  pulmonary  impairment.   A  1983\r\n\nassessment,  therefore, could not  establish the degree  to which\r\n\nclaimant's 1986  compensable injury  was impacted  by an  earlier\r\n\nexisting  non-asbestos-related  disability.     Dr.  Killian,  in\r\n\nreporting  on  claimant's  condition   in  1986,  concluded  that\r\n\nclaimant's prior  non-asbestos-related disability  contributed to\r\n\nclaimant's overall disability.  But  he gave no indication of how\r\n\nmuch  contribution existed,  and included  in  his assessment  of\r\n\nclaimant's \"overall disability\"  claimant's knee problems,  which\r\n\ncannot properly form  part of a Section 8(f)  determination.  Dr.\r\n\nCorbin provides the best evidence for BIW, stating, in 1987, that\r\n\nclaimant's  \"symptoms  of  shortness  of  breath  and  restricted\r\n\nactivity  are  significantly  contributed  to   by  his  physical\r\n\ndeconditioning and obesity.\"  However,  even this report fails to\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nmeet  the  required standard.    Dr.  Corbin provides  a  general\r\n\nstatement  that includes claimant's shortness of breath and spans\r\n\nhis  \"restricted activity.\"   The  report does  not  indicate the\r\n\nextent to which claimant's pre-existing  condition contributed to\r\n\nhis  permanent   partial  disability,  the   twenty-five  percent\r\n\npulmonary impairment for which condition alone claimant  received\r\n\ncompensation under the LHWCA. \r\n\n     Therefore, there being neither sufficient direct evidence of\r\n\nthe contribution  of asbestosis  to claimant's  overall permanent\r\n\npartial disability  nor a  basis for  deducing such  contribution\r\n\nfrom the contribution attributable to the pre-existing condition,\r\n\nBIW has failed to carry its considerable burden.\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r\n\n     Because we  determine that the  ALJ failed to find,  and the\r\n\nrecord contains  insufficient evidence  to show,  that claimant's\r\n\ncurrent   permanent   partial   disability  is   materially   and\r\n\nsubstantially  greater than that  which would have  resulted from\r\n\nasbestosis alone, we do  not address the remaining  issues raised\r\n\nby appellant.  For the  reasons discussed, we reverse the Section\r\n\n8(f) award to BIW. \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n",

He added that claimant \"does indeed have both pleural plaques and asbestosis which is due to his asbestos exposure occurring at work.  The degree of disability present from a pulmonary perspective can be classified as mild....  [H]is present impairment has caused noticeable disability within the last year or so.\"   In deposition testimony in 1988, Dr. Killian concluded that claimant's cigarette smoking, his obesity, his arthritic knees and lung damage caused by asbestos exposure contributed to claimant's overall disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987 a pulmonary specialist, Dr. Corbin, examined claimant and reviewed his pulmonary function tests.

We believe this case can be resolved on a fairly straightforward basis not requiring us to consider many of the issues raised on appeal.  As we discuss below, unless the employer establishes that the employee's compensable permanent partial disability was \"materially and substantially greater\" as a result of a prior disability, a Section 8(f) award is unavailable to the employer, and no further analysis is required.  Because existing case law has largely ignored the clear threshold requirements of Section 8(f), however, we think it helpful to clarify certain preliminary issues in the Section 8(f) framework.  We choose, therefore, to review in detail the initial steps that must be met to support an award of Section 8(f) relief, up to and including consideration of the \"materially and substantially greater\" standard;  we do not consider issues raised on appeal that go beyond these threshold requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LHWCA provides compensation for the death or disability of federal maritime employees if the disability or death results from a work-related injury.  Under what has been termed the \"aggravation rule,\" the LHWCA requires an employer to provide full coverage for a worker's job-related disability even when the disability resulted from some combination of a current employment injury and a pre-existing condition.  Ceres Marine Terminal v. Director, OWCP, 118 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir.1997).  In response to concern that this \"aggravation rule\" would give the employer an incentive to discriminate against partially disabled workers based on a fear of increased liability, Congress enacted Section 8(f).  Id.;  see also CNA, 935 F.2d at 435 (explaining that the statute was aimed at encouraging employers to hire or continue to employ handicapped workers by limiting liability for a subsequently incurred permanent partial disability attributable in part to a previously existing handicap).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 8(f) provides in relevant part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(f) Injury increasing disability:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(1) In ... cases of total permanent disability ... found not to be due solely to that injury, of an employee having an existing permanent partial disability, the employer shall provide ... compensation payments ... for one hundred and four weeks only....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ... cases in which the employee has a permanent partial disability, found not to be due solely to that injury, and such disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer shall provide ... compensation for one hundred and four weeks only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(f)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employer carries the burden to prove that the elements of Section 8(f) are met.  See Director, OWCP v. Edward Minte Co., Inc., 803 F.2d 731, 737 (D.C.Cir.1986);  Director, OWCP v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 676 F.2d 110, 115 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To qualify for the limitation on full liability, the employer therefore must prove that the claimant had a permanent partial disability within the meaning of Section 8(f), and that the condition existed prior to the work-related injury.  We have described the standard for \"disability\" under Section 8(f) as \"[a condition] serious enough to motivate a cautious employer either not to hire or [to] fire [the] employee because of the 'greatly increased risk of [an] employment-related accident and compensation liability.' \"  CNA, 935 F.2d at 435.   Thus, a person may be found to suffer from a pre-existing disability even if able to work full time in the identical position.  The pre-existing disability must, however, be a \"condition,\" and not merely an unhealthy behavior likely to lead to a condition.  See General Dynamics Corp. v. Sacchetti, 681 F.2d 37 (1st Cir.1982) (finding that an employee's habit of smoking moderately for ten years prior to developing asbestosis as a result of exposure at work did not constitute a qualifying prior permanent partial disability so as to limit an employer's liability under Section 8(f)).  To qualify as pre-existing, the condition must exist before the work-related injury;  a disability that occurs simultaneously will not meet the requirement.  See Fineman v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 27 BRBS 104 (1993) (citing Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Harris, 934 F.2d 548 (4th Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the employer establishes that the employee had a qualifying pre-existing disability, the scope of the compensable injury must be considered.  Although most cases have failed to acknowledge the differing standards, the proper analysis at this point turns on whether the employee suffers from a full or partial disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases where the employee is fully disabled, the employer must show that the disability is not due solely to the most recent injury.  E.P. Paup Co. v. Director, OWCP, 999 F.2d 1341, 1352 (9th Cir.1993);  Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp. v. Director, OWCP, 913 F.2d 1426, 1429 (9th Cir.1990).  \"Thus, if the employment injury was sufficient, by itself, to cause the claimant's total permanent disability, the employer should be liable for the entire compensation award and section 8(f) relief should be denied.  The aggravation rule that [S]ection 8(f) was intended to counteract never comes into play under these circumstances because the employer would be liable to the same extent if an able-bodied employee suffered the same injury.\"  Ceres Marine, 118 F.3d at 390.   The employer cannot satisfy the Section 8(f) standard merely by demonstrating that the employee's pre-existing injury compounded his employment-related injury;  rather, the employer must show that, but for pre-existing disability, claimant would be employable.

A showing of this kind requires quantification of the level of impairment that would ensue from the work-related injury alone.  In other words, an employer must present evidence of the type and extent of disability that the claimant would suffer if not previously disabled when injured by the same work-related injury.  Once the employer establishes the level of disability in the absence of a pre-existing permanent partial disability, an adjudicative body will have a basis on which to determine whether the ultimate permanent partial disability is materially and substantially greater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 F.3d at 185-86;  see also Ingalls, 125 F.3d 303, 307-08.

See, e.g., Skelton v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 27 BRBS 28, (1993) (stating that the Section 8(f) contribution requirement may be met by a showing \"that the pre-existing disability was aggravated by claimant's subsequent employment.\").  However, a finding that a claimant's permanent physical impairment is greater as a result of the combination of the pre-existing and work-related injuries is clearly insufficient to satisfy Section 8(f).  See Newport News, 8 F.3d at 184-85.

The evidence in the medical record supports the ALJ's conclusion that these problems, probably resulting from obesity and smoking, amounted to \"the classic condition of a high-risk employee whom a cautious employer would neither have hired nor retained in employment due to the increased likelihood that such an employee would sustain another occupational disease.\"   While we need not reach this issue to conclude this case, we note here that we agree with the ALJ's finding that claimant met the Section 8(f) criteria of suffering from a pre-existing permanent disability prior to his work-related injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be entitled to Section 8(f) relief, however, BIW was required to carry the burden of demonstrating that claimant's twenty-five percent disability was materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the asbestos exposure alone.  To do this, BIW was required to show the degree of disability attributable only to claimant's asbestosis.  See Newport News, 8 F.3d at 185-86.   Then, the ALJ should have compared this information with claimant's twenty-five percent disability to determine whether the \"materially and substantially greater\" standard had been met.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ, however, made no such determination.  He neither discussed the statutory requirement, nor applied it in analyzing the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the ALJ lacked the evidence to apply the \"materially and substantially greater\" standard even had he chosen to do so.  No evidence of the degree of disability attributable only to claimant's asbestosis was ever presented.  Nor can such disability be deduced from the medical records relating to claimant's non-asbestos-related injury.  While Dr. Schall did state that the non-related asbestos lung disease was in a further advanced state than claimant's asbestosis, Dr. Schall made this diagnosis in 1983.  At that time, claimant was not disabled as a result of pulmonary impairment.  A 1983 assessment, therefore, could not establish the degree to which claimant's 1986 compensable injury was impacted by an earlier existing non-asbestos-related disability.  Dr. Killian, in reporting on claimant's condition in 1986, concluded that claimant's prior non-asbestos-related disability contributed to claimant's overall disability.  But he gave no indication of how much contribution existed, and included in his assessment of claimant's \"overall disability\" claimant's knee problems, which cannot properly form part of a Section 8(f) determination.  Dr. Corbin provides the best evidence for BIW, stating, in 1987, that claimant's \"symptoms of shortness of breath and restricted activity are significantly contributed to by his physical deconditioning and obesity.\"   However, even this report fails to meet the required standard.  Dr. Corbin provides a general statement that includes claimant's shortness of breath and spans his \"restricted activity.\"   The report does not indicate the extent to which claimant's pre-existing condition contributed to his permanent partial disability, the twenty-five percent pulmonary impairment for which condition alone claimant received compensation under the LHWCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, there being neither sufficient direct evidence of the contribution of asbestosis to claimant's overall permanent partial disability nor a basis for deducing such contribution from the contribution attributable to the pre-existing condition, BIW has failed to carry its considerable burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we determine that the ALJ failed to find, and the record contains insufficient evidence to show, that claimant's current permanent partial disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from asbestosis alone, we do not address the remaining issues raised by appellant.  For the reasons discussed, we reverse the Section 8(f) award to BIW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The issue in this case concerns who should bear the primary responsibility for paying compensation to the claimant.

Newport News, 22 BRBS 78, 85 (1989), for the proposition that only pulmonary problems were relevant to the Section 8(f) determination;  physical problems relating to other impairments, such as claimant's knee injury, could not be considered.  In the section of Adams quoted by the ALJ, the Board mentions the \"materially and substantially greater\" requirement only as part of its general explanation that this standard must be met by a pre-existing disability that impacts the same type of physical functioning as does the work-related injury</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In long-latency disease cases, such as asbestosis, using the date of last exposure as the relevant time of injury is inappropriate because the injury arises years later when the disease manifests itself.

Therefore, while not determinative of our finding, we note here the applicable date for time of injury is the date that claimant was diagnosed with--and thus became aware that he suffered from--a twenty-five percent permanent partial disability resulting from asbestosis.  See Harris, 934 F.2d at 553 (stating that \"the time of injury is deemed to be the date on which the employee or claimant becomes aware, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice should have been aware, of the relationship between the employment, the disease, and the death or disability,\" citing 33 U.S.C. &#167; 910(i) and noting, \"[s]ince the issue before the court is how long the employer is going to have to pay the amount determined to be due under [Section 910], it necessarily follows that the definition of time of injury found therein would be used for the purposes of Section 8(f).\")</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We believe this case can be resolved on a fairly straightforward basis not requiring us to consider many of the issues raised on appeal.  As we discuss below, unless the employer establishes that the employee's compensable permanent partial disability was \"materially and substantially greater\" as a result of a prior disability, a Section 8(f) award is unavailable to the employer, and no further analysis is required.  Because existing case law has largely ignored the clear threshold requirements of Section 8(f), however, we think it helpful to clarify certain preliminary issues in the Section 8(f) framework.  We choose, therefore, to review in detail the initial steps that must be met to support an award of Section 8(f) relief, up to and including consideration of the \"materially and substantially greater\" standard;  we do not consider issues raised on appeal that go beyond these threshold requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LHWCA provides compensation for the death or disability of federal maritime employees if the disability or death results from a work-related injury.

Bath Iron Works Corp., 27 BRBS 28, (1993) (stating that the Section 8(f) contribution requirement may be met by a showing \"that the pre-existing disability was aggravated by claimant's subsequent employment.\").  However, a finding that a claimant's permanent physical impairment is greater as a result of the combination of the pre-existing and work-related injuries is clearly insufficient to satisfy Section 8(f).  See Newport News, 8 F.3d at 184-85.   Failure to apply the statutory criteria of \"materially and substantially greater\" constitutes error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BIW'S SECTION 8(f) BURDEN APPLIED</p>\n    <p>I. The ALJ's Findings and Conclusions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ defined the essential elements for Section 8(f) relief as:  \"(1) the employee had a pre-existing permanent partial disability, (2) which was manifest to the employer prior to the subsequent compensable injury, and (3) which combined with the subsequent injury to produce or increase the employee's permanent total or partial disability, a disability greater than that resulting from the first injury alone.\"   In concluding that BIW met these elements, the ALJ relied on the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>The record reflects ... (2) that [claimant] has experienced shortness of breath and pulmonary problems since at least May of 1978 as he was required to be examined by Dr. Schall for pre-operative clearance prior to knee surgery, (3) that he has suffered from obesity and hypertension for many years, (4) that he had a long history of cigarette smoking, i.e., at least 1 to 3 packs per day for forty years, a habit he stopped in 1978, (5) that Claimant's asbestos-related disease was first reported on his chest x-rays in April of 1982, ... (7) that his subsequent diagnostic tests, including pulmonary function tests, showed an increase of his asbestos-related disease and a worsening of his shortness of breath, (8) that Dr. Schall, as of December 5, 1983, opined that Claimant's pulmonary impairment was due to \"a mixture of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asbestosis with some restrictive component,\" (9) that Claimant's \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is far more risky to him and is (in) a further advanced state than is his asbestosis,\" (10) that he \"has the concomitant problems of obesity, chronic alcoholism and severe osteoarthritis of his knees,\" ... (12) that the doctors are in agreement that Claimant's permanent partial impairment is due to the combination of his asbestos-related disease, i.e., his asbestosis, his hypertension, his obesity, his cardiac problems diagnosed as ischemic heart disease, (13) that the doctors reiterated their opinions at their post-hearing depositions ..., [and] (14) that Claimant's permanent disability is the result of the combination of his pre-existing permanent partial disability (i.e. his pulmonary problems since at least May 18, 1978, his chronic obesity, his chronic hypertension, his cardiac problems and his cigarette smoking habit of at least 100 pack years and as high as 120 pack years) and his work-related asbestosis ...

The evidence in the medical record supports the ALJ's conclusion that these problems, probably resulting from obesity and smoking, amounted to \"the classic condition of a high-risk employee whom a cautious employer would neither have hired nor retained in employment due to the increased likelihood that such an employee would sustain another occupational disease.\"   While we need not reach this issue to conclude this case, we note here that we agree with the ALJ's finding that claimant met the Section 8(f) criteria of suffering from a pre-existing permanent disability prior to his work-related injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be entitled to Section 8(f) relief, however, BIW was required to carry the burden of demonstrating that claimant's twenty-five percent disability was materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the asbestos exposure alone.  To do this, BIW was required to show the degree of disability attributable only to claimant's asbestosis.  See Newport News, 8 F.3d at 185-86.   Then, the ALJ should have compared this information with claimant's twenty-five percent disability to determine whether the \"materially and substantially greater\" standard had been met.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ, however, made no such determination.  He neither discussed the statutory requirement, nor applied it in analyzing the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the ALJ lacked the evidence to apply the \"materially and substantially greater\" standard even had he chosen to do so.  No evidence of the degree of disability attributable only to claimant's asbestosis was ever presented.  Nor can such disability be deduced from the medical records relating to claimant's non-asbestos-related injury.  While Dr. Schall did state that the non-related asbestos lung disease was in a further advanced state than claimant's asbestosis, Dr. Schall made this diagnosis in 1983.  At that time, claimant was not disabled as a result of pulmonary impairment.  A 1983 assessment, therefore, could not establish the degree to which claimant's 1986 compensable injury was impacted by an earlier existing non-asbestos-related disability.  Dr. Killian, in reporting on claimant's condition in 1986, concluded that claimant's prior non-asbestos-related disability contributed to claimant's overall disability.  But he gave no indication of how much contribution existed, and included in his assessment of claimant's \"overall disability\" claimant's knee problems, which cannot properly form part of a Section 8(f) determination.  Dr. Corbin provides the best evidence for BIW, stating, in 1987, that claimant's \"symptoms of shortness of breath and restricted activity are significantly contributed to by his physical deconditioning and obesity.\"   However, even this report fails to meet the required standard.  Dr. Corbin provides a general statement that includes claimant's shortness of breath and spans his \"restricted activity.\"   The report does not indicate the extent to which claimant's pre-existing condition contributed to his permanent partial disability, the twenty-five percent pulmonary impairment for which condition alone claimant received compensation under the LHWCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, there being neither sufficient direct evidence of the contribution of asbestosis to claimant's overall permanent partial disability nor a basis for deducing such contribution from the contribution attributable to the pre-existing condition, BIW has failed to carry its considerable burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we determine that the ALJ failed to find, and the record contains insufficient evidence to show, that claimant's current permanent partial disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from asbestosis alone, we do not address the remaining issues raised by appellant.  For the reasons discussed, we reverse the Section 8(f) award to BIW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The issue in this case concerns who should bear the primary responsibility for paying compensation to the claimant.  Under the LHWCA, the employer pays the full amount unless it meets the requirements set forth in Section 8(f), in which case its liability for payment to disabled employees is limited to 104 weeks and any remaining compensation owed is paid by a special second injury fund.  33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 908(f)(1) &amp; (2)(A).

The abbreviation, \"Newport News,\" refers only to this Fourth Circuit case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> At the conclusion of the order, the ALJ quoted Adams v. Newport News, 22 BRBS 78, 85 (1989), for the proposition that only pulmonary problems were relevant to the Section 8(f) determination;  physical problems relating to other impairments, such as claimant's knee injury, could not be considered.  In the section of Adams quoted by the ALJ, the Board mentions the \"materially and substantially greater\" requirement only as part of its general explanation that this standard must be met by a pre-existing disability that impacts the same type of physical functioning as does the work-related injury</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In long-latency disease cases, such as asbestosis, using the date of last exposure as the relevant time of injury is inappropriate because the injury arises years later when the disease manifests itself.  See Bath Iron Works Co., 506 U.S. at 163, 113 S.Ct. at 698.   Therefore, while not determinative of our finding, we note here the applicable date for time of injury is the date that claimant was diagnosed with--and thus became aware that he suffered from--a twenty-five percent permanent partial disability resulting from asbestosis.  See Harris, 934 F.2d at 553 (stating that \"the time of injury is deemed to be the date on which the employee or claimant becomes aware, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice should have been aware, of the relationship between the employment, the disease, and the death or disability,\" citing 33 U.S.C. &#167; 910(i) and noting, \"[s]ince the issue before the court is how long the employer is going to have to pay the amount determined to be due under [Section 910], it necessarily follows that the definition of time of injury found therein would be used for the purposes of Section 8(f).\")</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
