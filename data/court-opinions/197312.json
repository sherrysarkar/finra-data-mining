Eventually\r\n\ncomprised of eleven attorneys with expertise in mass-tort litiga-\r\n\ntion, the PSC served as plaintiffs' lead counsel, responsible for\r\n\ncoordinating  discovery, settlement  negotiations and,  if neces-\r\n\nsary, trial matters  common to  all plaintiffs.   The eleven  PSC\r\n\nmembers  nonetheless  retained their  respective roles  as IRPAs,\r\n\ndirectly  representing  approximately  seventy  percent   of  the\r\n\nindividual plaintiffs.   The IRPAs,  on the other  hand, were  to\r\n\nfocus their  efforts on  litigation tasks idiosyncratic  to their\r\n\nrespective clients' cases.  \r\n\nA.

Pretrial Case-Management Orders\r                                              \r\n\n          In  two pretrial  orders, the  district court  directed\r\n\nplaintiffs, who would derive common benefit from PSC services, to\r\n\npay PSC attorney fees  and costs from the common  fund ultimately\r\n\nrecovered in the litigation.  See Pretrial Order No. 127 (Dec. 2,\r                                           \r\n\n1988); Pretrial  Order No. 2 (Mar.  23, 1987).  At  the time, the\r\n\ndistrict  court tentatively proposed to  limit the PSC  to a com-\r\n\nbined attorney fee/cost  award not exceeding  ten percent of  the\r\n\neventual  common fund, see Pretrial  Order No. 127,  at 48, which\r                                    \r\n\nultimately approximated $220 million.   The district court estab-\r\n\nlished  the  following cost-submission  and  reimbursement guide-\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nlines:\r\n\n               [A]ssessments2  will  be deposited  in a\r\n          fund that will defray the reasonable expenses\r\n          of the PSC in  the performance of its duties.\r\n          The PSC shall maintain a careful statement of\r\n          account on  the  fund, that  is, prepare  and\r\n          keep   accurate,  contemporaneous,   detailed\r                                                                 \r\n          records  of  the receipts,  deposits, accumu-\r                                             \r\n          lated interest  and subsequent disbursements.\r\n          The fund shall be used only to make disburse-\r\n          ments  (whether directly  to creditors  or to\r\n          reimburse  the PSC) for expenses incurred for\r\n          the benefit of all plaintiffs.  Any disburse-\r\n          ments made  for the  benefit of  a particular\r\n          plaintiff represented by a member of the  PSC\r\n          shall  be  the  sole  responsibility  of  the\r\n          plaintiff in question.

Further,  the  PSC  bylaws\r\n\nrequired prior approval, by five  PSC members, for any PSC-office\r\n\ncost reimbursement above $500,  as well as payment of  such costs\r\n\nby PSC check.\r\n\n          In  March  1987,  certified public  accountant  (\"CPA\")\r\n\nDonald  Kevane was  retained  to review  and  submit to  the  PSC\r\n\nmonthly reports summarizing PSC-office  costs.

Sterling  thereafter  reviewed\r\n\n\"every receipt or other piece of documentation submitted,\" noting\r\n\neach  questionable claim.5   Sterling  submitted her  reports and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Sterling, who had  acquired extensive  prior experience  in\r\nthe MGM case, established eleven criteria for determining whether\r                 \r\nPSC-member  costs were reimbursable:  (1) major expenditures only\r\nif documented  by receipts;  (2) minor expenditures  (e.g., tips,\r                                                                    \r\npay-phone charges), for which the use of receipts was impractica-\r\nble, only if supported by affidavit; (3) coach air fare only; (4)\r\nfederal express  charges if  documented  by airbills  designating\r\norigin  and  destination;  (5)  long distance  phone  charges  if\r\ndocumented  according to  date, number,  duration, and  cost; (6)\r\nphotocopying  expenditures  at  25  cents per  page  and  postage\r\ncharges at  actual cost if  the member indicated  compliance with\r\nnormal in-house procedure  at the member's law firm  for tracking\r\nthese  costs; (7)  telefax charges at  actual cost, not at a page\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nsupporting documentation to Adamina Soto, a CPA who reviewed  the\r\n\nSterling report  and randomly  checked its  underlying documenta-\r\n\ntion, then contacted PSC members about problem items and request-\r\n\ned further documentation.  Soto eventually disallowed $207,475 in\r\n\ncosts and submitted her reports to Raben.\r\n\n          Raben submitted  three final  reports  to the  district\r\n\ncourt, covering PSC-member cost claims through January 31, 1991.6\r\n\nHe disallowed an  additional $138,569 of the total  $3,847,233 in\r\n\nclaimed  expenditures.

See Order No. 510-\r                                                            \r\n\nA.  For example, as regards hotel charges, the court rejected the\r\n\ncontention that the  maximum per  diem rate should  be $116,  the\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nrate considered \"reasonable\" by the IRS for tax-deduction purpos-\r\n\nes.  It ruled  that reasonableness must be assessed case by case,\r\n\nto reflect  such variants as locale,  seasonal fluctuations, room\r\n\navailability, the number of persons sharing a room, accessibility\r\n\nof equipment and facilities essential  to the litigation task  at\r\n\nhand, as  well as other exigencies.  Id. at 7-8.  The court ruled\r                                                  \r\n\nthat, like the IRPAs,  PSC members were entitled  to \"reasonable\"\r\n\nreimbursement  for photocopying  costs and  had not  \"profit[ed]\"\r\n\nfrom the authorized twenty-five-cents-per-copy rate.  Id. at 9.  \r                                                                   \r\n\n          The district court further  noted, inter alia, that the\r                                                                 \r\n\nobjections the plaintiffs and IRPAs  made to the PSC-cost submis-\r\n\nsions were  so voluminous and  entwined with  issues relating  to\r\n\nattorney  fees that it was  difficult to determine the particular\r\n\ncosts  to  which the  plaintiffs and  IRPAs  were objecting.   It\r\n\ndirected the plaintiffs and  IRPAs to \"sort out this  chaos,\" id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 12; Torres  and Sterling to  meet and consult  at the JDD  not\r\n\nlater  than December  10; and  the plaintiffs  and IRPAs  to file\r\n\nparticularized objections to the remaining expenditures not later\r\n\nthan January 12, 1994.  \r\n\n          The  district court conducted an evidentiary hearing in\r\n\nDecember 1993, to determine  whether to allow the PSC  to recover\r\n\nits final cost installment  for retaining Thomas Foulds, Esquire,\r\n\nas an expert.  The PSC maintained that Foulds, who had worked for\r\n\nmany years in the insurance industry before attending law school,\r\n\nhad been retained as an insurance  expert, to interpret insurance\r                                                   \r\n\ncontracts, rather than as an attorney, and that his fee therefore\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nwas  fully reimbursable as a PSC-office cost.  See Pretrial Order\r                                                            \r\n\nNo. 127, at 48.   Although the plaintiffs and IRPAs objected that\r\n\nFoulds  had  performed  many  litigation tasks,  including  legal\r\n\nresearch and conducting depositions, normally performed by attor-\r\n\nneys and not by insurance experts, the district court allowed the\r\n\nFoulds fee  reimbursement as  a PSC-office cost  after concluding\r\n\nthat  Foulds  \"was  not contracted  merely  as  an attorney\"  but\r\n\nprimarily for his insurance expertise.  See Order No. 520, at 3-4\r                                                     \r\n\n(Jan. 28, 1994).  The final installment brought the total Foulds-\r\n\nfee reimbursement to $913,503.7\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs and IRPAs  filed their final objections\r\n\nto PSC-member costs in January 1995, essentially reiterating that\r\n\nthe cost  review and  verification process had  proven hopelessly\r\n\ninadequate to document either the necessariness or reasonableness\r\n\nof the claimed  costs, and that it was unfair  to require them to\r\n\nsort through the chaotic documentation created by the PSC and its\r\n\nmembers.    Alternatively,  the  plaintiffs  and  IRPAs  asserted\r\n\nspecific objections to a sampling of allegedly inappropriate PSC-\r\n\nmember  costs (e.g.,  phone  calls, tips,  charges for  \"drinks,\"\r                             \r\n\netc.)  and urged  an across-the-board  reduction of  all PSC-cost\r\n\nclaims by  a fixed percentage  (25-33%) to reflect  the sampling-\r\n\nbased  estimate of alleged PSC  overcharges.  Finally, the plain-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The district  court had  approved two prior  PSC reimburse-\r\nments relating  to Foulds, totaling  $850,000.  See  Margin Order\r                                                             \r\nNo.  755 (filed under  seal Dec. 27, 1990);  Order No. 398 (filed\r\nunder seal Oct. 15, 1991).  The final PSC installment  of $84,107\r\nwas disallowed  in part,  due to deficiencies  in contemporaneous\r\ndocumentation.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ntiffs and IRPAs  complained that Monita  Sterling had refused  to\r\n\nallow CPA Torres to inspect  the documentation pertaining to PSC-\r\n\noffice costs at the joint meeting required by Order No. 510-A.\r\n\n          The district court once again overruled the bulk of the\r\n\nobjections.   See Order No. 584 (Aug. 29, 1995).  First, it found\r                           \r\n\nthe PSC review process  adequate, noting that it had  resulted in\r\n\ndisallowance of  several questionable  expenditures based on  the\r\n\nindependent review  conducted by Raben, Sterling,  and Soto under\r\n\nobjective criteria.  Second,  except for a handful of  de minimis\r                                                                           \r\n\nmischarges  totaling less  than  $2,000, the  court rejected  the\r\n\nspecific challenges asserted by the plaintiffs and IRPAs based on\r\n\ntheir samplings of alleged overcharges.  Finally, the court ruled\r\n\nthat its Pretrial Order No. 510-A, see supra pp. 11-12, had envi-\r                                                                  \r                                                      \r\n\nsioned  only  that  Sterling  and  Torres  inspect  documentation\r\n\nrelating to  \"outstanding issues\"     those  involving PSC-member\r\n\ncosts, not PSC-office-cost issues. \r\n\n          In due course,  the plaintiffs and IRPAs  [hereinafter:\r\n\n\"appellants\"] appealed from the various orders approving PSC-cost\r\n\nreimbursements (Order Nos. 478, 485, 510-A, 520, and 584).\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.

Although the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs in mass-\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\ntort MDLs share the same litigation goal (viz., an optimum common\r                                                        \r\n\nfund),  internecine  differences  as  to  subsidiary  matters    \r\n\nparticularly the appropriate allocations from the common fund for\r\n\ntheir respective attorney fees and costs    are commonplace.  The\r\n\ngreater the attorney fees  and costs awarded the PSC,  of course,\r\n\nthe less  available for the  IRPAs and their  individual clients.\r\n\nAppellants  maintain that these conflicting self-interests neces-\r\n\nsarily entail  heightened oversight responsibilities on  the part\r\n\nof  the district  courts in  mass-tort MDLs  to ensure  stringent\r\n\nmonitoring and review procedures adequate to protect the individ-\r\n\nual plaintiffs and IRPAs from overreaching by the PSC.  \r\n\n          Appellants  fault  the   district  court  for  adopting\r\n\nreimbursement  procedures  which   delegate  important   judicial\r\n\noversight responsibilities  to auditors  appointed either by  the\r\n\ncourt or  the PSC.   It  is the PSC,  they say,  rather than  the\r\n\nappellants, which  must bear the ultimate  burden in establishing\r\n\nentitlement to reimbursement, see  Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin,\r                                                                          \r\n\n749  F.2d 945, 956-57 (1st Cir. 1984), which in turn necessitates\r\n\nthree distinct showings  by the PSC  for each claimed  reimburse-\r\n\nment; viz., that it  document:  (i) the actual  expenditure; (ii)\r                                                                     \r\n\nits necessariness to the assigned litigation task; and  (iii) its\r                           \r\n\nreasonableness, see, e.g., In re Agent Orange Prod.

Raben and Kevane were accountants, neither trained\r\n\nin the law nor familiar with the litigation tasks assigned to the\r\n\nPSC.   At best they  could verify  that the PSC  and its  members\r\n\nactually made the claimed expenditures, but in many instances PSC\r\n\nmembers maintained no detailed  records relating to their reason-\r\n\nableness and  necessariness.  Moreover, appellants  argue, though\r\n\nMonita  Sterling  and  others  similarly designated  by  the  PSC\r\n\nundoubtedly  were more  familiar than Kevane  and Raben  with the\r\n\nnature and  demands  of the  PSC's  litigation  responsibilities,\r\n\ntheir  assessments of  claimed  expenses were  inherently  biased\r\n\nbecause their employment with the PSC gave them a vested interest\r\n\nin justifying PSC reimbursements.\r\n\n          Appellants  contend that  the district  court erred  in\r\n\nsuggesting  that it was incumbent upon them, rather than the PSC,\r\n\nto demonstrate  that particular  PSC expenditures were  not reim-\r\n\nbursable.  See, e.g., Order No. 520, at 1 n.1 (\"Parties question-\r                              \r\n\ning payments  previously approved  carried the burden  of setting\r\n\nthem aside  whereas the PSC/Mr.  Foulds were required  to justify\r\n\nthe pending request.\").  The court based its ruling on the ground\r\n\nthat most PSC cost-reimbursement  claims during earlier stages in\r\n\nthe litigation had been  approved, without opposition, as submit-\r\n\nted.  \r\n\n          Appellants  complain not only  that the  district court\r\n\nthereby subverted the well-established burden of proof  incumbent\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nupon the PSC, see Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 956-57, but  foisted\r                                         \r\n\non the plaintiffs  and IRPAs the impracticable  task of rummaging\r\n\nthrough mountainous PSC documentation to determine    within very\r\n\nrestrictive court-ordered deadlines    which PSC-cost submissions\r\n\nwere either inadequately documented or otherwise nonreimbursable.\r\n\nAppellants therefore urge  that all otherwise  allowable PSC-cost\r\n\nreimbursements  be reduced  by  a fixed  (if somewhat  arbitrary)\r\n\ndiscount  (25% to 33%), see, e.g., Mokover v. Neco Enters., Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n785 F.

Appellants simply waited\r\n\ntoo long before  asking the  district court to  undo, with  their\r\n\nbroad axe (viz., a 25% to 33% across-the-board cut), the documen-\r                         \r\n\ntary muddle allowed to accumulate. \r\n\n           Moreover, pressed on many  other fronts since 1987, it\r\n\nwas not practicable  for the district  court alone to  scrutinize\r\n\nall cost-related  documentation maintained by the  PSC for nearly\r\n\nhalf a decade.   See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d  at 950 (noting that\r                                            \r\n\ncourts  must strive  for  cost-setting processes  which are  \"not\r\n\nunnecessarily burdensome to the courts themselves\").  Unlike less\r\n\nattenuated and  complex litigation, mass-tort MDLs  by their very\r\n\nnature  predetermine that detailed monitoring of case-administra-\r\n\ntion-related responsibilities be  delegated.  The  early pretrial\r\n\norders entered  by the district court,  with appellants' acquies-\r\n\ncence,  accordingly  established a  cost-monitoring  regime which\r\n\nrequired  the PSC to submit  cost summaries every  sixty days for\r\n\ninterim  approval by  the court.   The PSC-cost  summaries, which\r                 \r\n\nmerely  reflected total  expenses by  general type  and category,\r\n\nrepresented  the  cumulative, edited  product  of  the Raben  and\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nKevane \"audits,\" without the underlying documentation.  Thus, the\r\n\ninterim-approval regime  was reasonably  designed to  ensure that\r\n\ncost verification and containment by the parties not simply await\r\n\nan end to the  entire litigation, by which time  the accompanying\r\n\navalanche of documentation would all but preclude cogent review. \r\n\n          Nevertheless, two  serious deficiencies made  their way\r\n\ninto  these interim-approval procedures with appellants' acquies-\r\n\ncence:  (1) the failure to include defined criteria for assessing\r\n\n\"reasonableness\" and \"necessariness\"; and (2) the failure explic-\r\n\nitly to authorize or require appellants to monitor the underlying\r\n\ndocumentation as interim PSC-cost summaries were submitted to the\r\n\ndistrict court.9  Thus, appellants settled from the outset simply\r\n\nfor the broad, undefined  general criteria that claimed-PSC costs\r\n\nbe \"necessary\"  and  \"reasonable,\" thereby  implicitly  foregoing\r\n\nsuch  ongoing prophylactic  measures  as particularized  monetary\r\n\nguidelines and/or ceilings on major cost categories; for example,\r\n\nmaximum per diem  rates for hotels and page-rates  for photocopy-\r\n\ning.10  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9The record  discloses no indication that  appellants either\r\nobjected to  these deficiencies  or  proposed alternative  proce-\r\ndures.  See  Silva v. Witschen,  19 F.3d 725,  729 n.4 (1st  Cir.\r                                        \r\n1994)  (appellant bears  brunt  of failure  to include  pertinent\r\nmaterial in record).\r\n\n     10The MCL notes:\r\n\n               Rules  and  practices  vary widely  with\r\n          respect to reimbursement of expenses incurred\r\n          by lawyers in the course of the case out of a\r\n          fee  award.  Charges for  paralegals  and law\r\n          clerks at market rates and the fees of neces-\r\n          sary experts are generally reimbursable. Sec-\r\n          retarial assistance, on the  other hand, is a\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n          Yet  more fundamentally, the pretrial procedural orders\r\n\ndid not identify a  minimum level of detail in  the documentation\r\n\nrequired to  substantiate that  a particular PSC-member  cost was\r\n\n\"necessary\" to a  PSC litigation task and \"reasonable\" in amount.\r\n\nRather, the  orders  simply directed  the PSC  to keep  \"careful,\r\n\ncontemporaneous, detailed records\"  and provide \"proper verifica-\r\n\ntion\" of its  expenditures.  Although  Grendel's Den makes  clear\r                                                              \r\n\nthat an entity requesting  reimbursement must document its actual\r                                                                           \r\n\nexpenditures, normally by itemized receipt,  see 749 F.2d at 956-\r                                                          \r\n\n57, the more amorphous and subjective criteria for substantiating\r\n\nthat a given expenditure was \"necessary\" and \"reasonable\" may not\r\n\nbe  so readily documented.  For example, in some instances courts\r\n\ndo  not require exacting documentation  even for major cost reim-\r\n\nbursements, such as overhead expenses incurred in connection with\r\n\nthe PSC  office, relying instead  on their intimate  knowledge of\r\n\nthe litigation for determining whether entire categories of costs\r\n\npass the  reasonableness test;  viz., whether the  nature of  the\r                                              \r\n\nexpenditure  strikes  the court  as  clearly  superfluous or  its\r\n\namount  transcends  the broad  bounds  of  reasonableness in  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          normal  part of  overhead,  but  courts  have\r\n          differed over whether  overtime is  reimburs-\r\n          able.  Similarly, rulings vary  on such items\r\n          as copy and printing costs, certain meals and\r\n          travel,  and  fax,  telephone,  and  delivery\r\n          charges. The determination of these  kinds of\r\n          claims should  not  be  left  to  costly  and\r\n          time-consuming adversary  adjudication at the\r\n          end of  the litigation; ground rules on reim-\r\n          bursement should be  established at the  out-\r                                                                 \r\n          set.\r                       \r\n\nMCL   24.215 (emphasis added).  \r             \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\ncircumstances.11\r\n\n          Furthermore, the early pretrial orders afforded both an\r\n\nobvious  and ready  opportunity for  appellants, inter  alios, to\r                                                                       \r\n\npropose,  with  somewhat  greater  particularity  at  least, more\r\n\ndefinite  contours  for monitoring,  testing,  and verifying  PSC\r\n\ncompliance  with the  amorphous \"necessariness\"  and \"reasonable-\r\n\nness\" criteria laid down by the  district court.

It is  not necessary or  desirable for\r\n     federal courts to review receipts for every five dollar\r\n     expenditure.   Judges,  being former  practicing attor-\r\n     neys, are quite capable of  determining the reasonable-\r\n     ness of expenses incurred  during litigation.   Neither\r\n     is it  necessary to  itemize expenses in  great detail.\r\n     For example,  it is  sufficient that copying costs were\r\n     submitted without listing how many pages of which docu-\r\n     ments were copied during the three years of litigation.\r\n     Law firms generally do not keep such records and little\r\n     would  be served by requiring them except to make liti-\r\n     gation  more expensive.    The amount  of the  expenses\r\n     submitted is certainly reasonable given the  length and\r\n     complexity of this case. \r\n\nDuke v. Uniroyal Inc.,  743 F.

Thus, these  matters were left  unattended until\r\n\nthe end of the litigation at their peril. \r                                                  \r\n\n          Moreover, appellants exacerbated the documentary muddle\r\n\nfrom  the start by opting to forego ongoing monitoring of the PSC\r\n\ndocumentation.   Unlike  less prolonged  and complex  litigation,\r\n\nwherein interim-cost reimbursement claims may  be deferable until\r\n\nthe litigation nears completion,  the hands-off approach taken by\r\n\nappellants is  utterly impracticable in these  large and enduring\r\n\nmass-tort proceedings.\r\n\n          Given the potential for serious, long-term overreaching\r\n\nby  the PSC under the relaxed regime envisioned by these pretrial\r\n\norders, we discern no sound justification for appellants' failure\r\n\nto propose in 1987 that one  of their own number be designated to\r                                                          \r\n\nconduct closer review of the underlying PSC-cost documentation on\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nan ongoing basis.12   See Francis Bacon, Of Suspicion  (\"There is\r                                                               \r\n\nnothing  makes a man suspect  much, more than  to know little.\").\r\n\nAlternatively, the IRPAs could  have sought district court autho-\r\n\nrization  to  retain an  auditor  to  monitor these  interim-cost\r\n\nreports on an ongoing  basis for \"necessariness\" and \"reasonable-\r\n\nness.\"  Thus, appellants'  failure even to attempt interim  moni-\r\n\ntoring directly  contributed to the serious  and otherwise avoid-\r\n\nable  consequences ultimately  brought  to  the district  court's\r\n\nattention at a  time when  corrective action could  no longer  be\r\n\nconsidered practicable.\r\n\n          Nor are appellants absolved of their  primary responsi-\r                                                                           \r\n\nbility  for protecting their own interests based on the mere fact\r                                                    \r\n\nthat  the  pretrial  orders  did not  explicitly  direct  interim\r\n\nmonitoring.

Co., 159 F.R.D.\r                                                               \r\n653, 659-60 (M.D.N.C. 1995) (party-opponent barred from obtaining\r\nfee statements in circumstances where  it could \"examine the bill\r\nto find out the nature of the services in order  to discover what\r\nadvice  the attorney was providing defendants  and to learn other\r\ndetails about defendants' investigation of her claim\");  Colonial\r                                                                           \r\nGas  Co. v.

Thus, there was no privacy\r\nimpediment to allowing them access to the PSC's interim materials\r\nand supporting  documentation simply on  request.   In fact,  the\r\nappellees note that their  cost documentation was always accessi-\r\nble to the IRPAs and plaintiffs on request.\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nneither precluded  nor incapacitated from taking  appropriate and\r\n\ntimely precautions.  First and foremost, fundamental deficiencies\r\n\nin  the interim  PSC-cost  submissions to  the court,  especially\r\n\ntheir lack  of particularity,  readily could have  been addressed\r\n\nand corrected  ab initio, rather than  at the end of  the litiga-\r                                  \r\n\ntion.  Second, appellants  placed too much reliance upon  non-MDL\r                                                                       \r\n\ncase authority, see,  e.g., Grendel's Den,  supra, in failing  to\r                                                           \r\n\nconduct interim monitoring, based on their ill-advised assumption\r\n\nthat  the PSC's  ultimate burden  of proving  its entitlement  to\r\n\nreimbursement  relieved appellants of their independent responsi-\r                                                                           \r\n\nbility to collaborate  with the district court  and other parties\r                \r\n\nto develop and monitor appropriate cost-containment procedures.  \r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          Appellants were well aware, throughout the proceedings,\r\n\nthat the PSC had  not been directed to submit its voluminous cost\r\n\ndocumentation  to the  district court  together with  the interim\r\n\nsummaries.   Thus,  appellants knowingly  failed to  assume their\r\n\nrightful responsibilities for safeguarding their own interests by\r\n\nmonitoring interim  PSC-cost submissions  as  required to  ensure\r\n\nthat the  evolving documentation  practices actually utilized  by\r\n\nthe PSC were equal to the task and, if  not, to broach the matter\r\n\nfirst with the  PSC and, as need  be, with the court,  in time to\r\n\npermit   effective  preventive  and  corrective  measures  before\r\n\nmatters became completely unmanageable.13\r\n\n          We underscore  the central administrative  necessity in\r\n\nmass-tort MDLs, that  the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs attempt very\r\n\nearly on to work out mutually acceptable procedures for document-\r\n\ning and monitoring costs for which reimbursement is to be sought.\r\n\nNo less importantly,  both at  the outset  and thereafter,  where\r\n\ncooperative efforts fail  to produce  agreement, or  cost-benefit\r\n\nconsiderations   independently  warrant,   judicial  intervention\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13For example, in 1993  Torres and Sterling were at  logger-\r\nheads  over  whether  the  PSC  cost-documentation  records  were\r\nadequate.    Torres considered  them an  incomprehensible muddle.\r\nSterling countered that the  records were thoroughly organized at\r\nthe outset  but  that Torres  had  \"disorganized\" them  with  his\r\nhaphazard  rummaging.    The   district  court,  after  crediting\r\nSterling's account, attempted to resolve the impasse by directing\r\nTorres  and Sterling to  meet and consult  at the JDD.   By then,\r                                                   \r\nhowever, the  damage had  been  done and  the resultant  adminis-\r\ntrative \"chaos\" alluded to by the district court made it impossi-\r\nble even  to ascertain  whether the  PSC had  maintained suitable\r\ndocumentation for the  vast majority  of its cost  claims.   With\r\nprudent  ongoing monitoring  by  appellants from  the outset,  of\r\ncourse, the  administrative confusion need never  have gotten out\r\nof hand.\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nshould be promptly sought before matters worsen or become irreme-\r\n\ndiable.   See Jaquette v. Black Hawk  County, Iowa, 710 F.2d 455,\r                                                            \r\n\n463 (8th Cir. 1983) (\"[T]he key to avoiding excessive costs . . .\r\n\nis early and stringent judicial management of the case.\") (empha-\r                  \r\n\nsis added).\r\n\n          The  individual  plaintiffs and  IRPAs  have enough  at\r\n\nstake in these matters  to prompt their early intervention.   For\r\n\nexample,  if  overly  particularized  PSC-cost  documentation  on\r\n\n\"reasonableness\" and \"necessariness\" were  to be required without\r\n\nregard  to sound  cost-benefit  considerations,  its  unnecessary\r\n\nprocedural  costs ultimately  would  be borne  by the  individual\r\n\nplaintiffs.  See Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 572 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\n354, 383 (D.D.C. 1983) (\"Indeed, the amount of time that would be\r\n\nrequired to document each item of expense in the detail apparent-\r\n\nly suggested  by Defendant would be  prohibitive; the compensable\r\n\ntime required to  generate the detail  would exceed the  expenses\r\n\nclaimed.\").  Conversely, if appellants were to designate an IRPA,\r\n\nor  retain an  independent auditor,  to monitor  PSC-cost submis-\r\n\nsions,  the  expense  conceivably  could  exceed  whatever direct\r\n\nsavings might be derived through any resulting cost-reimbursement\r\n\ndisallowances.    Thus, as  the  ultimate  payors the  individual\r\n\nplaintiffs  and IRPAs have enough  at stake to warrant reasonable\r\n\nefforts at ensuring that adequate documentation and cost-monitor-\r\n\ning procedures also make cost-benefit sense.  \r\n\n          An adequate cost containment and monitoring system in a\r\n\nmass-tort  litigation  cannot  be  economically  and  efficiently\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\ndesigned  and  implemented from  the  outset absent  a  series of\r\n\ntradeoffs among the PSC,  IRPAs, and plaintiffs, all of  whom are\r\n\nunder  a  mutual obligation  to engage  in  an earnest  effort to\r\n\nresolve their  differences early  on.   These appellants, on  the\r\n\nother hand, elected  to acquiesce  for four years  in the  flawed\r\n\ncost containment  and monitoring  system first  set  in place  in\r\n\n1987, awaiting an end  to the principal litigation  before coming\r\n\nforward  with  their objections.   See  Reilly,  863 F.2d  at 160\r                                                        \r\n\n(litigants share mutual burden to collaborate with district court\r\n\nin fashioning workable litigation procedures).  \r\n\n          4.   Evidence of PSC Overreaching\r                    4.   Evidence of PSC Overreaching\r                                                     \r\n\n          Next  we consider  whether the  PSC-cost reimbursements\r\n\nshould be  subjected to  the across-the-board  cuts (25% to  33%)\r\n\nurged  by appellants  notwithstanding their  own failure  to take\r\n\nappropriate preventive  or corrective action.  In our view, their\r\n\ncrude cuts ought  not be  imposed in  these circumstances  absent\r\n\nevidence that the PSC acted in bad faith or took unfair advantage\r\n\nof the procedural deficiencies.   Not only have we found  no such\r\n\nevidence, but we can discern no appreciable PSC overreaching from\r\n\nthe record.\r\n\n          First,  there  should  be  no  ready  presumption  that\r\n\ncounsel appointed to  the PSC  expended its funds  in bad  faith;\r\n\nthat is,  with intent  to inflate PSC-cost  reimbursement submis-\r\n\nsions.   This  is especially  true in the  present circumstances,\r\n\nsince the PSC members repeatedly attested that their cost submis-\r\n\nsions were bona fide.   See, e.g., Alabama Power  Co. v. Gorsuch,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                33\r\r\n\n672  F.2d 1,  5 (D.C.

Cf. In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d at 223\r                                                          \r\n\n(noting  that lead  counsel owes  fiduciary duty to  class plain-\r\n\ntiffs);  see also  MCL    20.22 (counseling  court to  remind PSC\r                                \r\n\nmembers of \"their  responsibility to the court and  their obliga-\r\n\ntion to act  fairly, efficiently, and economically  in the inter-\r\n\nests  of all parties and their counsel\").  Furthermore, these PSC\r\n\nmembers simultaneously  were acting in their  respective roles as\r\n\nIRPAs, with  direct professional responsibility  for representing\r\n\napproximately  seventy percent of the  plaintiff class.  In these\r\n\ncircumstances especially, given their professional obligations to\r\n\nthe  court  and  their individual  clients,  we  would  be highly\r\n\nreluctant to  suppose that the PSC  members promoted overreaching\r\n\nby the PSC.\r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\n          Second, the PSC \"auditing\"  which did occur, whether or\r\n\nnot adequate,  cannot be dismissed  as perfunctory, since  it did\r\n\nscreen out some significant cost excesses.  For  example, Adamina\r\n\nSoto attested  that she contacted PSC  members concerning problem\r\n\nexpenses and followed up with requests for further documentation.\r\n\nIndeed,  the Raben  and Soto  audits resulted in  cost reductions\r\n\nexceeding  $346,000.   Although appellants  object that  some PSC\r\n\nauditing was conducted at  random, particularly that performed by\r\n\nKevane and Soto,  as it did  not purport to  verify each  expense\r\n\nclaim,  the  reviews conducted  by  Raben and  Sterling  were not\r\n\nrandom.   Finally, even  the random  \"audit\" procedures  were not\r\n\nconducted under PSC control.  Thus, we are not persuaded that the\r                                     \r\n\nrandom review procedures were flawed to the point that they could\r\n\nprovide no effective deterrent to substantial PSC overreaching. \r\n\n          Third, appellants emphasize that  Kevane and Raben were\r\n\naccountants, with little personal knowledge regarding the precise\r\n\nlitigation tasks  assigned to  the PSC.   Both were  professional\r\n\nCPAs, however,  and Raben in  particular was no  neophyte, having\r\n\nbeen responsible  for comparable cost oversight in  the MGM case,\r\n\nitself a hotel fire  litigation.  It does not  seem unreasonable,\r\n\ntherefore, absent evidence to the contrary, to expect  that Raben\r\n\nwas reasonably  qualified for  the professional task  assigned to\r\n\nhim.\r\n\n          Fourth,  as there  is  no indication  in the  appellate\r\n\nrecord that the  PSC ever  attempted to  prevent appellants  from\r\n\nexamining its  underlying cost  documentation prior to  1991, the\r\n\n                                35\r\r\n\nreasonably   foreseeable  prospect  that  appellants  might  well\r\n\n(indeed should)  have requested interim access  to the documenta-\r\n\ntion presumably had some  deterrent effect upon PSC overreaching.\r\n\nNot only did the  pretrial orders not preclude ongoing  access by\r\n\nappellants  to the PSC  documentation, but there  would appear to\r\n\nhave  been no  conflict of  interest or \"work  product\" privilege\r\n\nwhich  would have  prevented the  individual plaintiffs  or IRPAs\r\n\nfrom  inspecting the  PSC documentation  at  any time  during the\r\n\nlitigation.  See supra note 12.14  \r                                \r\n\n          Finally,  and  most  importantly,  the  district  court\r\n\ninitially proposed  to limit  PSC attorney  fees and  costs, com-\r                                                                           \r\n\nbined, to ten percent of the eventual common fund, thus providing\r               \r\n\nPSC members a substantial  inducement to exert reasonable efforts\r\n\nto minimize PSC costs with a view to  preserving a larger balance\r\n\nwith which to fund their attorney fees as PSC members.  See In re\r                                                                           \r\n\nWells Fargo Sec.  Litig., 157  F.R.D. 467, 470  (N.D.

Appellants respond that the ten percent ceiling did\r\n\nnot  deter inflated  costs, however,  because the  district court\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14Appellants point out that the PSC refused Torres access to\r\ncertain \"derivative\" documents after 1991, such as the Raben work\r\npapers.   Nevertheless, Torres  had access  to the  raw materials\r\nexamined by Raben (viz., actual PSC receipts and other documenta-\r                                 \r\ntion).   Moreover,  appellants were  not necessarily  entitled to\r\nfull-fledged discovery, at  least absent district court  authori-\r\nzation.   See  Thirteen  Appeals, 56  F.3d  at 303  (noting  that\r                                          \r\nnormally  it is  sufficient, for  purposes of  a fee  and expense\r\napplication, to order exchange of the \"raw materials\" or \"all the\r\ndata  reasonably necessary to formulate . . . objections\") (cita-\r\ntion omitted).  \r\n\n                                36\r\r\n\nannounced in January  1991 that  it would not  be enforced  after\r\n\nall.

Although  the  procedural deficiencies  dis-\r\n\ncussed  above may have  led to  some unnecessary  or unreasonable\r\n\nexpenditures,  appellants clearly  failed to  alert the  district\r\n\ncourt  until  it had  become impracticable  either to  prevent or\r\n\nassess,  let alone correct them in any reliable or cost-effective\r\n\nmanner.\r\n\nB.

The district\r\n\ncourt  determined that Foulds, who had worked for twenty years as\r\n\nan insurance claims manager before attending law school, had been\r\n\nhired  not  as an  attorney, but  primarily  to consult  with PSC\r\n\nattorneys regarding the nuts-and-bolts interpretation  of various\r\n\ninsurance policies.  The PSC concedes that Foulds handled certain\r\n\nlitigation tasks normally  performed by attorneys  (e.g., deposi-\r                                                                  \r\n\ntions  in  the liability  case  against  defendant Alexander  and\r\n\nAlexander), but  nonetheless insists that this was the most cost-\r\n\nefficient  approach, especially  given  Foulds'  intimate  under-\r\n\nstanding  of the  pertinent insurance  policies.17   Although the\r\n\nparties cite no authority  regarding the appropriate criteria for\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16Appellants likewise  attack the district  court determina-\r\ntion that  they waived  objection to  any PSC-office  costs other\r\nthan the  Foulds fee.   We need not  resolve the issue,  however,\r\nsince appellants'  objections to these  cost-reimbursement claims\r\nare based  on their contention  that the  PSC failed to  meet its\r\nburden of proof  and verification under Grendel's Den, a position\r                                                               \r\nwhich we have already rejected.  See supra Section II.A; see also\r                                                                           \r\nIn  re Agent  Orange Prod.  Liab.  Litig., 611  F. Supp.  at 1331\r                                                   \r\n(allowing \"[a]ll reasonable, verifiable expenses for running\" the\r\nPMC's centralized office). \r\n\n     17The PSC also  protests that  it came as  no \"surprise\"  to\r\nappellants  that Foulds  was retained.   But  this is  beside the\r\npoint.   Appellants simply maintain that they were never informed\r\nthat Foulds would be used as an \"attorney.\" \r\n\n                                38\r\r\n\ndetermining whether one in  Foulds' position should be considered\r\n\nan insurance expert  or an  attorney, we are  persuaded that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  ruling  constituted  error in  these  particular\r\n\ncircumstances.18\r\n\n          As  a general rule,  a PSC  member who  serves simulta-\r\n\nneously as  an IRPA in  a mass-tort  MDL is  entitled to  recover\r\n\nseparate compensation from the common fund for the legal services\r\n\nperformed in  each distinctive  role.  See  Thirteen Appeals,  56\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  at 300  n.2.  The  prospect of  more lucrative  returns for\r\n\ntheir services  prompted many IRPAs to compete  for these coveted\r\n\nPSC appointments  in 1987, respectively urging  upon the district\r\n\ncourt their particular experience and expertise in previous mass-\r\n\ntort suits. See Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 605 (\"[A]ppointment\r                                          \r\n\nto the PSC was much coveted . . . .\").\r\n\n          On the other hand, all the unsuccessful IRPA candidates\r\n\nfor PSC appointment must nevertheless contribute toward defraying\r\n\nPSC attorney  fees/costs, since the district  court's decision to\r\n\nestablish a PSC diverts a significant portion of their respective\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     18The applicable standard of review is not clear and we find\r\nno controlling precedent.   Nonetheless, the basic  determination\r\nas to  what work Foulds  performed would  call for  fact-finding,\r\nreviewable only  for clear error.  See Damon v. Sun Co., Inc., 87\r                                                                       \r\nF.3d  1467,  1483 (1st  Cir.1996).   In  this case,  however, the\r\nparties agree  as to what  work Foulds performed.   On  the other\r\nhand, the determination as to which fund    attorney fee or  cost\r\n    should bear  the expense  incurred for  a particular  type of\r\nservice, would appear to be a legal question, or a mixed question\r\nin  which  the  legal  component predominates,  either  of  which\r\nnormally would be reviewed de novo.  As we are persuaded that the\r                                            \r\ndistrict  court  ruling  cannot  withstand  review  under  either\r\nstandard,  we need  not determine  the  precise standard  at this\r                                                                    \r\njuncture.\r\n\n                                39\r\r\n\ncontingent fees toward  funding the PSC.

According-\r\n\nly, due  regard should be  had for these  nonmember-IRPAs' dimin-\r\n\nished fee  expectations, at least to the extent that \"the judge .\r\n\n. . attempt to  avoid any perception of favoritism\"  in mediating\r\n\ndisputes between PSC  members and nonmember IRPAs.   See Nineteen\r                                                                           \r\n\nAppeals, 982 F.2d at 605.  \r                 \r\n\n          At the time the nine original PSC members were appoint-\r\n\ned,  from among  forty applicants,  the district  court expressly\r\n\ndirected, inter alia, that the PSC \"shall neither be enlarged nor\r                              \r\n\ndiminished in size or membership without Court approval,\" Pretri-\r\n\nal Order  No. 127,  at 29,  that  the PSC  \"conduct all  pretrial\r\n\nliability  and damage discovery,\" id.  at 30, and  that \"only two\r                                               \r\n\nmembers  of  the PSC,  or counsel  duly  authorized by  them, may\r\n\nquestion [] deponent[s],\"  id.  Given the  acknowledgement by the\r                                        \r\n\nappellees  that Foulds,  on occasion,  served as  a de  facto PSC\r                                                                       \r\n\nattorney without prior  district court authorization,  his reten-\r\n\ntion, to that extent at least, directly contravened  the explicit\r\n\npretrial orders prohibiting any de facto expansion of PSC member-\r                                                  \r\n\nship.   Thus,  the district  court's subsequent  authorization of\r\n\nreimbursement  to  the PSC  for the  Foulds  fee as  an insurance\r\n\nexpert  cannot cure the  PSC's unauthorized, unilateral expansion\r\n\nof its attorney ranks, without inviting similar circumventions in\r\n\n                                40\r\r\n\nthe future.\r\n\n          We therefore  reject the  suggestion that we  remand to\r\n\npermit the  district  court  to  apportion the  $913,503  fee  as\r\n\nbetween the \"insurance expert\" and \"attorney\"  services performed\r\n\nby Foulds.  We wish  to make clear, however, that the PSC was not\r\n\nprecluded from retaining Foulds based on a reasonable belief that\r\n\nhe  was the  best  qualified insurance  expert available,  simply\r\n\nbecause he happened to be an attorney.  Nonetheless, once the PSC\r\n\ndid retain Foulds, it owed nonmember IRPAs a duty of fair dealing\r\n\nto  ensure that  he  undertook no  unauthorized \"attorney\"  tasks\r\n\nwhich might  have been  performed by some  disappointed candidate\r\n\nfor PSC membership. \r\n\n     2.   PSC-Member Costs \r               2.   PSC-Member Costs \r                                    \r\n\n          a)   Photocopying Costs\r                    a)   Photocopying Costs\r                                           \r\n\n          Appellants  oppose the  twenty-five-cent  page rate  at\r\n\nwhich the  district court permitted reimbursement  to PSC members\r\n\nfor  photocopying; in all,  amounting to $184,000.   The district\r\n\ncourt explained that  it \"fail[ed] to see  the difference between\r\n\nPSC  members and any IRPA  charging a client  a reasonable amount\r\n\nfor  copying charges.\"  Order No.  510-A, at  8 (Nov.  24, 1993).\r\n\nAppellants cite  numerous decisions  which hold the  twenty-five-\r\n\ncent  rate unreasonable, and argue that the PSC provided no proof\r\n\nthat it actually incurred that cost to copy each page. \r\n\n          The  PSC  members offer  three  justifications  for the\r\n\napproved  rate.   First, most  photocopying was  done at  the PSC\r\n\noffice and no  reimbursement claim was made.   Second, appellants\r\n\n                                41\r\r\n\nknew early on in the litigation that the PSC had  voted to permit\r\n\nits members to claim reimbursement at twenty-five cents per page.\r\n\nThird, the  twenty-five-cent rate, standard in  many law offices,\r\n\nhad  been allowed in the MGM case.  Although the district court's\r\n\ncost-allowance  rulings  are  entitled  to   deferential  review,\r\n\nGrendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950, we are persuaded  that its ruling\r                       \r\n\ndoes not withstand scrutiny.\r\n\n          Unlike  the PSC, the IRPAs are free to assess their own\r\n\nclients  for photocopying  in  accordance  with their  respective\r\n\ncontingent fee agreements and any  applicable ethical-code provi-\r\n\nsion.  On  the other hand, the PSC is a  creature of the district\r\n\ncourt, whose mission is to promote more efficient litigation, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nMCL     20.223 (\"Designated  counsel  should  render services  as\r             \r\n\neconomically  as  possible  under  the circumstances.\").    In  a\r\n\n\"common  benefit\" case  of this  sort, therefore, the  court must\r\n\nensure  that PSC members recover only their actual costs, with no\r                                                            \r\n\n\"profit\" margin.

Time was  of the essence and because of\r\n\nthis,  the activity  was feverish,  leaving scant  opportunity to\r\n\nfine-tune  the  preparation  and  justification  of  expenses.\").\r\n\nConsequently, the appropriate inquiry  here is not simply whether\r\n\nan individual attorney  might have booked a room at  a lower rate\r\n\nduring  a  given time  period.   Rather,  the PSC  frequently was\r\n\nrequired to  coordinate lodging for many  individuals and without\r\n\nmuch advance notice.\r\n\n          Thus, the appropriate inquiry  must be whether the rate\r\n\nwas reasonable in  relation to the legitimate needs occasioned by\r\n\nthe litigation tasks at hand.  Against  this backdrop, appellants\r\n\nhave failed to demonstrate  an abuse of discretion.   None of the\r\n\nhotel rates strike  us as  facially abusive  in these  particular\r\n\ncircumstances.  Cf. Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 957 (finding abuse\r                                           \r\n\nof  discretion  where hotel  bill  of  $917 could  be  considered\r\n\n\"unreasonable on its face\"). \r\n\n          Second,  as  with other  PSC-costs,  see supra  Section\r                                                                  \r\n\nII.A, appellants  settled, from  the outset and  without protest,\r\n\nfor  amorphous general  standards,  such as  \"moderate\" and  non-\r\n\n\"deluxe\" hotel  accommodations, whereas  they were free  from the\r\n\nstart  to propose  the  $116  per-diem  rate  they  now  suggest.\r                           \r\n\nFurthermore, there has been no showing that the hotel charges for\r\n\nwhich  reimbursement  was  sought  were either  \"deluxe\"  or  not\r\n\n                                46\r\r\n\n\"moderate\"  in   the  circumstances.21    Finally,   as  concerns\r                                             \r\n\nappellants'  contention that  PSC members  did not  keep adequate\r\n\nsupporting  documentation  relating  to the  \"necessariness\"  and\r\n\n\"reasonableness\" of  each hotel expense, their  position is fore-\r\n\nclosed.

Nonetheless,  despite\r\n\nreasonable notice  of the  obvious peril  to their own  financial\r\n\ninterests, and their clear obligation to forfend  against it from\r\n\nthe outset, appellants did not turn serious attention to the PSC-\r\n\ncost  reimbursement regime  deficiencies until  the Gordian  knot\r\n\ncould no longer  be undone.   Consequently, we  determine, as  we\r\n\nmust, that the requested  relief has been rendered impracticable,\r\n\nthrough appellants' inaction, to  the extent that further redress\r\n\nat this point would extend this satellite litigation for no cost-\r\n\neffective purpose.

After thousands of individual plaintiffs filed hundreds of claims against a host of defendants in many different jurisdictions (\"multidistrict litigation\" or \"MDL\"), the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated all cases for trial in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (Acosta, J.), see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1407.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As most plaintiffs had already retained their own counsel (hereinafter:  \"individually retained plaintiffs' attorneys\" or \"IRPAs\"), the district court recognized the need to coordinate their representation through the PSC. Eventually comprised of eleven attorneys with expertise in mass-tort litigation, the PSC served as plaintiffs' lead counsel, responsible for coordinating discovery, settlement negotiations and, if necessary, trial matters common to all plaintiffs.  The eleven PSC members nonetheless retained their respective roles as IRPAs, directly representing approximately seventy percent of the individual plaintiffs.  The IRPAs, on the other hand, were to focus their efforts on litigation tasks idiosyncratic to their respective clients' cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Pretrial Case-Management Orders</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In two pretrial orders, the district court directed plaintiffs, who would derive common benefit from PSC services, to pay PSC attorney fees and costs from the common fund ultimately recovered in the litigation.  See Pretrial Order No. 127 (Dec. 2, 1988);  Pretrial Order No. 2 (Mar. 23, 1987).  At the time, the district court tentatively proposed to limit the PSC to a combined attorney fee/cost award not exceeding ten percent of the eventual common fund, see Pretrial Order No. 127, at 48, which ultimately approximated $220 million.  The district court established the following cost-submission and reimbursement guidelines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ssessments<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> will be deposited in a fund that will defray the reasonable expenses of the PSC in the performance of its duties.  The PSC shall maintain a careful statement of account on the fund, that is, prepare and keep accurate, contemporaneous, detailed records of the receipts, deposits, accumulated interest and subsequent disbursements.  The fund shall be used only to make disbursements (whether directly to creditors or to reimburse the PSC) for expenses incurred for the benefit of all plaintiffs.  Any disbursements made for the benefit of a particular plaintiff represented by a member of the PSC shall be the sole responsibility of the plaintiff in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC shall be authorized to periodically expend monies from the fund as needed to defray the necessary \"hard\" costs of its work, such as office overhead, staff salaries, warehousing, duplication, expert fees, deposition costs, etc.  The members of the PSC shall be reimbursed from time to time for the \"hard\" expenses of the PSC-related work incurred by them or their employees/appointees, provided they submit to the PSC careful, contemporaneous, detailed records of their expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Soft\" costs such as travel, meals, transportation, lodging, etc., shall be borne by the individual PSC members who shall be reimbursed at the conclusion of this litigation or as otherwise provided by the Court.  All persons interested in reimbursement, particularly members of the PSC, must keep careful, contemporaneous, detailed records of individual expenses.  Only reasonable and necessary expenses will be reimbursed.  For example, airplane/transportation expenses should be at economical rates, not first class;  and hotel accommodations/meals should be moderate, not deluxe, etc.  Reimbursements are conditioned, of course, on the proper verification of expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC and/or its members, as pertinent, shall submit to the Court for its approval a statement for reimbursable \"hard\" expenses and another for \"soft\" expenses as well as statements of account beginning on August 1, 1987 and every sixty (60) days thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 44-45 (emphasis added).

The PSC-Office Cost Regimen</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although individual PSC members performed some PSC litigation tasks through their individual law firms, the district court also authorized the PSC to recover its direct costs in establishing, staffing, and operating a centralized PSC Office (hereinafter:  \"PSC-Office costs\").  Further, the PSC bylaws required prior approval, by five PSC members, for any PSC-office cost reimbursement above $500, as well as payment of such costs by PSC check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1987, certified public accountant (\"CPA\") Donald Kevane was retained to review and submit to the PSC monthly reports summarizing PSC-office costs.  In February 1991, the PSC submitted its final report to the district court, claiming $6,956,368 in PSC-office costs attributable to Phases I and II of the litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The PSC-Member Cost Regimen</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the district court authorized reimbursements of costs incurred by the eleven individual PSC members in perform ing PSC litigation tasks (hereinafter:  \"PSC-member costs\"), as distinguished from their respective duties as IRPAs.  Every sixty days, the PSC submitted, under seal and \"for [court] approval,\" a consolidated report summarizing each PSC member's individual \"hard\" and \"soft\" costs.  (Emphasis added.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1989, the district court appointed C. Terry Raben, a CPA, to \"review the [PSC-member cost] information supplied to ... date to ensure it is complete, accurate and contemporaneous [,] as well as to organize the reports before the sheer number of them unduly complicates any reasonable accounting procedures.\"   Order No. 222 (docket No. 12671, entered under seal Sept. 15, 1989).  Raben previously had performed comparable cost oversight responsibilities in another mass-tort litigation.  See generally In re MGM Grand Hotel Fire Litig., 660 F.Supp. 522 (D.Nev.1987) (or \"the MGM case\").  The district court directed Raben to scrutinize the PSC files for compliance with the criteria in Pretrial Order No. 127, supra, to obtain any additional documentation deemed appropriate, and submit findings to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1990, almost four years into these proceedings, the PSC became concerned that outside accountants like Raben, who were not attorneys and lacked intimate knowledge of the PSC's litigation responsibilities and inner workings, might not adequately appreciate whether PSC-member cost claims met the compliance criteria prescribed in Pretrial Order No. 127.  Accordingly, the PSC directed Monita Sterling, a paralegal for a PSC-member law firm with prior exposure to PSC litigation tasks, to review each PSC-member cost claim independently to determine whether the expenditures were \"necessary\" to legitimate PSC litigation tasks, \"reasonable\" in amount, and not duplicative of other PSC-member cost claims.  Sterling thereafter reviewed \"every receipt or other piece of documentation submitted,\" noting each questionable claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Sterling submitted her reports and supporting documentation to Adamina Soto, a CPA who reviewed the Sterling report and randomly checked its underlying documentation, then contacted PSC members about problem items and requested further documentation.  Soto eventually disallowed $207,475 in costs and submitted her reports to Raben.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raben submitted three final reports to the district court, covering PSC-member cost claims through January 31, 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  He disallowed an additional $138,569 of the total $3,847,233 in claimed expenditures.  The district court approved each Raben report as submitted.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 768 F.Supp. 912, 934 (D.P.R.1991), vacated on other grounds, 982 F.2d 603 (1st Cir.1992).  PSC members ultimately recovered $3,708,665.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Attorney Fee/Cost Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1991, the PSC submitted its final application for cost reimbursements, attaching the report previously prepared by Donald Kevane and requesting $6,956,368 in PSC-office costs attributable to Phases I and II.  See supra at p. 224.  Three months later, the district court abandoned its earlier tentative proposal, see supra at p. 223, to limit the PSC's combined attorney fee/cost award to ten percent of the common fund.  Thereafter, the court approved the entire PSC fee/cost application.  See Order No. 346 (June 21, 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we vacated the fee/cost award for failure to afford the plaintiffs and IRPAs a meaningful opportunity to challenge the PSC attorney fee application on the merits.  Accordingly, we remanded for further proceedings.  See In re Nineteen Appeals Arising Out of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 982 F.2d 603, 608, 615-16 (1st Cir.1992) [hereinafter \"Nineteen Appeals \"].  Following the remand and a second appeal, the PSC and IRPAs were directed to share the available attorney-fee fund ($68 million) equally.  See In re Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 56 F.3d 295, 312 (1st Cir.1995) [hereinafter \"Thirteen Appeals \"].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the remand in Nineteen Appeals, the district court separately reconsidered the PSC application for costs, fixing March 12, 1993, as the deadline for the plaintiffs and IRPAs to submit \"specific/detailed written objections\" to all PSC-cost submissions through January 31, 1991.  See Order No. 478 (Jan. 15, 1993).  The court further directed three categories of documents to be filed in the joint document depository (\"JDD\") for review by the plaintiffs and IRPAs:  (1) the three Raben reports analyzing PSC-member costs;  (2) the Kevane monthly reports summarizing PSC-office costs;  and (3) the PSC-member cost documentation.  See Order No. 479 (Jan. 20, 1993).  Although the court rejected a request by the plaintiffs and IRPAs for additional formal discovery, see Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 303 (noting that mandated exchanges of documentation, rather than \"searching discovery,\" are appropriate where only attorney fees and expenses are at issue), it ordered both Raben and Kevane to submit descriptions of their auditing procedures and directed Kevane to produce his working papers, correspondence, and documentation.  See Order No. 485 (Mar. 3, 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the extended deadline for further objections to costs, the plaintiffs and IRPAs submitted a report and affidavit by William Torres, a CPA newly retained to audit the PSC-cost submissions, attesting that he had requested the PSC to \"provide [him] with access to all of the records documenting the costs incurred in this case, ... including but not limited to, original bills or statements kept by the PSC staff or any PSC member, and any summaries or supporting documentation (including charge account bills) of the same.\"   Even though necessary to a \"meaningful analysis,\" Torres attested, the PSC failed to provide the requested documents, including the Raben working papers;  and, until March 10, 1993, the \"critical\" Kevane working papers were not made available;  many documents made available were unreadable;  the PSC did not allow access to the PSC-member-cost-reimbursement policies or the PSC-policy meeting minutes relating to cost reimbursements;  and, finally, the PSC refused to permit him to depose Raben, Kevane or any PSC member regarding questionable cost submissions or documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 24, 1993, the district court overruled most major objections to the PSC-cost submissions.  See Order No. 510-A.  For example, as regards hotel charges, the court rejected the contention that the maximum per diem rate should be $116, the rate considered \"reasonable\" by the IRS for tax-deduction purposes.  It ruled that reasonableness must be assessed case by case, to reflect such variants as locale, seasonal fluctuations, room availability, the number of persons sharing a room, accessibility of equipment and facilities essential to the litigation task at hand, as well as other exigencies.  Id. at 7-8.   The court ruled that, like the IRPAs, PSC members were entitled to \"reasonable\" reimbursement for photocopying costs and had not \"profit[ed]\" from the authorized twenty-five-cents-per-copy rate.  Id. at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further noted, inter alia, that the objections the plaintiffs and IRPAs made to the PSC-cost submissions were so voluminous and entwined with issues relating to attorney fees that it was difficult to determine the particular costs to which the plaintiffs and IRPAs were objecting.  It directed the plaintiffs and IRPAs to \"sort out this chaos,\" id. at 12;  Torres and Sterling to meet and consult at the JDD not later than December 10;  and the plaintiffs and IRPAs to file particularized objections to the remaining expenditures not later than January 12, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing in December 1993, to determine whether to allow the PSC to recover its final cost installment for retaining Thomas Foulds, Esquire, as an expert.  The PSC maintained that Foulds, who had worked for many years in the insurance industry before attending law school, had been retained as an insurance expert, to interpret insurance contracts, rather than as an attorney, and that his fee therefore was fully reimbursable as a PSC-office cost.  See Pretrial Order No. 127, at 48.  Although the plaintiffs and IRPAs objected that Foulds had performed many litigation tasks, including legal research and conducting depositions, normally performed by attorneys and not by insurance experts, the district court allowed the Foulds fee reimbursement as a PSC-office cost after concluding that Foulds \"was not contracted merely as an attorney\" but primarily for his insurance expertise.  See Order No. 520, at 3-4 (Jan. 28, 1994).  The final installment brought the total Foulds-fee reimbursement to $913,503.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs and IRPAs filed their final objections to PSC-member costs in January 1995, essentially reiterating that the cost review and verification process had proven hopelessly inadequate to document either the necessariness or reasonableness of the claimed costs, and that it was unfair to require them to sort through the chaotic documentation created by the PSC and its members.  Alternatively, the plaintiffs and IRPAs asserted specific objections to a sampling of allegedly inappropriate PSC-member costs (e.g., phone calls, tips, charges for \"drinks,\" etc.) and urged an across-the-board reduction of all PSC-cost claims by a fixed percentage (25-33%) to reflect the sampling-based estimate of alleged PSC overcharges.  Finally, the plaintiffs and IRPAs complained that Monita Sterling had refused to allow CPA Torres to inspect the documentation pertaining to PSC-office costs at the joint meeting required by Order No. 510-A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court once again overruled the bulk of the objections.  See Order No. 584 (Aug. 29, 1995).  First, it found the PSC review process adequate, noting that it had resulted in disallowance of several questionable expenditures based on the independent review conducted by Raben, Sterling, and Soto under objective criteria.  Second, except for a handful of de minimis mischarges totaling less than $2,000, the court rejected the specific challenges asserted by the plaintiffs and IRPAs based on their samplings of alleged overcharges.  Finally, the court ruled that its Pretrial Order No. 510-A, see supra at pp. 225-26, had envisioned only that Sterling and Torres inspect documentation relating to \"outstanding issues\"--those involving PSC-member costs, not PSC-office-cost issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the plaintiffs and IRPAs [hereinafter:  \"appellants\"] appealed from the various orders approving PSC-cost reimbursements (Order Nos. 478, 485, 510-A, 520, and 584).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The PSC-Cost Reimbursement Regimen</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Appellants' Position</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants aim their main broadside at the regimen established for documenting, monitoring, submitting, and approving PSC costs.  Although the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs in mass-tort MDLs share the same litigation goal (viz., an optimum common fund), internecine differences as to subsidiary matters--particularly the appropriate allocations from the common fund for their respective attorney fees and costs--are commonplace.  The greater the attorney fees and costs awarded the PSC, of course, the less available for the IRPAs and their individual clients.  Appellants maintain that these conflicting self-interests necessarily entail heightened oversight responsibilities on the part of the district courts in mass-tort MDLs to ensure stringent monitoring and review procedures adequate to protect the individual plaintiffs and IRPAs from overreaching by the PSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants fault the district court for adopting reimbursement procedures which delegate important judicial oversight responsibilities to auditors appointed either by the court or the PSC. It is the PSC, they say, rather than the appellants, which must bear the ultimate burden in establishing entitlement to reimbursement, see Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 956-57 (1st Cir.1984), which in turn necessitates three distinct showings by the PSC for each claimed reimbursement;  viz., that it document:  (i) the actual expenditure;  (ii) its necessariness to the assigned litigation task;  and (iii) its reasonableness, see, e.g., In re Agent Orange Prod.  Liab. Litig., 611 F.Supp. 1296, 1314 (E.D.N.Y.1985) (\"Expenses must be both reasonable in amount and reasonably related to the interests of the class.\"), aff'd in pertinent part, 818 F.2d 226, 238 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the Raben and Kevane \"audits\" did not inform the district court adequately regarding potential PSC excesses.  Raben and Kevane were accountants, neither trained in the law nor familiar with the litigation tasks assigned to the PSC. At best they could verify that the PSC and its members actually made the claimed expenditures, but in many instances PSC members maintained no detailed records relating to their reasonableness and necessariness.  Moreover, appellants argue, though Monita Sterling and others similarly designated by the PSC undoubtedly were more familiar than Kevane and Raben with the nature and demands of the PSC's litigation responsibilities, their assessments of claimed expenses were inherently biased because their employment with the PSC gave them a vested interest in justifying PSC reimbursements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the district court erred in suggesting that it was incumbent upon them, rather than the PSC, to demonstrate that particular PSC expenditures were not reimbursable.  See, e.g., Order No. 520, at 1 n. 1 (\"Parties questioning payments previously approved carried the burden of setting them aside whereas the PSC/Mr.  Foulds were required to justify the pending request.\").  The court based its ruling on the ground that most PSC cost-reimbursement claims during earlier stages in the litigation had been approved, without opposition, as submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants complain not only that the district court thereby subverted the well-established burden of proof incumbent upon the PSC, see Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 956-57, but foisted on the plaintiffs and IRPAs the impracticable task of rummaging through mountainous PSC documentation to determine--within very restrictive court-ordered deadlines--which PSC-cost submissions were either inadequately documented or otherwise nonreimbursable.  Appellants therefore urge that all otherwise allowable PSC-cost reimbursements be reduced by a fixed (if somewhat arbitrary) discount (25% to 33%), see, e.g., Mokover v. Neco Enters., Inc., 785 F.Supp. 1083, 1093-94 (D.R.I.1992), to reflect the likely extent to which the PSC inferably overcharged due to its failure to maintain \"appropriate\" documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District court orders awarding costs normally are reviewed only for abuse of discretion.  See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950;  see also Anderson v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 80 F.3d 1500, 1507 (10th Cir.1996);  National Info.  Servs., Inc. v. TRW, Inc., 51 F.3d 1470, 1471 (9th Cir.1995);  Estate of Borst v. O'Brien, 979 F.2d 511, 517 (7th Cir.1992) (\"The award of costs 'is the type of discretionary ruling to which appellate courts should give \"virtually complete\" deference.' \")  (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. \"Burdens of Proof \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC and its members undoubtedly must establish their entitlement to reimbursement.  See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 956-57.   Furthermore, there can be no quarrel that the respective self-interests of the plaintiffs, the IRPAs, and the PSC in mass-tort MDLs often diverge, nor for that matter that the cost-containment regimen initiated at the outset in this case (without benefit of hindsight) ultimately proved inadequate and even chaotic, see supra Section I.D, as the district court itself acknowledged several years later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nevertheless part company with appellants' contention that the belatedly perceived shortcomings in the adopted safeguards against PSC overreaching proximately caused the unsatisfactory regimen in this case, or that the PSC and its members must therefore be required to bear the entire brunt of its failure to function as envisioned by the district court.  Quite apart from formal burdens of proof, all litigants must share in their mutual obligation to collaborate with the district court ab initio in fashioning adequate case management and trial procedures, or bear the reasonably foreseeable consequences for their failure to do so.  See, e.g., Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 160 (1st Cir.1988) (noting that district court reasonably may presume affected parties, which take no exception to an announced course of action, have no objection);  see also Clemente v. Carnicon-Puerto Rico Mgt. Assocs., 52 F.3d 383, 387 (1st Cir.1995);  K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 913 (1st Cir.1989);  Austin v. Unarco Indus., Inc., 705 F.2d 1, 15 (1st Cir.), cert. dismissed, 463 U.S. 1247, 104 S.Ct. 34, 77 L.Ed.2d 1454 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the lawbooks bear out, in many respects this has been a groundbreaking mass-tort MDL from its onset in 1987.  See, e.g., supra n. 1. The district court was confronted not only with the daunting task of devising (sometimes from \"whole cloth\") mechanisms for streamlining case administration (e.g., the JDD), but with establishing auxiliary administrative entities, including the PSC itself, which would permit adequate ongoing judicial oversight to be reserved for the most pressing and essential litigation.  The PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs were indispensable partners in this important endeavor.  Spurred by their respective self-interests, these broadly allied litigants were far better positioned than the trial judge to propose the prophylactic procedures believed necessary to protect their respective interests from undue encroachment by potential adversaries, including one another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These complex and unwieldy \"mass tort cases are a breed apart,\" Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 311, to the point that efficient, and often innovative, administrative arrangements become absolutely essential to enable the \"court[ ][to] run [a] tight ship[ ] to ensure that [the] litigation stays on course.\"  Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 614.   See In re Recticel Foam Corp.  (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), 859 F.2d 1000, 1004 (1st Cir.1988) (\"In multi-party, multi-case litigation, the district court's success is largely dependent upon its ability to uncomplicate matters.\").  Trial judges newly immersed in mass-tort MDLs simply cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate, from the inception, all potential flaws in their unopposed procedural and administrative initiatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is essential, therefore, that counsel collaborate with the trial judge from the outset in fashioning workable programmatic procedures, and thereafter alert the court in a timely manner as operating experience points up infirmities warranting further judicial attention.  Absent this collaborative administrative monitoring, there inevitably remains an unacceptable potential for internecine conflicts among the PSC, IRPAs and plaintiffs over their respective dormant claims to the common fund, which threaten to convert their cost-reimbursement disputes into wasteful satellite litigations.  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (cautioning that cost claims \"should not [be allowed to] result in a second major litigation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even at the outset, while their primary focus remained on establishing defendants' liability, the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs surely could anticipate that their respective financial stakes in future PSC-cost reimbursement rulings would be substantial (e.g., $10 million, or 4 1/2 percent of common fund), especially since the district court had authorized the PSC not only to take over certain IRPA litigation tasks but to establish and finance its own ad hoc law firm at a centralized and inevitably costly adjunct office.  Confronted with this serious potential for conflicting self-interests, see Pretrial Order No. 2 (cautioning counsel that \"your working relationship will occasionally be strained, communication hampered, and mutual trust impeded\"), and the virtually certain prospect that the massive litigation would be protracted, see id.  (cautioning that counsel would \"probably be laboring together [in strained relationships] for several years\"), the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs were on reasonable notice from the outset that establishing adequate prophylactic procedures was a priority matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus forewarned, the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs all were fairly alerted that the massive cost-submission documentation generated over the years ahead would become critically important to them;  viz., to satisfy the PSC's burden of proof under Grendel's Den and enable both the IRPAs and plaintiffs to assert informed objections to inappropriate PSC cost-reimbursement submissions.  Clearly, then, their timely fashioning of mutually satisfactory documentation and monitoring procedures offered the most reasonable prospect for forfending this satellite litigation.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As appellants acknowledge that there are no legal precedents which provide detailed models for designing suitable mass-tort cost-reimbursement procedures, they now urge, after the fact, that we define the relevant responsibilities incumbent upon the district court and the PSC in these matters.  We decline their request, however, in large part for the reason that the guidance presently available plainly runs counter to their premise that the primary responsibility for designing cost-submission procedures, ab initio, rests with the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Manual for Complex Litigation (\"the MCL \") itself includes no detailed provisions on the subject, opting instead to encourage counsel for the principal parties to forge ad hoc prophylactic procedures by mutual agreement from the outset,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> it envisions that prescriptive procedural models will emerge, and deserving ones gain currency, through the litigants' own collaborative ad hoc initiatives, rather than originate in appellate case law.  See Pretrial Order No. 127, at 22 (\"The Manual for Complex Litigation ... has been and will continue to be a primary reference text in this litigation.  Counsel must become familiar with the Manual.\").  Furthermore, ex post facto pronouncements detailing model procedures would be particularly inappropriate in these circumstances as it is readily apparent that the present dispute sprang inexorably from the flawed procedural design in which appellants acquiesced from the outset, and for six years thereafter, to the point that its deficiencies became both systemic and irremediable.  Appellants simply waited too long before asking the district court to undo, with their broad axe (viz., a 25% to 33% across-the-board cut), the documentary muddle allowed to accumulate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, pressed on many other fronts since 1987, it was not practicable for the district court alone to scrutinize all cost-related documentation maintained by the PSC for nearly half a decade.  See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950 (noting that courts must strive for cost-setting processes which are \"not unnecessarily burdensome to the courts themselves\").  Unlike less attenuated and complex litigation, mass-tort MDLs by their very nature predetermine that detailed monitoring of case-administration-related responsibilities be delegated.  The early pretrial orders entered by the district court, with appellants' acquiescence, accordingly established a cost-monitoring regime which required the PSC to submit cost summaries every sixty days for interim approval by the court.  The PSC-cost summaries, which merely reflected total expenses by general type and category, represented the cumulative, edited product of the Raben and Kevane \"audits,\" without the underlying documentation.  Thus, the interim-approval regime was reasonably designed to ensure that cost verification and containment by the parties not simply await an end to the entire litigation, by which time the accompanying avalanche of documentation would all but preclude cogent review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, two serious deficiencies made their way into these interim-approval procedures with appellants' acquiescence:  (1) the failure to include defined criteria for assessing \"reasonableness\" and \"necessariness\";  and (2) the failure explicitly to authorize or require appellants to monitor the underlying documentation as interim PSC-cost summaries were submitted to the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, appellants settled from the outset simply for the broad, undefined general criteria that claimed-PSC costs be \"necessary\" and \"reasonable,\" thereby implicitly foregoing such ongoing prophylactic measures as particularized monetary guidelines and/or ceilings on major cost categories;  for example, maximum per diem rates for hotels and page-rates for photocopying.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet more fundamentally, the pretrial procedural orders did not identify a minimum level of detail in the documentation required to substantiate that a particular PSC-member cost was \"necessary\" to a PSC litigation task and \"reasonable\" in amount.  Rather, the orders simply directed the PSC to keep \"careful, contemporaneous, detailed records\" and provide \"proper verification\" of its expenditures.  Although Grendel's Den makes clear that an entity requesting reimbursement must document its actual expenditures, normally by itemized receipt, see 749 F.2d at 956-57, the more amorphous and subjective criteria for substantiating that a given expenditure was \"necessary\" and \"reasonable\" may not be so readily documented.  For example, in some instances courts do not require exacting documentation even for major cost reimbursements, such as overhead expenses incurred in connection with the PSC office, relying instead on their intimate knowledge of the litigation for determining whether entire categories of costs pass the reasonableness test;  viz., whether the nature of the expenditure strikes the court as clearly superfluous or its amount transcends the broad bounds of reasonableness in the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the early pretrial orders afforded both an obvious and ready opportunity for appellants, inter alios, to propose, with somewhat greater particularity at least, more definite contours for monitoring, testing, and verifying PSC compliance with the amorphous \"necessariness\" and \"reasonableness\" criteria laid down by the district court.  As this litigation demonstrates all too well, the terms \"detailed records\" and \"proper verification\"--though perhaps perfectly adequate benchmarks in a smaller, non-MDL litigation--simply were not up to the task in this mass-tort MDL. See MCL &#167; 20.223 (\"The court should also inform counsel what records should be kept....\").  For example, even though early pretrial orders forewarned that the litigation would be prolonged and that it would be impracticable for the PSC to submit all its underlying documentation directly to the district court for interim-approval review, the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs nonetheless refrained from proposing any further definition of the required level of documentary particularity.  Thus, these matters were left unattended until the end of the litigation at their peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, appellants exacerbated the documentary muddle from the start by opting to forego ongoing monitoring of the PSC documentation.  Unlike less prolonged and complex litigation, wherein interim-cost reimbursement claims may be deferrable until the litigation nears completion, the hands-off approach taken by appellants is utterly impracticable in these large and enduring mass-tort proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the potential for serious, long-term overreaching by the PSC under the relaxed regime envisioned by these pretrial orders, we discern no sound justification for appellants' failure to propose in 1987 that one of their own number be designated to conduct closer review of the underlying PSC-cost documentation on an ongoing basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  See Francis Bacon, Of Suspicion (\"There is nothing makes a man suspect much, more than to know little.\").  Alternatively, the IRPAs could have sought district court authorization to retain an auditor to monitor these interim-cost reports on an ongoing basis for \"necessariness\" and \"reasonableness.\"   Thus, appellants' failure even to attempt interim monitoring directly contributed to the serious and otherwise avoidable consequences ultimately brought to the district court's attention at a time when corrective action could no longer be considered practicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are appellants absolved of their primary responsibility for protecting their own interests based on the mere fact that the pretrial orders did not explicitly direct interim monitoring.  Rather, the record is clear that appellants were neither precluded nor incapacitated from taking appropriate and timely precautions.  First and foremost, fundamental deficiencies in the interim PSC-cost submissions to the court, especially their lack of particularity, readily could have been addressed and corrected ab initio, rather than at the end of the litigation.  Second, appellants placed too much reliance upon non-MDL case authority, see, e.g., Grendel's Den, supra, in failing to conduct interim monitoring, based on their ill-advised assumption that the PSC's ultimate burden of proving its entitlement to reimbursement relieved appellants of their independent responsibility to collaborate with the district court and other parties to develop and monitor appropriate cost-containment procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants were well aware, throughout the proceedings, that the PSC had not been directed to submit its voluminous cost documentation to the district court together with the interim summaries.  Thus, appellants knowingly failed to assume their rightful responsibilities for safeguarding their own interests by monitoring interim PSC-cost submissions as required to ensure that the evolving documentation practices actually utilized by the PSC were equal to the task and, if not, to broach the matter first with the PSC and, as need be, with the court, in time to permit effective preventive and corrective measures before matters became completely unmanageable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We underscore the central administrative necessity in mass-tort MDLs, that the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs attempt very early on to work out mutually acceptable procedures for documenting and monitoring costs for which reimbursement is to be sought.  No less importantly, both at the outset and thereafter, where cooperative efforts fail to produce agreement, or cost-benefit considerations independently warrant, judicial intervention should be promptly sought before matters worsen or become irremediable.  See Jaquette v. Black Hawk County, Iowa, 710 F.2d 455, 463 (8th Cir.1983) (\"[T]he key to avoiding excessive costs ... is early and stringent judicial management of the case.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual plaintiffs and IRPAs have enough at stake in these matters to prompt their early intervention.  For example, if overly particularized PSC-cost documentation on \"reasonableness\" and \"necessariness\" were to be required without regard to sound cost-benefit considerations, its unnecessary procedural costs ultimately would be borne by the individual plaintiffs.  See Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 572 F.Supp. 354, 383 (D.D.C.1983) (\"Indeed, the amount of time that would be required to document each item of expense in the detail apparently suggested by Defendant would be prohibitive;  the compensable time required to generate the detail would exceed the expenses claimed.\").  Conversely, if appellants were to designate an IRPA, or retain an independent auditor, to monitor PSC-cost submissions, the expense conceivably could exceed whatever direct savings might be derived through any resulting cost-reimbursement disallowances.  Thus, as the ultimate payors the individual plaintiffs and IRPAs have enough at stake to warrant reasonable efforts at ensuring that adequate documentation and cost-monitoring procedures also make cost-benefit sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An adequate cost containment and monitoring system in a mass-tort litigation cannot be economically and efficiently designed and implemented from the outset absent a series of tradeoffs among the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs, all of whom are under a mutual obligation to engage in an earnest effort to resolve their differences early on.  These appellants, on the other hand, elected to acquiesce for four years in the flawed cost containment and monitoring system first set in place in 1987, awaiting an end to the principal litigation before coming forward with their objections.  See Reilly, 863 F.2d at 160 (litigants share mutual burden to collaborate with district court in fashioning workable litigation procedures).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Evidence of PSC Overreaching</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next we consider whether the PSC-cost reimbursements should be subjected to the across-the-board cuts (25% to 33%) urged by appellants notwithstanding their own failure to take appropriate preventive or corrective action.  In our view, their crude cuts ought not be imposed in these circumstances absent evidence that the PSC acted in bad faith or took unfair advantage of the procedural deficiencies.  Not only have we found no such evidence, but we can discern no appreciable PSC overreaching from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there should be no ready presumption that counsel appointed to the PSC expended its funds in bad faith;  that is, with intent to inflate PSC-cost reimbursement submissions.  This is especially true in the present circumstances, since the PSC members repeatedly attested that their cost submissions were bona fide.  See, e.g., Alabama Power Co. v. Gorsuch, 672 F.2d 1, 5 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\"[I]n most cases, the court should be content to rely upon the integrity of counsel, and allow the[ ] expenses [claimed].\");  Greenspan v. Automobile Club of Mich., 536 F.Supp. 411, 413-14 (E.D.Mich.1982) (refusing to \"second-guess\" necessariness of costs and relying in part on affidavits filed by requesting parties and their attorneys);  cf. also, e.g., In re Agent Orange Prod.  Liab. Litig., 611 F.Supp. at 1322 (\"If there was doubt about the reason for a[n] [attorney's phone] call, it was allowed.\");  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1924 (permitting attorneys to vouch for necessariness of costs).  Whether or not there is a direct or formal attorney-client relationship between plaintiffs and the PSC, the PSC and its IRPA members necessarily owed a fiduciary obligation to the plaintiffs.  Cf. In re Agent Orange Prod.  Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d at 223 (noting that lead counsel owes fiduciary duty to class plaintiffs);  see also MCL &#167; 20.22 (counseling court to remind PSC members of \"their responsibility to the court and their obligation to act fairly, efficiently, and economically in the interests of all parties and their counsel\").  Furthermore, these PSC members simultaneously were acting in their respective roles as IRPAs, with direct professional responsibility for representing approximately seventy percent of the plaintiff class.  In these circumstances especially, given their professional obligations to the court and their individual clients, we would be highly reluctant to suppose that the PSC members promoted overreaching by the PSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the PSC \"auditing\" which did occur, whether or not adequate, cannot be dismissed as perfunctory, since it did screen out some significant cost excesses.  For example, Adamina Soto attested that she contacted PSC members concerning problem expenses and followed up with requests for further documentation.  Indeed, the Raben and Soto audits resulted in cost reductions exceeding $346,000.  Although appellants object that some PSC auditing was conducted at random, particularly that performed by Kevane and Soto, as it did not purport to verify each expense claim, the reviews conducted by Raben and Sterling were not random.  Finally, even the random \"audit\" procedures were not conducted under PSC control.   Thus, we are not persuaded that the random review procedures were flawed to the point that they could provide no effective deterrent to substantial PSC overreaching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, appellants emphasize that Kevane and Raben were accountants, with little personal knowledge regarding the precise litigation tasks assigned to the PSC. Both were professional CPAs, however, and Raben in particular was no neophyte, having been responsible for comparable cost oversight in the MGM case, itself a hotel fire litigation.  It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, absent evidence to the contrary, to expect that Raben was reasonably qualified for the professional task assigned to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, as there is no indication in the appellate record that the PSC ever attempted to prevent appellants from examining its underlying cost documentation prior to 1991, the reasonably foreseeable prospect that appellants might well (indeed should) have requested interim access to the documentation presumably had some deterrent effect upon PSC overreaching.  Not only did the pretrial orders not preclude ongoing access by appellants to the PSC documentation, but there would appear to have been no conflict of interest or \"work product\" privilege which would have prevented the individual plaintiffs or IRPAs from inspecting the PSC documentation at any time during the litigation.  See supra note 12.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and most importantly, the district court initially proposed to limit PSC attorney fees and costs, combined, to ten percent of the eventual common fund, thus providing PSC members a substantial inducement to exert reasonable efforts to minimize PSC costs with a view to preserving a larger balance with which to fund their attorney fees as PSC members.  See In re Wells Fargo Securities Litigation, 157 F.R.D. 467, 470 (N.D.Cal.1994) (\"[A]n attorney generally has no incentive to minimize litigation expenses unless his fee award is inversely related to such expenses.\").  Appellants respond that the ten percent ceiling did not deter inflated costs, however, because the district court announced in January 1991 that it would not be enforced after all.  See Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 307 n. 10 (holding that tentative cap was not binding on district court);  Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 612 (same).  Nevertheless, until January 1991, by which time the lion's share of its $10 million in costs had accrued, the PSC could not have known that the district court would discard the ten percent ceiling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude, based on the foregoing considerations, particularly the absence of reliable evidence of overreaching or bad faith on the part of the PSC, that it would be inequitable to resort to the crude cost-cutting bludgeon proposed by appellants, who share at least equal responsibility for these procedural lapses.  Although the procedural deficiencies discussed above may have led to some unnecessary or unreasonable expenditures, appellants clearly failed to alert the district court until it had become impracticable either to prevent or assess, let alone correct them in any reliable or cost-effective manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Individualized Objections</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next we consider appellants' objections to particular categories of cost-reimbursement claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. PSC-Office Costs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the $913,503 fee paid to Attorney Thomas H. Foulds by the PSC for services rendered as a putative \"insurance expert\" should not have been treated as a PSC-office cost, see Order No. 520 (Jan. 28, 1994), but as an attorney fee chargeable against the fifty percent share of the attorney-fee fund already recovered by PSC members.  The district court determined that Foulds, who had worked for twenty years as an insurance claims manager before attending law school, had been hired not as an attorney, but primarily to consult with PSC attorneys regarding the nuts-and-bolts interpretation of various insurance policies.  The PSC concedes that Foulds handled certain litigation tasks normally performed by attorneys (e.g., depositions in the liability case against defendant Alexander and Alexander), but nonetheless insists that this was the most cost-efficient approach, especially given Foulds' intimate understanding of the pertinent insurance policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Although the parties cite no authority regarding the appropriate criteria for determining whether one in Foulds' position should be considered an insurance expert or an attorney, we are persuaded that the district court ruling constituted error in these particular circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, a PSC member who serves simultaneously as an IRPA in a mass-tort MDL is entitled to recover separate compensation from the common fund for the legal services performed in each distinctive role.  See Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 300 n. 2. The prospect of more lucrative returns for their services prompted many IRPAs to compete for these coveted PSC appointments in 1987, respectively urging upon the district court their particular experience and expertise in previous mass-tort suits.  See Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 605 (\"[A]ppointment to the PSC was much coveted....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, all the unsuccessful IRPA candidates for PSC appointment must nevertheless contribute toward defraying PSC attorney fees/costs, since the district court's decision to establish a PSC diverts a significant portion of their respective contingent fees toward funding the PSC. Cf. id. at 310 (noting that though the PSC may be \"a necessary concomitant to skillful case management of mass tort suits, it nevertheless significantly interferes with [the respective IRPAs'] expectations regarding the fees that his or her client has agreed to pay\").  Accordingly, due regard should be had for these nonmember-IRPAs' diminished fee expectations, at least to the extent that \"the judge ... attempt to avoid any perception of favoritism\" in mediating disputes between PSC members and nonmember IRPAs.  See Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 605.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the nine original PSC members were appointed, from among forty applicants, the district court expressly directed, inter alia, that the PSC \"shall neither be enlarged nor diminished in size or membership without Court approval,\" Pretrial Order No. 127, at 29, that the PSC \"conduct all pretrial liability and damage discovery,\" id. at 30, and that \"only two members of the PSC, or counsel duly authorized by them, may question [ ] deponent[s],\" id.   Given the acknowledgement by the appellees that Foulds, on occasion, served as a de facto PSC attorney without prior district court authorization, his retention, to that extent at least, directly contravened the explicit pretrial orders prohibiting any de facto expansion of PSC membership.  Thus, the district court's subsequent authorization of reimbursement to the PSC for the Foulds fee as an insurance expert cannot cure the PSC's unauthorized, unilateral expansion of its attorney ranks, without inviting similar circumventions in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject the suggestion that we remand to permit the district court to apportion the $913,503 fee as between the \"insurance expert\" and \"attorney\" services performed by Foulds.  We wish to make clear, however, that the PSC was not precluded from retaining Foulds based on a reasonable belief that he was the best qualified insurance expert available, simply because he happened to be an attorney.  Nonetheless, once the PSC did retain Foulds, it owed nonmember IRPAs a duty of fair dealing to ensure that he undertook no unauthorized \"attorney\" tasks which might have been performed by some disappointed candidate for PSC membership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. PSC-Member Costs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) Photocopying Costs</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants oppose the twenty-five-cent page rate at which the district court permitted reimbursement to PSC members for photocopying;  in all, amounting to $184,000.  The district court explained that it \"fail[ed] to see the difference between PSC members and any IRPA charging a client a reasonable amount for copying charges.\"   Order No. 510-A, at 8 (Nov. 24, 1993).  Appellants cite numerous decisions which hold the twenty-five-cent rate unreasonable, and argue that the PSC provided no proof that it actually incurred that cost to copy each page.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC members offer three justifications for the approved rate.  First, most photocopying was done at the PSC office and no reimbursement claim was made.  Second, appellants knew early on in the litigation that the PSC had voted to permit its members to claim reimbursement at twenty-five cents per page.  Third, the twenty-five-cent rate, standard in many law offices, had been allowed in the MGM case.  Although the district court's cost-allowance rulings are entitled to deferential review, Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950, we are persuaded that its ruling does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the PSC, the IRPAs are free to assess their own clients for photocopying in accordance with their respective contingent fee agreements and any applicable ethical-code provision.  On the other hand, the PSC is a creature of the district court, whose mission is to promote more efficient litigation, see MCL &#167; 20.223 (\"Designated counsel should render services as economically as possible under the circumstances.\").  In a \"common benefit\" case of this sort, therefore, the court must ensure that PSC members recover only their actual costs, with no \"profit\" margin.  See Fogleman v. ARAMCO, 920 F.2d 278, 286 (5th Cir.1991) (\"To the extent that counsel charges a party more than actual cost for any service, be it reproduction of documents or telephone calls, counsel is recovering additional fees.\");  Spicer v. Chicago Bd. Options Exch., Inc., 844 F.Supp. 1226, 1260 (N.D.Ill.1993);  In re Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig., 779 F.Supp. 1063, 1111-12 (D.Ariz.1990) (reducing in-house photocopying costs claimed at twenty or twenty-five cents:  \"[t]hat this amount may be charged to regular clients by the firm, or that it is 'standard' in the firm's area of practice, is not controlling, [and] Class members will not be assessed an amount that produces a clear and unwarranted profit for the firm\"), rev'd on other grounds, 19 F.3d 1306 (9th Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the PSC's alleged failure to document the \"necessariness\" and \"reasonableness\" of other types of expenses (e.g., hotel charges, air fares), see supra Section II.A, its failure to document its own in-house photocopying costs presents a fundamental problem.  As in-house photocopying costs are not incurred with \"outside\" providers (e.g., hotel, airline, or even an outside photocopying service), there is no third-party receipt to verify the expenditure and its amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if only by reasoned approximation, therefore, the PSC needed either to demonstrate the various components of its in-house photocopying costs (e.g., the prorated cost of purchasing or leasing the photocopier, the copy paper, and salaries attributable to making the copies), or show the prevailing cost of comparable outside copy services, see, e.g., Haroco, Inc. v. American Nat'l Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, 38 F.3d 1429, 1441 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that \"charges for in-house reproduction may not exceed the charges of an outside print shop\").  See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950 (noting that the district court's discretion \"must, of course, be exercised within evidentiary bounds,\" and the court must \"provide a 'clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award' \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC does not pretend to have established that it actually incurred a twenty-five-cent-per-page photocopying cost.  As all three PSC justifications for the requested twenty-five-cent rate, supra, are inapposite to this essential showing, we vacate the district court ruling, and direct the PSC members to reimburse appellants for all PSC in-house photocopying cost claims calculated at a rate exceeding ten cents per page.  Thus, appellees are to remit $110,400 of the $184,000 disbursed to the PSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) Hotel Rates</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion by allowing reimbursement to various PSC members for hotel-room charges ranging from $180 to $450 per day, notwithstanding its pretrial order cautioning that \"hotel accommodations/meals should be moderate, not deluxe....\"  Pretrial Order No. 127, at 44-45.  Appellants assert that any hotel-room charge above the $116 per diem rate then deemed deductible by the Internal Revenue Service, should not have been reimbursed, that less expensive rooms were available in Puerto Rico, and that on occasion PSC members obtained less expensive rates.  There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court correctly noted that substantial leeway was due PSC members regarding their scheduling needs during the frenetic early stages of the litigation, when most investigation and discovery had to be conducted.  See Order No. 584, at 9 (noting that the PSC conducted over 2300 depositions, and retained twenty-nine expert witnesses);  id.  (\"[The investigative] stage was decisive in terms of immediately preserving evidence and conducting valuable investigations regarding the fire origin and spread.  Time was of the essence and because of this, the activity was feverish, leaving scant opportunity to fine-tune the preparation and justification of expenses.\").  Consequently, the appropriate inquiry here is not simply whether an individual attorney might have booked a room at a lower rate during a given time period.  Rather, the PSC frequently was required to coordinate lodging for many individuals and without much advance notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the appropriate inquiry must be whether the rate was reasonable in relation to the legitimate needs occasioned by the litigation tasks at hand.  Against this backdrop, appellants have failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.  None of the hotel rates strike us as facially abusive in these particular circumstances.  Cf. Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 957 (finding abuse of discretion where hotel bill of $917 could be considered \"unreasonable on its face\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as with other PSC-costs, see supra Section II.A, appellants settled, from the outset and without protest, for amorphous general standards, such as \"moderate\" and non-\"deluxe\" hotel accommodations, whereas they were free from the start to propose the $116 per-diem rate they now suggest.  Furthermore, there has been no showing that the hotel charges for which reimbursement was sought were either \"deluxe\" or not \"moderate\" in the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  Finally, as concerns appellants' contention that PSC members did not keep adequate supporting documentation relating to the \"necessariness\" and \"reasonableness\" of each hotel expense, their position is foreclosed.  See supra Section II.A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge the rational force in appellants' contention that inherent conflicts of interest exist between the PSC and individual plaintiffs in mass-tort MDLs, yet serious deficiencies in the cost-submission procedures nevertheless persisted throughout this litigation.  Nonetheless, despite reasonable notice of the obvious peril to their own financial interests, and their clear obligation to forfend against it from the outset, appellants did not turn serious attention to the PSCcost reimbursement regime deficiencies until the Gordian knot could no longer be undone.  Consequently, we determine, as we must, that the requested relief has been rendered impracticable, through appellants' inaction, to the extent that further redress at this point would extend this satellite litigation for no cost-effective purpose.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, within 30 days, appellees shall remit to the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico $1,023,903 (consisting of the $913,503 previously received as reimbursement for PSC costs incurred for services rendered by Mr. Foulds and the $110,400 for the PSC-Member photocopying costs), plus interest calculated at the legal rate (6% per annum), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3025, from the dates of the respective disbursements to the PSC from the litigation expense fund established in Pretrial Order No. 127.  In due course, the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall distribute the remitted funds to those plaintiffs who prosecuted the instant appeal, in equal shares (or otherwise as the district court in its discretion may apportion).  In turn, these plaintiffs shall pay their respective IRPAs whatever share of the rebated funds (if any) may be due the IRPAs under their respective contingent fee contracts for services rendered in prosecuting this appeal.  In all other respects, the district court order is affirmed.  The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.

If possible, the terms and procedures for payment should be established by agreement among counsel, but subject to judicial approval and control (see infra section 24.214, compensation for designated counsel).  Whether or not agreement is reached, the judge has the authority to order reimbursement and compensation and the obligation to ensure that the amounts are reasonable.  Terms and procedures should be established before substantial services are rendered and should provide for, among other things, the following:  periodic billings during the litigation or creation of a fund through advance or ongoing assessments of members of the group;  appropriate contributions from parties making partial settlements with respect to services already rendered by designated counsel;  and contributions from parties in later filed or assigned cases who benefit from the earlier work of designated counsel.</p>\n        <p>Designated counsel should render services as economically as possible under the circumstances, avoiding unnecessary activity and limiting the number of persons attending conferences and depositions and working on briefs and other tasks.

The court should also inform counsel what records should be kept and when they should be submitted to the court to support applications to recover fees and expenses from coparties.

Secretarial assistance, on the other hand, is a normal part of overhead, but courts have differed over whether overtime is reimbursable.  Similarly, rulings vary on such items as copy and printing costs, certain meals and travel, and fax, telephone, and delivery charges.  The determination of these kinds of claims should not be left to costly and time--consuming adversary adjudication at the end of the litigation;  ground rules on reimbursement should be established at the outset.</p>\n        <p>MCL &#167; 24.215 (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district courts differ quite sharply regarding the detail needed in cost-reimbursement submissions:</p>\n        <p>The defendants next object that the plaintiffs' attorneys have not documented their request for expenses with receipts.  It is not necessary or desirable for federal courts to review receipts for every five dollar expenditure.  Judges, being former practicing attorneys, are quite capable of determining the reasonableness of expenses incurred during litigation.  Neither is it necessary to itemize expenses in great detail.  For example, it is sufficient that copying costs were submitted without listing how many pages of which documents were copied during the three years of litigation.  Law firms generally do not keep such records and little would be served by requiring them except to make litigation more expensive.  The amount of the expenses submitted is certainly reasonable given the length and complexity of this case.</p>\n        <p>Duke v.

Sterling countered that the records were thoroughly organized at the outset but that Torres had \"disorganized\" them with his haphazard rummaging.  The district court, after crediting Sterling's account, attempted to resolve the impasse by directing Torres and Sterling to meet and consult at the JDD. By then, however, the damage had been done and the resultant administrative \"chaos\" alluded to by the district court made it impossible even to ascertain whether the PSC had maintained suitable documentation for the vast majority of its cost claims.

In this case, however, the parties agree as to what work Foulds performed.  On the other hand, the determination as to which fund--attorney fee or cost--should bear the expense incurred for a particular type of service, would appear to be a legal question, or a mixed question in which the legal component predominates, either of which normally would be reviewed de novo.

After thousands of individual plaintiffs filed hundreds of claims against a host of defendants in many different jurisdictions (\"multidistrict litigation\" or \"MDL\"), the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated all cases for trial in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (Acosta, J.), see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1407.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As most plaintiffs had already retained their own counsel (hereinafter:  \"individually retained plaintiffs' attorneys\" or \"IRPAs\"), the district court recognized the need to coordinate their representation through the PSC. Eventually comprised of eleven attorneys with expertise in mass-tort litigation, the PSC served as plaintiffs' lead counsel, responsible for coordinating discovery, settlement negotiations and, if necessary, trial matters common to all plaintiffs.  The eleven PSC members nonetheless retained their respective roles as IRPAs, directly representing approximately seventy percent of the individual plaintiffs.  The IRPAs, on the other hand, were to focus their efforts on litigation tasks idiosyncratic to their respective clients' cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Pretrial Case-Management Orders</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In two pretrial orders, the district court directed plaintiffs, who would derive common benefit from PSC services, to pay PSC attorney fees and costs from the common fund ultimately recovered in the litigation.  See Pretrial Order No. 127 (Dec. 2, 1988);  Pretrial Order No. 2 (Mar. 23, 1987).  At the time, the district court tentatively proposed to limit the PSC to a combined attorney fee/cost award not exceeding ten percent of the eventual common fund, see Pretrial Order No. 127, at 48, which ultimately approximated $220 million.  The district court established the following cost-submission and reimbursement guidelines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ssessments<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> will be deposited in a fund that will defray the reasonable expenses of the PSC in the performance of its duties.  The PSC shall maintain a careful statement of account on the fund, that is, prepare and keep accurate, contemporaneous, detailed records of the receipts, deposits, accumulated interest and subsequent disbursements.  The fund shall be used only to make disbursements (whether directly to creditors or to reimburse the PSC) for expenses incurred for the benefit of all plaintiffs.

All persons interested in reimbursement, particularly members of the PSC, must keep careful, contemporaneous, detailed records of individual expenses.  Only reasonable and necessary expenses will be reimbursed.  For example, airplane/transportation expenses should be at economical rates, not first class;  and hotel accommodations/meals should be moderate, not deluxe, etc.  Reimbursements are conditioned, of course, on the proper verification of expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC and/or its members, as pertinent, shall submit to the Court for its approval a statement for reimbursable \"hard\" expenses and another for \"soft\" expenses as well as statements of account beginning on August 1, 1987 and every sixty (60) days thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 44-45 (emphasis added).

Accordingly, the PSC directed Monita Sterling, a paralegal for a PSC-member law firm with prior exposure to PSC litigation tasks, to review each PSC-member cost claim independently to determine whether the expenditures were \"necessary\" to legitimate PSC litigation tasks, \"reasonable\" in amount, and not duplicative of other PSC-member cost claims.  Sterling thereafter reviewed \"every receipt or other piece of documentation submitted,\" noting each questionable claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Sterling submitted her reports and supporting documentation to Adamina Soto, a CPA who reviewed the Sterling report and randomly checked its underlying documentation, then contacted PSC members about problem items and requested further documentation.

See supra at p. 224.  Three months later, the district court abandoned its earlier tentative proposal, see supra at p. 223, to limit the PSC's combined attorney fee/cost award to ten percent of the common fund.

See Order No. 478 (Jan. 15, 1993).  The court further directed three categories of documents to be filed in the joint document depository (\"JDD\") for review by the plaintiffs and IRPAs:  (1) the three Raben reports analyzing PSC-member costs;  (2) the Kevane monthly reports summarizing PSC-office costs;  and (3) the PSC-member cost documentation.  See Order No. 479 (Jan. 20, 1993).  Although the court rejected a request by the plaintiffs and IRPAs for additional formal discovery, see Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 303 (noting that mandated exchanges of documentation, rather than \"searching discovery,\" are appropriate where only attorney fees and expenses are at issue), it ordered both Raben and Kevane to submit descriptions of their auditing procedures and directed Kevane to produce his working papers, correspondence, and documentation.  See Order No. 485 (Mar. 3, 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the extended deadline for further objections to costs, the plaintiffs and IRPAs submitted a report and affidavit by William Torres, a CPA newly retained to audit the PSC-cost submissions, attesting that he had requested the PSC to \"provide [him] with access to all of the records documenting the costs incurred in this case, ... including but not limited to, original bills or statements kept by the PSC staff or any PSC member, and any summaries or supporting documentation (including charge account bills) of the same.\"   Even though necessary to a \"meaningful analysis,\" Torres attested, the PSC failed to provide the requested documents, including the Raben working papers;  and, until March 10, 1993, the \"critical\" Kevane working papers were not made available;  many documents made available were unreadable;  the PSC did not allow access to the PSC-member-cost-reimbursement policies or the PSC-policy meeting minutes relating to cost reimbursements;  and, finally, the PSC refused to permit him to depose Raben, Kevane or any PSC member regarding questionable cost submissions or documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 24, 1993, the district court overruled most major objections to the PSC-cost submissions.  See Order No. 510-A.  For example, as regards hotel charges, the court rejected the contention that the maximum per diem rate should be $116, the rate considered \"reasonable\" by the IRS for tax-deduction purposes.  It ruled that reasonableness must be assessed case by case, to reflect such variants as locale, seasonal fluctuations, room availability, the number of persons sharing a room, accessibility of equipment and facilities essential to the litigation task at hand, as well as other exigencies.  Id. at 7-8.   The court ruled that, like the IRPAs, PSC members were entitled to \"reasonable\" reimbursement for photocopying costs and had not \"profit[ed]\" from the authorized twenty-five-cents-per-copy rate.

It directed the plaintiffs and IRPAs to \"sort out this chaos,\" id. at 12;  Torres and Sterling to meet and consult at the JDD not later than December 10;  and the plaintiffs and IRPAs to file particularized objections to the remaining expenditures not later than January 12, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing in December 1993, to determine whether to allow the PSC to recover its final cost installment for retaining Thomas Foulds, Esquire, as an expert.  The PSC maintained that Foulds, who had worked for many years in the insurance industry before attending law school, had been retained as an insurance expert, to interpret insurance contracts, rather than as an attorney, and that his fee therefore was fully reimbursable as a PSC-office cost.  See Pretrial Order No. 127, at 48.  Although the plaintiffs and IRPAs objected that Foulds had performed many litigation tasks, including legal research and conducting depositions, normally performed by attorneys and not by insurance experts, the district court allowed the Foulds fee reimbursement as a PSC-office cost after concluding that Foulds \"was not contracted merely as an attorney\" but primarily for his insurance expertise.  See Order No. 520, at 3-4 (Jan. 28, 1994).  The final installment brought the total Foulds-fee reimbursement to $913,503.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs and IRPAs filed their final objections to PSC-member costs in January 1995, essentially reiterating that the cost review and verification process had proven hopelessly inadequate to document either the necessariness or reasonableness of the claimed costs, and that it was unfair to require them to sort through the chaotic documentation created by the PSC and its members.  Alternatively, the plaintiffs and IRPAs asserted specific objections to a sampling of allegedly inappropriate PSC-member costs (e.g., phone calls, tips, charges for \"drinks,\" etc.) and urged an across-the-board reduction of all PSC-cost claims by a fixed percentage (25-33%) to reflect the sampling-based estimate of alleged PSC overcharges.  Finally, the plaintiffs and IRPAs complained that Monita Sterling had refused to allow CPA Torres to inspect the documentation pertaining to PSC-office costs at the joint meeting required by Order No. 510-A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court once again overruled the bulk of the objections.  See Order No. 584 (Aug. 29, 1995).  First, it found the PSC review process adequate, noting that it had resulted in disallowance of several questionable expenditures based on the independent review conducted by Raben, Sterling, and Soto under objective criteria.  Second, except for a handful of de minimis mischarges totaling less than $2,000, the court rejected the specific challenges asserted by the plaintiffs and IRPAs based on their samplings of alleged overcharges.  Finally, the court ruled that its Pretrial Order No. 510-A, see supra at pp. 225-26, had envisioned only that Sterling and Torres inspect documentation relating to \"outstanding issues\"--those involving PSC-member costs, not PSC-office-cost issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the plaintiffs and IRPAs [hereinafter:  \"appellants\"] appealed from the various orders approving PSC-cost reimbursements (Order Nos. 478, 485, 510-A, 520, and 584).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The PSC-Cost Reimbursement Regimen</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Appellants' Position</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants aim their main broadside at the regimen established for documenting, monitoring, submitting, and approving PSC costs.  Although the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs in mass-tort MDLs share the same litigation goal (viz., an optimum common fund), internecine differences as to subsidiary matters--particularly the appropriate allocations from the common fund for their respective attorney fees and costs--are commonplace.  The greater the attorney fees and costs awarded the PSC, of course, the less available for the IRPAs and their individual clients.  Appellants maintain that these conflicting self-interests necessarily entail heightened oversight responsibilities on the part of the district courts in mass-tort MDLs to ensure stringent monitoring and review procedures adequate to protect the individual plaintiffs and IRPAs from overreaching by the PSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants fault the district court for adopting reimbursement procedures which delegate important judicial oversight responsibilities to auditors appointed either by the court or the PSC. It is the PSC, they say, rather than the appellants, which must bear the ultimate burden in establishing entitlement to reimbursement, see Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445233\"><a href=\"/opinion/445233/grendels-den-inc-v-john-p-larkin-cambridge-license-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span>, 956-57 (1st Cir.1984), which in turn necessitates three distinct showings by the PSC for each claimed reimbursement;  viz., that it document:  (i) the actual expenditure;  (ii) its necessariness to the assigned litigation task;  and (iii) its reasonableness, see, e.g., In re Agent Orange Prod.  Liab. Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2004017\"><a href=\"/opinion/2004017/in-re-agent-orange-product-liability-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Raben and Kevane were accountants, neither trained in the law nor familiar with the litigation tasks assigned to the PSC. At best they could verify that the PSC and its members actually made the claimed expenditures, but in many instances PSC members maintained no detailed records relating to their reasonableness and necessariness.  Moreover, appellants argue, though Monita Sterling and others similarly designated by the PSC undoubtedly were more familiar than Kevane and Raben with the nature and demands of the PSC's litigation responsibilities, their assessments of claimed expenses were inherently biased because their employment with the PSC gave them a vested interest in justifying PSC reimbursements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the district court erred in suggesting that it was incumbent upon them, rather than the PSC, to demonstrate that particular PSC expenditures were not reimbursable.  See, e.g., Order No. 520, at 1 n. 1 (\"Parties questioning payments previously approved carried the burden of setting them aside whereas the PSC/Mr.  Foulds were required to justify the pending request.\").  The court based its ruling on the ground that most PSC cost-reimbursement claims during earlier stages in the litigation had been approved, without opposition, as submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants complain not only that the district court thereby subverted the well-established burden of proof incumbent upon the PSC, see Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 956-57, but foisted on the plaintiffs and IRPAs the impracticable task of rummaging through mountainous PSC documentation to determine--within very restrictive court-ordered deadlines--which PSC-cost submissions were either inadequately documented or otherwise nonreimbursable.  Appellants therefore urge that all otherwise allowable PSC-cost reimbursements be reduced by a fixed (if somewhat arbitrary) discount (25% to 33%), see, e.g., Mokover v. Neco Enters., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 956-57.   Furthermore, there can be no quarrel that the respective self-interests of the plaintiffs, the IRPAs, and the PSC in mass-tort MDLs often diverge, nor for that matter that the cost-containment regimen initiated at the outset in this case (without benefit of hindsight) ultimately proved inadequate and even chaotic, see supra Section I.D, as the district court itself acknowledged several years later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nevertheless part company with appellants' contention that the belatedly perceived shortcomings in the adopted safeguards against PSC overreaching proximately caused the unsatisfactory regimen in this case, or that the PSC and its members must therefore be required to bear the entire brunt of its failure to function as envisioned by the district court.  Quite apart from formal burdens of proof, all litigants must share in their mutual obligation to collaborate with the district court ab initio in fashioning adequate case management and trial procedures, or bear the reasonably foreseeable consequences for their failure to do so.

See, e.g., supra n. 1. The district court was confronted not only with the daunting task of devising (sometimes from \"whole cloth\") mechanisms for streamlining case administration (e.g., the JDD), but with establishing auxiliary administrative entities, including the PSC itself, which would permit adequate ongoing judicial oversight to be reserved for the most pressing and essential litigation.  The PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs were indispensable partners in this important endeavor.  Spurred by their respective self-interests, these broadly allied litigants were far better positioned than the trial judge to propose the prophylactic procedures believed necessary to protect their respective interests from undue encroachment by potential adversaries, including one another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These complex and unwieldy \"mass tort cases are a breed apart,\" Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 311, to the point that efficient, and often innovative, administrative arrangements become absolutely essential to enable the \"court[ ][to] run [a] tight ship[ ] to ensure that [the] litigation stays on course.\"  Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 614.

Absent this collaborative administrative monitoring, there inevitably remains an unacceptable potential for internecine conflicts among the PSC, IRPAs and plaintiffs over their respective dormant claims to the common fund, which threaten to convert their cost-reimbursement disputes into wasteful satellite litigations.

Confronted with this serious potential for conflicting self-interests, see Pretrial Order No. 2 (cautioning counsel that \"your working relationship will occasionally be strained, communication hampered, and mutual trust impeded\"), and the virtually certain prospect that the massive litigation would be protracted, see id.  (cautioning that counsel would \"probably be laboring together [in strained relationships] for several years\"), the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs were on reasonable notice from the outset that establishing adequate prophylactic procedures was a priority matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus forewarned, the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs all were fairly alerted that the massive cost-submission documentation generated over the years ahead would become critically important to them;  viz., to satisfy the PSC's burden of proof under Grendel's Den and enable both the IRPAs and plaintiffs to assert informed objections to inappropriate PSC cost-reimbursement submissions.  Clearly, then, their timely fashioning of mutually satisfactory documentation and monitoring procedures offered the most reasonable prospect for forfending this satellite litigation.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As appellants acknowledge that there are no legal precedents which provide detailed models for designing suitable mass-tort cost-reimbursement procedures, they now urge, after the fact, that we define the relevant responsibilities incumbent upon the district court and the PSC in these matters.  We decline their request, however, in large part for the reason that the guidance presently available plainly runs counter to their premise that the primary responsibility for designing cost-submission procedures, ab initio, rests with the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Manual for Complex Litigation (\"the MCL \") itself includes no detailed provisions on the subject, opting instead to encourage counsel for the principal parties to forge ad hoc prophylactic procedures by mutual agreement from the outset,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> it envisions that prescriptive procedural models will emerge, and deserving ones gain currency, through the litigants' own collaborative ad hoc initiatives, rather than originate in appellate case law.  See Pretrial Order No. 127, at 22 (\"The Manual for Complex Litigation ... has been and will continue to be a primary reference text in this litigation.  Counsel must become familiar with the Manual.\").  Furthermore, ex post facto pronouncements detailing model procedures would be particularly inappropriate in these circumstances as it is readily apparent that the present dispute sprang inexorably from the flawed procedural design in which appellants acquiesced from the outset, and for six years thereafter, to the point that its deficiencies became both systemic and irremediable.  Appellants simply waited too long before asking the district court to undo, with their broad axe (viz., a 25% to 33% across-the-board cut), the documentary muddle allowed to accumulate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, pressed on many other fronts since 1987, it was not practicable for the district court alone to scrutinize all cost-related documentation maintained by the PSC for nearly half a decade.  See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950 (noting that courts must strive for cost-setting processes which are \"not unnecessarily burdensome to the courts themselves\").  Unlike less attenuated and complex litigation, mass-tort MDLs by their very nature predetermine that detailed monitoring of case-administration-related responsibilities be delegated.  The early pretrial orders entered by the district court, with appellants' acquiescence, accordingly established a cost-monitoring regime which required the PSC to submit cost summaries every sixty days for interim approval by the court.  The PSC-cost summaries, which merely reflected total expenses by general type and category, represented the cumulative, edited product of the Raben and Kevane \"audits,\" without the underlying documentation.  Thus, the interim-approval regime was reasonably designed to ensure that cost verification and containment by the parties not simply await an end to the entire litigation, by which time the accompanying avalanche of documentation would all but preclude cogent review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, two serious deficiencies made their way into these interim-approval procedures with appellants' acquiescence:  (1) the failure to include defined criteria for assessing \"reasonableness\" and \"necessariness\";  and (2) the failure explicitly to authorize or require appellants to monitor the underlying documentation as interim PSC-cost summaries were submitted to the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, appellants settled from the outset simply for the broad, undefined general criteria that claimed-PSC costs be \"necessary\" and \"reasonable,\" thereby implicitly foregoing such ongoing prophylactic measures as particularized monetary guidelines and/or ceilings on major cost categories;  for example, maximum per diem rates for hotels and page-rates for photocopying.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet more fundamentally, the pretrial procedural orders did not identify a minimum level of detail in the documentation required to substantiate that a particular PSC-member cost was \"necessary\" to a PSC litigation task and \"reasonable\" in amount.  Rather, the orders simply directed the PSC to keep \"careful, contemporaneous, detailed records\" and provide \"proper verification\" of its expenditures.  Although Grendel's Den makes clear that an entity requesting reimbursement must document its actual expenditures, normally by itemized receipt, see 749 F.2d at 956-57, the more amorphous and subjective criteria for substantiating that a given expenditure was \"necessary\" and \"reasonable\" may not be so readily documented.  For example, in some instances courts do not require exacting documentation even for major cost reimbursements, such as overhead expenses incurred in connection with the PSC office, relying instead on their intimate knowledge of the litigation for determining whether entire categories of costs pass the reasonableness test;  viz., whether the nature of the expenditure strikes the court as clearly superfluous or its amount transcends the broad bounds of reasonableness in the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the early pretrial orders afforded both an obvious and ready opportunity for appellants, inter alios, to propose, with somewhat greater particularity at least, more definite contours for monitoring, testing, and verifying PSC compliance with the amorphous \"necessariness\" and \"reasonableness\" criteria laid down by the district court.  As this litigation demonstrates all too well, the terms \"detailed records\" and \"proper verification\"--though perhaps perfectly adequate benchmarks in a smaller, non-MDL litigation--simply were not up to the task in this mass-tort MDL. See MCL &#167; 20.223 (\"The court should also inform counsel what records should be kept....\").  For example, even though early pretrial orders forewarned that the litigation would be prolonged and that it would be impracticable for the PSC to submit all its underlying documentation directly to the district court for interim-approval review, the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs nonetheless refrained from proposing any further definition of the required level of documentary particularity.  Thus, these matters were left unattended until the end of the litigation at their peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, appellants exacerbated the documentary muddle from the start by opting to forego ongoing monitoring of the PSC documentation.  Unlike less prolonged and complex litigation, wherein interim-cost reimbursement claims may be deferrable until the litigation nears completion, the hands-off approach taken by appellants is utterly impracticable in these large and enduring mass-tort proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the potential for serious, long-term overreaching by the PSC under the relaxed regime envisioned by these pretrial orders, we discern no sound justification for appellants' failure to propose in 1987 that one of their own number be designated to conduct closer review of the underlying PSC-cost documentation on an ongoing basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  See Francis Bacon, Of Suspicion (\"There is nothing makes a man suspect much, more than to know little.\").  Alternatively, the IRPAs could have sought district court authorization to retain an auditor to monitor these interim-cost reports on an ongoing basis for \"necessariness\" and \"reasonableness.\"   Thus, appellants' failure even to attempt interim monitoring directly contributed to the serious and otherwise avoidable consequences ultimately brought to the district court's attention at a time when corrective action could no longer be considered practicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are appellants absolved of their primary responsibility for protecting their own interests based on the mere fact that the pretrial orders did not explicitly direct interim monitoring.  Rather, the record is clear that appellants were neither precluded nor incapacitated from taking appropriate and timely precautions.  First and foremost, fundamental deficiencies in the interim PSC-cost submissions to the court, especially their lack of particularity, readily could have been addressed and corrected ab initio, rather than at the end of the litigation.  Second, appellants placed too much reliance upon non-MDL case authority, see, e.g., Grendel's Den, supra, in failing to conduct interim monitoring, based on their ill-advised assumption that the PSC's ultimate burden of proving its entitlement to reimbursement relieved appellants of their independent responsibility to collaborate with the district court and other parties to develop and monitor appropriate cost-containment procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants were well aware, throughout the proceedings, that the PSC had not been directed to submit its voluminous cost documentation to the district court together with the interim summaries.  Thus, appellants knowingly failed to assume their rightful responsibilities for safeguarding their own interests by monitoring interim PSC-cost submissions as required to ensure that the evolving documentation practices actually utilized by the PSC were equal to the task and, if not, to broach the matter first with the PSC and, as need be, with the court, in time to permit effective preventive and corrective measures before matters became completely unmanageable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We underscore the central administrative necessity in mass-tort MDLs, that the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs attempt very early on to work out mutually acceptable procedures for documenting and monitoring costs for which reimbursement is to be sought.  No less importantly, both at the outset and thereafter, where cooperative efforts fail to produce agreement, or cost-benefit considerations independently warrant, judicial intervention should be promptly sought before matters worsen or become irremediable.  See Jaquette v. Black Hawk County, Iowa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420766\"><a href=\"/opinion/420766/peggy-jo-jaquette-v-black-hawk-county-iowa-black-hawk-county-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, 463 (8th Cir.1983) (\"[T]he key to avoiding excessive costs ... is early and stringent judicial management of the case.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual plaintiffs and IRPAs have enough at stake in these matters to prompt their early intervention.  For example, if overly particularized PSC-cost documentation on \"reasonableness\" and \"necessariness\" were to be required without regard to sound cost-benefit considerations, its unnecessary procedural costs ultimately would be borne by the individual plaintiffs.  See Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310965\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310965/laffey-v-northwest-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 383 (D.D.C.1983) (\"Indeed, the amount of time that would be required to document each item of expense in the detail apparently suggested by Defendant would be prohibitive;  the compensable time required to generate the detail would exceed the expenses claimed.\").  Conversely, if appellants were to designate an IRPA, or retain an independent auditor, to monitor PSC-cost submissions, the expense conceivably could exceed whatever direct savings might be derived through any resulting cost-reimbursement disallowances.  Thus, as the ultimate payors the individual plaintiffs and IRPAs have enough at stake to warrant reasonable efforts at ensuring that adequate documentation and cost-monitoring procedures also make cost-benefit sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An adequate cost containment and monitoring system in a mass-tort litigation cannot be economically and efficiently designed and implemented from the outset absent a series of tradeoffs among the PSC, IRPAs, and plaintiffs, all of whom are under a mutual obligation to engage in an earnest effort to resolve their differences early on.  These appellants, on the other hand, elected to acquiesce for four years in the flawed cost containment and monitoring system first set in place in 1987, awaiting an end to the principal litigation before coming forward with their objections.  See Reilly, 863 F.2d at 160 (litigants share mutual burden to collaborate with district court in fashioning workable litigation procedures).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Evidence of PSC Overreaching</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next we consider whether the PSC-cost reimbursements should be subjected to the across-the-board cuts (25% to 33%) urged by appellants notwithstanding their own failure to take appropriate preventive or corrective action.  In our view, their crude cuts ought not be imposed in these circumstances absent evidence that the PSC acted in bad faith or took unfair advantage of the procedural deficiencies.  Not only have we found no such evidence, but we can discern no appreciable PSC overreaching from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there should be no ready presumption that counsel appointed to the PSC expended its funds in bad faith;  that is, with intent to inflate PSC-cost reimbursement submissions.  This is especially true in the present circumstances, since the PSC members repeatedly attested that their cost submissions were bona fide.  See, e.g., Alabama Power Co. v. Gorsuch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"400063\"><a href=\"/opinion/400063/alabama-power-company-v-anne-m-gorsuch-as-administrator-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\"[I]n most cases, the court should be content to rely upon the integrity of counsel, and allow the[ ] expenses [claimed].\");  Greenspan v. Automobile Club of Mich., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2009859\"><a href=\"/opinion/2009859/greenspan-v-automobile-club-of-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 413-14 (E.D.Mich.1982) (refusing to \"second-guess\" necessariness of costs and relying in part on affidavits filed by requesting parties and their attorneys);  cf. also, e.g., In re Agent Orange Prod.  Liab. Litig., 611 F.Supp. at 1322 (\"If there was doubt about the reason for a[n] [attorney's phone] call, it was allowed.\");  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1924 (permitting attorneys to vouch for necessariness of costs).  Whether or not there is a direct or formal attorney-client relationship between plaintiffs and the PSC, the PSC and its IRPA members necessarily owed a fiduciary obligation to the plaintiffs.  Cf. In re Agent Orange Prod.  Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d at 223 (noting that lead counsel owes fiduciary duty to class plaintiffs);  see also MCL &#167; 20.22 (counseling court to remind PSC members of \"their responsibility to the court and their obligation to act fairly, efficiently, and economically in the interests of all parties and their counsel\").  Furthermore, these PSC members simultaneously were acting in their respective roles as IRPAs, with direct professional responsibility for representing approximately seventy percent of the plaintiff class.  In these circumstances especially, given their professional obligations to the court and their individual clients, we would be highly reluctant to suppose that the PSC members promoted overreaching by the PSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the PSC \"auditing\" which did occur, whether or not adequate, cannot be dismissed as perfunctory, since it did screen out some significant cost excesses.  For example, Adamina Soto attested that she contacted PSC members concerning problem expenses and followed up with requests for further documentation.  Indeed, the Raben and Soto audits resulted in cost reductions exceeding $346,000.  Although appellants object that some PSC auditing was conducted at random, particularly that performed by Kevane and Soto, as it did not purport to verify each expense claim, the reviews conducted by Raben and Sterling were not random.  Finally, even the random \"audit\" procedures were not conducted under PSC control.   Thus, we are not persuaded that the random review procedures were flawed to the point that they could provide no effective deterrent to substantial PSC overreaching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, appellants emphasize that Kevane and Raben were accountants, with little personal knowledge regarding the precise litigation tasks assigned to the PSC. Both were professional CPAs, however, and Raben in particular was no neophyte, having been responsible for comparable cost oversight in the MGM case, itself a hotel fire litigation.  It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, absent evidence to the contrary, to expect that Raben was reasonably qualified for the professional task assigned to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, as there is no indication in the appellate record that the PSC ever attempted to prevent appellants from examining its underlying cost documentation prior to 1991, the reasonably foreseeable prospect that appellants might well (indeed should) have requested interim access to the documentation presumably had some deterrent effect upon PSC overreaching.  Not only did the pretrial orders not preclude ongoing access by appellants to the PSC documentation, but there would appear to have been no conflict of interest or \"work product\" privilege which would have prevented the individual plaintiffs or IRPAs from inspecting the PSC documentation at any time during the litigation.  See supra note 12.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, and most importantly, the district court initially proposed to limit PSC attorney fees and costs, combined, to ten percent of the eventual common fund, thus providing PSC members a substantial inducement to exert reasonable efforts to minimize PSC costs with a view to preserving a larger balance with which to fund their attorney fees as PSC members.  See In re Wells Fargo Securities Litigation, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></span>, 470 (N.D.Cal.1994) (\"[A]n attorney generally has no incentive to minimize litigation expenses unless his fee award is inversely related to such expenses.\").  Appellants respond that the ten percent ceiling did not deter inflated costs, however, because the district court announced in January 1991 that it would not be enforced after all.  See Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 307 n. 10 (holding that tentative cap was not binding on district court);  Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 612 (same).  Nevertheless, until January 1991, by which time the lion's share of its $10 million in costs had accrued, the PSC could not have known that the district court would discard the ten percent ceiling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude, based on the foregoing considerations, particularly the absence of reliable evidence of overreaching or bad faith on the part of the PSC, that it would be inequitable to resort to the crude cost-cutting bludgeon proposed by appellants, who share at least equal responsibility for these procedural lapses.  Although the procedural deficiencies discussed above may have led to some unnecessary or unreasonable expenditures, appellants clearly failed to alert the district court until it had become impracticable either to prevent or assess, let alone correct them in any reliable or cost-effective manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Individualized Objections</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next we consider appellants' objections to particular categories of cost-reimbursement claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. PSC-Office Costs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the $913,503 fee paid to Attorney Thomas H. Foulds by the PSC for services rendered as a putative \"insurance expert\" should not have been treated as a PSC-office cost, see Order No. 520 (Jan. 28, 1994), but as an attorney fee chargeable against the fifty percent share of the attorney-fee fund already recovered by PSC members.  The district court determined that Foulds, who had worked for twenty years as an insurance claims manager before attending law school, had been hired not as an attorney, but primarily to consult with PSC attorneys regarding the nuts-and-bolts interpretation of various insurance policies.  The PSC concedes that Foulds handled certain litigation tasks normally performed by attorneys (e.g., depositions in the liability case against defendant Alexander and Alexander), but nonetheless insists that this was the most cost-efficient approach, especially given Foulds' intimate understanding of the pertinent insurance policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Although the parties cite no authority regarding the appropriate criteria for determining whether one in Foulds' position should be considered an insurance expert or an attorney, we are persuaded that the district court ruling constituted error in these particular circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, a PSC member who serves simultaneously as an IRPA in a mass-tort MDL is entitled to recover separate compensation from the common fund for the legal services performed in each distinctive role.  See Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 300 n. 2. The prospect of more lucrative returns for their services prompted many IRPAs to compete for these coveted PSC appointments in 1987, respectively urging upon the district court their particular experience and expertise in previous mass-tort suits.  See Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 605 (\"[A]ppointment to the PSC was much coveted....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, all the unsuccessful IRPA candidates for PSC appointment must nevertheless contribute toward defraying PSC attorney fees/costs, since the district court's decision to establish a PSC diverts a significant portion of their respective contingent fees toward funding the PSC. Cf. id. at 310 (noting that though the PSC may be \"a necessary concomitant to skillful case management of mass tort suits, it nevertheless significantly interferes with [the respective IRPAs'] expectations regarding the fees that his or her client has agreed to pay\").  Accordingly, due regard should be had for these nonmember-IRPAs' diminished fee expectations, at least to the extent that \"the judge ... attempt to avoid any perception of favoritism\" in mediating disputes between PSC members and nonmember IRPAs.  See Nineteen Appeals, 982 F.2d at 605.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the nine original PSC members were appointed, from among forty applicants, the district court expressly directed, inter alia, that the PSC \"shall neither be enlarged nor diminished in size or membership without Court approval,\" Pretrial Order No. 127, at 29, that the PSC \"conduct all pretrial liability and damage discovery,\" id. at 30, and that \"only two members of the PSC, or counsel duly authorized by them, may question [ ] deponent[s],\" id.   Given the acknowledgement by the appellees that Foulds, on occasion, served as a de facto PSC attorney without prior district court authorization, his retention, to that extent at least, directly contravened the explicit pretrial orders prohibiting any de facto expansion of PSC membership.  Thus, the district court's subsequent authorization of reimbursement to the PSC for the Foulds fee as an insurance expert cannot cure the PSC's unauthorized, unilateral expansion of its attorney ranks, without inviting similar circumventions in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject the suggestion that we remand to permit the district court to apportion the $913,503 fee as between the \"insurance expert\" and \"attorney\" services performed by Foulds.  We wish to make clear, however, that the PSC was not precluded from retaining Foulds based on a reasonable belief that he was the best qualified insurance expert available, simply because he happened to be an attorney.  Nonetheless, once the PSC did retain Foulds, it owed nonmember IRPAs a duty of fair dealing to ensure that he undertook no unauthorized \"attorney\" tasks which might have been performed by some disappointed candidate for PSC membership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. PSC-Member Costs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) Photocopying Costs</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants oppose the twenty-five-cent page rate at which the district court permitted reimbursement to PSC members for photocopying;  in all, amounting to $184,000.  The district court explained that it \"fail[ed] to see the difference between PSC members and any IRPA charging a client a reasonable amount for copying charges.\"   Order No. 510-A, at 8 (Nov. 24, 1993).  Appellants cite numerous decisions which hold the twenty-five-cent rate unreasonable, and argue that the PSC provided no proof that it actually incurred that cost to copy each page.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC members offer three justifications for the approved rate.  First, most photocopying was done at the PSC office and no reimbursement claim was made.  Second, appellants knew early on in the litigation that the PSC had voted to permit its members to claim reimbursement at twenty-five cents per page.  Third, the twenty-five-cent rate, standard in many law offices, had been allowed in the MGM case.  Although the district court's cost-allowance rulings are entitled to deferential review, Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950, we are persuaded that its ruling does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the PSC, the IRPAs are free to assess their own clients for photocopying in accordance with their respective contingent fee agreements and any applicable ethical-code provision.  On the other hand, the PSC is a creature of the district court, whose mission is to promote more efficient litigation, see MCL &#167; 20.223 (\"Designated counsel should render services as economically as possible under the circumstances.\").  In a \"common benefit\" case of this sort, therefore, the court must ensure that PSC members recover only their actual costs, with no \"profit\" margin.  See Fogleman v. ARAMCO, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552368\"><a href=\"/opinion/552368/vernon-isaiah-fogleman-and-jean-kenanin-fogleman-cross-appellees-v-aramco/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 286 (5th Cir.1991) (\"To the extent that counsel charges a party more than actual cost for any service, be it reproduction of documents or telephone calls, counsel is recovering additional fees.\");  Spicer v.

As in-house photocopying costs are not incurred with \"outside\" providers (e.g., hotel, airline, or even an outside photocopying service), there is no third-party receipt to verify the expenditure and its amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if only by reasoned approximation, therefore, the PSC needed either to demonstrate the various components of its in-house photocopying costs (e.g., the prorated cost of purchasing or leasing the photocopier, the copy paper, and salaries attributable to making the copies), or show the prevailing cost of comparable outside copy services, see, e.g., Haroco, Inc. v. American Nat'l Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681311\"><a href=\"/opinion/681311/haroco-incorporated-roman-ceramics-incorporated-california-originals/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1429</span></a></span>, 1441 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that \"charges for in-house reproduction may not exceed the charges of an outside print shop\").  See Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 950 (noting that the district court's discretion \"must, of course, be exercised within evidentiary bounds,\" and the court must \"provide a 'clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award' \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSC does not pretend to have established that it actually incurred a twenty-five-cent-per-page photocopying cost.  As all three PSC justifications for the requested twenty-five-cent rate, supra, are inapposite to this essential showing, we vacate the district court ruling, and direct the PSC members to reimburse appellants for all PSC in-house photocopying cost claims calculated at a rate exceeding ten cents per page.  Thus, appellees are to remit $110,400 of the $184,000 disbursed to the PSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) Hotel Rates</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion by allowing reimbursement to various PSC members for hotel-room charges ranging from $180 to $450 per day, notwithstanding its pretrial order cautioning that \"hotel accommodations/meals should be moderate, not deluxe....\"  Pretrial Order No. 127, at 44-45.  Appellants assert that any hotel-room charge above the $116 per diem rate then deemed deductible by the Internal Revenue Service, should not have been reimbursed, that less expensive rooms were available in Puerto Rico, and that on occasion PSC members obtained less expensive rates.  There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court correctly noted that substantial leeway was due PSC members regarding their scheduling needs during the frenetic early stages of the litigation, when most investigation and discovery had to be conducted.  See Order No. 584, at 9 (noting that the PSC conducted over 2300 depositions, and retained twenty-nine expert witnesses);  id.  (\"[The investigative] stage was decisive in terms of immediately preserving evidence and conducting valuable investigations regarding the fire origin and spread.  Time was of the essence and because of this, the activity was feverish, leaving scant opportunity to fine-tune the preparation and justification of expenses.\").  Consequently, the appropriate inquiry here is not simply whether an individual attorney might have booked a room at a lower rate during a given time period.  Rather, the PSC frequently was required to coordinate lodging for many individuals and without much advance notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the appropriate inquiry must be whether the rate was reasonable in relation to the legitimate needs occasioned by the litigation tasks at hand.  Against this backdrop, appellants have failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.  None of the hotel rates strike us as facially abusive in these particular circumstances.  Cf. Grendel's Den, 749 F.2d at 957 (finding abuse of discretion where hotel bill of $917 could be considered \"unreasonable on its face\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as with other PSC-costs, see supra Section II.A, appellants settled, from the outset and without protest, for amorphous general standards, such as \"moderate\" and non-\"deluxe\" hotel accommodations, whereas they were free from the start to propose the $116 per-diem rate they now suggest.  Furthermore, there has been no showing that the hotel charges for which reimbursement was sought were either \"deluxe\" or not \"moderate\" in the circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  Finally, as concerns appellants' contention that PSC members did not keep adequate supporting documentation relating to the \"necessariness\" and \"reasonableness\" of each hotel expense, their position is foreclosed.  See supra Section II.A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge the rational force in appellants' contention that inherent conflicts of interest exist between the PSC and individual plaintiffs in mass-tort MDLs, yet serious deficiencies in the cost-submission procedures nevertheless persisted throughout this litigation.  Nonetheless, despite reasonable notice of the obvious peril to their own financial interests, and their clear obligation to forfend against it from the outset, appellants did not turn serious attention to the PSCcost reimbursement regime deficiencies until the Gordian knot could no longer be undone.  Consequently, we determine, as we must, that the requested relief has been rendered impracticable, through appellants' inaction, to the extent that further redress at this point would extend this satellite litigation for no cost-effective purpose.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, within 30 days, appellees shall remit to the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico $1,023,903 (consisting of the $913,503 previously received as reimbursement for PSC costs incurred for services rendered by Mr. Foulds and the $110,400 for the PSC-Member photocopying costs), plus interest calculated at the legal rate (6% per annum), P.R.

If possible, the terms and procedures for payment should be established by agreement among counsel, but subject to judicial approval and control (see infra section 24.214, compensation for designated counsel).  Whether or not agreement is reached, the judge has the authority to order reimbursement and compensation and the obligation to ensure that the amounts are reasonable.  Terms and procedures should be established before substantial services are rendered and should provide for, among other things, the following:  periodic billings during the litigation or creation of a fund through advance or ongoing assessments of members of the group;  appropriate contributions from parties making partial settlements with respect to services already rendered by designated counsel;  and contributions from parties in later filed or assigned cases who benefit from the earlier work of designated counsel.</p>\n        <p>Designated counsel should render services as economically as possible under the circumstances, avoiding unnecessary activity and limiting the number of persons attending conferences and depositions and working on briefs and other tasks.  The court should make clear at the first pretrial conference that compensation will not be approved for unnecessary or duplicative activities or services.  The court should also inform counsel what records should be kept and when they should be submitted to the court to support applications to recover fees and expenses from coparties.  See infra section 24.21, which discusses ground rules and record keeping where attorneys' fees are awarded by the court.</p>\n        <p>MCL &#167; 20.223 (3d ed.1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The record discloses no indication that appellants either objected to these deficiencies or proposed alternative procedures.

Charges for paralegals and law clerks at market rates and the fees of necessary experts are generally reimbursable.  Secretarial assistance, on the other hand, is a normal part of overhead, but courts have differed over whether overtime is reimbursable.  Similarly, rulings vary on such items as copy and printing costs, certain meals and travel, and fax, telephone, and delivery charges.  The determination of these kinds of claims should not be left to costly and time--consuming adversary adjudication at the end of the litigation;  ground rules on reimbursement should be established at the outset.</p>\n        <p>MCL &#167; 24.215 (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district courts differ quite sharply regarding the detail needed in cost-reimbursement submissions:</p>\n        <p>The defendants next object that the plaintiffs' attorneys have not documented their request for expenses with receipts.  It is not necessary or desirable for federal courts to review receipts for every five dollar expenditure.  Judges, being former practicing attorneys, are quite capable of determining the reasonableness of expenses incurred during litigation.  Neither is it necessary to itemize expenses in great detail.  For example, it is sufficient that copying costs were submitted without listing how many pages of which documents were copied during the three years of litigation.  Law firms generally do not keep such records and little would be served by requiring them except to make litigation more expensive.  The amount of the expenses submitted is certainly reasonable given the length and complexity of this case.</p>\n        <p>Duke v.

In some attorney fee and cost shifting disputes, the requesting party may not wish to disclose its documentation to a party-opponent during the litigation, out of fear that its litigation strategies may be divulged, even though the party-opponent eventually may be liable for the fees or costs.

Torres considered them an incomprehensible muddle.  Sterling countered that the records were thoroughly organized at the outset but that Torres had \"disorganized\" them with his haphazard rummaging.  The district court, after crediting Sterling's account, attempted to resolve the impasse by directing Torres and Sterling to meet and consult at the JDD. By then, however, the damage had been done and the resultant administrative \"chaos\" alluded to by the district court made it impossible even to ascertain whether the PSC had maintained suitable documentation for the vast majority of its cost claims.  With prudent ongoing monitoring by appellants from the outset, of course, the administrative confusion need never have gotten out of hand</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Appellants point out that the PSC refused Torres access to certain \"derivative\" documents after 1991, such as the Raben work papers.  Nevertheless, Torres had access to the raw materials examined by Raben (viz., actual PSC receipts and other documentation).  Moreover, appellants were not necessarily entitled to full-fledged discovery, at least absent district court authorization.  See Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 303 (noting that normally it is sufficient, for purposes of a fee and expense application, to order exchange of the \"raw materials\" or \"all the data reasonably necessary to formulate ... objections\") (citation omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We see no need to catalog certain meritless challenges appellants raise to various miscellaneous expenses, especially in light of the deferential standard of review.

We need not resolve the issue, however, since appellants' objections to these cost-reimbursement claims are based on their contention that the PSC failed to meet its burden of proof and verification under Grendel's Den, a position which we have already rejected.  See supra Section II.A;  see also In re Agent Orange Prod.  Liab. Litig., 611 F.Supp. at 1331 (allowing \"[a]ll reasonable, verifiable expenses for running\" the PMC's centralized office)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The PSC also protests that it came as no \"surprise\" to appellants that Foulds was retained.  But this is beside the point.  Appellants simply maintain that they were never informed that Foulds would be used as an \"attorney.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The applicable standard of review is not clear and we find no controlling precedent.  Nonetheless, the basic determination as to what work Foulds performed would call for fact-finding, reviewable only for clear error.  See Damon v. Sun Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721298\"><a href=\"/opinion/721298/roy-r-damon-and-eleanor-m-damon-v-sun-company-inc-roy-r-damon-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1467</span></a></span>, 1483 (1st Cir.1996).  In this case, however, the parties agree as to what work Foulds performed.  On the other hand, the determination as to which fund--attorney fee or cost--should bear the expense incurred for a particular type of service, would appear to be a legal question, or a mixed question in which the legal component predominates, either of which normally would be reviewed de novo.   As we are persuaded that the district court ruling cannot withstand review under either standard, we need not determine the precise standard at this juncture</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> See also ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 379 (1993) (noting that counsel is \"obliged to charge the client no more than the direct cost associated with the service (i.e., the actual cost of making a copy on the photocopy machine) plus a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses directly associated with the provision of the service (e.g., the salary of a photocopy machine operator)\");  id.
