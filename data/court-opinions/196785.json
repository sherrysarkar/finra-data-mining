For the reasons that follow, we vacate the\r\n\nconvictions and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Facts\r                                        Facts\r                                             \r\n\n          Viewing the  record in the light  most favorable to\r\n\nthe verdict, United States  v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761,  764 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1996),  a rational jury  could have found  the following\r\n\nfacts from the trial evidence.\r\n\n          During the  indictment period, 1986  to March 1993,\r\n\nthe  John Hancock  Mutual Life Insurance  Company (\"Hancock\")\r\n\nemployed  the defendant-appellant,  F. William  Sawyer,  as a\r\n\nsenior  lobbyist within its  Government Relations Department.\r\n\nAs  the  largest  life insurance  company  in  Massachusetts,\r\n\nHancock had a continuing and abiding interest in the  state's\r\n\ninsurance laws.  Sawyer's job  was to lobby the Massachusetts\r\n\nLegislature  on Hancock's  behalf.   In  particular, his  job\r\n\ndescription required him  to: research and  develop Hancock's\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nposition  on  pertinent  legislation;   communicate  relevant\r\n\ninformation  to representative government  officials in order\r\n\nto effect  a favorable outcome  and to protect  the Company's\r\n\ninterests;  and establish  and  maintain  relationships  with\r\n\nlegislators as well as with members of industry associations.\r\n\n          A principal  focus of Sawyer's  lobbying activities\r\n\nwas the Legislature's  Joint Insurance Committee  (\"Insurance\r\n\nCommittee\"), composed of state representatives  and senators.\r\n\nThe  Insurance  Committee  has  the ability  to  impact  life\r\n\ninsurance  regulations  more   than  any  other   legislative\r\n\ncommittee.  To  this end, it reviews approximately  300 bills\r\n\nper  year, about  fifty of  which affect  the life  insurance\r\n\nindustry.    During  each  year  of  the  indictment  period,\r\n\nMassachusetts  life insurance  companies actively  sought the\r\n\npassage   of  about  five  bills,  most   of  which  made  it\r\n\nsuccessfully through the Insurance Committee \"in some form or\r\n\nanother.\"  Robert J. Smith,  a research analyst and  director\r\n\nfor  the  Committee, testified  that,  during the  indictment\r\n\nperiod, Sawyer was one  of three lobbyists who  appeared most\r\n\noften to  lobby  for  bills  sought  by  the  life  insurance\r\n\nindustry.\r\n\n          The Insurance Committee  is co-chaired by a  senate\r\n\nand  house member, each with  equal control over  the fate of\r\n\nbills assigned to the Committee.  The Chairs have the ability\r\n\nto schedule  hearings, assign  bills to the  hearing calendar\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nand   subsequent  executive   sessions,  advocate   bills  at\r\n\nexecutive  sessions, and  take other  action to  advance them\r\n\nthrough  the Committee.   Each  Chair could  \"carry\" a  bill,\r\n\ni.e., actively  guide it through the Legislature  as a whole;\r                \r\n\nalternatively, a Chair could send it to the \"Study Committee\"\r\n\nwhich usually shelved it.\r\n\n          During  the indictment  period, Sawyer  focused his\r\n\nlobbying  activities on  the house  members of  the Insurance\r\n\nCommittee,  some  of  whom   took  action  that  directly  or\r\n\nindirectly  affected  Hancock's  interests.    Representative\r\n\nFrancis  H. Woodward  was the  House  Chair of  the Insurance\r\n\nCommittee  from  1986  to   1990.    Research  analyst  Smith\r\n\nidentified Sawyer  as the  lobbyist  he saw  most often  with\r\n\nRepresentative  Woodward  during  Woodward's  tenure  as  the\r\n\nCommittee's  House Chair.   During  this time,  the Insurance\r\n\nCommittee  never rejected Woodward's recommendations on bills\r\n\naffecting the life insurance industry and Woodward  \"carried\"\r\n\nmost  of the  bills sought  by the industry.   Representative\r\n\nFrank  Emilio,  a  member  from  1986 to  1990,  sponsored  a\r\n\nSeptember  1990 bill  on behalf  of Hancock.   Representative\r\n\nJohn  F.  Cox  sponsored  bills  that  Hancock  supported  in\r\n\nNovember   1990   and   December   1991.       In   addition,\r\n\nRepresentatives   Walsh,   Mara,   and   Driscoll   sponsored\r\n\nlegislation sought by the life insurance industry.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          \"Legislative   Reports\"   issued  by   the  Hancock\r\n\nGovernment  Relations Department to  senior Hancock officers,\r\n\nand signed by Sawyer,  outlined specific lobbying efforts and\r\n\nproceedings  in  the Massachusetts  Legislature  pertinent to\r\n\nHancock's interests.  In July 1990, Sawyer wrote a memorandum\r\n\nto Hancock's Management  Committee summarizing the successful\r\n\nefforts of Hancock lobbyists, including himself, in excluding\r\n\nHancock  from a bill that would have  subjected it to a $100-\r\n\nmillion tax liability.  In a September 1990 memorandum to the\r\n\nManagement Committee,  Sawyer referred to a  1990 bill, filed\r\n\nby Representative Emilio, that  allowed Hancock to assess and\r\n\nreport  its  real estate  advantageously.    A November  1990\r\n\nletter from  Ralph F. Scott, Hancock's  Assistant Legislative\r\n\nCounsel,  to Representative  Cox  indicated  that Sawyer  and\r\n\nScott planned to work with Cox in obtaining  favorable action\r\n\non a specific bill that he had sponsored for Hancock.\r\n\n          During  the  indictment  period,  Sawyer  paid  for\r\n\nnumerous meals,  rounds of golf, and  other entertainment for\r\n\nand with Massachusetts legislators, including many members of\r\n\nthe Insurance Committee.   Although Sawyer initially paid for\r\n\nmost  of  these  activities  himself, they  were  treated  as\r\n\nbusiness  expenses and  reimbursed  by  Hancock  (hereinafter\r\n\n\"expenditures\").   In  accordance with  Hancock's procedures,\r\n\nSawyer  would complete  monthly  expense vouchers,  attaching\r\n\nreceipts and  a  handwritten  calendar  that  identified  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nrecipients of the expenses.   Sawyer's supervisor, Raeburn B.\r\n\nHathaway,   the  head   of  Hancock's   Government  Relations\r\n\nDepartment, reviewed  Sawyer's expense vouchers  and approved\r\n\nthem  for  reimbursement.   Hathaway's  secretary would  then\r\n\ndetach the detailed calendars  from the vouchers, keeping the\r\n\ncalendars  within the  Government  Relations Department,  and\r\n\nforward the voucher, alone,  to the accounting department for\r\n\npayment.\r\n\n          Analysis of Sawyer's expense vouchers and calendars\r\n\nduring  the indictment  period  revealed that  the top  three\r\n\nrecipients of his expenditures were: Representative Woodward,\r\n\nwho received  more than  $8,000 worth of  expenditures during\r\n\nhis  tenure  as  Insurance   Committee  House  Chair;  Robert\r\n\nHowarth,  an Insurance  Committee  member from  1986 to  1992\r\n\n(over  $3,000);  and  Representative  Emilio  (over  $2,500).\r\n\nAfter these three legislators  left office, Sawyer, on behalf\r\n\nof Hancock, expended practically nothing on entertaining them\r\n\n(Woodward, $0; Howarth, $8.33; and Emilio, $85.65).\r\n\n          Specifically,   Sawyer's   expenditures    included\r\n\nthousands of  dollars for golf -- in and out of state -- with\r\n\nvarious  Massachusetts  legislators including  Representative\r\n\nFrancis   Mara,  Woodward's   1991  successor   as  Insurance\r\n\nCommittee  House  Chair.    Sawyer also  hosted  dinners  for\r\n\nlegislators and  their families.   In September  1992, Sawyer\r\n\nprovided Representative Mara  and his wife tickets for a show\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nin  Hancock's private box at  the Wang Center  and ordered an\r\n\naccompanying dinner.\r\n\n          The apparent  catalyst for this  prosecution was  a\r\n\nDecember  1992  trip  to  Puerto  Rico  where  Sawyer,  other\r\n\nlobbyists,   and   a   group   of    legislators,   including\r\n\nRepresentative Mara, travelled  for a legislative conference.\r\n\nThe  group did not stay  at the conference  site, but instead\r\n\nwent to a different  resort where Sawyer paid for many of the\r\n\nlegislators'  meals,  transportation,   and  golf.    Hancock\r\n\nreimbursed Sawyer  for some $4,000  of entertainment expenses\r\n\nfrom the Puerto Rican trip.1\r\n\n          Both  Sawyer  and  his  supervisor,  Hathaway,  had\r\n\nreason  to  believe  that  these expenditures  could  or  did\r\n\nviolate  certain state  laws.   In  his  office, Sawyer  kept\r\n\ninternal Hancock memoranda,  newspaper articles, and opinions\r\n\nof the  Massachusetts  Ethics Commission,  all explaining  or\r\n\nreporting on Massachusetts ethics-in-lobbying.  While some of\r\n\nthe   documents  varied   in   their  interpretations,   they\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In   1986,   Sawyer   and   his   wife   travelled   with\r\nRepresentative Woodward and  his wife to New  Orleans for the\r\nSuper Bowl.  Hancock provided the game tickets and reimbursed\r\nSawyer for the  airfare.  The  district court instructed  the\r\njury that, because this  trip occurred before the mail  fraud\r\nstatute  proscribed  honest  services  fraud,  it  could  not\r\nprovide  the sole  basis for  a mail  fraud conviction.   The\r\ncourt  added, however, that the jury  could consider the trip\r\nas evidence of  Sawyer's state  of mind with  respect to  the\r\nalleged scheme to defraud.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nnonetheless  advised  on   compliance  with  laws   regarding\r\n\ngratuities, gifts, and lobbying expenditures.\r\n\n          In  April 1993,  a reporter  from the  Boston Globe\r\n\nnewspaper queried Richard  Bevilacqua, Hancock's Director  of\r\n\nEmployee   and   Customer   Communications,  about   Sawyer's\r\n\nentertainment of legislators during the 1992 Puerto Rico trip\r\n\nand about  Hancock's legislative  agenda during  that period.\r\n\nBevilacqua, in turn, asked Sawyer about the  trip, and Sawyer\r\n\nopined, \"it's difficult to take anyone out to lunch or dinner\r\n\nthese  days without  going  over [the]  amount [permitted  by\r\n\nlaw].\"    This set  of events  prompted  Hancock to  begin an\r\n\ninternal    investigation     into    Sawyer's    legislative\r\n\nexpenditures.2   Bruce A.  Skrine, vice  president, corporate\r\n\ncounsel  and  secretary for  Hancock,  asked  Sawyer for  his\r\n\nexpense records.  Contemporaneous with Sawyer's production of\r\n\nthe  records,  Sawyer  told  Skrine that  the  expenses  were\r\n\n\"consistent with the  way . .  . things  were done on  Beacon\r\n\nHill.\"   Sawyer also told  Skrine that his  reason for making\r\n\nthe  expenditures was \"to get to know\" the legislators and to\r\n\ndevelop \"a  certain relationship  so that you  could turn  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  In  the  Spring of  1993,  the  United States  Attorney's\r\nOffice for the  District of Massachusetts  (\"USAO\") commenced\r\nan investigation into Hancock's involvement  in the allegedly\r\nillegal expenditures on legislators.   In March 1994, Hancock\r\nentered into a civil settlement with the USAO whereby it paid\r\na fine of about $1,000,000 and promised to cooperate with the\r\nUSAO.

In  a leading  case\r\n\ninvolving  the bribery  of  a state  governor on  legislative\r\n\nmatters,  the  Fourth Circuit  explained  how  bribery of  an\r\n\nofficial can constitute honest services fraud:\r\n\n          [T]he fraud  involved in the bribery of a\r\n          public official lies in the fact that the\r\n          public  official  is  not exercising  his\r\n          independent   judgment   in  passing   on\r\n          official  matters. .  . .  When a  public\r\n          official has been bribed, he breaches his\r\n          duty    of     honest,    faithful    and\r\n          disinterested  service.  .   .  .   [T]he\r\n          official has been paid for his decisions,\r\n          perhaps  without   even  considering  the\r\n          merits of  the matter.   Thus, the public\r\n          is not  receiving what it expects  and is\r\n          entitled to, the public official's honest\r\n          and faithful service.\r\n\nMandel, 591 F.2d at 1362; see  also, Boots, 80 F.3d at 592-94\r                                                      \r\n\n(involving scheme  to bribe Native-American  police chief  in\r\n\nexercise  of  his border  patrol  duties);  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHolzer,  816 F.2d  304,  308 (7th  Cir.)

When  an official fails to disclose\r                   \r\n\na  personal interest in a matter over which she has decision-\r\n\nmaking power, the public  is deprived of its right  either to\r\n\ndisinterested decision  making itself or, as the case may be,\r\n\nto full disclosure as  to the official's potential motivation\r\n\nbehind an  official act.

Rabbitt had\r\n\noffered to introduce a friend's architectural firm to certain\r\n\npublic officials responsible for awarding state architectural\r\n\ncontracts, in return for a ten percent commission on any work\r\n\nawarded.    Id. at  1020.   The  government charged  that his\r                           \r\n\nreceipt  of the resulting,  undisclosed commissions defrauded\r\n\nthe citizens of Rabbitt's honest services.

The  court  also  observed  that  the\r\n\ngovernment failed to  cite any applicable standard  requiring\r\n\nRabbit to disclose his  interest in the contracts, and  thus,\r\n\nthe  citizens  were  not  deprived  of   any  right  to  such\r\n\ndisclosure.

Similarly,  if a non-public-official  is prosecuted\r\n\nfor scheming to  defraud the public  of an official's  honest\r\n\nservices,  the government must  prove that the  target of the\r\n\nscheme is the deprivation  of the official's honest services.\r\n\nIf the  \"scheme\" does not, as its  necessary outcome, deprive\r\n\nthe public  of honest services, then  independent evidence of\r\n\nthe  intent to  deprive  another of  those  services must  be\r\n\npresented.

Scheme to Defraud\r                                 \r\n\n          Here,  the government did  not prosecute  Sawyer on\r\n\nthe theory  that he, as a  lobbyist, directly owed a  duty of\r\n\nhonest services to the Commonwealth or its citizens.  Rather,\r\n\nthe government sought to prove that Sawyer engaged in conduct\r\n\nintended to cause state legislators to violate their  duty to\r\n\nthe  public.  The government  sought to establish this scheme\r\n\nby  proving  that Sawyer  intentionally  violated,  or caused\r\n\nmembers of  the  legislature to  violate,  two  Massachusetts\r\n\nstatutes.\r\n\n          Briefly,   these    two   Massachusetts   statutes,\r\n\ndiscussed  more fully infra, are: (1) Mass. Gen. L. ch. 268B,\r                                       \r\n\n  6 (the \"gift\" statute), which prohibits -- under threat  of\r\n\ncivil  penalties --  a \"legislative  agent\" from  offering or\r\n\ngiving to a public official (or an official's  acceptance of)\r\n\n\"gifts\" aggregating $100 or more per year; and (2) Mass. Gen.\r\n\nL. ch. 268A,   3 (the \"gratuity\" statute), which prohibits --\r\n\nunder threat of civil  and criminal penalties -- anyone  from\r\n\ngiving to a  legislator (or a  legislator from soliciting  or\r\n\naccepting)  anything  of \"substantial  value  .  .  . for  or\r\n\nbecause  of any official act performed or to be performed\" by\r\n\nthat  person.   Through  the  violation  of these  laws,  the\r\n\ngovernment contended, Sawyer stole the honest services of the\r\n\nlegislators.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          In general, proof of  a state law violation  is not\r\n\nrequired  for  conviction  of  honest services  fraud.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\nSilvano, 812 F.2d  at 759.   Indeed, the  incorporation of  a\r                   \r\n\nstate  law   violation  in  such  a   prosecution  may  cause\r\n\ncomplications.   See  United States  v.

Here, however, the parties\r\n\nagree  that the  indictment,  as structured,  required it  to\r\n\nprove that Sawyer violated at least one state law.  Thus, the\r\n\nstate  laws  in question  had to  be  correctly charged  as a\r\n\nmatter of state law, and the violation of at least one had to\r\n\nbe proven.\r\n\n          Sawyer appeals various aspects of  the court's jury\r\n\ninstructions  on the  state statutes  and their  role  in the\r\n\nalleged scheme to defraud.

(emphasis added).\r\n\nAfter describing the two statutes, the court continued:\r\n\n          If  you find  beyond  a reasonable  doubt\r\n          that  the defendant devised  or created a\r\n          scheme   to   defraud    in   which    he\r\n          intentionally   violated   or  caused   a\r\n          violation  of at  least one  of the  laws\r\n          that  I have just described, then you may\r\n          find that  the government has  proved the\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          first  element of  mail  fraud  and  wire\r\n          fraud.\r\n\n          These instructions  permitted the jury to  find the\r\n\nrequisite scheme to defraud  upon proof that Sawyer violated,\r\n\nor  caused legislators  to violate,  either one of  the state\r                                                       \r\n\nstatutes.  In other words, the  jury was allowed to find that\r\n\na violation of either  statute, without more, constituted the\r\n\ndeprivation  of honest  services.8   At oral  argument before\r\n\nthis court,  the government affirmed that it  chose the state\r\n\nlaw  violations as \"the sole  vehicle to prove  the scheme or\r\n\nartifice to defraud\" in order to \"narrow the issues of intent\r\n\nand good faith.\"   Thus,  we analyze both  state statutes  in\r\n\nlight  of the  law of  honest services,  set forth  above, to\r\n\ndetermine  whether  the   court's  instructions   erroneously\r\n\npermitted a conviction  for conduct not  within the reach  of\r\n\nthe mail fraud statute.\r\n\n          1.

After the  court instructed  the jury, Sawyer  lodged the\r\nfollowing objection:\r\n\n          Your  Honor, I  believe that  the Court's\r\n          instruction  failed to  properly instruct\r\n          the jury that, even  if it finds that the\r\n          defendant violated  one of the  two state\r\n          statutes . . . the defendant would not be\r\n          guilty of any federal offense, mail fraud\r\n          and  wire  fraud  offense,   unless  [the\r\n          violation] was  part of a plan to defraud\r\n          the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  or its\r\n          citizens of the duty of honest services.\r\n\nThe court declined any further charge.\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n          The   first  Massachusetts  statute  on  which  the\r\n\nalleged scheme to  defraud was  based is ch.  268B,   6  (the\r\n\n\"gift statute\"), which provides:\r\n\n          No legislative agent shall  knowingly and\r\n          wilfully  offer  or   give  to  a  public\r\n          official  or public employee  or a member\r\n          of such person's immediate family, and no\r\n          public  official  or  public employee  or\r\n          member of such person's  immediate family\r\n          shall knowingly and  wilfully solicit  or\r\n          accept from any legislative  agent, gifts\r\n          with  an aggregate  value of  one hundred\r\n          dollars or more in a calendar year.\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch. 268B,   6.  We discuss Sawyer's challenges\r\n\nto  the court's  instructions  on  the statutory  definitions\r\n\nbefore turning  to the  statute's relation  to the scheme  to\r\n\ndefraud. \r\n\n               a.  \"Legislative Agent\"\r                                                  \r\n\n          The court  instructed  the  jury  that,  under  the\r\n\nstatute,  a  legislative agent  cannot  give  or offer  gifts\r\n\naggregating $100 or  more to  a legislator or  member of  the\r\n\nlegislator's   family.     It  further   instructed  that   a\r\n\n\"legislative agent\"  is \"any person who,  for compensation or\r\n\nreward,  does  any  act   to  promote,  oppose  or  influence\r\n\nlegislation.\"  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 268B,   1(g).9   Sawyer\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  The   entire  definition  of   \"legislative  agent,\"  for\r\npurposes of the gift statute, is:\r\n\n          any person who for compensation or reward\r\n          does   any  act  to  promote,  oppose  or\r\n          influence legislation  . . . .   The term\r\n          shall include persons who, as any part of\r\n          their  regular  and usual  employment and\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nargues that this instruction  failed to reflect his assertion\r\n\nthat  a person  is a \"legislative  agent\" only when  he is so\r\n\nregistered  with the  Secretary of  State or  he is  actually\r\n\nengaging in lobbying activity at the time he gave the alleged\r\n\ngifts.\r\n\n          The court  instructed that  a legislative  agent is\r\n\none   who  is   paid   to  \"promote,   oppose  or   influence\r\n\nlegislation,\"  i.e.,  to  lobby,  and that  such  agents  are\r                               \r\n\nforbidden to give or offer certain \"gifts.\"  The instruction,\r\n\nas  a whole, adequately conveyed the idea that such gifts are\r\n\nforbidden only  when given by those  who, at the time  of the\r\n\ngifts, are  paid to actually  lobby.   While there  may be  a\r\n\nperson with the  job title \"lobbyist\"  who does not  actually\r\n\nengage in lobbying, there was ample evidence here that Sawyer\r\n\nlobbied at the time  he gave the alleged \"gifts.\"   Moreover,\r\n\nthe  fact  that he  had an  obligation  to register  with the\r\n\nSecretary of State, see Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 3,    40, 41, does\r                                   \r\n\nnot  alter  the  definition.    No  further  instruction  was\r\n\nrequired.\r\n\n               b.

Gen. L. ch. 268B,    1(g); see also  3   39 (identical\r                                                      \r\ndefinition in statutory section on disclosure obligations).\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n          The court instructed  the jury that \"gifts,\"  under\r\n\nthe    relevant   Massachusetts   law,    are   \"a   payment,\r\n\nentertainment, subscription, advance, services or anything of\r\n\nvalue,  unless consideration  of  equal or  greater value  is\r\n\nreceived.\"   See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 268B,   1(g).  Much of the\r                            \r\n\nevidence  offered to  prove Sawyer's  violations of  the gift\r\n\nstatute was  his payment  for shared meals  and entertainment\r\n\nwith the legislators.  Sawyer  contends that his payment  for\r\n\n\"shared hospitality\" does not  constitute a \"gift\" within the\r\n\nmeaning   of  the  statute.    The  issue  turns  out  to  be\r\n\npotentially  complicated  and  involves  somewhat  convoluted\r\n\nanalysis of  the statutory  history of  a comparable  law set\r\n\nforth at  Mass. Gen.  L.  ch. 3,    43.   We  have  carefully\r\n\nreviewed the arguments on both sides, and for the reasons set\r\n\nforth  in the  district  court's ruling,  see Sawyer,  878 F.\r                                                                \r\n\nSupp.  at  282-84, we  conclude  that  Sawyer's shared  meals\r\n\ncould, if the jury so found, fit within the gift definition's\r\n\nterm  \"entertainment\" and/or the very broad phrase, \"anything\r\n\nof value.\"\r\n\n               c.  Relation to Scheme to Defraud\r                                                            \r\n\n          As   explained  above,   under  the   court's  jury\r\n\ninstructions   regarding  the  scheme  to  defraud,  Sawyer's\r\n\nintentional  violations of  the gift  statute, by  their very\r\n\noccurrence (or ipso facto), must deprive the public  of their\r                                     \r\n\nlegislators' honest services.   Sawyer challenges  this legal\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\npremise,  arguing  that such  violations  do  not necessarily\r\n\ndeprive  the public  of those  services.10   For  the reasons\r\n\nthat follow, we agree.\r\n\n          The gift statute, which forbids a legislative agent\r\n\nfrom \"knowingly and wilfully\" giving a \"public official . . .\r\n\ngifts with an aggregated value of one hundred dollars or more\r\n\nin  a calendar  year,\" Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 268B,    6, simply\r\n\nlimits, by  a dollar-amount, the gift-giving  by lobbyists to\r\n\nlegislators.   It  is a  prophylactic civil  prohibition that\r\n\naddresses  appearances of -- but not actual -- corruption.  A\r\n\nviolation  of  the   Massachusetts  gift  statute   does  not\r\n\nnecessarily  entail any  improper  motive  to  influence,  or\r\n\notherwise affect,  the official duties of the  recipient.  It\r                                                  \r\n\nis possible for a lobbyist to give a legislator items falling\r\n\nwithin  the   statute's  definition  of  \"gift,\"   or  for  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  The  government claims that  Sawyer has  only challenged\r\nthe  evidentiary sufficiency  of his  fraudulent intent,  and\r\nthus has waived  a jury instruction  challenge on the  issue.\r\nWe disagree.   While Sawyer ultimately  endeavors to persuade\r\nus  that  the  evidence   was  insufficient  to  support  his\r\nconviction, he squarely challenges the very legal theory upon\r\nwhich  he  was convicted.    He  particularly challenges  the\r\ngovernment's theory (as accepted by the district court) that,\r\nas a matter of law, the scheme to defraud could be predicated\r\nupon  state  law  violations  alone, without  the  intent  to\r\ndeprive the  public  of honest  services.   Sawyer  not  only\r\nlodged  an adequate  objection on this  issue with  the trial\r\ncourt, see supra note  8, his brief to this  court thoroughly\r                            \r\naddresses the  precise legal issues surrounding the interplay\r\nbetween  the  mail  statute,  the  state  statutes,  and  the\r\nrequirement of  fraudulent intent.   The legal  arguments are\r\nsharply  presented and the record is adequate for our review.\r\nThus, we conclude that the issue is properly before us.\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nlegislator  to  accept such  gifts,  without  an accompanying\r\n\nintent to  cause the  legislator to deviate  from the  honest\r\n\nperformance  of  official duties.    While  such gifts  would\r\n\nconstitute   a   gift-statute  violation,   not   every  such\r\n\ncircumstance would necessarily amount to a deviation from the\r\n\nofficial's performance  of honest  services to  the public.11\r\n\nThus, unlike the honest services fraud cases, noted above, in\r\n\nwhich an official was bribed or took official action based on\r\n\na secret conflict of interest, a gift statute violation, even\r\n\nif intentional, does not in itself  amount to honest services\r\n\nfraud.\r\n\n          While  the  Massachusetts' citizenry  expects their\r\n\nlegislators to comply with  laws pertaining to their official\r\n\ncapacity, the  presence of such illegal  conduct, even though\r\n\nit relates to public office, does not by itself (or,  per se)\r                                                                        \r\n\nestablish honest services  fraud.

To allow  every transgression of state governmental\r\n\nobligations to  amount to  mail fraud would  effectively turn\r\n\nevery such  violation into a  federal felony; this  cannot be\r\n\ncountenanced.\r\n\n          Because  the court's instructions  allowed the jury\r\n\nto equate  a gift statute  violation with the  deprivation of\r\n\nhonest  services,  it  also permitted  the  jury  to find  an\r\n\n\"intent to defraud\"  from the intent to violate  the statute,\r\n\nwithout more.   To  establish the  scheme to  defraud through\r\n\nthese violations, however, it must also have been charged and\r\n\nshown  that   the  intent  behind  the   violations  was  the\r                                     \r\n\ndeprivation of honest services.  See D'Amato, 39 F.3d at 1257\r                                                        \r\n\n(explaining that where  harm is not  the necessary result  of\r\n\nthe  scheme, independent  evidence  of fraudulent  intent  is\r\n\nrequired).

Because this  language\r\n\nentails some connection between  the gift and the performance\r\n\nof official duties, a gratuity statute violation --  unlike a\r\n\ngift  statute  violation  --  may  itself  be  sufficient  to\r\n\nimplicate the duty of  honest services in a  given case.   As\r\n\nwith the  gift statute, however,  not every violation  of the\r\n\ngratuity  statute  automatically  encompasses  an  intent  to\r\n\ninduce the  public  official to  alter  or deviate  from  the\r\n\nperformance of honest and impartial services.  We explain.\r\n\n          A Massachusetts gratuity offense does not require a\r\n\nfinding of corrupt intent, i.e., improper intent to influence\r                                           \r\n\nofficial decision  making.

Rather,  only some lesser\r\n\nintent  need be  shown.  A  jury might  be charged  to find a\r\n\nbribery or gratuity offense in the alternative, thus allowing\r\n\nit to convict for a gratuity offense  if it is convinced that\r\n\nthe defendant gave  something to a public official because of\r\n\nan  official act, but is not persuaded that the defendant had\r\n\na corrupt intent to  influence that act.  See,  e.g., Dutney,\r                                                                        \r\n\n348 N.E.2d at 821.\r\n\n          As the  word \"gratuity\"  implies,  the intent  most\r\n\noften associated with  the offense is the  intent to \"reward\"\r\n\nan official for an  act taken in the past  or to be taken  in\r\n\nthe  future.   See Mariano,  983 F.2d  at 1159  (noting that,\r                                      \r\n\nunlike one who bribes, the gratuity offender \"gives  the gift\r\n\nwithout  attaching any  strings,  intending it  instead as  a\r\n\nreward for actions the public  official has already taken  or\r\n\nis  already committed  to  take\").   The  official act  might\r\n\notherwise  be properly  motivated; and  the  gratuity, though\r\n\nunlawful, might  not be intended to  influence the official's\r\n\nmindset  with regard  to  that particular  action.   In  some\r\n\ncases, such as  a reward for  long-past official action,  the\r\n\nintent to influence could  not possibly exist.  A  finding of\r\n\nhonest services fraud, however, requires, in connection  with\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 268A,   2(a) (emphasis added).\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nthe gratuity, the intent to cause an official to deviate from\r\n\nthe honest performance of services.\r\n\n          Thus,  as  with  the   gift  statute,  proof  of  a\r\n\nviolation  of the  Massachusetts  gratuity  statute,  without\r\n\nmore, does not establish an  intent to commit honest services\r\n\nfraud.   The  government  must  prove that  the  conduct  was\r\n\naccompanied by the  requisite intent.   This intent could  be\r\n\nshown  in a  number of  ways.   For example,  a bribery-like,\r\n\ncorrupt intent to influence official action necessarily is an\r\n\nintent  to  deprive  the   public  of  an  official's  honest\r\n\nservices.   A  person might  not,  however, give  an unlawful\r\n\ngratuity with the intent  to effect a specific quid  pro quo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRather,  as  the  government  contends here,  a  person  with\r\n\ncontinuing and  long-term interests before an  official might\r\n\nengage  in  a  pattern  of   repeated,  intentional  gratuity\r\n\noffenses in  order to coax ongoing  favorable official action\r\n\nin  derogation of  the public's  right to  impartial official\r\n\nservices.   Such  conduct would  be akin  to (although  not a\r\n\nclassic case of) the conflict of  interest cases noted above.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 567; Silvano, 812 F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n759.  Here, for  example, while Sawyer may not  have provided\r\n\nthe legislators with direct kickbacks  or commissions arising\r\n\nout of the specific official action, he may have intended the\r\n\nlegislators  generally  to  treat   preferentially  Hancock's\r\n\ninterests,  knowing that  the free meals,  entertainment, and\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\ngolf would continue so long as  favorable official acts were,\r\n\nat some point, taken.\r\n\n          In this case, the district  court did not, in fact,\r\n\ninstruct  the jury on a true \"gratuity\" offense.  Instead, it\r\n\ninstructed the  jury that,  to establish a  gratuity offense,\r\n\nthe  government must  prove  that Sawyer  \"gave something  of\r\n\nsubstantial  value  to  a   legislator  with  the  intent  to\r                                                                         \r\n\ninfluence  an official act  of that legislator.\"   While this\r                                      \r\n\ninstruction erroneously added an  intent-to-influence element\r\n\nto the gratuity offense,  it also had the effect  of charging\r\n\nthe jury  to find  the requisite intent  for honest  services\r\n\nfraud.14  \r\n\n          3.    Conclusion:  Scheme   to  Deprive  of  Honest\r                                                                         \r\n\nServices\r                    \r\n\n          The jury was permitted to find the first element of\r\n\nmail and wire fraud,  the scheme to defraud, upon  proof that\r\n\neither the gift statute or the gratuity statute was violated.\r\n\nThe  gift   statute  as  charged,  however,   was  a  legally\r                     \r\n\ninsufficient basis upon which to find  the scheme to defraud.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  The  court also  instructed the  jury that  it is  not a\r\ndefense to a gratuity charge that the official act would have\r\noccurred even if the gratuity had not been given.  See United\r                                                                         \r\nStates v. Previte,  648 F.2d 73, 82 (1st  Cir. 1981).  Sawyer\r                             \r\nassigns error  to this instruction, contending  that the fact\r\nthat the  act would  have occurred  without  the gratuity  is\r\nindicative of good faith.   Sawyer fails to explain, however,\r\nhow  the fact that an official act would have occurred anyway\r\ncould  have  affected  his  state  of  mind  when giving  the\r                                      \r\ngratuities.  The court's  instruction was a correct statement\r\nof the law, relevant to this case, and it was not in error.\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nAlthough  the  gratuity statute  was  properly  instructed in\r                                   \r\n\nterms  of honest services mail  fraud, we cannot  tell if the\r\n\nconvictions were based on  that statute or the insufficiently\r\n\ncharged  gift statute.  When  a jury has  been presented with\r\n\nseveral  bases  for  conviction,  one  of  which  is  legally\r\n\nerroneous, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury\r\n\nconvicted upon,  the conviction cannot stand.   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d 431, 435-36 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                            \r\n\n          The government contends that  if we find error with\r\n\nrespect to the gift statute, we should affirm the convictions\r\n\nbecause   the  jury  found  that  Sawyer  committed  gratuity\r\n\noffenses within  the Travel Act convictions, discussed infra.\r                                                                        \r\n\nWe cannot  assume from  the Travel Act  convictions, however,\r\n\nthat  the jury based its  mail and wire  fraud convictions on\r\n\nthe gratuity statute.  The court charged the jury to consider\r\n\neach  offense as separate bases  for the mail  and wire fraud\r\n\ncharges.   Accordingly,  the  possibility exists  that,  when\r\n\nconvicting  on the  mail  and wire  fraud  charges, the  jury\r\n\nfocused on violations of the gift statute, alone.  See Boots,\r                                                                        \r\n\n80 F.3d at 589  (declining to affirm conviction where  it was\r\n\npossible  that  the jury  focused  its  verdict on  erroneous\r\n\nbasis).   Thus, for the foregoing reasons,  Sawyer's mail and\r\n\nwire fraud convictions must be reversed.\r\n\n          Sawyer contends that  the evidence was insufficient\r\n\nto  prove an  intent to  influence the  legislators' official\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nacts  and that  therefore his  conviction should  be reversed\r\n\nwithout the possibility  of retrial.   We cannot  agree.   At\r\n\ntrial,  there  was  evidence  that  Sawyer  intentionally and\r\n\nrepeatedly   provided  legislators  with  valuable  gifts  of\r\n\nentertainment for the purpose  of obtaining \"greater  access\"\r\n\nto,15  and  of  developing  a  \"certain  relationship  with,\"\r\n\nlegislators.  A  jury could credit  Sawyer's defense that  he\r\n\nthought his expenditures were lawful and that they were meant\r\n\nonly for goodwill entertaining.   Taking the evidence in  the\r\n\nlight most favorable to  the prosecution, however, see United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

Ct. 522 (1995),  a jury could  also rationally infer,\r\n\nbeyond  a  reasonable doubt  that  Sawyer  intended that  his\r\n\nrepeated  gifts and  gratuities would  induce legislators  to\r\n\nperform   official  acts   to  benefit   Hancock's  interests\r\n\nregardless of,  or at  the expense  of, the public  interest.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  We  do  not think  that the  desire  to gain  access, by\r\nitself,  amounts to  an  intent to  influence improperly  the\r\nlegislators'  exercise of  official duties.   The  government\r\npoints  to no legislative duty to provide equal access to all\r\nmembers of the public;  and, from a practical  standpoint, we\r\ndoubt one exists.   See Sawyer, 878 F. Supp. at 294 (striking\r                                          \r\nphrase  \"free  from  favoritism\"  from  indictment's list  of\r\nlegislators' duties).   True,  Sawyer's very  job description\r\nrequired him to develop contacts  in the Legislature, and, as\r\nwith all lobbyists, his employment  goal was to persuade  and\r\ninfluence legislators  to benefit  certain  interests.   Such\r\nendeavors, however,  are protected by the  right \"to petition\r\nthe Government for a redress  of grievance\" guaranteed by the\r\nFirst Amendment of the United States Constitution, see United\r                                                                         \r\nStates  v.

Our  comments are\r\n\naddressed primarily to  the mail fraud  statute but apply  in\r\n\nsome  measure to the  Travel Act charge,  discussed infra, as\r                                                                     \r\n\nwell.  Two problems are of specific concern to us.\r\n\n          First, concerning the theft of honest services jury\r\n\ninstruction, an  overemphasis on  what state law  forbids may\r\n\nlead the jury to  believe that state rather than  federal law\r\n\ndefines the  crime, or more specifically,  that any violation\r\n\nof a state law or  regulation concerning lobbying or  related\r\n\nmatters amounts  to honest  services fraud.    Wire and  mail\r\n\nfraud are  federal offenses;  and while state  violations may\r                              \r\n\nplay a  role, the jury should not be allowed to slip into the\r\n\nmisunderstanding  that any  violation of  proliferating state\r\n\nlaws  and regulations  controlling  this  area  automatically\r\n\namounts to a federal crime.\r\n\n          In  a similar vein, we think there exists a risk in\r\n\nthis case -- particularly in view of the prosecutor's closing\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nargument  with  its repeated  emphasis on  permissible dollar\r\n\nlimits in  lobbying --  that the jury  could wrongly  believe\r\n\nthat  any expenditure  in  excess of  that  allowed by  state\r\n\nstatute or  regulation  by  itself  constitutes  the  federal\r\n\noffense.    The  district  court has  ample  authority  under\r\n\nFederal  Rule of  Evidence 403  to limit  evidence concerning\r\n\nstate law  requirements where that evidence  is substantially\r\n\nmore  prejudicial than probative.   And, in  all events, jury\r\n\ninstructions need to make  clear that for the federal  honest\r\n\nservices  fraud  to be  proven, the  defendant must  have the\r\n\nintent to  affect a  legislator's performance of  an official\r\n\nact  and not merely to make  payments in excess of some state\r\n\nspecified limitations.\r\n\nB.  Intent to Deceive\r                                 \r\n\n          Whether or not  a new  trial on the  mail and  wire\r\n\nfraud  counts  is allowable  requires  us  to reach  Sawyer's\r\n\nadditional contention  that the evidence  was insufficient to\r\n\nestablish his intent  to deceive  the public.   To this  end,\r\n\nSawyer contends that because the government did not establish\r\n\nthat  he had  a  duty  to  disclose  his  illegal  gifts  and\r\n\ngratuities to  the public, his  intent to deceive  the public\r\n\nhad to be shown through affirmative acts of deception,  which\r\n\nhe claims are absent here.\r\n\n          To  establish  mail  fraud  --  in  cases involving\r\n\nhonest  services fraud  and otherwise  -- the  alleged scheme\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nmust involve deception in the deprivation of money, property,\r\n\nor the right to  honest services.

Thus, an official's\r\n\nintentional violation  of the  duty to disclose  provides the\r\n\nrequisite \"deceit.\"  See  id. at 760 (noting that  failure to\r                                         \r\n\ndisclose \"under circumstances  where the non-disclosure could\r\n\nor does result in harm to the employer is a  violation of the\r\n\nmail  fraud  statute\")  (citation  and   internal  quotations\r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          Here,  although the  issue  has  not  been  clearly\r\n\npresented  by  the parties,  it  appears  that the  requisite\r\n\nintent  to  deceive  could  have been  shown  either  through\r\n\nSawyer's own acts of deception toward the public with respect\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\na change in this requirement for establishing honest services\r\nmail or  wire  fraud.   Thus, while  it may  be difficult  to\r\nconceive  of  a scheme  to deprive  someone  of the  right to\r\nhonest services without intending to deceive that person, the\r\nintent to deceive must nonetheless be established.\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nto  the  gift/gratuity  statute  violations, or  through  his\r\n\nefforts to  ensure that  the legislators deceived  the public\r\n\nwith respect to the violations.  The latter requires evidence\r\n\nonly  that   Sawyer  intended   to   cause  the   legislators\r\n\nintentionally to  fail to disclose material information about\r\n\nthe  violations,17 although  evidence  that  he intended  the\r\n\nlegislators  to affirmatively misrepresent themselves in this\r\n\nregard would also suffice.   At bottom, the evidence  must be\r\n\nsufficient to establish Sawyer's intent that, in the end, the\r\n\npublicbedeceivedwith respecttohisunlawfulgifts andgratuities.\r\n\n          Therefore,  we  must  determine  if  the admissible\r\n\nevidence,  viewed  in  light  most favorable  to  the  jury's\r\n\nverdict,  is  sufficient for  a  rational jury  to  find that\r\n\nSawyer  intended that  the public  be deceived.

The evidence need not compel an\r                  \r\n\nintent-to-deceive finding; rather, it is only required that a\r\n\nreasonable jury  could  be  persuaded,  beyond  a  reasonable\r\n\ndoubt, that Sawyer  had such  intent.

Ostensibly,  a\r                   \r\n\nperson  could offer an illegal bribe to a public official and\r\n\nnot  be concerned  with  its  secrecy.   Thus,  the  evidence\r\n\npresented must permit a finding that Sawyer not only gave the\r\n\nunlawful  gifts or gratuities with the  intent to deprive the\r\n\npublic  of  honest services,  but  that he  also  intended to\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\ndeceive the public about that conduct.

Much of his entertainment of lobbyists\r\n\ntook   place  out-of-state   --  usually   at  industry   and\r\n\nlegislative conferences -- where members of the Massachusetts\r\n\ncitizenry  generally  would   not  observe  the  questionable\r\n\nactivities.   Unlike his acts  of \"non-public\" entertainment,\r\n\nSawyer ensured compliance with  state ethical standards for a\r\n\n1993  Boston Marathon  brunch,  potentially  a  high  profile\r\n\nevent.    In  his  office,  Sawyer  kept  newspaper  articles\r\n\nreporting  legislators'  activities  with  lobbyists,  and in\r\n\nparticular, the ethical  ramifications of such relationships.\r\n\nIn one article, Representative  Mara (a recipient of Sawyer's\r\n\nunlawful gifts or gratuities)  is quoted as saying, \"Everyone\r\n\npicks up their own  tabs at [legislative] conferences. .  . .\r\n\nThese  conferences have  become almost  nonexistent.\"   These\r\n\narticles  were   kept  in  notebooks  with   other  materials\r\n\nregarding lobbying laws.\r\n\n          A  jury  rationally  could  infer that  Sawyer  was\r\n\ncognizant of his ethical obligations in lobbying, knew of the\r\n\npublic awareness  of lobbying activity,  and repeatedly  gave\r\n\nhidden unlawful  gifts and  gratuities until he  was publicly\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\nexposed.

The  government  also  presented  evidence  that  Sawyer\r\nsomehow concealed his  expenditures on  legislators from  his\r\nHancock superiors  other than Hathaway.   The government does\r\nnot  argue that  this evidence  can amount  to the  requisite\r\ndeceptive conduct, nor did  it rely on it to prove the intent\r\nto deceive.  In any event, Sawyer's deceptive conduct  toward\r\nHancock, alone, cannot form the basis of this honest services\r\nfraud conviction.   Rather, the  alleged victims of  the mail\r\nfraud  -- here, the state and the  public -- must be the ones\r\ndeceived.  Thus,  in order  for any deception  of Hancock  to\r\nform a part of the scheme to deprive the Commonwealth and her\r\ncitizens of  legislators' honest services, some  showing that\r\nsuch  conduct  was connected  to  the  defrauding of  alleged\r\nvictims is required.

L. ch. 268A,   3, in  violation of 18 U.S.C.   1952 (the\r\n\n\"Travel  Act\").19     The  government  asserted  that  Sawyer\r\n\nviolated  the  Massachusetts gratuity  statute  subsequent to\r\n\ninterstate  travel  to  the  following  destinations:  Tulsa,\r\n\nOklahoma;  Orlando,  Florida; Savannah,  Georgia; Scottsdale,\r\n\nArizona;  Key Largo,  Florida;  Charleston,  South  Carolina;\r\n\nAmelia Island, Florida; and Puerto Rico.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n19.  The Travel Act proscribes  travel in interstate commerce\r\n\"with intent to .  . . promote, manage, establish,  carry on,\r\nor  facilitate the  promotion, management,  establishment, or\r\ncarrying on, of any unlawful activity.\"  18 U.S.C.   1952(a).\r\n\"Unlawful activity\" is defined as, inter alia, \"bribery . . .\r                                                         \r\nin violation of the  laws of the State in which  committed or\r\nof  the United  States.\"   18  U.S.C.    1952(b); see  United\r                                                                         \r\nStates  v. Arruda, 715  F.2d 671, 681  (1st Cir. 1983).   The\r                             \r\ndistrict court instructed  the jury that  a violation of  the\r\ngratuity statute  constituted \"unlawful\" activity  within the\r\npurview of  the Travel Act, a view with which we agree to the\r\nextent that the court instructed that  something of value was\r\ngiven in  order to influence  the performance of  an official\r\nact.   Sawyer does not  dispute that a  gratuity violation of\r\nthis character is \"bribery\" for purposes of the Travel Act.\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                          45\r\r\n\n          Sawyer argues that his Travel  Act convictions must\r\n\nbe reversed because: (1) the court erroneously instructed the\r\n\njury  on   the  gratuity   statute;  (2)  the   evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient  to  establish the  gratuity  offenses; (3)  the\r\n\ncourt  barred him  from  presenting evidence  crucial to  his\r\n\ndefense;  and  (4)  the  court  improperly  admitted  summary\r\n\nevidence introduced  by the government.   Although we discuss\r\n\nand  reject each of  these arguments in  turn, we nonetheless\r\n\nreverse his  conviction on these counts  because the district\r\n\ncourt's  instructions on  the meaning  of \"bribery,\"  for the\r\n\npurposes of the Travel Act, were fatally flawed.\r\n\nA.  Gratuity Statute Jury Instructions\r                                                  \r\n\n          Because   the  Travel  Act  convictions  rely  upon\r\n\nviolations  of the  Massachusetts  gratuity  statute, we  now\r\n\naddress  an  additional  state-law  aspect  of  the  gratuity\r\n\nstatute about which the parties disagree.\r\n\n          The  gratuity statute  requires  that the  item  of\r\n\n\"substantial value\"  be given \"for or because of any official\r\n\nact  performed or to be performed.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 268A,\r\n\n  3(a).   An \"official act\"  is defined as:  \"any decision or\r\n\naction  in  a  particular  matter  or  in  the  enactment  of\r\n\nlegislation.\"    Mass. Gen.  L.  ch. 268A,    1(h).20   Here,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n20.  A \"particular matter\" is further defined as:\r\n\n          any   judicial   or   other   proceeding,\r\n          application,  submission,  request for  a\r\n          ruling or  other determination, contract,\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\nSawyer  allegedly  bestowed gratuities  upon  legislators who\r\n\nwere  members of the Insurance Committee.  Thus, for purposes\r\n\nof  this  discussion,  we  proceed on  the  theory  that  the\r\n\ngovernment had to prove that Sawyer gave the gratuities  \"for\r\n\nor because of . .  . any decision or action in  the enactment\r\n\nof legislation.\"  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 268A,    3(a), 1(h).\r                                 \r\n\n          The  parties'  interpretations   of  the   gratuity\r\n\nstatute differ with respect to the scope and character of the\r\n\nconnection required  between  the gratuity  and the  official\r\n\nact.  Sawyer contends  that the gratuity must be  linked to a\r\n\nspecific, identifiable official  act.  The  government argues\r\n\nthat  it is sufficient to  prove that the  gratuity would not\r\n\nhave been  given but  for  the legislator's  ability to  take\r\n\nofficial action favorable to Sawyer.  In a pretrial ruling on\r\n\nSawyer's motions  to dismiss, the district  court agreed with\r\n\nthe government's interpretation, and instructed as such.21\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          claim,  controversy, charge,  accusation,\r\n          arrest, decision, determination, finding,\r\n          but   excluding   enactment  of   general\r\n          legislation . . .\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 268A,   1(k).\r\n\n21.  The  court's jury  instructions  on this  issue were  as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n          I instruct you that the government has to\r\n          prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that the\r\n          defendant   intended  to   influence  the\r\n          action  of the legislator on any official\r\n          matter  which  was  pending   before  the\r\n          legislator or  which  may, by  law,  have\r\n          been  brought  before  the legislator  at\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\n          No Massachusetts court decision has yet interpreted\r\n\nthe operative \"for  or because of any official  act\" language\r\n\nin ch. 268A,   3(a).   To support their respective positions,\r\n\nthe  parties  present   differing  arguments  regarding   the\r\n\nstatutory language, legislative history, comparable statutes,\r\n\nand  State  Ethics Commission  rulings.    We consider  these\r\n\nsources separately.\r\n\n          1.  Statutory Language\r                                            \r\n\n          The  gratuity  statute   prohibits  the  giving  of\r\n\ngratuities \"for or because  of any official act  performed or\r\n\nto be  performed.\"  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 268A,   3.  The statute\r\n\ndoes not  read \"for or  because of the  official's position.\"\r                    \r\n\nRather, it forbids gratuities motivated by \"any official act\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          some later time.\r\n               . . . .\r\n               I  further  instruct  you  that  the\r\n          government  need  not   prove  that   the\r\n          alleged gratuity was linked to a specific\r\n          identifiable  act.   In other  words, the\r\n          government  need  not   prove  that   the\r\n          gratuity  was given  as a  quid pro  quo;\r\n          that is, in exchange for any one specific\r\n          act performed or  to be performed by  the\r\n          legislator.  The government does not have\r\n          to  show  that  there  was  an  agreement\r\n          between the defendant and  the legislator\r\n          requiring   the  legislator   to  perform\r\n          certain   acts   in   exchange  for   the\r\n          gratuity.\r\n               The government  must prove, however,\r\n          that  the  defendant  gave   the  alleged\r\n          gratuity   to   a  legislator   with  the\r\n          expectation that the legislator would use\r\n          his influence on official matters in ways\r\n          favorable to the defendant.\r\n\n                             -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\nand  further  defines, rather  meticulously,  \"official act.\"\r\n\nSee Mass. Gen. L. ch. 268A,    1(h) &amp; (k).  Thus, on the face\r               \r\n\nof the statute, it  does not appear that the  unlawfulness of\r\n\nthe  gratuity could  be  established  by  proof that  it  was\r\n\nmotivated solely by the official's position.  In other words,\r\n\nproof of  the offense requires  something more than  a simple\r\n\nshowing that \"but for\" the official's authority, the gratuity\r\n\nwould not have been given.22\r\n\n          This observation,  however,  does not  lead to  the\r\n\nconclusion that the gratuity must be shown to be motivated by\r\n\na  specifically identified official  act.  As  noted supra, a\r                                                                      \r\n\ngratuity  offense is  essentially a  bribery  offense without\r\n\nproof of  \"corrupt intent.\"  The concern  behind the gratuity\r\n\nstatute,  like   the  bribery   statute,  is   the  potential\r\n\nundermining  of  official integrity.    A  gratuity does  not\r\n\ncompromise this  integrity because of its  possible effect on\r\n\nthe  official's  \"position\"; rather,  the  danger  is in  its\r\n\nability to affect the official's performance of duties, i.e.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n\"official  acts.\"    It is  not  surprising,  then, that  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n22.  For example, if the parent of a student gives the school\r\nprincipal  a  gift  of  substantial value  at  the  student's\r\ngraduation,  that  alone  would  not  constitute  a  gratuity\r\noffense, even though the parent would not have given the gift\r\n\"but for\" the  principal's position.   If, however, the  gift\r\nwas given under circumstances in which the principal  had the\r\ndiscretion  to  decide  whether  or  not  the  student  would\r\ngraduate, a gratuity offense might be found.\r\n\n                             -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n\nstatute  proscribes gratuities  motivated by  \"official acts\"\r\n\nrather than \"official position.\"\r\n\n          Thus, the use of the term \"official act\" appears to\r\n\nensure that  the gratuity would be deemed  unlawful only when\r\n\nthe giving of an item of \"substantial value\" is linked to the\r\n\nofficial's performance of duties.  The connection between the\r\n\ngratuity  and the  performance of  official duties,  however,\r\n\ndoes not necessarily require the identification of a specific\r\n\nofficial act, and we  find nothing in the statutory  language\r\n\nto require such a demonstration.\r\n\n          2.  Legislative History\r                                             \r\n\n          The  gratuity statute  was based,  in part,  upon a\r\n\nbill drafted  by a  1962 Massachusetts Special  Commission on\r\n\nCode of Ethics.  See Report of the Special Commission on Code\r                                \r\n\nof Ethics, 1962  House Doc. No.  3650, p.8.   Nothing in  the\r\n\nCommission's Report,  however,  assists us  in resolving  the\r\n\ninstant question.  It  states only: \"It should be  noted that\r\n\nto  constitute a criminal act, the giving or receiving of the\r\n\nitem  of such `substantial value' must be `for or because of'\r\n\nan official act.\"  Id. at 11; see Commonwealth v. Famigletti,\r                                                                        \r\n\n354  N.E.2d  890, 893  (Mass.  Ct.  App. 1976)  (noting  same\r\n\nlanguage  in the report).  The Report neither parses out what\r\n\nthese terms  mean, nor gives  examples of what  was intended.\r\n\nFrom  this we discern only that  the Commission was concerned\r\n\n                             -50-\r                                          50\r\r\n\nthat \"innocent\" gifts to officials would  not fall within the\r\n\ngratuity statute's purview.\r\n\n          The Commission's  report does tell  us that \"[m]uch\r\n\nof the  language of  the  proposed legislation  is taken  and\r\n\nadapted from  [a  proposed federal  bribery/gratuity  bill].\"\r\n\nReport of  Special Commission, supra  at 8;  see Dutney,  348\r                                                                   \r\n\nN.E.2d  at  822 n.16.    As  discussed  below,  however,  the\r\n\ncomparable federal gratuity  statute, 18 U.S.C.   201(c),  is\r\n\nalso unhelpful in resolving the question before us.\r\n\n          3.

Lapham, 156 Mass.\r                                                              \r\n\n480,  31  N.E.  638  (Mass.   1892),  and  on  federal  cases\r\n\ninterpreting   the  federal   gratuity  statute,   18  U.S.C.\r\n\n  201(c).\r\n\n          Lapham  involved a  milk  dealer who  attempted  to\r                            \r\n\nbribe a city milk inspector and was convicted under a statute\r\n\npunishing anyone who:\r\n\n          corruptly  gives,  offers or  promises to\r\n          any  executive,  legislative  .  .  .  or\r\n          judicial  officer   .  .  .any   gift  or\r\n          gratuity   whatever,   with   intent   to\r\n          influence   his   act,   vote,   opinion,\r\n          decision,  or  judgment  on  any  matter,\r\n          question, cause, or proceeding, which may\r\n          be then pending, or may by law come or be\r\n          brought  before  him   in  his   official\r\n          capacity.\r\n\n                             -51-\r                                          51\r\r\n\nMass.  Pub. St. ch. 205,   9  (Ch. 349 Revised May 21, 1891);\r\n\nsee Lapham, 31 N.E. at  638-39.  The milk dealer  argued that\r                      \r\n\nthe indictment  was insufficient  because it  did not  aver a\r\n\nparticular  matter  to  be  influenced.    Id.    The Supreme\r                                                          \r\n\nJudicial Court disagreed, reasoning as follows:\r\n\n          Nor  is  it  necessary in  an  indictment\r\n          under  [ch. 205,    9]  to aver  that the\r\n          corrupt intention to  influence the  act,\r\n          opinion,  decision  or  judgment  of  the\r\n          inspector was in relation to any specific\r\n          and particular matter then pending before\r\n          him,  or which was  then expected to come\r\n          before  him.   It  is  enough  to aver  a\r\n          corrupt  intention so to influence him in\r\n          any matter which may  then be pending, or\r\n          which may  by  law  come  or  be  brought\r\n          before him.  If for example an executive,\r\n          legislative or judicial officer is bribed\r\n          corruptly to favor a particular person in\r\n          any and all matters affecting that person\r\n          which  may  come  before   such  officer,\r\n          without specification or knowledge of the\r\n          particular matters likely to come up, the\r\n          statute is broad enough to include such a\r\n          case.    A  narrower  construction  of  a\r\n          similar  statute  has  been   adopted  in\r\n          Alabama,   but   we  cannot   follow  it.\r\n          Barefield v. State, 14 Ala. 603 [1848].\r                                        \r\n\nId. at 639.\r               \r\n\n          The  difficulty with  the government's  reliance on\r\n\nLapham is, of course, the fact that it involved a differently\r                  \r\n\nworded statute.  The Lapham statute proscribes a corrupt gift\r                                       \r\n\nto  influence an official act \"on any  matter . . . which may\r                                                                         \r\n\nbe then pending or may  by law come or be brought  before him\r                                  \r\n\nin his  official capacity.\"  Mass. Pub. St. ch. 205,   9 (Ch.\r\n\n349  Revised May 21, 1891) (emphasis added).  In holding that\r\n\n                             -52-\r                                          52\r\r\n\nan  averment  of a  specific  matter was  not  necessary, the\r\n\nLapham  court repeatedly used the word \"may.\"  See, e.g., id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n(\"It  is enough to aver  a corrupt intention  so to influence\r\n\nhim in any matter which may then be pending, or  which may by\r                                                                      \r\n\nlaw come or be brought before him.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\n          The  question is  whether the  absence of  the word\r\n\n\"may\"  in the present gratuity statute, see Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r                                                       \r\n\n268A,    3,  1(h) &amp; (k), signifies,  by negative implication,\r\n\nthe requirement of a specific official act.  The reasoning in\r\n\nLapham does  seem to  indicate some relationship  between the\r                  \r\n\nword  \"may\" and the absence of a specificity requirement.  We\r\n\nthink, however, that it  does not follow that the  word \"may\"\r\n\nis  the  only manner  in  which to  indicate  that particular\r\n\nofficial  acts need  not  be shown  to  establish a  gratuity\r\n\noffense.\r\n\n          The  present  statute  proscribes  a  gift \"for  or\r\n\nbecause   of   any   official   act  performed   or   to   be\r                              \r\n\nperformed,\"23  and  further defines  \"official  act\" as  \"any\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n23.  The  phrase  \"performed  or  to  be  performed\"  affords\r\ntemporal flexibility  between the gratuity and any motivating\r\nofficial  act.   Mass. Gen.  L. ch  268A   3(a);  Dutney, 348\r                                                                    \r\nN.E.2d at  821  n.14.   This  temporal  flexibility  is  also\r\npresent  in the Lapham statute (\"may then be pending or which\r                                  \r\nmay by  law come  or be brought  before him\"),  ch. 205,    9\r\n(1891),  as well as the federal gratuity statute (\"may at any\r\ntime be pending, or  which may by law  be brought before  [an\r\nofficial]\")  noted infra.   18  U.S.C.   201(a)(3).   In  our\r                                    \r\nview, and contrary to the district  court, while the language\r\naffording temporal flexibility is consistent with the absence\r\nof  an  official-act  specificity  requirement,  it  does not\r\ncompel that result.  See Sawyer, 878 F. Supp. at 287.\r                                           \r\n\n                             -53-\r                                          53\r\r\n\ndecision or action in a particular matter or in the enactment\r\n\nof legislation.\"    Mass. Gen.  L.  ch. 268A,     3(a),  1(h)\r\n\n(emphasis  added).  Use of the broad term \"any\" is consistent\r\n\nwith  a legislative  intent to  proscribe gifts  motivated by\r\n\nunidentified  official  acts.   Most  importantly,  given the\r\n\nreasoning  set  forth  in  Lapham,  we  think  that   if  the\r                                             \r\n\nMassachusetts  Legislature had  wanted to  drastically narrow\r\n\nthe scope  of the gratuity offense  by requiring specifically\r\n\nidentified official  acts, it would have  spoken more clearly\r\n\nthan  it has.    In the  end,  the Lapham  case  supports the\r                                                     \r\n\nconclusion that a gratuity offense may be established without\r\n\nproof that a specific official act was the motivation for the\r\n\ngratuity.\r\n\n          The  government also  relies on  cases interpreting\r\n\nthe  similarly  worded federal  gratuity  statute,  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  201(c),24  that  indicate  that  a  conviction  under  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n24.  The   federal  gratuity  statute,  18  U.S.C.    201(c),\r\nprovides, in pertinent part:\r\n\n          Whoever  -- [] otherwise than as provided\r\n          by  law  for   the  proper  discharge  of\r\n          official   duty   --   []   directly   or\r\n          indirectly  gives,  offers,  or  promises\r\n          anything of value  to any public official\r\n          . . . for or because of  any official act\r\n          performed  or to  be  performed  by  such\r\n          public   official   .   .  .   shall   be\r\n          [punished].\r\n\n          The term  \"official act\"  is further defined  in 18\r\nU.S.C.   201 (a)(3) as:\r\n\n                             -54-\r                                          54\r\r\n\nstatute  does  not require  a showing  that the  gratuity was\r\n\nlinked  to a specific official act.

That deference, however, is tempered not only by the\r\n\nfact that  no Massachusetts  court has passed  on the  Ethics\r\n\nCommission's  interpretation,  but  also because  this  is  a\r\n\ncriminal case and the Ethics Commission is charged only  with\r\n\ncivil enforcement.   The Commission may very  well have valid\r\n\nreasons for adopting a broad, prophylactic interpretation  of\r\n\nthe   statute  in   its  civil  dispositions   of  individual\r\n\n                             -57-\r                                          57\r\r\n\ntransgressions; its interpretation is easier to prove and the\r\n\noffender  is more likely to settle with the Commission if she\r\n\ndoes not have to admit to more egregious wrongdoing.\r\n\n          Nonetheless, we note  that the Ethics  Commission's\r\n\ninterpretation  of  the  gratuity   statute  has  been   left\r\n\nundisturbed  by   the  Massachusetts  Legislature,   and  its\r\n\ninterpretation   is   not    \"arbitrary,   unreasonable    or\r\n\ninconsistent\" with  the statute.

Thus,  the Ethics  Commission's opinion on  the matter\r\n\nfurther supports the conclusion  that a specific official act\r\n\nneed not be identified in a gratuity offense.\r\n\n          5.  Conclusion: Jury Instructions\r                                                       \r\n\n          The absence  of a  Massachusetts court  decision on\r\n\nthis  issue  is troubling.    We  have carefully  considered,\r\n\nhowever,  all  of the  authority  and  arguments on  Sawyer's\r\n\nbehalf,  and none of them is availing.   We also take note of\r\n\nthe  fact that Sawyer does  not cite a  single gratuity case,\r\n\neither  federal or  state (and  we have found  none), holding\r\n\nthat a specific official  act must be linked to  the unlawful\r\n\ngratuity.  Thus, we  conclude that the Massachusetts gratuity\r\n\nstatute does  not require  proof that  the offender  gave the\r\n\nitem  of  \"substantial  value\"  because   of  a  specifically\r\n\nidentified official  act.   Of course, the  identification of\r\n\ncertain official acts in relation to the gratuity  might make\r\n\n                             -58-\r                                          58\r\r\n\na  gratuity offense easier to prove, and we suspect that most\r\n\ncases will include such proof although it is unnecessary.\r\n\nB.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                                           \r\n\n          In  cases such  as this one,  it becomes  clear why\r\n\nparticular  official acts need not be shown.  The evidence at\r\n\ntrial showed that Sawyer  gave items (that could be  found to\r\n\nbe of  \"substantial value\") to Massachusetts  legislators who\r\n\nhad the ability to take official action favorable to Hancock,\r\n\nand that those gifts effectively ceased after the legislators\r\n\nleft  office.  While the government did not detail all of the\r\n\nlegislators'   acts  that  were  favorable  to  Hancock,  the\r\n\ngovernment  did show  that  Sawyer had  a long-term,  ongoing\r\n\ninterest in the official acts of the legislators, and that he\r\n\nknew his gratuities  were unlawful.  From  this evidence, the\r\n\njury  could  rationally   infer  that  the  gratuities   were\r\n\nmotivated by the legislators' performance of official duties,\r\n\ni.e.,  that they were given  \"for or because  of any official\r                \r\n\nact,\"  within  the  meaning  of  the  Massachusetts  gratuity\r\n\nstatute, Mass.

Exclusion of Skrine Memorandum\r                                                        \r\n\n          Sawyer  contends that  the court  unduly restricted\r\n\nthe  presentation of evidence  that he  entertained lawmakers\r\n\nsolely out  of friendship and  goodwill and he  believed that\r\n\n                             -59-\r                                          59\r\r\n\nthis did  not violate the gratuity  statute.25  Specifically,\r\n\nhe  appeals the court's  exclusion of a  document, written by\r\n\nBruce  Skrine, memorializing  Skrine's interview  with Sawyer\r\n\nafter the  Boston Globe's inquiry into the  Puerto Rico trip.\r\n\nThat  document   reflects   Sawyer's  assertion   that   such\r\n\nentertainment, while  perhaps excessive in Puerto  Rico, \"was\r\n\ncommonly done and that, [the] legislators were all friends of\r\n\nhis  and  that  they  were  not  in anyway  [sic]  discussing\r\n\nlegislation or lobbying.\"\r\n\n          At  trial, Sawyer  did  not attempt  to offer  this\r\n\ndocument  to  prove his  state of  mind  with respect  to his\r\n\nexpenditures.   In fact, he  indicated to the  court that its\r\n\nadmission was  not necessary because he  had already elicited\r\n\nthe  desired  testimony  from  Skrine.   Later  on,  however,\r\n\npointing out  that  the  document  did not  mention  that  he\r\n\nentertained  to \"gain access\"  to legislators, Sawyer offered\r\n\nit to impeach Skrine.  The court did not permit its admission\r\n\non  that basis,  but  it did  allow  Sawyer to  cross-examine\r\n\nSkrine on that very  issue.  Because Sawyer did not offer the\r\n\ndocument for the  purpose he  now asserts on  appeal, he  has\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n25.  Sawyer  also  raises  arguments  as to  his  good  faith\r\nconduct vis  a vis the gift statute, which is not relevant to\r                              \r\nthe Travel Act counts.  Such contentions would be relevant to\r\nthe mail and  wire fraud counts, which we have  reversed.  We\r\nleave  the good  faith  issues surrounding  the gift  statute\r\n(which are  dependent on the  evidence adduced at  trial) for\r\nthe  district   court  to  resolve  on   remand,  should  the\r\ngovernment choose to retry those counts.\r\n\n                             -60-\r                                          60\r\r\n\nforfeited  this claim.

Admission of Computer Summaries\r                                                         \r\n\n          Sawyer  assigns  reversible error  to  the district\r\n\ncourt's  admission of five charts, Exhibits 1, 1Q, 1R, 1S and\r\n\n1T,  proffered by the government.  Exhibit 1 was a forty-nine\r\n\npage   computer   printout   summarizing  612   expenditures,\r\n\noccurring  between January 1,  1986 and March  31, 1993, that\r\n\nwere  recorded  in  Sawyer's appointment  calendars,  expense\r\n\nrecords and other admitted documents.  Exhibits 1Q, 1R and 1S\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n26.  Sawyer also argues that the court erroneously refused to\r\ninstruct  the  jury on  his  defense-theory that  it  was his\r\nbelief  that   if  expenditures  were   permitted  under  the\r\nlobbying-disclosure obligations  set forth  in Mass.  Gen. L.\r\nch.  3,  then those  expenditures  (although they  had  to be\r\ndisclosed)  were  also allowed  under  the  gratuity statute.\r\nUpon review of the  record, we agree with the  district court\r\nthat this instruction was  unwarranted because Sawyer did not\r\npresent any  evidence that, during the  indictment period, he\r\nactually believed that his expenditures were permitted by the\r\nlobbying-disclosure laws.\r\n\n                             -61-\r                                          61\r\r\n\nare extracts of Exhibit  1 that isolate the  expenditures for\r\n\nRepresentatives Woodward,  Howarth  and Emilio.   Exhibit  1T\r\n\ncontrasts  the amount  spent  on those  three Representatives\r\n\nwhile they were  members of the  Legislature with the  amount\r\n\nspent on them after  they left that office.   Sawyer contends\r\n\nthat these charts were admitted on an insufficient foundation\r\n\nand that they were misleading, argumentative and prejudicial.\r\n\n          Federal   Rule  of   Evidence  1006   provides,  in\r\n\npertinent part:\r\n\n          The contents of voluminous writings . . .\r\n          which cannot conveniently be  examined in\r\n          court may  be presented in the  form of a\r\n          chart,  summary,  or  calculation.

He argues  that this was  unduly misleading\r\n\nbecause  it created a \"false  impression\" as to  the date the\r\n\nalleged  conspiracy  began,  and  falsely  implied  that  the\r\n\nexpenditures ended after the three named representatives left\r\n\noffice.  We disagree.\r\n\n          The  summaries  were  based  on  evidence  that was\r\n\nalready independently  admitted  and  that  was  relevant  to\r\n\nSawyer's  questionable  expenditures  during  the  indictment\r\n\nperiod.  Sawyer had the opportunity, on cross-examination, to\r\n\nplace  the  summaries in  context  with  his total  financial\r\n\nactivity.   See Nivica,  887  F.2d at  1125 (concluding  that\r                                  \r\n\nargument that summaries failed to, inter alia, reflect \"total\r                                                         \r\n\nfinancial  activity\"   \"affect[s]  weight  rather   than  the\r\n\nadmissibility\").

He also could have offered\r\n\nhis own  contrary evidence, including his  own summary (which\r\n\nhe did not do).  As we stated in Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1126:\r                                                   \r\n\n          So long as the government, exercising due\r\n          diligence, collects  whatever records are\r\n          reasonably  available   and  succeeds  in\r\n          introducing  them,  it  may be  permitted\r\n          (subject,  of  course,  to relevancy  and\r\n          perscrutation under Fed. R. Evid. 403) to\r\n          summarize  the  data  it  has  managed to\r\n          obtain.       If   defendants   possessed\r\n          exculpatory    records    not   in    the\r\n          government's   files,  they   could  have\r\n          offered them at  trial or prepared  their\r\n          own summary.  By the same token, if there\r\n          were gaps in the  charts, the defense . .\r\n          .  had every opportunity to exploit them.\r\n          In the last analysis, completeness of the\r\n          underlying records was for the jury.\r\n\nWe  conclude that  the summaries  were based on  a sufficient\r\n\nfoundation and that the court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n\nadmitting them.\r\n\nD.  Protective Instruction\r                                      \r\n\n          Having rejected all of Sawyer's arguments, we think\r\n\nthere  is one  flaw in the  proceedings that does  have to be\r\n\naddressed in the interests of justice and especially in light\r\n\nof  the possibility of future prosecutions of this kind.  Our\r\n\nconcern arises from  the close relationship  between lobbying\r\n\nactivities  that are  lawful from  the standpoint  of federal\r\n\nlaw,  even if  deplorable,  and associated  or slightly  more\r\n\nextreme versions of such  conduct that can constitute federal\r\n\nviolations.   The problem  is, in  some respects,  novel; the\r\n\n                             -64-\r                                          64\r\r\n\nreason for its novelty  is that it appears  that prosecutions\r\n\non facts like these have not generally been brought.\r\n\n          A review  of pre-McNally theft  of honest  services\r                                              \r\n\ncases and of bribery and gratuity cases under the counterpart\r\n\nfederal  statute,  18 U.S.C.    201,  indicates,  as we  have\r\n\nalready noted, that  most involved straightforward corruption\r\n\n--  most often, quid pro  quo bribery or  blatant conflict of\r                                         \r\n\ninterest.   While  the issue  in  those cases  was  typically\r\n\nwhether or not the conduct actually occurred, in most of them\r\n\nthe  alleged  conduct was  blatantly illegal.   This  case is\r\n\ndistinct   in  that  the  conduct  itself  may  not  be  very\r\n\ndifferent,  except  possibly  in  degree, from  the  kind  of\r\n\nroutine cultivation of friendship in a lobbying context that,\r\n\nwhile arguably very unattractive, is not \"bribery\" within the\r\n\nmeaning of the Travel Act.\r\n\n          The practice of using hospitality, including lavish\r\n\nhospitality, to cultivate business or political relationships\r\n\nis  longstanding  and pervasive.    The  government does  not\r\n\nargue,   and   we  do   not   believe,   that  payments   for\r\n\nentertainment,  lodging, golf,  sports events,  and the  like\r\n\nwould constitute  violations of the  Travel Act (or  the mail\r\n\nand  wire fraud  statutes) if  the aim  of the  lobbyist were\r\n\nsimply to cultivate a business or political \"friendship\" with\r\n\nthe legislator.   It may  well be that  all such  hospitality\r\n\nshould  be flatly prohibited by  law, but if  Sawyer had this\r\n\n                             -65-\r                                          65\r\r\n\nlimited  intent --  to  cultivate friendship  rather than  to\r\n\ninfluence an  official  act   --  the federal  statutes  here\r\n\ninvolved would not be violated.27\r\n\n          The charge to  the jury in  this case followed  the\r\n\nconventional  formula  for  prosecutions involving  political\r\n\ncorruption.   But  where  the difference  between lawful  and\r\n\nunlawful turns primarily on intent, and the lawful conduct is\r\n\nitself  most unattractive, we think the jury needs to be told\r\n\nspecifically that the defendant  has not violated the bribery\r\n\ncomponent  of the  Travel Act  (or committed  honest services\r\n\nfraud)  if  his intent  was  limited  to  the cultivation  of\r\n\nbusiness  or political  friendship.   Only if  instead or  in\r\n\naddition,  there is an intent to cause the recipient to alter\r\n\nher  official  acts  may the  jury  find  a  theft of  honest\r\n\nservices  or the bribery predicate of the Travel Act.  Absent\r\n\nsome explicit  explanation  of this  kind,  the  conventional\r\n\ncharge will be slanted in favor of conviction.28\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n27.  See, e.g.,  United States v.  Arthur, 544 F.2d  730 (4th\r                                                     \r\nCir. 1976); United States v. Brewster, 506 F.2d 62 (D.C.

It  is not  clear whether  the government  would contend\r\nthat  a gratuity  violation involving  only a  reward for  an\r\nofficial act (even without any intent to influence any future\r\nofficial act) could constitute  \"bribery\" for purposes of the\r\nTravel  Act.   We are  extremely doubtful whether  this would\r\nconstitute bribery  for these  purposes and  do not  read the\r\nSecond  Circuit as ruling on  this point in  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\nBiaggi, 853 F.2d 89, 100-02 (2d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489\r                                                                    \r\nU.S. 1052  (1989).    The  fact  that  a  gratuity  violation\r\ninvolving an intent to  influence is essentially bribery, see\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -66-\r                                          66\r\r\n\n          In reaching this conclusion, we intend no criticism\r\n\nof the able  district judge  who was coping  with a  somewhat\r\n\nnovel foray by the government.   But where, as here, the line\r\n\nbetween the merely unattractive and actually criminal conduct\r\n\nis  blurred,  the  court  must  take  pains  to  explain  the\r\n\ndifference  to the jury.   The Second Circuit  took this same\r\n\nview  in a closely related  context, saying: \"When an elected\r\n\nofficial who has  received campaign contributions is  charged\r\n\nwith  extortion and  with receiving  bribes, the  charge must\r\n\ncarefully  focus  the  jury's  attention  on  the  difference\r\n\nbetween   lawful   political   contributions   and   unlawful\r\n\nextortionate payments and bribes.\"   United States v. Biaggi,\r                                                                        \r\n\n909 F.2d 662, 695-96  (2d Cir. 1990), cert. denied,  499 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n904 (1991).\r\n\n          Having concluded that the jury charge was mistaken,\r\n\nwe must consider whether Sawyer should get the benefit of the\r\n\nerror.   This is a  close call.  On the  one hand, Sawyer did\r\n\nnot  explicitly  ask  for  the  sort  of  language  we  think\r\n\nappropriate.   Ordinarily,  the failure  to make  an explicit\r\n\nobjection requires  the defendant to satisfy  the plain error\r\n\ntest of United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 1777 (1993).\r                                          \r\n\nOn  the  other hand,  a  number of  Sawyer's  objections were\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n853  F.2d  at   101,  does  not  mean   that  every  possible\r\napplication  of a gratuity statute  fits the rubric.   In all\r\nevents, if the government  intends to rely upon an  intent to\r\ninfluence   theory,  our  protective   instruction  would  be\r\nrequired here.\r\n\n                             -67-\r                                          67\r\r\n\nclosely related in that they sought in several different ways\r\n\n-- which we do not  accept -- to protect one engaged  in good\r\n\nfaith lobbying from prosecution.\r\n\n          On balance, we think that the Travel Act counts, as\r\n\nwell  as the  mail and  wire fraud  convictions, ought  to be\r\n\nreversed and retried under proper instructions.  Although the\r\n\nevidence here would be adequate to infer improper intent, the\r\n\nissue  is close  and  an explanatory  instruction could  well\r\n\naffect  the outcome.  Also, the fact that the prosecution was\r\n\nnovel makes us  look more tolerantly  on Sawyer's failure  to\r\n\narticulate  precisely the  shape of the  necessary protective\r\n\ninstruction.\r\n\n          Apart from  the expense of retrial,  the government\r\n\nhas very  little to complain about  in this result.   We have\r\n\nagreed  that  the  Massachusetts  gratuity statute  does  not\r\n\nrequire the  government to  link the  gratuity to a  specific\r\n\nofficial act.  We  have also found that the evidence  here is\r\n\nsufficient to  convict (although  we  can imagine  reasonable\r\n\npeople  thinking  otherwise).    And while  we  are  somewhat\r\n\nconcerned about  the lack  of fair warning  of a  prosecution\r\n\nsuch  as this one, we  see no legal  basis for precluding the\r\n\ngovernment from embarking  on what is  in practical terms  an\r\n\nexpansive  reading of  the  federal statutes.   Against  this\r\n\nbackdrop, we think it even more important that Sawyer get the\r\n\nbenefit of the few protections that remain.\r\n\n                             -68-\r                                          68\r\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                       Conspiracy Count\r                                   Conspiracy Count\r                                                   \r\n\n          Sawyer was  also convicted, under  18 U.S.C.   371,\r\n\nof one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, and\r\n\nto violate the  Travel Act.   The court  instructed the  jury\r\n\nthat it could find  Sawyer guilty of conspiracy if  it found,\r\n\nbeyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  that  he  conspired  with  his\r\n\nsupervisor, Hathaway, to commit any one of the three objects,\r\n\ni.e., the  substantive offenses as  charged.  Because  all of\r                \r\n\nthe  objects  --  mail and  wire  fraud  and  the Travel  Act\r\n\nviolations  -- were  erroneously charged and  instructed, the\r\n\nconspiracy convictions must be reversed as well.\r\n\n          Retrial  is  not  precluded   if  the  evidence  is\r\n\nsufficient to  prove the existence of  a conspiracy, Sawyer's\r\n\nknowledge of and voluntary participation in it, and  an overt\r\n\nact in furtherance of it.   See United States v. Yefsky,  994\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 885, 890 (1st Cir.  1993); see generally, United  States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Ct. 1118  (1995).  Neither  the agreement nor\r                  \r\n\nSawyer's  participation  in it  need  be  proven with  direct\r\n\nevidence.   Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80 (1942);\r                                                \r\n\nsee Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653.\r                           \r\n\n            Sawyer   contends   that    the   evidence    was\r\n\ninsufficient  to prove  that: (1)  he and  Hathaway knowingly\r\n\nagreed   to  commit   the   offenses;   (2)  he   voluntarily\r\n\nparticipated  in such an  agreement; and  (3) either  of them\r\n\nperformed any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  We\r\n\ndisagree.   The government presented  evidence that  Hathaway\r\n\nsupervised   Sawyer  in   his  lobbying  activities.     From\r\n\nHathaway's receipt  of many of  the same legal  memoranda and\r\n\nMassachusetts Ethics Commission rulings that Sawyer received,\r\n\na  jury could  rationally infer  that Hathaway  (an attorney,\r\n\nlike Sawyer)  knew and understood the  ethical obligations in\r\n\nlobbying.   Some  of these  documents had  both  Sawyer's and\r\n\nHathaway's  names  on  them;  thus, a  jury  could  find that\r\n\nHathaway  and Sawyer  knew of  each other's knowledge  of the\r\n\nlobbying   laws.29     Sawyer   turned   to   Hathaway,   his\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n29.  For  example, one  trial exhibit  was a  memorandum from\r\nSawyer to Hathaway, enclosing  a 1990 State Ethics Commission\r\nDisposition  Agreement  with  House Majority  Leader  Charles\r\nFlaherty.   That  agreement concerned  the giving  of Celtics\r\nbasketball game  tickets  to  Representative  Flaherty  by  a\r\nperson with  interests before him, and how that might violate\r\nthe Massachusetts  gratuity statute, Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 268A,\r\n  3.  Sawyer and  Hathaway discussed the Flaherty Disposition\r\nduring a  meeting with Bruce Skrine  (vice president, counsel\r\nand  secretary  for Hancock)  in  which  Sawyer and  Hathaway\r\nexpressed concern  about compliance with state  ethics law in\r\n\n                             -70-\r                                          70\r\r\n\nsupervisor, for  approval of his expense  vouchers.  Hathaway\r\n\nperformed  this  responsibility  throughout   the  indictment\r\n\nperiod,  and  in so  doing was  the  only person  (other than\r\n\nSawyer)  to   have  detailed   knowledge   of  the   specific\r\n\nlegislators, often  members of  the Insurance Committee,  who\r\n\nreceived the gifts and gratuities.\r\n\n          Thus, the jury could reasonably infer that Hathaway\r\n\nand Sawyer both knew that the expenditures were unlawful, and\r\n\nfrom this, that the reason for the repeated illegal gifts and\r\n\ngratuities  to  key  legislators  was  to  secretly influence\r\n\nlegislative  action.   Given  the  evidence  of the  repeated\r\n\nsubmission and approval of the expense vouchers, a jury could\r\n\nrationally  find that  Hathaway and  Sawyer agreed,  at least\r\n\ntacitly, to  the pattern of  unlawful conduct.   Finally, the\r\n\njury  could also infer that Sawyer and Hathaway knew that the\r\n\nmails and wires would be used to facilitate the entertainment\r\n\nand/or reimbursement (e.g., the  mailing of bills related to,\r                                      \r\n\nand   the  making   of  telephone   calls  to   arrange,  the\r\n\nentertainment), and that interstate travel in connection with\r\n\nthe entertainment (e.g., reimbursement of  out-of-state golf)\r                                   \r\n\nwould or  had  to  occur.   The  overt acts  charged  in  the\r\n\nindictment included Sawyer's giving of illegal gratuities and\r\n\nHathaway's  approval and authorization  of reimbursement, and\r\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to establish those acts.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nplanning for the 1993 Boston Marathon brunch.\r\n\n                             -71-\r                                          71\r\r\n\n          Thus,  despite  the  underlying  legal  error,  the\r\n\nevidence  was sufficient to  establish the conspiracy offense\r\n\nand  a  new  trial on  this  count  is  allowable should  the\r\n\ngovernment so choose.\r\n\n                              V.\r                                          V.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          Sawyer raises a number of other issues that we have\r\n\nreviewed, find  to  be without  merit,  and that  warrant  no\r\n\nfurther discussion.\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  vacate  the mail\r                                                               \r\n\nfraud, wire fraud, Travel Act and conspiracy convictions, and\r\n\nremand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r                  \r\n\n                             -72-\r                                          72\r\r\n",

Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir.1996), a rational jury could have found the following facts from the trial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the indictment period, 1986 to March 1993, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"Hancock\") employed the defendant-appellant, F. William Sawyer, as a senior lobbyist within its Government Relations Department.   As the largest life insurance company in Massachusetts, Hancock had a continuing and abiding interest in the state's insurance laws.   Sawyer's job was to lobby the Massachusetts Legislature on Hancock's behalf.   In particular, his job description required him to:  research and develop Hancock's position on pertinent legislation;  communicate relevant information to representative government officials in order to effect a favorable outcome and to protect the Company's interests;  and establish and maintain relationships with legislators as well as with members of industry associations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A principal focus of Sawyer's lobbying activities was the Legislature's Joint Insurance Committee (\"Insurance Committee\"), composed of state representatives and senators.   The Insurance Committee has the ability to impact life insurance regulations more than any other legislative committee.   To this end, it reviews approximately 300 bills per year, about fifty of which affect the life insurance industry.   During each year of the indictment period, Massachusetts life insurance companies actively sought the passage of about five bills, most of which made it successfully through the Insurance Committee \"in some form or another.\"   Robert J. Smith, a research analyst and director for the Committee, testified that, during the indictment period, Sawyer was one of three lobbyists who appeared most often to lobby for bills sought by the life insurance industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Committee is co-chaired by a senate and house member, each with equal control over the fate of bills assigned to the Committee.   The Chairs have the ability to schedule hearings, assign bills to the hearing calendar and subsequent executive sessions, advocate bills at executive sessions, and take other action to advance them through the Committee.   Each Chair could \"carry\" a bill, i.e., actively guide it through the Legislature as a whole;  alternatively, a Chair could send it to the \"Study Committee\" which usually shelved it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the indictment period, Sawyer focused his lobbying activities on the house members of the Insurance Committee, some of whom took action that directly or indirectly affected Hancock's interests.   Representative Francis H. Woodward was the House Chair of the Insurance Committee from 1986 to 1990.   Research analyst Smith identified Sawyer as the lobbyist he saw most often with Representative Woodward during Woodward's tenure as the Committee's House Chair.   During this time, the Insurance Committee never rejected Woodward's recommendations on bills affecting the life insurance industry and Woodward \"carried\" most of the bills sought by the industry.   Representative Frank Emilio, a member from 1986 to 1990, sponsored a September 1990 bill on behalf of Hancock.   Representative John F. Cox sponsored bills that Hancock supported in November 1990 and December 1991.   In addition, Representatives Walsh, Mara, and Driscoll sponsored legislation sought by the life insurance industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Legislative Reports\" issued by the Hancock Government Relations Department to senior Hancock officers, and signed by Sawyer, outlined specific lobbying efforts and proceedings in the Massachusetts Legislature pertinent to Hancock's interests.   In July 1990, Sawyer wrote a memorandum to Hancock's Management Committee summarizing the successful efforts of Hancock lobbyists, including himself, in excluding Hancock from a bill that would have subjected it to a $100-million tax liability.   In a September 1990 memorandum to the Management Committee, Sawyer referred to a 1990 bill, filed by Representative Emilio, that allowed Hancock to assess and report its real estate advantageously.   A November 1990 letter from Ralph F. Scott, Hancock's Assistant Legislative Counsel, to Representative Cox indicated that Sawyer and Scott planned to work with Cox in obtaining favorable action on a specific bill that he had sponsored for Hancock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the indictment period, Sawyer paid for numerous meals, rounds of golf, and other entertainment for and with Massachusetts legislators, including many members of the Insurance Committee.   Although Sawyer initially paid for most of these activities himself, they were treated as business expenses and reimbursed by Hancock (hereinafter \"expenditures\").   In accordance with Hancock's procedures, Sawyer would complete monthly expense vouchers, attaching receipts and a handwritten calendar that identified the recipients of the expenses.   Sawyer's supervisor, Raeburn B. Hathaway, the head of Hancock's Government Relations Department, reviewed Sawyer's expense vouchers and approved them for reimbursement.   Hathaway's secretary would then detach the detailed calendars from the vouchers, keeping the calendars within the Government Relations Department, and forward the voucher, alone, to the accounting department for payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analysis of Sawyer's expense vouchers and calendars during the indictment period revealed that the top three recipients of his expenditures were:  Representative Woodward, who received more than $8,000 worth of expenditures during his tenure as Insurance Committee House Chair;  Robert Howarth, an Insurance Committee member from 1986 to 1992 (over $3,000);  and Representative Emilio (over $2,500).   After these three legislators left office, Sawyer, on behalf of Hancock, expended practically nothing on entertaining them (Woodward, $0;  Howarth, $8.33;  and Emilio, $85.65).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Sawyer's expenditures included thousands of dollars for golf--in and out of state--with various Massachusetts legislators including Representative Francis Mara, Woodward's 1991 successor as Insurance Committee House Chair.   Sawyer also hosted dinners for legislators and their families.   In September 1992, Sawyer provided Representative Mara and his wife tickets for a show in Hancock's private box at the Wang Center and ordered an accompanying dinner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The apparent catalyst for this prosecution was a December 1992 trip to Puerto Rico where Sawyer, other lobbyists, and a group of legislators, including Representative Mara, travelled for a legislative conference.   The group did not stay at the conference site, but instead went to a different resort where Sawyer paid for many of the legislators' meals, transportation, and golf.   Hancock reimbursed Sawyer for some $4,000 of entertainment expenses from the Puerto Rican trip.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Sawyer and his supervisor, Hathaway, had reason to believe that these expenditures could or did violate certain state laws.   In his office, Sawyer kept internal Hancock memoranda, newspaper articles, and opinions of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission, all explaining or reporting on Massachusetts ethics-in-lobbying.   While some of the documents varied in their interpretations, they nonetheless advised on compliance with laws regarding gratuities, gifts, and lobbying expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1993, a reporter from the Boston Globe newspaper queried Richard Bevilacqua, Hancock's Director of Employee and Customer Communications, about Sawyer's entertainment of legislators during the 1992 Puerto Rico trip and about Hancock's legislative agenda during that period.   Bevilacqua, in turn, asked Sawyer about the trip, and Sawyer opined, \"it's difficult to take anyone out to lunch or dinner these days without going over [the] amount [permitted by law].\"  This set of events prompted Hancock to begin an internal investigation into Sawyer's legislative expenditures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Bruce A. Skrine, vice president, corporate counsel and secretary for Hancock, asked Sawyer for his expense records.   Contemporaneous with Sawyer's production of the records, Sawyer told Skrine that the expenses were \"consistent with the way ... things were done on Beacon Hill.\"  Sawyer also told Skrine that his reason for making the expenditures was \"to get to know\" the legislators and to develop \"a certain relationship so that you could turn to them\";  he further indicated that he made these expenditures to \"build and maintain relationships,\" gain \"access to legislators,\" and get legislators to \"return his calls as a result of [the expenditures].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer caused the mailing of items related to the expenditures on legislators, including golf bills, reimbursement requests, and credit card bills.

He argues that this case is exemplary of the \"dangers of standardless federal criminal enforcement and unbridled prosecutorial discretion long-recognized under the mail fraud statute.\"   We have already considered and rejected these arguments, however.   See United States v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 758-59 (1st Cir.1987).   Congress may protect the integrity of the interstate mails and wires by forbidding their use in furtherance of schemes to defraud a state and its citizens, whether or not it can forbid the scheme itself.

Because the relevant language in both the mail and wire fraud statutes is the same, we analyze both offenses together for the purposes of this case and, for simplicity, we refer only to mail fraud.

Some courts later expanded the scope of the statutes to encompass schemes intended to defraud citizens of their intangible, non-property right to the honest services of their public officials.

Congress quickly reacted to the McNally decision by enacting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346, which provides that, for the purposes of, inter alia, the mail and wire fraud statutes, \"the term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\"   We have recognized that &#167; 1346 was intended to overturn McNally and reinstate the reasoning of pre-McNally case law holding that the mail fraud statute reached schemes to defraud individuals of the intangible right to honest services of government officials.

See Silvano 812 F.2d at 759.   When an official fails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which she has decision-making power, the public is deprived of its right either to disinterested decision making itself or, as the case may be, to full disclosure as to the official's potential motivation behind an official act.   See id.  (upholding conviction of city fiduciary who failed to disclose material information about unnecessary spending of city money for secret enrichment of fiduciary's friend).   Thus, undisclosed, biased decision making for personal gain, whether or not tangible loss to the public is shown, constitutes a deprivation of honest services.   See e.g., Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 567 (city board member took secret action to influence award of public contract to official's private constructionbusiness interest);  United States v. Waymer, 55 F.3d 564 (11th Cir.1995) (board of education member received secret commissions from companies contracting with school system), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1350, 134 L.Ed.2d 519 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The broad scope of the mail fraud statute, however, does not encompass every instance of official misconduct that results in the official's personal gain.   For example, in United States v. McNeive, 536 F.2d 1245, 1246 (8th Cir.1976), a city plumbing inspector repeatedly accepted unsolicited gratuities in connection with his non-discretionary, administrative duty to issue plumbing permits.   Although McNeive may have violated a city ordinance banning the acceptance of gratuities by city officials, the court found his conduct beyond the reach of the mail fraud statute because there was no evidence that the gratuities disadvantaged the city in any respect or that they deterred McNeive from otherwise conscientiously performing his duties.  Id. at 1251.   In short, the \"scheme\" was shown to neither involve nor contemplate the deprivation of McNeive's honest services to the city or public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, in United States v.

Rabbitt had offered to introduce a friend's architectural firm to certain public officials responsible for awarding state architectural contracts, in return for a ten percent commission on any work awarded.  Id. at 1020.   The government charged that his receipt of the resulting, undisclosed commissions defrauded the citizens of Rabbitt's honest services.  Id. at 1025.   The evidence showed, however, that the officials who awarded the architectural contracts did so on merit alone and Rabbitt played no role in the selection of the firm.  Id. at 1026.   Because Rabbitt did not control the awarding of the contracts, or otherwise fail to fulfill his official duties, his conduct did not deprive the citizens of his honest services.  Id. (noting case's resemblance to McNeive, 536 F.2d at 1251-52).   The court also observed that the government failed to cite any applicable standard requiring Rabbit to disclose his interest in the contracts, and thus, the citizens were not deprived of any right to such disclosure.  Id. at 1026.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The McNeive and Rabbitt cases illustrate that although a public official might engage in reprehensible misconduct related to an official position, the conviction of that official for honest-services fraud cannot stand where the conduct does not actually deprive the public of its right to her honest services, and it is not shown to intend that result.   Similarly, if a non-public-official is prosecuted for scheming to defraud the public of an official's honest services, the government must prove that the target of the scheme is the deprivation of the official's honest services.   If the \"scheme\" does not, as its necessary outcome, deprive the public of honest services, then independent evidence of the intent to deprive another of those services must be presented.   See United States v. D'Amato, 39 F.3d, 1249, 1257 (2d Cir.1994) (\"Where the scheme does not cause injury to the alleged victim as its necessary result, the government must produce evidence independent of the alleged scheme to show the defendant's fraudulent intent.\");  United States v.

With this background, we consider the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Scheme to Defraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government did not prosecute Sawyer on the theory that he, as a lobbyist, directly owed a duty of honest services to the Commonwealth or its citizens.   Rather, the government sought to prove that Sawyer engaged in conduct intended to cause state legislators to violate their duty to the public.   The government sought to establish this scheme by proving that Sawyer intentionally violated, or caused members of the legislature to violate, two Massachusetts statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Briefly, these two Massachusetts statutes, discussed more fully infra, are:  (1) Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 6 (the \"gift\" statute), which prohibits--under threat of civil penalties--a \"legislative agent\" from offering or giving to a public official (or an official's acceptance of) \"gifts\" aggregating $100 or more per year;  and (2) Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3 (the \"gratuity\" statute), which prohibits--under threat of civil and criminal penalties--anyone from giving to a legislator (or a legislator from soliciting or accepting) anything of \"substantial value ... for or because of any official act performed or to be performed\" by that person.   Through the violation of these laws, the government contended, Sawyer stole the honest services of the legislators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, proof of a state law violation is not required for conviction of honest services fraud.   See Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759.   Indeed, the incorporation of a state law violation in such a prosecution may cause complications.   See United States v. Washington, 688 F.2d 953, 958 (5th Cir.1982) (reversing mail fraud conviction where jury should have been instructed that the defendant \"should not be found guilty of the federal offense merely because he violated state law\").   Here, however, the parties agree that the indictment, as structured, required it to prove that Sawyer violated at least one state law.   Thus, the state laws in question had to be correctly charged as a matter of state law, and the violation of at least one had to be proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer appeals various aspects of the court's jury instructions on the state statutes and their role in the alleged scheme to defraud.   To determine whether the court's instructions adequately explained the law or whether they \"tended to confuse or mislead the jury,\" United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1001 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotations and citation omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 909, 133 L.Ed.2d 841 (1996), we review the entire charge pertaining to the role of the state statutes in this honest services fraud prosecution:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>In this case the government has charged Mr. Sawyer with devising a scheme or artifice;  that is, a plan, to deprive the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its citizens of their right to the honest services of members of the Massachusetts Legislature by giving or offering to those legislators gifts of free travel, lodging, golf, meals, and other entertainment.   I instruct you that under the mail and wire fraud statutes, a scheme to defraud can be a plan to deprive the public of its right to the honest services of members of the Massachusetts Legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elected public officials, such as members of the Massachusetts Legislature, owe certain duties to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to its citizens.   One of those duties is the duty to act honestly.   The government charges that by violating and causing legislators to violate certain state statutes, Mr. Sawyer deprived the public of its right to the honest services of members of the Massachusetts Legislature and, therefore devised a scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the government alleges that the defendant violated federal laws, mail fraud and wire fraud, by intentionally violating or causing Massachusetts legislators to violate certain state laws.   Accordingly, in order to prove the first element of the mail fraud and/or wire fraud, that the defendant devised a scheme to defraud, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally violated or caused members of the Massachusetts Legislature to violate at least one of the following two state laws .... (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After describing the two statutes, the court continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant devised or created a scheme to defraud in which he intentionally violated or caused a violation of at least one of the laws that I have just described, then you may find that the government has proved the first element of mail fraud and wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These instructions permitted the jury to find the requisite scheme to defraud upon proof that Sawyer violated, or caused legislators to violate, either one of the state statutes.   In other words, the jury was allowed to find that a violation of either statute, without more, constituted the deprivation of honest services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  At oral argument before this court, the government affirmed that it chose the state law violations as \"the sole vehicle to prove the scheme or artifice to defraud\" in order to \"narrow the issues of intent and good faith.\"   Thus, we analyze both state statutes in light of the law of honest services, set forth above, to determine whether the court's instructions erroneously permitted a conviction for conduct not within the reach of the mail fraud statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Gift Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first Massachusetts statute on which the alleged scheme to defraud was based is ch.   268B, &#167; 6 (the \"gift statute\"), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>No legislative agent shall knowingly and wilfully offer or give to a public official or public employee or a member of such person's immediate family, and no public official or public employee or member of such person's immediate family shall knowingly and wilfully solicit or accept from any legislative agent, gifts with an aggregate value of one hundred dollars or more in a calendar year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 6. We discuss Sawyer's challenges to the court's instructions on the statutory definitions before turning to the statute's relation to the scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>a. \"Legislative Agent\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed the jury that, under the statute, a legislative agent cannot give or offer gifts aggregating $100 or more to a legislator or member of the legislator's family.   It further instructed that a \"legislative agent\" is \"any person who, for compensation or reward, does any act to promote, oppose or influence legislation.\"   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 1(g).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Sawyer argues that this instruction failed to reflect his assertion that a person is a \"legislative agent\" only when he is so registered with the Secretary of State or he is actually engaging in lobbying activity at the time he gave the alleged gifts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed that a legislative agent is one who is paid to \"promote, oppose or influence legislation,\" i.e., to lobby, and that such agents are forbidden to give or offer certain \"gifts.\"   The instruction, as a whole, adequately conveyed the idea that such gifts are forbidden only when given by those who, at the time of the gifts, are paid to actually lobby.   While there may be a person with the job title \"lobbyist\" who does not actually engage in lobbying, there was ample evidence here that Sawyer lobbied at the time he gave the alleged \"gifts.\"   Moreover, the fact that he had an obligation to register with the Secretary of State, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 3, &#167;&#167; 40, 41, does not alter the definition.   No further instruction was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>b. Shared Meals as \"Gifts\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed the jury that \"gifts,\" under the relevant Massachusetts law, are \"a payment, entertainment, subscription, advance, services or anything of value, unless consideration of equal or greater value is received.\"   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 1(g).   Much of the evidence offered to prove Sawyer's violations of the gift statute was his payment for shared meals and entertainment with the legislators.   Sawyer contends that his payment for \"shared hospitality\" does not constitute a \"gift\" within the meaning of the statute.   The issue turns out to be potentially complicated and involves somewhat convoluted analysis of the statutory history of a comparable law set forth at Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 3, &#167; 43.   We have carefully reviewed the arguments on both sides, and for the reasons set forth in the district court's ruling, see Sawyer, 878 F.Supp. at 282-84, we conclude that Sawyer's shared meals could, if the jury so found, fit within the gift definition's term \"entertainment\" and/or the very broad phrase, \"anything of value.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>c. Relation to Scheme to Defraud</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained above, under the court's jury instructions regarding the scheme to defraud, Sawyer's intentional violations of the gift statute, by their very occurrence (or ipso facto ), must deprive the public of their legislators' honest services.   Sawyer challenges this legal premise, arguing that such violations do not necessarily deprive the public of those services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gift statute, which forbids a legislative agent from \"knowingly and wilfully\" giving a \"public official ... gifts with an aggregated value of one hundred dollars or more in a calendar year,\" Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 6, simply limits, by a dollar-amount, the gift-giving by lobbyists to legislators.   It is a prophylactic civil prohibition that addresses appearances of--but not actual--corruption.   A violation of the Massachusetts gift statute does not necessarily entail any improper motive to influence, or otherwise affect, the official duties of the recipient.   It is possible for a lobbyist to give a legislator items falling within the statute's definition of \"gift,\" or for a legislator to accept such gifts, without an accompanying intent to cause the legislator to deviate from the honest performance of official duties.   While such gifts would constitute a gift-statute violation, not every such circumstance would necessarily amount to a deviation from the official's performance of honest services to the public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Thus, unlike the honest services fraud cases, noted above, in which an official was bribed or took official action based on a secret conflict of interest, a gift statute violation, even if intentional, does not in itself amount to honest services fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Massachusetts' citizenry expects their legislators to comply with laws pertaining to their official capacity, the presence of such illegal conduct, even though it relates to public office, does not by itself (or, per se ) establish honest services fraud.   Cf. See United States v. Dowling, 739 F.2d 1445, 1449-50 (9th Cir.1984) (rejecting government's suggestion that \"the presence of illegal conduct alone may constitute the basis of the 'fraud' element of a mail fraud prosecution\" and stating that \"to hold otherwise ... would have the potential of bringing almost any illegal act within the province of the mail fraud statute\"), rev'd on other grounds, 473 U.S. 207, 105 S.Ct. 3127, 87 L.Ed.2d 152 (1985);  United States v. Gallant, 570 F.Supp. 303, 309 and n. 7 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (noting that Congress forbade the use of the mails in furtherance of \"any scheme or artifice to defraud\" and not in furtherance of \"any crime\").   To allow every transgression of state governmental obligations to amount to mail fraud would effectively turn every such violation into a federal felony;  this cannot be countenanced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court's instructions allowed the jury to equate a gift statute violation with the deprivation of honest services, it also permitted the jury to find an \"intent to defraud\" from the intent to violate the statute, without more.   To establish the scheme to defraud through these violations, however, it must also have been charged and shown that the intent behind the violations was the deprivation of honest services.   See D'Amato, 39 F.3d at 1257 (explaining that where harm is not the necessary result of the scheme, independent evidence of fraudulent intent is required).   Thus, this case required a separate instruction that, to prove the intent to commit honest services fraud, the jury had to find that Sawyer intended to influence or otherwise improperly affect the official's performance of duties, not merely that he intended to violate the state statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Allowing the jury to find that Sawyer intended to defraud the public of its right to honest services based on proof of gift statute violations alone constituted reversible error.   See United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47, 57 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 918, 109 S.Ct. 3243, 106 L.Ed.2d 590 (1989) (observing that reversal of convictions is required if instructions \"could have led the jury to convict for conduct outside the proscription of the mail fraud statute\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Gratuity Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Massachusetts statute upon which the convictions for honest-services mail fraud rely, is ch.   268A, &#167; 3 (the \"gratuity statute\"), which provides, in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>(a) Whoever, otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty, directly or indirectly gives, offers or promises anything of substantial value to any present or former state ... employee ... for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such an employee</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>(d) ... shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The centerpiece of the gratuity statute is the giving of an item of \"substantial value\" (the \"gratuity\"), to an official, \"for or because of any official act performed or to be performed\" by the official.   Because this language entails some connection between the gift and the performance of official duties, a gratuity statute violation--unlike a gift statute violation--may itself be sufficient to implicate the duty of honest services in a given case.   As with the gift statute, however, not every violation of the gratuity statute automatically encompasses an intent to induce the public official to alter or deviate from the performance of honest and impartial services.   We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Massachusetts gratuity offense does not require a finding of corrupt intent, i.e., improper intent to influence official decision making.   See Commonwealth v. Dutney, 4 Mass.App.Ct. 363, 348 N.E.2d 812, 821 (1976) (finding gratuity offense to be a lesser included offense of Massachusetts bribery statute, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 2, which adds the element of \"corrupt intent\" i.e., intent to influence);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  cf.  United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1159 (1st Cir.1993) (observing that gratuity offense, unlike bribery, does not involve a \"corrupt purpose\"). Rather, only some lesser intent need be shown.   A jury might be charged to find a bribery or gratuity offense in the alternative, thus allowing it to convict for a gratuity offense if it is convinced that the defendant gave something to a public official because of an official act, but is not persuaded that the defendant had a corrupt intent to influence that act.   See, e.g., Dutney, 348 N.E.2d at 821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the word \"gratuity\" implies, the intent most often associated with the offense is the intent to \"reward\" an official for an act taken in the past or to be taken in the future.   See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1159 (noting that, unlike one who bribes, the gratuity offender \"gives the gift without attaching any strings, intending it instead as a reward for actions the public official has already taken or is already committed to take\").   The official act might otherwise be properly motivated;  and the gratuity, though unlawful, might not be intended to influence the official's mindset with regard to that particular action.   In some cases, such as a reward for long-past official action, the intent to influence could not possibly exist.   A finding of honest services fraud, however, requires, in connection with the gratuity, the intent to cause an official to deviate from the honest performance of services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as with the gift statute, proof of a violation of the Massachusetts gratuity statute, without more, does not establish an intent to commit honest services fraud.   The government must prove that the conduct was accompanied by the requisite intent.   This intent could be shown in a number of ways.   For example, a bribery-like, corrupt intent to influence official action necessarily is an intent to deprive the public of an official's honest services.   A person might not, however, give an unlawful gratuity with the intent to effect a specific quid pro quo.   Rather, as the government contends here, a person with continuing and long-term interests before an official might engage in a pattern of repeated, intentional gratuity offenses in order to coax ongoing favorable official action in derogation of the public's right to impartial official services.   Such conduct would be akin to (although not a classic case of) the conflict of interest cases noted above.   See, e.g., Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 567;  Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759.   Here, for example, while Sawyer may not have provided the legislators with direct kickbacks or commissions arising out of the specific official action, he may have intended the legislators generally to treat preferentially Hancock's interests, knowing that the free meals, entertainment, and golf would continue so long as favorable official acts were, at some point, taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court did not, in fact, instruct the jury on a true \"gratuity\" offense.   Instead, it instructed the jury that, to establish a gratuity offense, the government must prove that Sawyer \"gave something of substantial value to a legislator with the intent to influence an official act of that legislator.\"   While this instruction erroneously added an intent-to-influence element to the gratuity offense, it also had the effect of charging the jury to find the requisite intent for honest services fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Conclusion:  Scheme to Deprive of Honest Services</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was permitted to find the first element of mail and wire fraud, the scheme to defraud, upon proof that either the gift statute or the gratuity statute was violated.   The gift statute as charged, however, was a legally insufficient basis upon which to find the scheme to defraud.   Although the gratuity statute was properly instructed in terms of honest services mail fraud, we cannot tell if the convictions were based on that statute or the insufficiently charged gift statute.   When a jury has been presented with several bases for conviction, one of which is legally erroneous, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury convicted upon, the conviction cannot stand.  United States v. Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d 431, 435-36 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that if we find error with respect to the gift statute, we should affirm the convictions because the jury found that Sawyer committed gratuity offenses within the Travel Act convictions, discussed infra.   We cannot assume from the Travel Act convictions, however, that the jury based its mail and wire fraud convictions on the gratuity statute.   The court charged the jury to consider each offense as separate bases for the mail and wire fraud charges.   Accordingly, the possibility exists that, when convicting on the mail and wire fraud charges, the jury focused on violations of the gift statute, alone.   See Boots, 80 F.3d at 589 (declining to affirm conviction where it was possible that the jury focused its verdict on erroneous basis).   Thus, for the foregoing reasons, Sawyer's mail and wire fraud convictions must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove an intent to influence the legislators' official acts and that therefore his conviction should be reversed without the possibility of retrial.   We cannot agree.   At trial, there was evidence that Sawyer intentionally and repeatedly provided legislators with valuable gifts of entertainment for the purpose of obtaining \"greater access\" to,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and of developing a \"certain relationship with,\" legislators.   A jury could credit Sawyer's defense that he thought his expenditures were lawful and that they were meant only for goodwill entertaining.   Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, however, see United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 522, 133 L.Ed.2d 430 (1995), a jury could also rationally infer, beyond a reasonable doubt that Sawyer intended that his repeated gifts and gratuities would induce legislators to perform official acts to benefit Hancock's interests regardless of, or at the expense of, the public interest.   Hence, retrial is not precluded.   See Boots, 80 F.3d at 589-90 (reversing because of legal error in instructions but remanding for possible retrial because the evidence was sufficient for proper conviction);  United States v. Ochs, 842 F.2d 515, 529 (1st Cir.1988) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the possibility that the government may choose to retry this case, we think it is useful to add a cautionary word concerning the relationship between state and federal law in cases such as this one.   Our comments are addressed primarily to the mail fraud statute but apply in some measure to the Travel Act charge, discussed infra, as well.   Two problems are of specific concern to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, concerning the theft of honest services jury instruction, an overemphasis on what state law forbids may lead the jury to believe that state rather than federal law defines the crime, or more specifically, that any violation of a state law or regulation concerning lobbying or related matters amounts to honest services fraud.   Wire and mail fraud are federal offenses;  and while state violations may play a role, the jury should not be allowed to slip into the misunderstanding that any violation of proliferating state laws and regulations controlling this area automatically amounts to a federal crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a similar vein, we think there exists a risk in this case--particularly in view of the prosecutor's closing argument with its repeated emphasis on permissible dollar limits in lobbying--that the jury could wrongly believe that any expenditure in excess of that allowed by state statute or regulation by itself constitutes the federal offense.   The district court has ample authority under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 to limit evidence concerning state law requirements where that evidence is substantially more prejudicial than probative.   And, in all events, jury instructions need to make clear that for the federal honest services fraud to be proven, the defendant must have the intent to affect a legislator's performance of an official act and not merely to make payments in excess of some state specified limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Intent to Deceive</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not a new trial on the mail and wire fraud counts is allowable requires us to reach Sawyer's additional contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish his intent to deceive the public.   To this end, Sawyer contends that because the government did not establish that he had a duty to disclose his illegal gifts and gratuities to the public, his intent to deceive the public had to be shown through affirmative acts of deception, which he claims are absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish mail fraud--in cases involving honest services fraud and otherwise--the alleged scheme must involve deception in the deprivation of money, property, or the right to honest services.   See McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Heritage Travel, Inc., 904 F.2d 786, 791 (1st Cir.)  (\"[N]ot every use of the mails or wires in furtherance of an unlawful scheme to deprive another of property constitutes mail or wire fraud....  Rather, the scheme must be intended to deceive another, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, promises or other deceptive conduct.\")  (citations omitted), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 992, 111 S.Ct. 536, 112 L.Ed.2d 546 (1990);  see also Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 567 (finding that public official's conduct of secretly delivering gratuities to other officials for favorable action, \"without disclosing his actions to other [officials],\" falls within purview of honest services mail fraud) (citing McEvoy Travel, 904 F.2d at 791);  United States v. Bush, 522 F.2d 641, 648 (7th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 977, 96 S.Ct. 1484, 47 L.Ed.2d 748 (1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  While a misrepresentation of fact is not required to establish mail fraud, McEvoy Travel, 904 F.2d at 791, a demonstrated intent to deceive is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the conduct of a government official is involved, \"the affirmative duty to disclose material information arises out of [the] official's fiduciary relationship to [the public].\"  Silvano, 812 F.2d at 758;  see id. at 760 (\"Although not all dishonest or disloyal conduct by an employee violates the mail fraud statute, an employee's breach of a fiduciary duty falls within the strictures of the statute when it encompasses the breach of a duty to disclose material information to the employer.\").   Thus, an official's intentional violation of the duty to disclose provides the requisite \"deceit.\"   See id. at 760 (noting that failure to disclose \"under circumstances where the non-disclosure could or does result in harm to the employer is a violation of the mail fraud statute\") (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, although the issue has not been clearly presented by the parties, it appears that the requisite intent to deceive could have been shown either through Sawyer's own acts of deception toward the public with respect to the gift/gratuity statute violations, or through his efforts to ensure that the legislators deceived the public with respect to the violations.   The latter requires evidence only that Sawyer intended to cause the legislators intentionally to fail to disclose material information about the violations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> although evidence that he intended the legislators to affirmatively misrepresent themselves in this regard would also suffice.   At bottom, the evidence must be sufficient to establish Sawyer's intent that, in the end, the public be deceived with respect to his unlawful gifts and gratuities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, we must determine if the admissible evidence, viewed in light most favorable to the jury's verdict, is sufficient for a rational jury to find that Sawyer intended that the public be deceived.   See United States v. Kaplan, 832 F.2d 676, 679 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 907, 108 S.Ct. 1080, 99 L.Ed.2d 239 (1988).   The evidence need not compel an intent-to-deceive finding;  rather, it is only required that a reasonable jury could be persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sawyer had such intent.   See United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706-707 (1st Cir.1994).   And we are mindful that a jury may choose among the reasonable alternatives posed by the evidence.  United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 522, 133 L.Ed.2d 430 (1995).   Finally, the specific intent to deceive may be proven (and usually is) by indirect and circumstantial evidence.   See O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706 (observing that fraud crimes \"by their very nature, often yield little in the way of direct proof\");  Kaplan, 832 F.2d at 679;  see also United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1113 (1st Cir.1989) (opining that \"factual circumstances may signal fraudulent intent in ways as diverse as the manifestations of fraud itself\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1005, 110 S.Ct. 1300, 108 L.Ed.2d 477 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, it may appear that bribery of a public official necessarily incorporates a finding that the offender intended to \"trick\" or \"deceive\" the public into thinking that the official was acting independently when, in fact, the official was actually motivated by the bribe.   While we have little doubt that bribes are usually given in secrecy, see Holzer, 816 F.2d at 309 (observing that \"no public official in the United States takes bribes openly\"), bribery and gratuity statutes generally, as here, do not require a separate element of deception.   Ostensibly, a person could offer an illegal bribe to a public official and not be concerned with its secrecy.   Thus, the evidence presented must permit a finding that Sawyer not only gave the unlawful gifts or gratuities with the intent to deprive the public of honest services, but that he also intended to deceive the public about that conduct.   See Bush, 522 F.2d at 648.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government presented evidence that Sawyer gave the unlawful gifts and gratuities during the seven years of the indictment period until the Boston Globe exposed the practice in May 1993.   Much of his entertainment of lobbyists took place out-of-state--usually at industry and legislative conferences--where members of the Massachusetts citizenry generally would not observe the questionable activities.   Unlike his acts of \"non-public\" entertainment, Sawyer ensured compliance with state ethical standards for a 1993 Boston Marathon brunch, potentially a high profile event.   In his office, Sawyer kept newspaper articles reporting legislators' activities with lobbyists, and in particular, the ethical ramifications of such relationships.   In one article, Representative Mara (a recipient of Sawyer's unlawful gifts or gratuities) is quoted as saying, \"Everyone picks up their own tabs at [legislative] conferences....  These conferences have become almost nonexistent.\"   These articles were kept in notebooks with other materials regarding lobbying laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury rationally could infer that Sawyer was cognizant of his ethical obligations in lobbying, knew of the public awareness of lobbying activity, and repeatedly gave hidden unlawful gifts and gratuities until he was publicly exposed.   While not overwhelming, the combined evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sawyer intended to deceive the public about his unlawful expenditures on legislators.   See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that \"juries are not required to examine the evidence in isolation, for 'individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.

Although we discuss and reject each of these arguments in turn, we nonetheless reverse his conviction on these counts because the district court's instructions on the meaning of \"bribery,\" for the purposes of the Travel Act, were fatally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Sawyer contends that the gratuity must be linked to a specific, identifiable official act.   The government argues that it is sufficient to prove that the gratuity would not have been given but for the legislator's ability to take official action favorable to Sawyer.   In a pretrial ruling on Sawyer's motions to dismiss, the district court agreed with the government's interpretation, and instructed as such.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Massachusetts court decision has yet interpreted the operative \"for or because of any official act\" language in ch.   268A, &#167; 3(a).   To support their respective positions, the parties present differing arguments regarding the statutory language, legislative history, comparable statutes, and State Ethics Commission rulings.   We consider these sources separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Statutory Language</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gratuity statute prohibits the giving of gratuities \"for or because of any official act performed or to be performed.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3. The statute does not read \"for or because of the official's position.\"   Rather, it forbids gratuities motivated by \"any official act\" and further defines, rather meticulously, \"official act.\"   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167;&#167; 1(h) &amp; (k).   Thus, on the face of the statute, it does not appear that the unlawfulness of the gratuity could be established by proof that it was motivated solely by the official's position.   In other words, proof of the offense requires something more than a simple showing that \"but for\" the official's authority, the gratuity would not have been given.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This observation, however, does not lead to the conclusion that the gratuity must be shown to be motivated by a specifically identified official act.   As noted supra, a gratuity offense is essentially a bribery offense without proof of \"corrupt intent.\"   The concern behind the gratuity statute, like the bribery statute, is the potential undermining of official integrity.   A gratuity does not compromise this integrity because of its possible effect on the official's \"position\";  rather, the danger is in its ability to affect the official's performance of duties, i.e., \"official acts.\"   It is not surprising, then, that the statute proscribes gratuities motivated by \"official acts\" rather than \"official position.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the use of the term \"official act\" appears to ensure that the gratuity would be deemed unlawful only when the giving of an item of \"substantial value\" is linked to the official's performance of duties.   The connection between the gratuity and the performance of official duties, however, does not necessarily require the identification of a specific official act, and we find nothing in the statutory language to require such a demonstration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Legislative History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gratuity statute was based, in part, upon a bill drafted by a 1962 Massachusetts Special Commission on Code of Ethics.   See Report of the Special Commission on Code of Ethics, 1962 House Doc.  No. 3650, p. 8. Nothing in the Commission's Report, however, assists us in resolving the instant question.   It states only:  \"It should be noted that to constitute a criminal act, the giving or receiving of the item of such 'substantial value' must be 'for or because of' an official act.\"   Id. at 11;  see Commonwealth v. Famigletti, 4 Mass.App.Ct. 584, 354 N.E.2d 890, 893 (1976) (noting same language in the report).   The Report neither parses out what these terms mean, nor gives examples of what was intended.   From this we discern only that the Commission was concerned that \"innocent\" gifts to officials would not fall within the gratuity statute's purview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's report does tell us that \"[m]uch of the language of the proposed legislation is taken and adapted from [a proposed federal bribery/gratuity bill].\"  Report of Special Commission, supra at 8;  see Dutney, 348 N.E.2d at 822 n. 16.  As discussed below, however, the comparable federal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c), is also unhelpful in resolving the question before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Comparable Statutes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its position, the government relies on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's interpretation of a different statute in Commonwealth v. Lapham, 156 Mass. 480, 31 N.E. 638 (Mass.1892), and on federal cases interpreting the federal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lapham involved a milk dealer who attempted to bribe a city milk inspector and was convicted under a statute punishing anyone who:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>corruptly gives, offers or promises to any executive, legislative ... or judicial officer ... any gift or gratuity whatever, with intent to influence his act, vote, opinion, decision, or judgment on any matter, question, cause, or proceeding, which may be then pending, or may by law come or be brought before him in his official capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Pub. St. ch. 205, &#167; 9 (Ch. 349 Revised May 21, 1891);  see Lapham, 31 N.E. at 638-39.   The milk dealer argued that the indictment was insufficient because it did not aver a particular matter to be influenced.  Id. The Supreme Judicial Court disagreed, reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>Nor is it necessary in an indictment under [ch. 205, &#167; 9] to aver that the corrupt intention to influence the act, opinion, decision or judgment of the inspector was in relation to any specific and particular matter then pending before him, or which was then expected to come before him.   It is enough to aver a corrupt intention so to influence him in any matter which may then be pending, or which may by law come or be brought before him.   If for example an executive, legislative or judicial officer is bribed corruptly to favor a particular person in any and all matters affecting that person which may come before such officer, without specification or knowledge of the particular matters likely to come up, the statute is broad enough to include such a case.   A narrower construction of a similar statute has been adopted in Alabama, but we cannot follow it.  Barefield v. State, 14 Ala. 603 [1848].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. 31 N.E. at 639.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with the government's reliance on Lapham is, of course, the fact that it involved a differently worded statute.   The Lapham statute proscribes a corrupt gift to influence an official act \"on any matter ... which may be then pending or may by law come or be brought before him in his official capacity.\"   Mass. Pub. St. ch. 205, &#167; 9 (Ch. 349 Revised May 21, 1891) (emphasis added).   In holding that an averment of a specific matter was not necessary, the Lapham court repeatedly used the word \"may.\"   See, e.g., id.  (\"It is enough to aver a corrupt intention so to influence him in any matter which may then be pending, or which may by law come or be brought before him.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether the absence of the word \"may\" in the present gratuity statute, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167;&#167; 3, 1(h) &amp; (k), signifies, by negative implication, the requirement of a specific official act.   The reasoning in Lapham does seem to indicate some relationship between the word \"may\" and the absence of a specificity requirement.   We think, however, that it does not follow that the word \"may\" is the only manner in which to indicate that particular official acts need not be shown to establish a gratuity offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present statute proscribes a gift \"for or because of any official act performed or to be performed,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> and further defines \"official act\" as \"any decision or action in a particular matter or in the enactment of legislation.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167;&#167; 3(a), 1(h) (emphasis added).   Use of the broad term \"any\" is consistent with a legislative intent to proscribe gifts motivated by unidentified official acts.   Most importantly, given the reasoning set forth in Lapham, we think that if the Massachusetts Legislature had wanted to drastically narrow the scope of the gratuity offense by requiring specifically identified official acts, it would have spoken more clearly than it has.   In the end, the Lapham case supports the conclusion that a gratuity offense may be established without proof that a specific official act was the motivation for the gratuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also relies on cases interpreting the similarly worded federal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> that indicate that a conviction under that statute does not require a showing that the gratuity was linked to a specific official act.   See, e.g., United States v. Bustamante, 45 F.3d 933, 940 (5th Cir.)  (\"it is sufficient for the government to show that the defendant was given the gratuity simply because he held public office\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 473, 133 L.Ed.2d 402 (1995);  United States v. Niederberger, 580 F.2d 63, 68-69 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 980, 99 S.Ct. 567, 58 L.Ed.2d 651 (1978);  United States v. Standefer, 610 F.2d 1076, 1080 (3d Cir.1979) (en banc), aff'd on other grounds, 447 U.S. 10, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980).   The government reasons that because much of the Massachusetts gratuity statute's language was based upon the federal statute, see Dutney, 348 N.E.2d at 822 n. 16, and because some federal cases hold that specific acts need not be shown, a similar interpretation of the state law should obtain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reliance on those cases, however, is undermined by the fact that the First Circuit has expressly reserved ruling on the question of whether or not a gratuity prosecution under the federal statute requires proof of a \"causal relation to any 'specific, identifiable act.' \"  United States v. Previte, 648 F.2d 73, 82 n. 8 (1st Cir.1981) (quoting Niederberger, 580 F.2d at 68-69).   Sawyer, on the other hand, cites no federal gratuity cases (or state gratuity cases, for that matter) squarely holding that specific acts must be shown;  although, he does cite cases in which specific official acts were shown, see e.g., United States v. Biaggi, 853 F.2d 89, 99-100 (2d Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1052, 109 S.Ct. 1312, 103 L.Ed.2d 581 (1989);  United States v. Brewster, 506 F.2d 62, 77-78 (D.C.Cir.1974).   This is not the proper case for us to decide the federal issue.   Thus, we conclude that it would be inappropriate to take any guidance here from cases interpreting the federal gratuity statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. State Ethics Commission Pronouncements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts State Ethics Commission is the primary civil enforcement agency for violations of the gratuity statute.   Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 3(i).   The Ethics Commission has the power and duty to investigate alleged gratuity offenses, initiate appropriate adjudicatory proceedings, and order civil penalties if it concludes that a violation has occurred.   Id. &#167; 4. Upon the petition of any party, a final action of the Ethics Commission is subject to review by the Massachusetts superior court, which may enforce, modify or set aside the order.   Id. &#167; 4(k).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ethics Commission has repeatedly interpreted the gratuity statute as forbidding gifts motivated generally by the official's authority to act favorably for the donor.   See In Re Charles F. Flaherty, 1990 SEC 59 (Disposition Agreement) (\" 'All that is required to bring [the gratuity statute] into play is a nexus between the motivation for the gift and the employee's public duties' \" (quoting In Re George A. Michael, 1981 SEC 59, 68));  SEC Commission Advisory No. 8 \"Free Passes\" (May 14, 1985) (noting that \"even in the absence of any specifically identifiable matter that was, is or soon will be pending before the official, [the gratuity statute] may apply\") (citing United States v. Standefer, 452 F.Supp. 1178, 1183 (W.D.Pa.1978)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We give the Ethics Commission's interpretation some deference.   See Olszewski v. Berube, 3 Mass.  L. Rptr. 297, 1995 WL 808889 (Mass.Super.No. 922666) (Jan. 27, 1995) at * 2 (stating that although the Ethics Commission's \"decision on matters within its competence is to be given great weight, the courts are the final interpreter\") (citing Finkelstein v. Board of Reg. in Optometry, 370 Mass. 476, 349 N.E.2d 346, 348 (1976)).   That deference, however, is tempered not only by the fact that no Massachusetts court has passed on the Ethics Commission's interpretation, but also because this is a criminal case and the Ethics Commission is charged only with civil enforcement.   The Commission may very well have valid reasons for adopting a broad, prophylactic interpretation of the statute in its civil dispositions of individual transgressions;  its interpretation is easier to prove and the offender is more likely to settle with the Commission if she does not have to admit to more egregious wrongdoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we note that the Ethics Commission's interpretation of the gratuity statute has been left undisturbed by the Massachusetts Legislature, and its interpretation is not \"arbitrary, unreasonable or inconsistent\" with the statute.  Finkelstein, 349 N.E.2d at 348.   Thus, the Ethics Commission's opinion on the matter further supports the conclusion that a specific official act need not be identified in a gratuity offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Conclusion:  Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of a Massachusetts court decision on this issue is troubling.   We have carefully considered, however, all of the authority and arguments on Sawyer's behalf, and none of them is availing.   We also take note of the fact that Sawyer does not cite a single gratuity case, either federal or state (and we have found none), holding that a specific official act must be linked to the unlawful gratuity.   Thus, we conclude that the Massachusetts gratuity statute does not require proof that the offender gave the item of \"substantial value\" because of a specifically identified official act.   Of course, the identification of certain official acts in relation to the gratuity might make a gratuity offense easier to prove, and we suspect that most cases will include such proof although it is unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases such as this one, it becomes clear why particular official acts need not be shown.   The evidence at trial showed that Sawyer gave items (that could be found to be of \"substantial value\") to Massachusetts legislators who had the ability to take official action favorable to Hancock, and that those gifts effectively ceased after the legislators left office.   While the government did not detail all of the legislators' acts that were favorable to Hancock, the government did show that Sawyer had a long-term, ongoing interest in the official acts of the legislators, and that he knew his gratuities were unlawful.   From this evidence, the jury could rationally infer that the gratuities were motivated by the legislators' performance of official duties, i.e., that they were given \"for or because of any official act,\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Exclusion of Skrine Memorandum</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer contends that the court unduly restricted the presentation of evidence that he entertained lawmakers solely out of friendship and goodwill and he believed that this did not violate the gratuity statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Specifically, he appeals the court's exclusion of a document, written by Bruce Skrine, memorializing Skrine's interview with Sawyer after the Boston Globe's inquiry into the Puerto Rico trip.   That document reflects Sawyer's assertion that such entertainment, while perhaps excessive in Puerto Rico, \"was commonly done and that, [the] legislators were all friends of his and that they were not in anyway [sic] discussing legislation or lobbying.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Sawyer did not attempt to offer this document to prove his state of mind with respect to his expenditures.   In fact, he indicated to the court that its admission was not necessary because he had already elicited the desired testimony from Skrine.   Later on, however, pointing out that the document did not mention that he entertained to \"gain access\" to legislators, Sawyer offered it to impeach Skrine.   The court did not permit its admission on that basis, but it did allow Sawyer to cross-examine Skrine on that very issue.   Because Sawyer did not offer the document for the purpose he now asserts on appeal, he has forfeited this claim.   See United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1302 (1st Cir.)  (explaining that evidence must have been offered for the purpose asserted on appeal to preserve issue) (citing Tate v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., 790 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir.1986)), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 378, 498, 499, 532, 130 L.Ed.2d 328, 408, 435 (1994).   But because the issue may again arise on remand, we further hold that because Sawyer was able to obtain the desired testimony on the issue he now asserts, we would find no abuse of discretion in its exclusion.   See United States v. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1995) (reviewing court's exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Admission of Computer Summaries</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer assigns reversible error to the district court's admission of five charts, Exhibits 1, 1Q, 1R, 1S and 1T, proffered by the government.   Exhibit 1 was a forty-nine page computer printout summarizing 612 expenditures, occurring between January 1, 1986 and March 31, 1993, that were recorded in Sawyer's appointment calendars, expense records and other admitted documents.   Exhibits 1Q, 1R and 1S are extracts of Exhibit 1 that isolate the expenditures for Representatives Woodward, Howarth and Emilio.   Exhibit 1T contrasts the amount spent on those three Representatives while they were members of the Legislature with the amount spent on them after they left that office.   Sawyer contends that these charts were admitted on an insufficient foundation and that they were misleading, argumentative and prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p>The contents of voluminous writings ... which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation.

He argues that this was unduly misleading because it created a \"false impression\" as to the date the alleged conspiracy began, and falsely implied that the expenditures ended after the three named representatives left office.   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summaries were based on evidence that was already independently admitted and that was relevant to Sawyer's questionable expenditures during the indictment period.

See Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1125 (concluding that argument that summaries failed to, inter alia, reflect \"total financial activity\" \"affect[s] weight rather than the admissibility\").   On the matters to which Sawyer assigns undue prejudice, he had ample opportunity to explore them on cross-examination, which he did.   He also could have offered his own contrary evidence, including his own summary (which he did not do).   As we stated in Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1126:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p>So long as the government, exercising due diligence, collects whatever records are reasonably available and succeeds in introducing them, it may be permitted (subject, of course, to relevancy and perscrutation under Fed.R.Evid. 403) to summarize the data it has managed to obtain.   If defendants possessed exculpatory records not in the government's files, they could have offered them at trial or prepared their own summary.   By the same token, if there were gaps in the charts, the defense ... had every opportunity to exploit them.

Our concern arises from the close relationship between lobbying activities that are lawful from the standpoint of federal law, even if deplorable, and associated or slightly more extreme versions of such conduct that can constitute federal violations.   The problem is, in some respects, novel;  the reason for its novelty is that it appears that prosecutions on facts like these have not generally been brought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of pre-McNally theft of honest services cases and of bribery and gratuity cases under the counterpart federal statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201, indicates, as we have already noted, that most involved straightforward corruption--most often, quid pro quo bribery or blatant conflict of interest.   While the issue in those cases was typically whether or not the conduct actually occurred, in most of them the alleged conduct was blatantly illegal.   This case is distinct in that the conduct itself may not be very different, except possibly in degree, from the kind of routine cultivation of friendship in a lobbying context that, while arguably very unattractive, is not \"bribery\" within the meaning of the Travel Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The practice of using hospitality, including lavish hospitality, to cultivate business or political relationships is longstanding and pervasive.   The government does not argue, and we do not believe, that payments for entertainment, lodging, golf, sports events, and the like would constitute violations of the Travel Act (or the mail and wire fraud statutes) if the aim of the lobbyist were simply to cultivate a business or political \"friendship\" with the legislator.   It may well be that all such hospitality should be flatly prohibited by law, but if Sawyer had this limited intent--to cultivate friendship rather than to influence an official act--the federal statutes here involved would not be violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge to the jury in this case followed the conventional formula for prosecutions involving political corruption.   But where the difference between lawful and unlawful turns primarily on intent, and the lawful conduct is itself most unattractive, we think the jury needs to be told specifically that the defendant has not violated the bribery component of the Travel Act (or committed honest services fraud) if his intent was limited to the cultivation of business or political friendship.   Only if instead or in addition, there is an intent to cause the recipient to alter her official acts may the jury find a theft of honest services or the bribery predicate of the Travel Act.  Absent some explicit explanation of this kind, the conventional charge will be slanted in favor of conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we intend no criticism of the able district judge who was coping with a somewhat novel foray by the government.   But where, as here, the line between the merely unattractive and actually criminal conduct is blurred, the court must take pains to explain the difference to the jury.   The Second Circuit took this same view in a closely related context, saying:  \"When an elected official who has received campaign contributions is charged with extortion and with receiving bribes, the charge must carefully focus the jury's attention on the difference between lawful political contributions and unlawful extortionate payments and bribes.\"  United States v. Biaggi, 909 F.2d 662, 695-96 (2d Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 904, 111 S.Ct. 1102, 113 L.Ed.2d 213 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the jury charge was mistaken, we must consider whether Sawyer should get the benefit of the error.   This is a close call.   On the one hand, Sawyer did not explicitly ask for the sort of language we think appropriate.   Ordinarily, the failure to make an explicit objection requires the defendant to satisfy the plain error test of United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).   On the other hand, a number of Sawyer's objections were closely related in that they sought in several different ways--which we do not accept--to protect one engaged in good faith lobbying from prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, we think that the Travel Act counts, as well as the mail and wire fraud convictions, ought to be reversed and retried under proper instructions.   Although the evidence here would be adequate to infer improper intent, the issue is close and an explanatory instruction could well affect the outcome.   Also, the fact that the prosecution was novel makes us look more tolerantly on Sawyer's failure to articulate precisely the shape of the necessary protective instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from the expense of retrial, the government has very little to complain about in this result.   We have agreed that the Massachusetts gratuity statute does not require the government to link the gratuity to a specific official act.   We have also found that the evidence here is sufficient to convict (although we can imagine reasonable people thinking otherwise).   And while we are somewhat concerned about the lack of fair warning of a prosecution such as this one, we see no legal basis for precluding the government from embarking on what is in practical terms an expansive reading of the federal statutes.   Against this backdrop, we think it even more important that Sawyer get the benefit of the few protections that remain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conspiracy Count</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer was also convicted, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, of one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, and to violate the Travel Act.  The court instructed the jury that it could find Sawyer guilty of conspiracy if it found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he conspired with his supervisor, Hathaway, to commit any one of the three objects, i.e., the substantive offenses as charged.   Because all of the objects--mail and wire fraud and the Travel Act violations--were erroneously charged and instructed, the conspiracy convictions must be reversed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Retrial is not precluded if the evidence is sufficient to prove the existence of a conspiracy, Sawyer's knowledge of and voluntary participation in it, and an overt act in furtherance of it.   See United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 890 (1st Cir.1993);  see generally, United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 653 (1st Cir.1996).   The agreement need not be explicit;  a tacit agreement will suffice.  Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 712-13, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 1269-70, 87 L.Ed. 1674 (1943).   To establish Sawyer's voluntary participation in the conspiracy, the evidence must establish both his intent to agree and his intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.  Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 890;  see also United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 615 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995).   Neither the agreement nor Sawyer's participation in it need be proven with direct evidence.  Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942);  see Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that:  (1) he and Hathaway knowingly agreed to commit the offenses;  (2) he voluntarily participated in such an agreement;  and (3) either of them performed any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.   We disagree.   The government presented evidence that Hathaway supervised Sawyer in his lobbying activities.   From Hathaway's receipt of many of the same legal memoranda and Massachusetts Ethics Commission rulings that Sawyer received, a jury could rationally infer that Hathaway (an attorney, like Sawyer) knew and understood the ethical obligations in lobbying.   Some of these documents had both Sawyer's and Hathaway's names on them;  thus, a jury could find that Hathaway and Sawyer knew of each other's knowledge of the lobbying laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  Sawyer turned to Hathaway, his supervisor, for approval of his expense vouchers.   Hathaway performed this responsibility throughout the indictment period, and in so doing was the only person (other than Sawyer) to have detailed knowledge of the specific legislators, often members of the Insurance Committee, who received the gifts and gratuities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the jury could reasonably infer that Hathaway and Sawyer both knew that the expenditures were unlawful, and from this, that the reason for the repeated illegal gifts and gratuities to key legislators was to secretly influence legislative action.   Given the evidence of the repeated submission and approval of the expense vouchers, a jury could rationally find that Hathaway and Sawyer agreed, at least tacitly, to the pattern of unlawful conduct.   Finally, the jury could also infer that Sawyer and Hathaway knew that the mails and wires would be used to facilitate the entertainment and/or reimbursement (e.g., the mailing of bills related to, and the making of telephone calls to arrange, the entertainment), and that interstate travel in connection with the entertainment (e.g., reimbursement of out-of-state golf) would or had to occur.   The overt acts charged in the indictment included Sawyer's giving of illegal gratuities and Hathaway's approval and authorization of reimbursement, and the evidence was sufficient to establish those acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, despite the underlying legal error, the evidence was sufficient to establish the conspiracy offense and a new trial on this count is allowable should the government so choose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer raises a number of other issues that we have reviewed, find to be without merit, and that warrant no further discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the mail fraud, wire fraud, Travel Act and conspiracy convictions, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 1986, Sawyer and his wife travelled with Representative Woodward and his wife to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.  Hancock provided the game tickets and reimbursed Sawyer for the airfare.   The district court instructed the jury that, because this trip occurred before the mail fraud statute proscribed honest services fraud, it could not provide the sole basis for a mail fraud conviction.   The court added, however, that the jury could consider the trip as evidence of Sawyer's state of mind with respect to the alleged scheme to defraud</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In the Spring of 1993, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts (\"USAO\") commenced an investigation into Hancock's involvement in the allegedly illegal expenditures on legislators.   In March 1994, Hancock entered into a civil settlement with the USAO whereby it paid a fine of about $1,000,000 and promised to cooperate with the USAO.  In return, the USAO agreed not to prosecute Hancock for any matter relating to the investigation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> According to the indictment, the legislators' duty of honest services included the obligation to perform their jobs as Massachusetts lawmakers free from deceit, fraud, dishonesty, favoritism and self-enrichment.   By consent of the parties, the district court struck the word \"favoritism\" in this description.  United States v. Sawyer, 878 F.Supp. 279, 294 (D.Mass.1995).   In addition to this general duty of honest services, the indictment stated that the legislators had a specific duty to abide by the Massachusetts laws set forth in the indictment.   The indictment identified both the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its citizenry as the fraud victims;  for simplicity, we will refer only to the public (or \"citizenry\") as the victim</p>\n        <p>With regard to the scheme to defraud, the indictment charged, inter alia, that Sawyer gave, and legislators accepted, travel, lodging, golf, meals and other entertainment in violation of Massachusetts law;  that Sawyer monitored the public coverage of the Massachusetts Legislature so that he could ensure the nondisclosure of his gratuities;  that Sawyer was given greater access to the Insurance Committee and its House Chair than was available generally to the citizenry;  that the House Chair of the Insurance Committee repeatedly performed official acts advocated by Sawyer on behalf of Hancock;  and that Sawyer's direct supervisor approved of, and authorized Hancock's reimbursement of Sawyer for, his illegal gratuities.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341 and 1343 provide:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises ...

We disagree.   While Sawyer ultimately endeavors to persuade us that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, he squarely challenges the very legal theory upon which he was convicted.   He particularly challenges the government's theory (as accepted by the district court) that, as a matter of law, the scheme to defraud could be predicated upon state law violations alone, without the intent to deprive the public of honest services.   Sawyer not only lodged an adequate objection on this issue with the trial court, see supra note 8, his brief to this court thoroughly addresses the precise legal issues surrounding the interplay between the mail statute, the state statutes, and the requirement of fraudulent intent.   The legal arguments are sharply presented and the record is adequate for our review.   Thus, we conclude that the issue is properly before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We note that under Massachusetts law, violation of the gift statute is punishable by no more than a $2000 civil fine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> This intent is not equivalent to, or subsumed within, the intent to deceive the public, discussed infra.   In addition to deceit (the gravamen of \"fraud\"), the government must also show the intent to harm (in this case, to deprive of honest services).   See McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Heritage Travel, Inc., 904 F.2d 786, 791-92 (1st Cir.)  (explaining that mail fraud requires both deceit and deprivation), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 992, 111 S.Ct. 536, 112 L.Ed.2d 546 (1990);  D'Amato, 39 F.3d at 1257 (explaining that \"the deceit must be coupled with a contemplated harm to the victim\") (quotation and citation omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The Massachusetts bribery statute, which did not form a part of this case, provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises anything of value to any state ... employee ..., with intent ... to influence any official act or any act within the official responsibility of such employee [shall be punished].</p>\n        <p>Mass.

See United States v. Previte, 648 F.2d 73, 82 (1st Cir.1981).   Sawyer assigns error to this instruction, contending that the fact that the act would have occurred without the gratuity is indicative of good faith.   Sawyer fails to explain, however, how the fact that an official act would have occurred anyway could have affected his state of mind when giving the gratuities.   The court's instruction was a correct statement of the law, relevant to this case, and it was not in error</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We do not think that the desire to gain access, by itself, amounts to an intent to influence improperly the legislators' exercise of official duties.   The government points to no legislative duty to provide equal access to all members of the public;  and, from a practical standpoint, we doubt one exists.   See Sawyer, 878 F.Supp. at 294 (striking phrase \"free from favoritism\" from indictment's list of legislators' duties).   True, Sawyer's very job description required him to develop contacts in the Legislature, and, as with all lobbyists, his employment goal was to persuade and influence legislators to benefit certain interests.   Such endeavors, however, are protected by the right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievance\" guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, see United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 625, 74 S.Ct. 808, 815-16, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954);  it would be impermissible to rely upon the lobbying position simpliciter to establish a corrupt intent to influence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346, \"the term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\"  (emphasis added).   We do not think the word \"deprive\" in this section eliminates the requirement of deceit in an honest services fraud prosecution.   Nor do we find that a deprivation of \"honest\" services, by definition, necessarily includes the deceit factor sufficient for mail fraud.   By enacting &#167; 1346, Congress meant to overturn McNally, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), which held that the scheme to defraud must be intended to deprive another of money or property.  Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 566.   And prior to McNally, courts endorsing the honest-services mail fraud theory invariably required some showing of deceit which is inherent in the term \"fraud.\"   See Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759-60;  Mandel, 591 F.2d at 1361;  United States v. Barber, 668 F.2d 778, 784-85 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 829, 103 S.Ct. 66, 74 L.Ed.2d 67 (1982).   We find nothing that indicates a change in this requirement for establishing honest services mail or wire fraud.   Thus, while it may be difficult to conceive of a scheme to deprive someone of the right to honest services without intending to deceive that person, the intent to deceive must nonetheless be established</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Although allegations that Sawyer caused legislators to violate their statutory disclosure obligations were withdrawn by the government at trial, the obligation to disclose material information inheres in the legislator's general fiduciary duty to the public.  Silvano, 812 F.2d at 758</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The government also presented evidence that Sawyer somehow concealed his expenditures on legislators from his Hancock superiors other than Hathaway.   The government does not argue that this evidence can amount to the requisite deceptive conduct, nor did it rely on it to prove the intent to deceive.   In any event, Sawyer's deceptive conduct toward Hancock, alone, cannot form the basis of this honest services fraud conviction.   Rather, the alleged victims of the mail fraud--here, the state and the public--must be the ones deceived.   Thus, in order for any deception of Hancock to form a part of the scheme to deprive the Commonwealth and her citizens of legislators' honest services, some showing that such conduct was connected to the defrauding of alleged victims is required.

The district court instructed the jury that a violation of the gratuity statute constituted \"unlawful\" activity within the purview of the Travel Act, a view with which we agree to the extent that the court instructed that something of value was given in order to influence the performance of an official act.

In other words, the government need not prove that the gratuity was given as a quid pro quo;  that is, in exchange for any one specific act performed or to be performed by the legislator.   The government does not have to show that there was an agreement between the defendant and the legislator requiring the legislator to perform certain acts in exchange for the gratuity.</p>\n        <p>The government must prove, however, that the defendant gave the alleged gratuity to a legislator with the expectation that the legislator would use his influence on official matters in ways favorable to the defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> For example, if the parent of a student gives the school principal a gift of substantial value at the student's graduation, that alone would not constitute a gratuity offense, even though the parent would not have given the gift \"but for\" the principal's position.

This temporal flexibility is also present in the Lapham statute (\"may then be pending or which may by law come or be brought before him\"), ch. 205, &#167; 9 (1891), as well as the federal gratuity statute (\"may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before [an official]\") noted infra.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(a)(3).   In our view, and contrary to the district court, while the language affording temporal flexibility is consistent with the absence of an official-act specificity requirement, it does not compel that result.

Such contentions would be relevant to the mail and wire fraud counts, which we have reversed.   We leave the good faith issues surrounding the gift statute (which are dependent on the evidence adduced at trial) for the district court to resolve on remand, should the government choose to retry those counts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> Sawyer also argues that the court erroneously refused to instruct the jury on his defense-theory that it was his belief that if expenditures were permitted under the lobbying-disclosure obligations set forth in Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 3, then those expenditures (although they had to be disclosed) were also allowed under the gratuity statute.   Upon review of the record, we agree with the district court that this instruction was unwarranted because Sawyer did not present any evidence that, during the indictment period, he actually believed that his expenditures were permitted by the lobbying-disclosure laws</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., United States v.

We are extremely doubtful whether this would constitute bribery for these purposes and do not read the Second Circuit as ruling on this point in United States v. Biaggi, 853 F.2d 89, 100-02 (2d Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1052, 109 S.Ct. 1312, 103 L.Ed.2d 581 (1989).   The fact that a gratuity violation involving an intent to influence is essentially bribery, see 853 F.2d at 101, does not mean that every possible application of a gratuity statute fits the rubric.   In all events, if the government intends to rely upon an intent to influence theory, our protective instruction would be required here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> For example, one trial exhibit was a memorandum from Sawyer to Hathaway, enclosing a 1990 State Ethics Commission Disposition Agreement with House Majority Leader Charles Flaherty.

Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3. Sawyer and Hathaway discussed the Flaherty Disposition during a meeting with Bruce Skrine (vice president, counsel and secretary for Hancock) in which Sawyer and Hathaway expressed concern about compliance with state ethics law in planning for the 1993 Boston Marathon brunch</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

William Sawyer, as a senior lobbyist within its Government Relations Department.   As the largest life insurance company in Massachusetts, Hancock had a continuing and abiding interest in the state's insurance laws.   Sawyer's job was to lobby the Massachusetts Legislature on Hancock's behalf.   In particular, his job description required him to:  research and develop Hancock's position on pertinent legislation;  communicate relevant information to representative government officials in order to effect a favorable outcome and to protect the Company's interests;  and establish and maintain relationships with legislators as well as with members of industry associations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A principal focus of Sawyer's lobbying activities was the Legislature's Joint Insurance Committee (\"Insurance Committee\"), composed of state representatives and senators.   The Insurance Committee has the ability to impact life insurance regulations more than any other legislative committee.   To this end, it reviews approximately 300 bills per year, about fifty of which affect the life insurance industry.   During each year of the indictment period, Massachusetts life insurance companies actively sought the passage of about five bills, most of which made it successfully through the Insurance Committee \"in some form or another.\"   Robert J. Smith, a research analyst and director for the Committee, testified that, during the indictment period, Sawyer was one of three lobbyists who appeared most often to lobby for bills sought by the life insurance industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Committee is co-chaired by a senate and house member, each with equal control over the fate of bills assigned to the Committee.   The Chairs have the ability to schedule hearings, assign bills to the hearing calendar and subsequent executive sessions, advocate bills at executive sessions, and take other action to advance them through the Committee.   Each Chair could \"carry\" a bill, i.e., actively guide it through the Legislature as a whole;  alternatively, a Chair could send it to the \"Study Committee\" which usually shelved it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the indictment period, Sawyer focused his lobbying activities on the house members of the Insurance Committee, some of whom took action that directly or indirectly affected Hancock's interests.   Representative Francis H. Woodward was the House Chair of the Insurance Committee from 1986 to 1990.   Research analyst Smith identified Sawyer as the lobbyist he saw most often with Representative Woodward during Woodward's tenure as the Committee's House Chair.   During this time, the Insurance Committee never rejected Woodward's recommendations on bills affecting the life insurance industry and Woodward \"carried\" most of the bills sought by the industry.   Representative Frank Emilio, a member from 1986 to 1990, sponsored a September 1990 bill on behalf of Hancock.   Representative John F. Cox sponsored bills that Hancock supported in November 1990 and December 1991.   In addition, Representatives Walsh, Mara, and Driscoll sponsored legislation sought by the life insurance industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Legislative Reports\" issued by the Hancock Government Relations Department to senior Hancock officers, and signed by Sawyer, outlined specific lobbying efforts and proceedings in the Massachusetts Legislature pertinent to Hancock's interests.   In July 1990, Sawyer wrote a memorandum to Hancock's Management Committee summarizing the successful efforts of Hancock lobbyists, including himself, in excluding Hancock from a bill that would have subjected it to a $100-million tax liability.   In a September 1990 memorandum to the Management Committee, Sawyer referred to a 1990 bill, filed by Representative Emilio, that allowed Hancock to assess and report its real estate advantageously.   A November 1990 letter from Ralph F. Scott, Hancock's Assistant Legislative Counsel, to Representative Cox indicated that Sawyer and Scott planned to work with Cox in obtaining favorable action on a specific bill that he had sponsored for Hancock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the indictment period, Sawyer paid for numerous meals, rounds of golf, and other entertainment for and with Massachusetts legislators, including many members of the Insurance Committee.   Although Sawyer initially paid for most of these activities himself, they were treated as business expenses and reimbursed by Hancock (hereinafter \"expenditures\").   In accordance with Hancock's procedures, Sawyer would complete monthly expense vouchers, attaching receipts and a handwritten calendar that identified the recipients of the expenses.   Sawyer's supervisor, Raeburn B. Hathaway, the head of Hancock's Government Relations Department, reviewed Sawyer's expense vouchers and approved them for reimbursement.   Hathaway's secretary would then detach the detailed calendars from the vouchers, keeping the calendars within the Government Relations Department, and forward the voucher, alone, to the accounting department for payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analysis of Sawyer's expense vouchers and calendars during the indictment period revealed that the top three recipients of his expenditures were:  Representative Woodward, who received more than $8,000 worth of expenditures during his tenure as Insurance Committee House Chair;  Robert Howarth, an Insurance Committee member from 1986 to 1992 (over $3,000);  and Representative Emilio (over $2,500).   After these three legislators left office, Sawyer, on behalf of Hancock, expended practically nothing on entertaining them (Woodward, $0;  Howarth, $8.33;  and Emilio, $85.65).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Sawyer's expenditures included thousands of dollars for golf--in and out of state--with various Massachusetts legislators including Representative Francis Mara, Woodward's 1991 successor as Insurance Committee House Chair.   Sawyer also hosted dinners for legislators and their families.   In September 1992, Sawyer provided Representative Mara and his wife tickets for a show in Hancock's private box at the Wang Center and ordered an accompanying dinner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The apparent catalyst for this prosecution was a December 1992 trip to Puerto Rico where Sawyer, other lobbyists, and a group of legislators, including Representative Mara, travelled for a legislative conference.   The group did not stay at the conference site, but instead went to a different resort where Sawyer paid for many of the legislators' meals, transportation, and golf.   Hancock reimbursed Sawyer for some $4,000 of entertainment expenses from the Puerto Rican trip.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Sawyer and his supervisor, Hathaway, had reason to believe that these expenditures could or did violate certain state laws.   In his office, Sawyer kept internal Hancock memoranda, newspaper articles, and opinions of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission, all explaining or reporting on Massachusetts ethics-in-lobbying.   While some of the documents varied in their interpretations, they nonetheless advised on compliance with laws regarding gratuities, gifts, and lobbying expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1993, a reporter from the Boston Globe newspaper queried Richard Bevilacqua, Hancock's Director of Employee and Customer Communications, about Sawyer's entertainment of legislators during the 1992 Puerto Rico trip and about Hancock's legislative agenda during that period.   Bevilacqua, in turn, asked Sawyer about the trip, and Sawyer opined, \"it's difficult to take anyone out to lunch or dinner these days without going over [the] amount [permitted by law].\"  This set of events prompted Hancock to begin an internal investigation into Sawyer's legislative expenditures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Bruce A. Skrine, vice president, corporate counsel and secretary for Hancock, asked Sawyer for his expense records.   Contemporaneous with Sawyer's production of the records, Sawyer told Skrine that the expenses were \"consistent with the way ... things were done on Beacon Hill.\"  Sawyer also told Skrine that his reason for making the expenditures was \"to get to know\" the legislators and to develop \"a certain relationship so that you could turn to them\";  he further indicated that he made these expenditures to \"build and maintain relationships,\" gain \"access to legislators,\" and get legislators to \"return his calls as a result of [the expenditures].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer caused the mailing of items related to the expenditures on legislators, including golf bills, reimbursement requests, and credit card bills.   Sawyer also caused the making of interstate telephone calls to arrange for some of the entertainment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a nine-day trial, the jury convicted Sawyer of fifteen counts of mail fraud, nine counts of wire fraud, eight counts of interstate travel to commit bribery, and one count of conspiracy.   The jury acquitted Sawyer of two additional mail fraud counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Mail and Wire Fraud Counts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged that Sawyer and his unindicted co-conspirator--his Hancock supervisor, Hathaway--engaged in a scheme to deprive the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its citizens of the right to the honest services of their state legislators,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and used the mails and interstate telephone wires in furtherance of the scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, and 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer contends that his convictions impermissibly involve the federal government in setting standards of good government for local and state officials.   He argues that this case is exemplary of the \"dangers of standardless federal criminal enforcement and unbridled prosecutorial discretion long-recognized under the mail fraud statute.\"   We have already considered and rejected these arguments, however.   See United States v. Silvano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483811\"><a href=\"/opinion/483811/united-states-v-joseph-silvano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 758-59 (1st Cir.1987).

To explain our resolution of this issue, we provide a brief overview of the law of honest services fraud.   The ultimate issue is whether or not the \"scheme\" presented at trial actually targeted the Massachusetts' citizens' right to \"honest services\" within the meaning of the mail fraud statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove mail and wire fraud, the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt:  (1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails or interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  United States v.

Because the relevant language in both the mail and wire fraud statutes is the same, we analyze both offenses together for the purposes of this case and, for simplicity, we refer only to mail fraud.

See generally, United States v.

Some courts later expanded the scope of the statutes to encompass schemes intended to defraud citizens of their intangible, non-property right to the honest services of their public officials.

See Silvano 812 F.2d at 759.   When an official fails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which she has decision-making power, the public is deprived of its right either to disinterested decision making itself or, as the case may be, to full disclosure as to the official's potential motivation behind an official act.   See id.  (upholding conviction of city fiduciary who failed to disclose material information about unnecessary spending of city money for secret enrichment of fiduciary's friend).   Thus, undisclosed, biased decision making for personal gain, whether or not tangible loss to the public is shown, constitutes a deprivation of honest services.   See e.g., Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 567 (city board member took secret action to influence award of public contract to official's private constructionbusiness interest);  United States v.

Although McNeive may have violated a city ordinance banning the acceptance of gratuities by city officials, the court found his conduct beyond the reach of the mail fraud statute because there was no evidence that the gratuities disadvantaged the city in any respect or that they deterred McNeive from otherwise conscientiously performing his duties.  Id. at 1251.   In short, the \"scheme\" was shown to neither involve nor contemplate the deprivation of McNeive's honest services to the city or public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, in United States v.

Rabbitt had offered to introduce a friend's architectural firm to certain public officials responsible for awarding state architectural contracts, in return for a ten percent commission on any work awarded.  Id. at 1020.   The government charged that his receipt of the resulting, undisclosed commissions defrauded the citizens of Rabbitt's honest services.  Id. at 1025.   The evidence showed, however, that the officials who awarded the architectural contracts did so on merit alone and Rabbitt played no role in the selection of the firm.  Id. at 1026.   Because Rabbitt did not control the awarding of the contracts, or otherwise fail to fulfill his official duties, his conduct did not deprive the citizens of his honest services.  Id. (noting case's resemblance to McNeive, 536 F.2d at 1251-52).   The court also observed that the government failed to cite any applicable standard requiring Rabbit to disclose his interest in the contracts, and thus, the citizens were not deprived of any right to such disclosure.  Id. at 1026.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The McNeive and Rabbitt cases illustrate that although a public official might engage in reprehensible misconduct related to an official position, the conviction of that official for honest-services fraud cannot stand where the conduct does not actually deprive the public of its right to her honest services, and it is not shown to intend that result.   Similarly, if a non-public-official is prosecuted for scheming to defraud the public of an official's honest services, the government must prove that the target of the scheme is the deprivation of the official's honest services.   If the \"scheme\" does not, as its necessary outcome, deprive the public of honest services, then independent evidence of the intent to deprive another of those services must be presented.

Scheme to Defraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government did not prosecute Sawyer on the theory that he, as a lobbyist, directly owed a duty of honest services to the Commonwealth or its citizens.   Rather, the government sought to prove that Sawyer engaged in conduct intended to cause state legislators to violate their duty to the public.   The government sought to establish this scheme by proving that Sawyer intentionally violated, or caused members of the legislature to violate, two Massachusetts statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Briefly, these two Massachusetts statutes, discussed more fully infra, are:  (1) Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 6 (the \"gift\" statute), which prohibits--under threat of civil penalties--a \"legislative agent\" from offering or giving to a public official (or an official's acceptance of) \"gifts\" aggregating $100 or more per year;  and (2) Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3 (the \"gratuity\" statute), which prohibits--under threat of civil and criminal penalties--anyone from giving to a legislator (or a legislator from soliciting or accepting) anything of \"substantial value ... for or because of any official act performed or to be performed\" by that person.   Through the violation of these laws, the government contended, Sawyer stole the honest services of the legislators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, proof of a state law violation is not required for conviction of honest services fraud.   See Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759.   Indeed, the incorporation of a state law violation in such a prosecution may cause complications.   See United States v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409042\"><a href=\"/opinion/409042/united-states-v-george-wayne-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 958 (5th Cir.1982) (reversing mail fraud conviction where jury should have been instructed that the defendant \"should not be found guilty of the federal offense merely because he violated state law\").   Here, however, the parties agree that the indictment, as structured, required it to prove that Sawyer violated at least one state law.   Thus, the state laws in question had to be correctly charged as a matter of state law, and the violation of at least one had to be proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer appeals various aspects of the court's jury instructions on the state statutes and their role in the alleged scheme to defraud.

I instruct you that under the mail and wire fraud statutes, a scheme to defraud can be a plan to deprive the public of its right to the honest services of members of the Massachusetts Legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elected public officials, such as members of the Massachusetts Legislature, owe certain duties to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to its citizens.   One of those duties is the duty to act honestly.   The government charges that by violating and causing legislators to violate certain state statutes, Mr. Sawyer deprived the public of its right to the honest services of members of the Massachusetts Legislature and, therefore devised a scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the government alleges that the defendant violated federal laws, mail fraud and wire fraud, by intentionally violating or causing Massachusetts legislators to violate certain state laws.   Accordingly, in order to prove the first element of the mail fraud and/or wire fraud, that the defendant devised a scheme to defraud, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally violated or caused members of the Massachusetts Legislature to violate at least one of the following two state laws .... (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After describing the two statutes, the court continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant devised or created a scheme to defraud in which he intentionally violated or caused a violation of at least one of the laws that I have just described, then you may find that the government has proved the first element of mail fraud and wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These instructions permitted the jury to find the requisite scheme to defraud upon proof that Sawyer violated, or caused legislators to violate, either one of the state statutes.   In other words, the jury was allowed to find that a violation of either statute, without more, constituted the deprivation of honest services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  At oral argument before this court, the government affirmed that it chose the state law violations as \"the sole vehicle to prove the scheme or artifice to defraud\" in order to \"narrow the issues of intent and good faith.\"   Thus, we analyze both state statutes in light of the law of honest services, set forth above, to determine whether the court's instructions erroneously permitted a conviction for conduct not within the reach of the mail fraud statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Gift Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first Massachusetts statute on which the alleged scheme to defraud was based is ch.   268B, &#167; 6 (the \"gift statute\"), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>No legislative agent shall knowingly and wilfully offer or give to a public official or public employee or a member of such person's immediate family, and no public official or public employee or member of such person's immediate family shall knowingly and wilfully solicit or accept from any legislative agent, gifts with an aggregate value of one hundred dollars or more in a calendar year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 6. We discuss Sawyer's challenges to the court's instructions on the statutory definitions before turning to the statute's relation to the scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>a. \"Legislative Agent\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed the jury that, under the statute, a legislative agent cannot give or offer gifts aggregating $100 or more to a legislator or member of the legislator's family.   It further instructed that a \"legislative agent\" is \"any person who, for compensation or reward, does any act to promote, oppose or influence legislation.\"   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 1(g).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Sawyer argues that this instruction failed to reflect his assertion that a person is a \"legislative agent\" only when he is so registered with the Secretary of State or he is actually engaging in lobbying activity at the time he gave the alleged gifts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed that a legislative agent is one who is paid to \"promote, oppose or influence legislation,\" i.e., to lobby, and that such agents are forbidden to give or offer certain \"gifts.\"   The instruction, as a whole, adequately conveyed the idea that such gifts are forbidden only when given by those who, at the time of the gifts, are paid to actually lobby.   While there may be a person with the job title \"lobbyist\" who does not actually engage in lobbying, there was ample evidence here that Sawyer lobbied at the time he gave the alleged \"gifts.\"   Moreover, the fact that he had an obligation to register with the Secretary of State, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 3, &#167;&#167; 40, 41, does not alter the definition.   No further instruction was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>b. Shared Meals as \"Gifts\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed the jury that \"gifts,\" under the relevant Massachusetts law, are \"a payment, entertainment, subscription, advance, services or anything of value, unless consideration of equal or greater value is received.\"   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 1(g).   Much of the evidence offered to prove Sawyer's violations of the gift statute was his payment for shared meals and entertainment with the legislators.   Sawyer contends that his payment for \"shared hospitality\" does not constitute a \"gift\" within the meaning of the statute.   The issue turns out to be potentially complicated and involves somewhat convoluted analysis of the statutory history of a comparable law set forth at Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 3, &#167; 43.   We have carefully reviewed the arguments on both sides, and for the reasons set forth in the district court's ruling, see Sawyer, 878 F.Supp. at 282-84, we conclude that Sawyer's shared meals could, if the jury so found, fit within the gift definition's term \"entertainment\" and/or the very broad phrase, \"anything of value.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>c.

Sawyer challenges this legal premise, arguing that such violations do not necessarily deprive the public of those services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gift statute, which forbids a legislative agent from \"knowingly and wilfully\" giving a \"public official ... gifts with an aggregated value of one hundred dollars or more in a calendar year,\" Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 6, simply limits, by a dollar-amount, the gift-giving by lobbyists to legislators.   It is a prophylactic civil prohibition that addresses appearances of--but not actual--corruption.   A violation of the Massachusetts gift statute does not necessarily entail any improper motive to influence, or otherwise affect, the official duties of the recipient.   It is possible for a lobbyist to give a legislator items falling within the statute's definition of \"gift,\" or for a legislator to accept such gifts, without an accompanying intent to cause the legislator to deviate from the honest performance of official duties.   While such gifts would constitute a gift-statute violation, not every such circumstance would necessarily amount to a deviation from the official's performance of honest services to the public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Thus, unlike the honest services fraud cases, noted above, in which an official was bribed or took official action based on a secret conflict of interest, a gift statute violation, even if intentional, does not in itself amount to honest services fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Massachusetts' citizenry expects their legislators to comply with laws pertaining to their official capacity, the presence of such illegal conduct, even though it relates to public office, does not by itself (or, per se ) establish honest services fraud.

To establish the scheme to defraud through these violations, however, it must also have been charged and shown that the intent behind the violations was the deprivation of honest services.   See D'Amato, 39 F.3d at 1257 (explaining that where harm is not the necessary result of the scheme, independent evidence of fraudulent intent is required).   Thus, this case required a separate instruction that, to prove the intent to commit honest services fraud, the jury had to find that Sawyer intended to influence or otherwise improperly affect the official's performance of duties, not merely that he intended to violate the state statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Allowing the jury to find that Sawyer intended to defraud the public of its right to honest services based on proof of gift statute violations alone constituted reversible error.

Because this language entails some connection between the gift and the performance of official duties, a gratuity statute violation--unlike a gift statute violation--may itself be sufficient to implicate the duty of honest services in a given case.   As with the gift statute, however, not every violation of the gratuity statute automatically encompasses an intent to induce the public official to alter or deviate from the performance of honest and impartial services.   We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Massachusetts gratuity offense does not require a finding of corrupt intent, i.e., improper intent to influence official decision making.   See Commonwealth v. Dutney, 4 Mass.App.Ct. 363, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2009407\"><a href=\"/opinion/2009407/commonwealth-v-dutney/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 821 (1976) (finding gratuity offense to be a lesser included offense of Massachusetts bribery statute, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 2, which adds the element of \"corrupt intent\" i.e., intent to influence);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  cf.  United States v. Mariano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598971\"><a href=\"/opinion/598971/united-states-v-abel-a-mariano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>, 1159 (1st Cir.1993) (observing that gratuity offense, unlike bribery, does not involve a \"corrupt purpose\"). Rather, only some lesser intent need be shown.   A jury might be charged to find a bribery or gratuity offense in the alternative, thus allowing it to convict for a gratuity offense if it is convinced that the defendant gave something to a public official because of an official act, but is not persuaded that the defendant had a corrupt intent to influence that act.   See, e.g., Dutney, 348 N.E.2d at 821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the word \"gratuity\" implies, the intent most often associated with the offense is the intent to \"reward\" an official for an act taken in the past or to be taken in the future.   See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1159 (noting that, unlike one who bribes, the gratuity offender \"gives the gift without attaching any strings, intending it instead as a reward for actions the public official has already taken or is already committed to take\").   The official act might otherwise be properly motivated;  and the gratuity, though unlawful, might not be intended to influence the official's mindset with regard to that particular action.   In some cases, such as a reward for long-past official action, the intent to influence could not possibly exist.   A finding of honest services fraud, however, requires, in connection with the gratuity, the intent to cause an official to deviate from the honest performance of services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as with the gift statute, proof of a violation of the Massachusetts gratuity statute, without more, does not establish an intent to commit honest services fraud.   The government must prove that the conduct was accompanied by the requisite intent.   This intent could be shown in a number of ways.   For example, a bribery-like, corrupt intent to influence official action necessarily is an intent to deprive the public of an official's honest services.   A person might not, however, give an unlawful gratuity with the intent to effect a specific quid pro quo.   Rather, as the government contends here, a person with continuing and long-term interests before an official might engage in a pattern of repeated, intentional gratuity offenses in order to coax ongoing favorable official action in derogation of the public's right to impartial official services.   Such conduct would be akin to (although not a classic case of) the conflict of interest cases noted above.   See, e.g., Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 567;  Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759.   Here, for example, while Sawyer may not have provided the legislators with direct kickbacks or commissions arising out of the specific official action, he may have intended the legislators generally to treat preferentially Hancock's interests, knowing that the free meals, entertainment, and golf would continue so long as favorable official acts were, at some point, taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court did not, in fact, instruct the jury on a true \"gratuity\" offense.   Instead, it instructed the jury that, to establish a gratuity offense, the government must prove that Sawyer \"gave something of substantial value to a legislator with the intent to influence an official act of that legislator.\"   While this instruction erroneously added an intent-to-influence element to the gratuity offense, it also had the effect of charging the jury to find the requisite intent for honest services fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Conclusion:  Scheme to Deprive of Honest Services</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was permitted to find the first element of mail and wire fraud, the scheme to defraud, upon proof that either the gift statute or the gratuity statute was violated.   The gift statute as charged, however, was a legally insufficient basis upon which to find the scheme to defraud.   Although the gratuity statute was properly instructed in terms of honest services mail fraud, we cannot tell if the convictions were based on that statute or the insufficiently charged gift statute.   When a jury has been presented with several bases for conviction, one of which is legally erroneous, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury convicted upon, the conviction cannot stand.  United States v. Nieves-Burgos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701736\"><a href=\"/opinion/701736/united-states-v-frank-nieves-burgos/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 435-36 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that if we find error with respect to the gift statute, we should affirm the convictions because the jury found that Sawyer committed gratuity offenses within the Travel Act convictions, discussed infra.   We cannot assume from the Travel Act convictions, however, that the jury based its mail and wire fraud convictions on the gratuity statute.   The court charged the jury to consider each offense as separate bases for the mail and wire fraud charges.   Accordingly, the possibility exists that, when convicting on the mail and wire fraud charges, the jury focused on violations of the gift statute, alone.   See Boots, 80 F.3d at 589 (declining to affirm conviction where it was possible that the jury focused its verdict on erroneous basis).   Thus, for the foregoing reasons, Sawyer's mail and wire fraud convictions must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove an intent to influence the legislators' official acts and that therefore his conviction should be reversed without the possibility of retrial.   We cannot agree.   At trial, there was evidence that Sawyer intentionally and repeatedly provided legislators with valuable gifts of entertainment for the purpose of obtaining \"greater access\" to,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and of developing a \"certain relationship with,\" legislators.   A jury could credit Sawyer's defense that he thought his expenditures were lawful and that they were meant only for goodwill entertaining.   Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, however, see United States v. Olbres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196204\"><a href=\"/opinion/196204/united-states-v-olbres/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span> (1995), a jury could also rationally infer, beyond a reasonable doubt that Sawyer intended that his repeated gifts and gratuities would induce legislators to perform official acts to benefit Hancock's interests regardless of, or at the expense of, the public interest.   Hence, retrial is not precluded.   See Boots, 80 F.3d at 589-90 (reversing because of legal error in instructions but remanding for possible retrial because the evidence was sufficient for proper conviction);  United States v. Ochs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503427\"><a href=\"/opinion/503427/united-states-v-paul-ochs-jr-united-states-of-america-v-richard-dray/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 529 (1st Cir.1988) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the possibility that the government may choose to retry this case, we think it is useful to add a cautionary word concerning the relationship between state and federal law in cases such as this one.   Our comments are addressed primarily to the mail fraud statute but apply in some measure to the Travel Act charge, discussed infra, as well.   Two problems are of specific concern to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, concerning the theft of honest services jury instruction, an overemphasis on what state law forbids may lead the jury to believe that state rather than federal law defines the crime, or more specifically, that any violation of a state law or regulation concerning lobbying or related matters amounts to honest services fraud.   Wire and mail fraud are federal offenses;  and while state violations may play a role, the jury should not be allowed to slip into the misunderstanding that any violation of proliferating state laws and regulations controlling this area automatically amounts to a federal crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a similar vein, we think there exists a risk in this case--particularly in view of the prosecutor's closing argument with its repeated emphasis on permissible dollar limits in lobbying--that the jury could wrongly believe that any expenditure in excess of that allowed by state statute or regulation by itself constitutes the federal offense.   The district court has ample authority under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 to limit evidence concerning state law requirements where that evidence is substantially more prejudicial than probative.   And, in all events, jury instructions need to make clear that for the federal honest services fraud to be proven, the defendant must have the intent to affect a legislator's performance of an official act and not merely to make payments in excess of some state specified limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Intent to Deceive</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not a new trial on the mail and wire fraud counts is allowable requires us to reach Sawyer's additional contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish his intent to deceive the public.   To this end, Sawyer contends that because the government did not establish that he had a duty to disclose his illegal gifts and gratuities to the public, his intent to deceive the public had to be shown through affirmative acts of deception, which he claims are absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish mail fraud--in cases involving honest services fraud and otherwise--the alleged scheme must involve deception in the deprivation of money, property, or the right to honest services.

The latter requires evidence only that Sawyer intended to cause the legislators intentionally to fail to disclose material information about the violations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> although evidence that he intended the legislators to affirmatively misrepresent themselves in this regard would also suffice.

While we have little doubt that bribes are usually given in secrecy, see Holzer, 816 F.2d at 309 (observing that \"no public official in the United States takes bribes openly\"), bribery and gratuity statutes generally, as here, do not require a separate element of deception.   Ostensibly, a person could offer an illegal bribe to a public official and not be concerned with its secrecy.   Thus, the evidence presented must permit a finding that Sawyer not only gave the unlawful gifts or gratuities with the intent to deprive the public of honest services, but that he also intended to deceive the public about that conduct.   See Bush, 522 F.2d at 648.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government presented evidence that Sawyer gave the unlawful gifts and gratuities during the seven years of the indictment period until the Boston Globe exposed the practice in May 1993.   Much of his entertainment of lobbyists took place out-of-state--usually at industry and legislative conferences--where members of the Massachusetts citizenry generally would not observe the questionable activities.   Unlike his acts of \"non-public\" entertainment, Sawyer ensured compliance with state ethical standards for a 1993 Boston Marathon brunch, potentially a high profile event.   In his office, Sawyer kept newspaper articles reporting legislators' activities with lobbyists, and in particular, the ethical ramifications of such relationships.   In one article, Representative Mara (a recipient of Sawyer's unlawful gifts or gratuities) is quoted as saying, \"Everyone picks up their own tabs at [legislative] conferences....  These conferences have become almost nonexistent.\"   These articles were kept in notebooks with other materials regarding lobbying laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury rationally could infer that Sawyer was cognizant of his ethical obligations in lobbying, knew of the public awareness of lobbying activity, and repeatedly gave hidden unlawful gifts and gratuities until he was publicly exposed.   While not overwhelming, the combined evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sawyer intended to deceive the public about his unlawful expenditures on legislators.

Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952 (the \"Travel Act\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  The government asserted that Sawyer violated the Massachusetts gratuity statute subsequent to interstate travel to the following destinations:  Tulsa, Oklahoma;  Orlando, Florida;  Savannah, Georgia;  Scottsdale, Arizona;  Key Largo, Florida;  Charleston, South Carolina;  Amelia Island, Florida;  and Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer argues that his Travel Act convictions must be reversed because:  (1) the court erroneously instructed the jury on the gratuity statute;  (2) the evidence was insufficient to establish the gratuity offenses;  (3) the court barred him from presenting evidence crucial to his defense;  and (4) the court improperly admitted summary evidence introduced by the government.   Although we discuss and reject each of these arguments in turn, we nonetheless reverse his conviction on these counts because the district court's instructions on the meaning of \"bribery,\" for the purposes of the Travel Act, were fatally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3(a).   An \"official act\" is defined as:  \"any decision or action in a particular matter or in the enactment of legislation.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 1(h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  Here, Sawyer allegedly bestowed gratuities upon legislators who were members of the Insurance Committee.   Thus, for purposes of this discussion, we proceed on the theory that the government had to prove that Sawyer gave the gratuities \"for or because of ... any decision or action in the enactment of legislation.\"   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167;&#167; 3(a), 1(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties' interpretations of the gratuity statute differ with respect to the scope and character of the connection required between the gratuity and the official act.   Sawyer contends that the gratuity must be linked to a specific, identifiable official act.   The government argues that it is sufficient to prove that the gratuity would not have been given but for the legislator's ability to take official action favorable to Sawyer.   In a pretrial ruling on Sawyer's motions to dismiss, the district court agreed with the government's interpretation, and instructed as such.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Massachusetts court decision has yet interpreted the operative \"for or because of any official act\" language in ch.   268A, &#167; 3(a).   To support their respective positions, the parties present differing arguments regarding the statutory language, legislative history, comparable statutes, and State Ethics Commission rulings.   We consider these sources separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Statutory Language</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gratuity statute prohibits the giving of gratuities \"for or because of any official act performed or to be performed.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3. The statute does not read \"for or because of the official's position.\"   Rather, it forbids gratuities motivated by \"any official act\" and further defines, rather meticulously, \"official act.\"   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167;&#167; 1(h) &amp; (k).   Thus, on the face of the statute, it does not appear that the unlawfulness of the gratuity could be established by proof that it was motivated solely by the official's position.   In other words, proof of the offense requires something more than a simple showing that \"but for\" the official's authority, the gratuity would not have been given.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This observation, however, does not lead to the conclusion that the gratuity must be shown to be motivated by a specifically identified official act.   As noted supra, a gratuity offense is essentially a bribery offense without proof of \"corrupt intent.\"   The concern behind the gratuity statute, like the bribery statute, is the potential undermining of official integrity.   A gratuity does not compromise this integrity because of its possible effect on the official's \"position\";  rather, the danger is in its ability to affect the official's performance of duties, i.e., \"official acts.\"   It is not surprising, then, that the statute proscribes gratuities motivated by \"official acts\" rather than \"official position.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the use of the term \"official act\" appears to ensure that the gratuity would be deemed unlawful only when the giving of an item of \"substantial value\" is linked to the official's performance of duties.   The connection between the gratuity and the performance of official duties, however, does not necessarily require the identification of a specific official act, and we find nothing in the statutory language to require such a demonstration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Legislative History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gratuity statute was based, in part, upon a bill drafted by a 1962 Massachusetts Special Commission on Code of Ethics.   See Report of the Special Commission on Code of Ethics, 1962 House Doc.  No. 3650, p. 8. Nothing in the Commission's Report, however, assists us in resolving the instant question.   It states only:  \"It should be noted that to constitute a criminal act, the giving or receiving of the item of such 'substantial value' must be 'for or because of' an official act.\"   Id. at 11;  see Commonwealth v. Famigletti, 4 Mass.App.Ct. 584, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2029903\"><a href=\"/opinion/2029903/commonwealth-v-famigletti/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 893 (1976) (noting same language in the report).   The Report neither parses out what these terms mean, nor gives examples of what was intended.   From this we discern only that the Commission was concerned that \"innocent\" gifts to officials would not fall within the gratuity statute's purview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's report does tell us that \"[m]uch of the language of the proposed legislation is taken and adapted from [a proposed federal bribery/gratuity bill].\"  Report of Special Commission, supra at 8;  see Dutney, 348 N.E.2d at 822 n. 16.  As discussed below, however, the comparable federal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c), is also unhelpful in resolving the question before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Comparable Statutes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its position, the government relies on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's interpretation of a different statute in Commonwealth v. Lapham, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></span> (Mass.1892), and on federal cases interpreting the federal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lapham involved a milk dealer who attempted to bribe a city milk inspector and was convicted under a statute punishing anyone who:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>corruptly gives, offers or promises to any executive, legislative ... or judicial officer ... any gift or gratuity whatever, with intent to influence his act, vote, opinion, decision, or judgment on any matter, question, cause, or proceeding, which may be then pending, or may by law come or be brought before him in his official capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Pub. St. ch. 205, &#167; 9 (Ch. 349 Revised May 21, 1891);  see Lapham, 31 N.E. at 638-39.   The milk dealer argued that the indictment was insufficient because it did not aver a particular matter to be influenced.  Id. The Supreme Judicial Court disagreed, reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>Nor is it necessary in an indictment under [ch. 205, &#167; 9] to aver that the corrupt intention to influence the act, opinion, decision or judgment of the inspector was in relation to any specific and particular matter then pending before him, or which was then expected to come before him.   It is enough to aver a corrupt intention so to influence him in any matter which may then be pending, or which may by law come or be brought before him.   If for example an executive, legislative or judicial officer is bribed corruptly to favor a particular person in any and all matters affecting that person which may come before such officer, without specification or knowledge of the particular matters likely to come up, the statute is broad enough to include such a case.   A narrower construction of a similar statute has been adopted in Alabama, but we cannot follow it.  Barefield v. State, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span> [1848].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. 31 N.E. at 639.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with the government's reliance on Lapham is, of course, the fact that it involved a differently worded statute.   The Lapham statute proscribes a corrupt gift to influence an official act \"on any matter ... which may be then pending or may by law come or be brought before him in his official capacity.\"   Mass. Pub. St. ch. 205, &#167; 9 (Ch. 349 Revised May 21, 1891) (emphasis added).   In holding that an averment of a specific matter was not necessary, the Lapham court repeatedly used the word \"may.\"   See, e.g., id.  (\"It is enough to aver a corrupt intention so to influence him in any matter which may then be pending, or which may by law come or be brought before him.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether the absence of the word \"may\" in the present gratuity statute, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167;&#167; 3, 1(h) &amp; (k), signifies, by negative implication, the requirement of a specific official act.   The reasoning in Lapham does seem to indicate some relationship between the word \"may\" and the absence of a specificity requirement.   We think, however, that it does not follow that the word \"may\" is the only manner in which to indicate that particular official acts need not be shown to establish a gratuity offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present statute proscribes a gift \"for or because of any official act performed or to be performed,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> and further defines \"official act\" as \"any decision or action in a particular matter or in the enactment of legislation.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167;&#167; 3(a), 1(h) (emphasis added).   Use of the broad term \"any\" is consistent with a legislative intent to proscribe gifts motivated by unidentified official acts.   Most importantly, given the reasoning set forth in Lapham, we think that if the Massachusetts Legislature had wanted to drastically narrow the scope of the gratuity offense by requiring specifically identified official acts, it would have spoken more clearly than it has.   In the end, the Lapham case supports the conclusion that a gratuity offense may be established without proof that a specific official act was the motivation for the gratuity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also relies on cases interpreting the similarly worded federal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> that indicate that a conviction under that statute does not require a showing that the gratuity was linked to a specific official act.

The government reasons that because much of the Massachusetts gratuity statute's language was based upon the federal statute, see Dutney, 348 N.E.2d at 822 n. 16, and because some federal cases hold that specific acts need not be shown, a similar interpretation of the state law should obtain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reliance on those cases, however, is undermined by the fact that the First Circuit has expressly reserved ruling on the question of whether or not a gratuity prosecution under the federal statute requires proof of a \"causal relation to any 'specific, identifiable act.' \"  United States v.

Sawyer, on the other hand, cites no federal gratuity cases (or state gratuity cases, for that matter) squarely holding that specific acts must be shown;  although, he does cite cases in which specific official acts were shown, see e.g., United States v.

State Ethics Commission Pronouncements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts State Ethics Commission is the primary civil enforcement agency for violations of the gratuity statute.   Mass. Gen. L. ch.   268B, &#167; 3(i).   The Ethics Commission has the power and duty to investigate alleged gratuity offenses, initiate appropriate adjudicatory proceedings, and order civil penalties if it concludes that a violation has occurred.   Id. &#167; 4. Upon the petition of any party, a final action of the Ethics Commission is subject to review by the Massachusetts superior court, which may enforce, modify or set aside the order.   Id. &#167; 4(k).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ethics Commission has repeatedly interpreted the gratuity statute as forbidding gifts motivated generally by the official's authority to act favorably for the donor.   See In Re Charles F. Flaherty, 1990 SEC 59 (Disposition Agreement) (\" 'All that is required to bring [the gratuity statute] into play is a nexus between the motivation for the gift and the employee's public duties' \" (quoting In Re George A. Michael, 1981 SEC 59, 68));  SEC Commission Advisory No. 8 \"Free Passes\" (May 14, 1985) (noting that \"even in the absence of any specifically identifiable matter that was, is or soon will be pending before the official, [the gratuity statute] may apply\") (citing United States v.

See Olszewski v. Berube, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>  <span class=\"page\">L</span></span>. Rptr. 297, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">808889</span></span> (Mass.Super.No. 922666) (Jan. 27, 1995) at * 2 (stating that although the Ethics Commission's \"decision on matters within its competence is to be given great weight, the courts are the final interpreter\") (citing Finkelstein v. Board of Reg. in Optometry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2129333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2129333/finkelstein-v-board-of-registration-in-optometry/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2129333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2129333/finkelstein-v-board-of-registration-in-optometry/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 348 (1976)).   That deference, however, is tempered not only by the fact that no Massachusetts court has passed on the Ethics Commission's interpretation, but also because this is a criminal case and the Ethics Commission is charged only with civil enforcement.   The Commission may very well have valid reasons for adopting a broad, prophylactic interpretation of the statute in its civil dispositions of individual transgressions;  its interpretation is easier to prove and the offender is more likely to settle with the Commission if she does not have to admit to more egregious wrongdoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we note that the Ethics Commission's interpretation of the gratuity statute has been left undisturbed by the Massachusetts Legislature, and its interpretation is not \"arbitrary, unreasonable or inconsistent\" with the statute.  Finkelstein, 349 N.E.2d at 348.   Thus, the Ethics Commission's opinion on the matter further supports the conclusion that a specific official act need not be identified in a gratuity offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Conclusion:  Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of a Massachusetts court decision on this issue is troubling.   We have carefully considered, however, all of the authority and arguments on Sawyer's behalf, and none of them is availing.   We also take note of the fact that Sawyer does not cite a single gratuity case, either federal or state (and we have found none), holding that a specific official act must be linked to the unlawful gratuity.   Thus, we conclude that the Massachusetts gratuity statute does not require proof that the offender gave the item of \"substantial value\" because of a specifically identified official act.   Of course, the identification of certain official acts in relation to the gratuity might make a gratuity offense easier to prove, and we suspect that most cases will include such proof although it is unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases such as this one, it becomes clear why particular official acts need not be shown.   The evidence at trial showed that Sawyer gave items (that could be found to be of \"substantial value\") to Massachusetts legislators who had the ability to take official action favorable to Hancock, and that those gifts effectively ceased after the legislators left office.   While the government did not detail all of the legislators' acts that were favorable to Hancock, the government did show that Sawyer had a long-term, ongoing interest in the official acts of the legislators, and that he knew his gratuities were unlawful.   From this evidence, the jury could rationally infer that the gratuities were motivated by the legislators' performance of official duties, i.e., that they were given \"for or because of any official act,\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Exclusion of Skrine Memorandum</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer contends that the court unduly restricted the presentation of evidence that he entertained lawmakers solely out of friendship and goodwill and he believed that this did not violate the gratuity statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Specifically, he appeals the court's exclusion of a document, written by Bruce Skrine, memorializing Skrine's interview with Sawyer after the Boston Globe's inquiry into the Puerto Rico trip.   That document reflects Sawyer's assertion that such entertainment, while perhaps excessive in Puerto Rico, \"was commonly done and that, [the] legislators were all friends of his and that they were not in anyway [sic] discussing legislation or lobbying.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Sawyer did not attempt to offer this document to prove his state of mind with respect to his expenditures.   In fact, he indicated to the court that its admission was not necessary because he had already elicited the desired testimony from Skrine.   Later on, however, pointing out that the document did not mention that he entertained to \"gain access\" to legislators, Sawyer offered it to impeach Skrine.   The court did not permit its admission on that basis, but it did allow Sawyer to cross-examine Skrine on that very issue.   Because Sawyer did not offer the document for the purpose he now asserts on appeal, he has forfeited this claim.   See United States v. Whiting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673817\"><a href=\"/opinion/673817/united-states-v-darryl-whiting-aka-g-god-rah-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>, 1302 (1st Cir.)

But because the issue may again arise on remand, we further hold that because Sawyer was able to obtain the desired testimony on the issue he now asserts, we would find no abuse of discretion in its exclusion.

Newman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195935\"><a href=\"/opinion/195935/united-states-v-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.1995) (reviewing court's exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Admission of Computer Summaries</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer assigns reversible error to the district court's admission of five charts, Exhibits 1, 1Q, 1R, 1S and 1T, proffered by the government.   Exhibit 1 was a forty-nine page computer printout summarizing 612 expenditures, occurring between January 1, 1986 and March 31, 1993, that were recorded in Sawyer's appointment calendars, expense records and other admitted documents.   Exhibits 1Q, 1R and 1S are extracts of Exhibit 1 that isolate the expenditures for Representatives Woodward, Howarth and Emilio.   Exhibit 1T contrasts the amount spent on those three Representatives while they were members of the Legislature with the amount spent on them after they left that office.   Sawyer contends that these charts were admitted on an insufficient foundation and that they were misleading, argumentative and prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p>The contents of voluminous writings ... which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation.

He argues that this was unduly misleading because it created a \"false impression\" as to the date the alleged conspiracy began, and falsely implied that the expenditures ended after the three named representatives left office.   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summaries were based on evidence that was already independently admitted and that was relevant to Sawyer's questionable expenditures during the indictment period.   Sawyer had the opportunity, on cross-examination, to place the summaries in context with his total financial activity.   See Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1125 (concluding that argument that summaries failed to, inter alia, reflect \"total financial activity\" \"affect[s] weight rather than the admissibility\").   On the matters to which Sawyer assigns undue prejudice, he had ample opportunity to explore them on cross-examination, which he did.   He also could have offered his own contrary evidence, including his own summary (which he did not do).   As we stated in Nivica, 887 F.2d at 1126:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p>So long as the government, exercising due diligence, collects whatever records are reasonably available and succeeds in introducing them, it may be permitted (subject, of course, to relevancy and perscrutation under Fed.R.Evid. 403) to summarize the data it has managed to obtain.   If defendants possessed exculpatory records not in the government's files, they could have offered them at trial or prepared their own summary.   By the same token, if there were gaps in the charts, the defense ... had every opportunity to exploit them.   In the last analysis, completeness of the underlying records was for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the summaries were based on a sufficient foundation and that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting them.D. Protective Instruction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having rejected all of Sawyer's arguments, we think there is one flaw in the proceedings that does have to be addressed in the interests of justice and especially in light of the possibility of future prosecutions of this kind.   Our concern arises from the close relationship between lobbying activities that are lawful from the standpoint of federal law, even if deplorable, and associated or slightly more extreme versions of such conduct that can constitute federal violations.   The problem is, in some respects, novel;  the reason for its novelty is that it appears that prosecutions on facts like these have not generally been brought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of pre-McNally theft of honest services cases and of bribery and gratuity cases under the counterpart federal statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201, indicates, as we have already noted, that most involved straightforward corruption--most often, quid pro quo bribery or blatant conflict of interest.   While the issue in those cases was typically whether or not the conduct actually occurred, in most of them the alleged conduct was blatantly illegal.   This case is distinct in that the conduct itself may not be very different, except possibly in degree, from the kind of routine cultivation of friendship in a lobbying context that, while arguably very unattractive, is not \"bribery\" within the meaning of the Travel Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The practice of using hospitality, including lavish hospitality, to cultivate business or political relationships is longstanding and pervasive.   The government does not argue, and we do not believe, that payments for entertainment, lodging, golf, sports events, and the like would constitute violations of the Travel Act (or the mail and wire fraud statutes) if the aim of the lobbyist were simply to cultivate a business or political \"friendship\" with the legislator.   It may well be that all such hospitality should be flatly prohibited by law, but if Sawyer had this limited intent--to cultivate friendship rather than to influence an official act--the federal statutes here involved would not be violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge to the jury in this case followed the conventional formula for prosecutions involving political corruption.   But where the difference between lawful and unlawful turns primarily on intent, and the lawful conduct is itself most unattractive, we think the jury needs to be told specifically that the defendant has not violated the bribery component of the Travel Act (or committed honest services fraud) if his intent was limited to the cultivation of business or political friendship.   Only if instead or in addition, there is an intent to cause the recipient to alter her official acts may the jury find a theft of honest services or the bribery predicate of the Travel Act.  Absent some explicit explanation of this kind, the conventional charge will be slanted in favor of conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we intend no criticism of the able district judge who was coping with a somewhat novel foray by the government.   But where, as here, the line between the merely unattractive and actually criminal conduct is blurred, the court must take pains to explain the difference to the jury.   The Second Circuit took this same view in a closely related context, saying:  \"When an elected official who has received campaign contributions is charged with extortion and with receiving bribes, the charge must carefully focus the jury's attention on the difference between lawful political contributions and unlawful extortionate payments and bribes.\"  United States v.

This is a close call.   On the one hand, Sawyer did not explicitly ask for the sort of language we think appropriate.   Ordinarily, the failure to make an explicit objection requires the defendant to satisfy the plain error test of United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732-34, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993).   On the other hand, a number of Sawyer's objections were closely related in that they sought in several different ways--which we do not accept--to protect one engaged in good faith lobbying from prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, we think that the Travel Act counts, as well as the mail and wire fraud convictions, ought to be reversed and retried under proper instructions.   Although the evidence here would be adequate to infer improper intent, the issue is close and an explanatory instruction could well affect the outcome.   Also, the fact that the prosecution was novel makes us look more tolerantly on Sawyer's failure to articulate precisely the shape of the necessary protective instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from the expense of retrial, the government has very little to complain about in this result.   We have agreed that the Massachusetts gratuity statute does not require the government to link the gratuity to a specific official act.   We have also found that the evidence here is sufficient to convict (although we can imagine reasonable people thinking otherwise).   And while we are somewhat concerned about the lack of fair warning of a prosecution such as this one, we see no legal basis for precluding the government from embarking on what is in practical terms an expansive reading of the federal statutes.   Against this backdrop, we think it even more important that Sawyer get the benefit of the few protections that remain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Conspiracy Count</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer was also convicted, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, of one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, and to violate the Travel Act.  The court instructed the jury that it could find Sawyer guilty of conspiracy if it found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he conspired with his supervisor, Hathaway, to commit any one of the three objects, i.e., the substantive offenses as charged.   Because all of the objects--mail and wire fraud and the Travel Act violations--were erroneously charged and instructed, the conspiracy convictions must be reversed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Retrial is not precluded if the evidence is sufficient to prove the existence of a conspiracy, Sawyer's knowledge of and voluntary participation in it, and an overt act in furtherance of it.

We disagree.   The government presented evidence that Hathaway supervised Sawyer in his lobbying activities.   From Hathaway's receipt of many of the same legal memoranda and Massachusetts Ethics Commission rulings that Sawyer received, a jury could rationally infer that Hathaway (an attorney, like Sawyer) knew and understood the ethical obligations in lobbying.   Some of these documents had both Sawyer's and Hathaway's names on them;  thus, a jury could find that Hathaway and Sawyer knew of each other's knowledge of the lobbying laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  Sawyer turned to Hathaway, his supervisor, for approval of his expense vouchers.

Given the evidence of the repeated submission and approval of the expense vouchers, a jury could rationally find that Hathaway and Sawyer agreed, at least tacitly, to the pattern of unlawful conduct.   Finally, the jury could also infer that Sawyer and Hathaway knew that the mails and wires would be used to facilitate the entertainment and/or reimbursement (e.g., the mailing of bills related to, and the making of telephone calls to arrange, the entertainment), and that interstate travel in connection with the entertainment (e.g., reimbursement of out-of-state golf) would or had to occur.   The overt acts charged in the indictment included Sawyer's giving of illegal gratuities and Hathaway's approval and authorization of reimbursement, and the evidence was sufficient to establish those acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, despite the underlying legal error, the evidence was sufficient to establish the conspiracy offense and a new trial on this count is allowable should the government so choose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer raises a number of other issues that we have reviewed, find to be without merit, and that warrant no further discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the mail fraud, wire fraud, Travel Act and conspiracy convictions, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 1986, Sawyer and his wife travelled with Representative Woodward and his wife to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.

We disagree.   While Sawyer ultimately endeavors to persuade us that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, he squarely challenges the very legal theory upon which he was convicted.   He particularly challenges the government's theory (as accepted by the district court) that, as a matter of law, the scheme to defraud could be predicated upon state law violations alone, without the intent to deprive the public of honest services.   Sawyer not only lodged an adequate objection on this issue with the trial court, see supra note 8, his brief to this court thoroughly addresses the precise legal issues surrounding the interplay between the mail statute, the state statutes, and the requirement of fraudulent intent.   The legal arguments are sharply presented and the record is adequate for our review.

Sawyer assigns error to this instruction, contending that the fact that the act would have occurred without the gratuity is indicative of good faith.   Sawyer fails to explain, however, how the fact that an official act would have occurred anyway could have affected his state of mind when giving the gratuities.

See Sawyer, 878 F.Supp. at 294 (striking phrase \"free from favoritism\" from indictment's list of legislators' duties).   True, Sawyer's very job description required him to develop contacts in the Legislature, and, as with all lobbyists, his employment goal was to persuade and influence legislators to benefit certain interests.   Such endeavors, however, are protected by the right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievance\" guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, see United States v.

And prior to McNally, courts endorsing the honest-services mail fraud theory invariably required some showing of deceit which is inherent in the term \"fraud.\"   See Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759-60;  Mandel, 591 F.2d at 1361;  United States v.

Thus, while it may be difficult to conceive of a scheme to deprive someone of the right to honest services without intending to deceive that person, the intent to deceive must nonetheless be established</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Although allegations that Sawyer caused legislators to violate their statutory disclosure obligations were withdrawn by the government at trial, the obligation to disclose material information inheres in the legislator's general fiduciary duty to the public.

The government does not argue that this evidence can amount to the requisite deceptive conduct, nor did it rely on it to prove the intent to deceive.   In any event, Sawyer's deceptive conduct toward Hancock, alone, cannot form the basis of this honest services fraud conviction.   Rather, the alleged victims of the mail fraud--here, the state and the public--must be the ones deceived.   Thus, in order for any deception of Hancock to form a part of the scheme to deprive the Commonwealth and her citizens of legislators' honest services, some showing that such conduct was connected to the defrauding of alleged victims is required.

Sawyer does not dispute that a gratuity violation of this character is \"bribery\" for purposes of the Travel Act</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> A \"particular matter\" is further defined as:</p>\n        <p>any judicial or other proceeding, application, submission, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, decision, determination, finding, but excluding enactment of general legislation ...</p>\n        <p>Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 1(k).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The court's jury instructions on this issue were as follows:</p>\n        <p>I instruct you that the government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to influence the action of the legislator on any official matter which was pending before the legislator or which may, by law, have been brought before the legislator at some later time.</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>I further instruct you that the government need not prove that the alleged gratuity was linked to a specific identifiable act.   In other words, the government need not prove that the gratuity was given as a quid pro quo;  that is, in exchange for any one specific act performed or to be performed by the legislator.   The government does not have to show that there was an agreement between the defendant and the legislator requiring the legislator to perform certain acts in exchange for the gratuity.</p>\n        <p>The government must prove, however, that the defendant gave the alleged gratuity to a legislator with the expectation that the legislator would use his influence on official matters in ways favorable to the defendant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> For example, if the parent of a student gives the school principal a gift of substantial value at the student's graduation, that alone would not constitute a gratuity offense, even though the parent would not have given the gift \"but for\" the principal's position.   If, however, the gift was given under circumstances in which the principal had the discretion to decide whether or not the student would graduate, a gratuity offense might be found</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The phrase \"performed or to be performed\" affords temporal flexibility between the gratuity and any motivating official act.   Mass. Gen. L. ch 268A &#167; 3(a);  Dutney, 348 N.E.2d at 821 n. 14.  This temporal flexibility is also present in the Lapham statute (\"may then be pending or which may by law come or be brought before him\"), ch. 205, &#167; 9 (1891), as well as the federal gratuity statute (\"may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before [an official]\") noted infra.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(a)(3).   In our view, and contrary to the district court, while the language affording temporal flexibility is consistent with the absence of an official-act specificity requirement, it does not compel that result.   See Sawyer, 878 F.Supp. at 287</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The federal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever--[ ] otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty--[ ] directly or indirectly gives, offers, or promises anything of value to any public official ... for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such public official ... shall be [punished].</p>\n        <p>The term \"official act\" is further defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(a)(3) as:</p>\n        <p>any decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official's official capacity, or in such official's place of trust or profit.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> Sawyer also raises arguments as to his good faith conduct vis a vis the gift statute, which is not relevant to the Travel Act counts.   Such contentions would be relevant to the mail and wire fraud counts, which we have reversed.   We leave the good faith issues surrounding the gift statute (which are dependent on the evidence adduced at trial) for the district court to resolve on remand, should the government choose to retry those counts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> Sawyer also argues that the court erroneously refused to instruct the jury on his defense-theory that it was his belief that if expenditures were permitted under the lobbying-disclosure obligations set forth in Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 3, then those expenditures (although they had to be disclosed) were also allowed under the gratuity statute.   Upon review of the record, we agree with the district court that this instruction was unwarranted because Sawyer did not present any evidence that, during the indictment period, he actually believed that his expenditures were permitted by the lobbying-disclosure laws</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., United States v.

We are extremely doubtful whether this would constitute bribery for these purposes and do not read the Second Circuit as ruling on this point in United States v. Biaggi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509534\"><a href=\"/opinion/509534/united-states-v-mario-biaggi-and-meade-esposito/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 100-02 (2d Cir.1988), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></span> (1989).   The fact that a gratuity violation involving an intent to influence is essentially bribery, see 853 F.2d at 101, does not mean that every possible application of a gratuity statute fits the rubric.   In all events, if the government intends to rely upon an intent to influence theory, our protective instruction would be required here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> For example, one trial exhibit was a memorandum from Sawyer to Hathaway, enclosing a 1990 State Ethics Commission Disposition Agreement with House Majority Leader Charles Flaherty.   That agreement concerned the giving of Celtics basketball game tickets to Representative Flaherty by a person with interests before him, and how that might violate the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   268A, &#167; 3. Sawyer and Hathaway discussed the Flaherty Disposition during a meeting with Bruce Skrine (vice president, counsel and secretary for Hancock) in which Sawyer and Hathaway expressed concern about compliance with state ethics law in planning for the 1993 Boston Marathon brunch</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
