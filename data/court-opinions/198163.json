Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n         Boudin, Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges. \r\n\n        Americo M. Scungio on brief for appellant.\r\n        Michael P. Duffy with whom Tobias M. Lederberg and\r\nPeabody &amp; Arnold were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nOctober 13, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  In 1994 one Brian Gillson owned a property\r\nin Middleton, Rhode Island, subject to a bank mortgage.  At this\r\ntime, Gillson--who had earlier filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy--was\r\nsubject to a reorganization plan confirmed in 1992 by the U.S.\r\nBankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island.  The order\r\nconfirming the plan provided that failure by Gillson to make\r\npayments pursuant to the mortgage, note, or other loan documents\r\nwould trigger the default provisions in the documents, and the bank\r\n\"retained its rights and remedies\" provided in those documents. \r\nThe bankruptcy court also explicitly retained jurisdiction over the\r\nproceedings.\r\nIn September 1994, ALI, Inc., acquired the bank mortgage\r\nand, when Gillson failed to make his mortgage payments, began\r\nproceedings to foreclose on the mortgage.  Gillson then brought an\r\naction in Rhode Island state court seeking a delay, and in April\r\n1995, a state court stayed the foreclosure for about a month on the\r\ncondition that Gillson execute a deed of his property in favor of\r\na subsidiary of ALI--the deed to be held in escrow and recorded\r\nonly if Gillson failed to sell the property by May 16, 1995.\r\nGillson failed to sell the property and on May 17, 1995,\r\nthe deed for the mortgaged property in favor of ALI's subsidiary\r\nwas conveyed to the subsidiary and was recorded under Rhode Island\r\nlaw.  The subsidiary now held the title to the property subject to\r\nthe original mortgage.  ALI held the mortgage, and Gillson had no\r\ninterest in the property, having transferred his interest to ALI's\r\nsubsidiary.\r\nUnder the mortgage, ALI conducted a foreclosure sale of\r\nthe property in October 1995, and Jonco, LLC, was the highest\r\nbidder.  Jonco paid ALI a non-refundable deposit of $100,000 and\r\nentered into a memorandum of sale providing for closing in 30 days,\r\nspecifically, on November 9, 1995.   The memorandum provided that\r\ntime was of the essence.  Thereafter, on October 26, 1995, the\r\nbankruptcy court entered an order converting Gillson's\r\nreorganization proceeding to one under chapter 7.\r\nOn November 9, 1995, the day the closing was scheduled to\r\ntake place, Jonco sought a postponement, asserting that Gillson's\r\nchapter 7 bankruptcy had triggered the automatic stay restricting\r\ntransfer of estate property.  11 U.S.C.  362(c).  In seeking the\r\ndelay, Jonco may have been prompted by difficulties of its own in\r\nobtaining financing, but its motive matters not.  ALI responded by\r\npointing out that Gillson had no interest in the property after May\r\n1995 and therefore any automatic stay was irrelevant.\r\nJonco nevertheless declined to complete the sale and\r\nthereafter, brought suit against ALI and its subsidiary, arguing\r\nthat ALI lacked marketable title on November 9, 1995.  Jonco asked\r\neither for a return of its deposit or for conveyance of the\r\nproperty.  ALI and its subsidiary moved for summary judgment, the\r\nmagistrate judge so recommended, and in January 1996 the district\r\ncourt adopted the magistrate judge's findings and recommendations\r\nin a two-sentence order dismissing Jonco's case.\r\nOn this appeal, Jonco's only remotely serious argument is\r\nthat ALI lacked marketable title on November 9, 1995.  Jonco says\r\nthat Gillson's transfer of his title to ALI's subsidiary in May\r\n1995, pursuant to the state court proceeding that delayed the\r\nforeclosure, was invalid because no one had obtained the prior\r\napproval of the bankruptcy court, which had kept jurisdiction over\r\nGillson's chapter 11 reorganization.  According to Jonco, Gillson\r\ntherefore retained his interest in the property despite the\r\nrecorded deed to the ALI subsidiary, and the property therefore\r\nbecame subject to the automatic stay in October 1995.\r\nThe bankruptcy court did retain jurisdiction after the\r\nchapter 11 reorganization plan was confirmed in 1992 in order to\r\nimplement the plan and resolve specified open issues.  But the plan\r\nitself explicitly permitted the mortgage holder to pursue its\r\nremedies for default if Gillson failed to make payment on the\r\nmortgage; and nothing in the plan prevented the mortgagee from\r\nutilizing state court proceedings, or required any further approval\r\nby the bankruptcy court in the event of a default.\r\nDirectly on point is In re Ernst, 45 B.R. 700 (Bankr. D.\r\nMinn. 1985), relied upon by the magistrate judge.  There, the court\r\nobserved:\r\n   Unless the matter at issue is within the\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy\r\nCourt, the mere reservation of jurisdiction in\r\nthe case by the Bankruptcy Court post-\r\nconfirmation does not foreclose the right of a\r\nparty to seek his remedy upon default under\r\nthe plan in a state court having jurisdiction\r\nover the subject matter of the dispute.\r\n\nId. at 702; see also In re Timber Tracts, Inc., 70 B.R. 773, 778\r\n(Bankr. D. Mont. 1987).  This is not a case in which the bankruptcy\r\ncourt expressly sought to reserve exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\nmatter.  Compare In re 12th &amp; N Joint Venture, 63 B.R. 36 (Bankr.\r\nD. D.C. 1986).\r\nJonco's remaining arguments are without substance. \r\nNeither in the district court nor in this court has it shown that\r\nthere was any material fact precluding summary judgment or that\r\nfurther discovery was likely to unearth pertinent evidence.  And\r\nwhile the district court was required to review the magistrate\r\njudge's decision de novo, 28 U.S.C.  636(b)(1)(C), this did not--\r\ncontrary to Jonco's contention--compel the district court to make\r\nseparate findings of fact or issue an opinion setting forth its own\r\nreasoning, see Elmendorf Grafica, Inc. v. D.S. America (East),\r\nInc., 48 F.3d 46, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nAffirmed.\n",
