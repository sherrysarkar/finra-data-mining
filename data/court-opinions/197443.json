The  order  of  contempt  shall\r\n          recite the  facts and shall  be signed by\r\n          the judge and entered of record.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nLisi in a multiple defendant, multiple count case.  Perry was\r\n\ncharged,  inter alia,  with racketeering.    See 18  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n1962(c).  Some of  the underlying criminal activities alleged\r\n\nincluded murder, 18 U.S.C.   1959(a)(1), conspiracy to commit\r\n\nthe murders  of several individuals, 18  U.S.C.   1959(a)(5),\r\n\ncarjacking,  18 U.S.C.   2119(3), and use of a firearm during\r\n\nand in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C.   924(c).\r\n\n     The trial began on January 21, 1997, and lasted 44 days.\r\n\nOn April 3, 1997, which was day 40,  the government began its\r\n\nclosing   argument.     After  roughly   two  hours   of  the\r\n\ngovernment's  summation, at  about 12:15 pm,  Perry's counsel\r\n\npassed a note to  Judge Lisi informing her that  Perry wished\r\n\nto use the restroom.  Judge Lisi interrupted the government's\r\n\nclosing  argument  and  called  both counsel  to  the  bench.\r\n\nGovernment counsel informed her that he had about five to ten\r\n\nadditional  minutes of  argument.   Judge  Lisi told  Perry's\r\n\ncounsel  to tell Perry  that proceedings  would end  in about\r\n\nfive to ten minutes.  Counsel did so.  As government  counsel\r\n\nresumed  his argument, Perry stood up, turned his back to the\r\n\njury, unzipped his pants, and urinated on the carpet.\r\n\n     Perry was immediately removed  from the courtroom by the\r\n\nmarshals.  The jury was excused.   Perry was then returned to\r\n\nthe courtroom  and informed by  Judge Lisi that  his behavior\r\n\nwas contemptuous.   Judge Lisi  also related  that, after  an\r\n\nearlier   outburst  (not  otherwise  described)  during  jury\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nselection in January, she  had warned Perry that if  he could\r\n\nnot  conduct himself in a  proper manner, he  would watch the\r\n\nremainder of the proceedings from the cellblock.\r\n\n     Perry's counsel was  allowed to address  the court.   He\r\n\nstated  that during the ten  minutes prior to  his passing of\r\n\nthe note to the  bench, Perry had twice informed him  that he\r\n\nneeded to use the restroom, the second time in a more  urgent\r\n\nmanner.   Counsel passed the  note to the  bench upon Perry's\r\n\nthird importuning.   When  counsel returned from  the sidebar\r\n\nand  informed Perry that a  recess would not  occur until the\r\n\ngovernment had concluded  its closing argument,  Perry stated\r\n\nto  counsel: \"There's nothing I can do.\"  Perry then relieved\r\n\nhimself on the carpet.\r\n\n     Counsel moved for a mistrial due to his client's conduct\r\n\nand the court's announced intention to exclude Perry from the\r\n\ncourtroom, contending that, in  the circumstances, it was now\r\n\nvirtually  impossible   for  Perry  to  get   a  fair  trial.\r\n\nGovernment counsel opposed the request.  Perry's codefendants\r\n\nmoved  for mistrials  as  well,  and,  alternatively,  sought\r\n\nseverance,  adding that the  jury may have  seen the marshals\r\n\ndraw batons and put  handcuffs on all the defendants  as they\r\n\nsought to  maintain security while others  removed Perry from\r\n\nthe courtroom.  Judge Lisi denied the motions for mistrial or\r\n\nseverance, ordered  Perry removed from the  courtroom for the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nremainder of the government's  summation, and stated that she\r\n\nwould deal with him after the noon recess.\r\n\n     When the  jurors returned, the court  instructed them to\r\n\ntake  no adverse  inference  from Perry's  conduct, from  the\r\n\nactions of  the marshals in  securing Perry, or  from Perry's\r\n\nabsence  from   the  courtroom.    Government   counsel  then\r\n\nconcluded  his  argument,   which  took  approximately   five\r\n\nminutes.   Perry  watched  this portion  of the  government's\r\n\nsummation  on a  closed  circuit television  system from  the\r\n\ncourthouse  cellblock.    He  also  had  available  a  direct\r\n\ntelephone  line to his counsel.  The court recessed for lunch\r\n\nafter government counsel had concluded.\r\n\n     That afternoon, Judge Lisi convened a session with Perry\r\n\nand all counsel in her courtroom, but without the presence of\r\n\nthe  jury.   She labelled  this as  an opportunity  to permit\r\n\nPerry and his counsel  to advise her whether Perry  wished to\r\n\nreturn  to  the courtroom  and  whether  he believed  himself\r\n\ncapable of appropriate behavior.  Perry apologized and stated\r\n\nthat he would maintain himself in  a more appropriate manner.\r\n\nJudge Lisi informed Perry that she would permit him to remain\r\n\nas  long as he conducted himself in a decorous fashion.  When\r\n\na codefendant's  counsel objected to Perry's  presence in the\r\n\ncourtroom as  prejudicial to his  client in light  of Perry's\r\n\noutrageous  conduct and  the government's  prosecuting theory\r\n\nthat all the  defendants had acted  in concert regarding  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncharged crimes, Judge Lisi responded that  Perry \"has a right\r\n\nto  be present during the  proceedings so long  as he behaves\r\n\nhimself.\"\r\n\n     Defense  counsel then  began  their  closing  arguments,\r\n\nwhich  continued through the next day (Friday, April 4).  The\r\n\ngovernment's  rebuttal and  the court's  instructions to  the\r\n\njury  occurred  on  Monday,   April  7.    These  proceedings\r\n\ntranspired with  Perry in  the courtroom and  without further\r\n\nincident.   The jury began  deliberation on the  afternoon of\r\n\nApril  7,  continued  deliberating  on  April 8  and  9,  and\r\n\nrendered verdicts on April 10.2\r                                          2\r\n\n     On  April 10,  Judge Lisi  held a  hearing at  which the\r\n\nfollowing colloquy occurred:\r\n\n          THE COURT:     Mr. Perry, would you stand\r\n          up.\r\n\n               Mr. Perry,  on April 3rd, just a few\r\n          days  ago,  you  behaved   with  contempt\r\n          toward this Court.   I need not say again\r\n          what that behavior consisted of.  At  the\r\n          time, I  told you that your  behavior was\r\n          in   contempt  of   this  Court   and  in\r\n          deliberate  and  willful  defiance of  my\r\n          order that you wait  a few moments  until\r\n          the  Government   completed  its  closing\r\n          arguments.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2Some of  the defendants were  found guilty on  all counts\r               2\r\nwith which they were charged; others received mixed verdicts.\r\nAs for Perry, he was convicted of racketeering, conspiracy to\r\ncommit racketeering, the murder of Jose Mendez, conspiracy to\r\nmurder two  other individuals, carjacking, and  two counts of\r\nusing  a firearm  during  and  in  relation  to  a  crime  of\r\nviolence.  He was acquitted on a charge related to the murder\r\nof  Temujin Vandergroen.  None of the defendants has yet been\r\nsentenced.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n               At  this time, I'm advising you that\r\n          you  are  in  criminal contempt  of  this\r\n          Court.   I think I told you that on April\r\n          3rd.  I permitted  you to return, because\r\n          you promised  to behave yourself  and you\r\n          did  behave  yourself.     However,  your\r\n          behavior   was   so  outrageous   and  so\r\n          despicable that  in order to  restore the\r\n          authority  and dignity  of this  Court, I\r\n          feel I must impose a punishment.\r\n\n               Before  I do  so, is  there anything\r\n          you want to say in your own behalf?\r\n\n          DEFENDANT PERRY:     No.\r\n\nCounsel for  Perry was  permitted to  address  the court  and\r\n\nraise  arguments in Perry's behalf.  Judge Lisi then issued a\r\n\n\"certificate of contempt and order.\"  In accordance with Rule\r\n\n42(a), the  certificate recited the facts  outlined above and\r\n\nconfirmed both  that the  judge saw the  conduct constituting\r\n\nthe contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence\r\n\nof  the  court.   She sentenced  Perry  to 90  days' isolated\r\n\nconfinement.3  On  appeal, Perry raises  two issues (both  of\r                        3\r\n\nwhich were preserved below).\r\n\n                            II-A.\r\n\n     Perry  contends  that  he  could not  be  sentenced  for\r\n\ncontempt on April 10  once he had accepted and  complied with\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   3According  to  the  government,  some of  the  crimes  of\r               3\r\nconviction carry mandatory life sentences and Perry faces the\r\n\"near certainty of life  imprisonment.\"  Judge Lisi may  well\r\nhave ordered that the contempt sanction be served in isolated\r\nconfinement so that the conviction for criminal contempt will\r\ncarry some punitive  effect.   In all events,  Perry has  not\r\nchallenged the  isolated confinement aspect  of the  criminal\r\ncontempt order.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nthe court's offer of an opportunity to purge himself on April\r\n\n3.   This  contention proceeds  from Perry's  assumption that\r\n\nJudge Lisi's permitting Perry to  return to the courtroom for\r\n\nthe remainder  of the trial proceedings  (defense closing and\r\n\njury  charge) was  a  purge of  his  contempt and  ended  the\r\n\nmatter.  Nothing in the record, however, indicates that Judge\r\n\nLisi shared  this understanding that the  banishment from the\r\n\ncourtroom for the remaining  five minutes of the government's\r\n\nsummation  was punishment at  all  --  its seems  more in the\r\n\nnature of a step needed to ensure the orderly progress of the\r\n\ntrial  -- let alone that  the exclusion sufficed  as the full\r\n\nextent of punishment for Perry's contemptuous behavior.\r\n\n     Moreover,   \"purge\"   is  a   term   more  appropriately\r\n\nassociated  with civil,  not criminal,  contempt.4   Although\r                                                             4\r\n\ncertain court orders might contain indicia of both  civil and\r\n\ncriminal contempt -- for example, when a contemnor refuses to\r\n\ntestify in an ongoing trial or grand jury proceeding, a judge\r\n\nmight craft  a determinate sentence of  incarceration with an\r\n\nincentive  of earlier  release  if the  contemnor decides  to\r\n\ncomply with the order to testify, see, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   4The term \"purge\" is not uttered by the court  in any part\r               4\r\nof  the record before us.   Counsel suggests  that Judge Lisi\r\nused the term \"purge\" at an (unrecorded) bench conference  on\r\nApril 3.  He  referred to his understanding  at the April  10\r\nproceeding but  Judge Lisi did not  respond.  We do  not deem\r\nthe matter worth pursuing; even if the court did use the word\r\n\"purge,\" it was not  reasonable for Perry to assume  that the\r\ncourt  thereby  intended  to  foreclose  a  criminal contempt\r\nsanction.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nWinter, 70 F.3d  655, 660-65 (1st  Cir. 1995), cert.  denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n116 S.  Ct. 1366  (1996) -- the  paradigmatic civil  contempt\r\n\nsanction  is coercive,  designed to  exact compliance  with a\r\n\nprior  court order.   \"[I]mprisonment  for civil  contempt is\r\n\nordered where the defendant has  refused to do an affirmative\r\n\nact required by the  provisions of an order which,  either in\r\n\nform or substance,  was mandatory in its character.\"  Gompers\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Judge  Lisi  allowed  Perry  to  return to  the\r\n\ncourtroom for  the  remaining  proceedings  because  she  was\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nsensitive to Perry's right  (conditioned on good behavior) to\r\n\nbe present at his trial proceedings.  The court's recognition\r\n\nof this right does  not inhibit the right to  punish behavior\r\n\ncommitted in open court that is so obvious an affront  to the\r\n\ndignity of the court.\r\n\n                            II-B.\r\n\n     Perry contends  that the  summary contempt  procedure of\r\n\nRule 42(a) was unavailable to  the court because the  court's\r\n\naction in  delaying the  imposition of sentence  was evidence\r\n\nthat immediate  punishment was  not essential.   If immediate\r\n\npunishment   is  not   necessary,  Perry  argues,   then  the\r\n\nprocedures outlined in  Rule 42(b) -- in  counsel's words, \"a\r\n\nfull fledged  hearing,\" with concomitant notice  and time for\r\n\nthe  preparation of  a  defense --  is  required by  the  Due\r\n\nProcess Clause and the Sixth Amendment.\r\n\n     Both the  Supreme Court  and this court  previously have\r\n\nrejected  such an argument.

Perry was charged, inter alia, with racketeering.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c).  Some of the underlying criminal activities alleged included murder, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(1), conspiracy to commit the murders of several individuals, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(5), carjacking, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began on January 21, 1997, and lasted 44 days.  On April 3, 1997, which was day 40, the government began its closing argument.  After roughly two hours of the government's summation, at about 12:15 pm, Perry's counsel passed a note to Judge Lisi informing her that Perry wished to use the restroom.  Judge Lisi interrupted the government's closing argument and called both counsel to the bench.  Government counsel informed her that he had about five to ten additional minutes of argument.  Judge Lisi told Perry's counsel to tell Perry that proceedings would end in about five to ten minutes.  Counsel did so.  As government counsel resumed his argument, Perry stood up, turned his back to the jury, unzipped his pants, and urinated on the carpet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry was immediately removed from the courtroom by the marshals.  The jury was excused.  Perry was then returned to the courtroom and informed by Judge Lisi that his behavior was contemptuous.  Judge Lisi also related that, after an earlier outburst (not otherwise described) during jury selection in January, she had warned Perry that if he could not conduct himself in a proper manner, he would watch the remainder of the proceedings from the cellblock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry's counsel was allowed to address the court.  He stated that during the ten minutes prior to his passing of the note to the bench, Perry had twice informed him that he needed to use the restroom, the second time in a more urgent manner.  Counsel passed the note to the bench upon Perry's third importuning.  When counsel returned from the sidebar and informed Perry that a recess would not occur until the government had concluded its closing argument, Perry stated to counsel:  \"There's nothing I can do.\"   Perry then relieved himself on the carpet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel moved for a mistrial due to his client's conduct and the court's announced intention to exclude Perry from the courtroom, contending that, in the circumstances, it was now virtually impossible for Perry to get a fair trial.  Government counsel opposed the request.  Perry's codefendants moved for mistrials as well, and, alternatively, sought severance, adding that the jury may have seen the marshals draw batons and put handcuffs on all the defendants as they sought to maintain security while others removed Perry from the courtroom.  Judge Lisi denied the motions for mistrial or severance, ordered Perry removed from the courtroom for the remainder of the government's summation, and stated that she would deal with him after the noon recess.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the jurors returned, the court instructed them to take no adverse inference from Perry's conduct, from the actions of the marshals in securing Perry, or from Perry's absence from the courtroom.  Government counsel then concluded his argument, which took approximately five minutes.  Perry watched this portion of the government's summation on a closed circuit television system from the courthouse cellblock.  He also had available a direct telephone line to his counsel.  The court recessed for lunch after government counsel had concluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, Judge Lisi convened a session with Perry and all counsel in her courtroom, but without the presence of the jury. She labelled this as an opportunity to permit Perry and his counsel to advise her whether Perry wished to return to the courtroom and whether he believed himself capable of appropriate behavior.  Perry apologized and stated that he would maintain himself in a more appropriate manner.  Judge Lisi informed Perry that she would permit him to remain as long as he conducted himself in a decorous fashion.  When a codefendant's counsel objected to Perry's presence in the courtroom as prejudicial to his client in light of Perry's outrageous conduct and the government's prosecuting theory that all the defendants had acted in concert regarding the charged crimes, Judge Lisi responded that Perry \"has a right to be present during the proceedings so long as he behaves himself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then began their closing arguments, which continued through the next day (Friday, April 4).  The government's rebuttal and the court's instructions to the jury occurred on Monday, April 7. These proceedings transpired with Perry in the courtroom and without further incident.  The jury began deliberation on the afternoon of April 7, continued deliberating on April 8 and 9, and rendered verdicts on April 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, Judge Lisi held a hearing at which the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>THE COURT: Mr.  Perry, would you stand up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Perry, on April 3rd, just a few days ago, you behaved with contempt toward this Court.  I need not say again what that behavior consisted of.  At the time, I told you that your behavior was in contempt of this Court and in deliberate and willful defiance of my order that you wait a few moments until the Government completed its closing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this time, I'm advising you that you are in criminal contempt of this Court.  I think I told you that on April 3rd.  I permitted you to return, because you promised to behave yourself and you did behave yourself.  However, your behavior was so outrageous and so despicable that in order to restore the authority and dignity of this Court, I feel I must impose a punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before I do so, is there anything you want to say in your own behalf?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>DEFENDANT PERRY: No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for Perry was permitted to address the court and raise arguments in Perry's behalf.  Judge Lisi then issued a \"certificate of contempt and order.\"   In accordance with Rule 42(a), the certificate recited the facts outlined above and confirmed both that the judge saw the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court.  She sentenced Perry to 90 days' isolated confinement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On appeal, Perry raises two issues (both of which were preserved below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>II-A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry contends that he could not be sentenced for contempt on April 10 once he had accepted and complied with the court's offer of an opportunity to purge himself on April 3. This contention proceeds from Perry's assumption that Judge Lisi's permitting Perry to return to the courtroom for the remainder of the trial proceedings (defense closing and jury charge) was a purge of his contempt and ended the matter.  Nothing in the record, however, indicates that Judge Lisi shared this understanding that the banishment from the courtroom for the remaining five minutes of the government's summation was punishment at all--its seems more in the nature of a step needed to ensure the orderly progress of the trial--let alone that the exclusion sufficed as the full extent of punishment for Perry's contemptuous behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, \"purge\" is a term more appropriately associated with civil, not criminal, contempt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Although certain court orders might contain indicia of both civil and criminal contempt--for example, when a contemnor refuses to testify in an ongoing trial or grand jury proceeding, a judge might craft a determinate sentence of incarceration with an incentive of earlier release if the contemnor decides to comply with the order to testify, see, e.g., United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d 655, 660-65 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1366, 134 L.Ed.2d 532 (1996)--the paradigmatic civil contempt sanction is coercive, designed to exact compliance with a prior court order.  \"[I]mprisonment for civil contempt is ordered where the defendant has refused to do an affirmative act required by the provisions of an order which, either in form or substance, was mandatory in its character.\"  Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 442, 31 S.Ct. 492, 498, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911).  The contemnor is confined indefinitely with release dependent on \"purging\" the contempt by complying with the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Punishment for criminal contempt, on the other hand, is punitive and imposed to vindicate the authority of the court.  \"Purging\" is neither permitted nor possible.  \"When a contempt involves the prior conduct of an isolated, prohibited act, the resulting sanction has no coercive effect.  '[T]he defendant is furnished no key, and he cannot shorten the term by promising not to repeat the offense.' \"  International Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 829, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 2558, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994) (quoting Gompers, supra ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a misreading of what actually transpired to suggest that Judge Lisi was permitting Perry to purge himself of contempt by giving him an opportunity to apologize and to agree that he would behave more appropriately in the courtroom.  Judge Lisi allowed Perry to return to the courtroom for the remaining proceedings because she was sensitive to Perry's right (conditioned on good behavior) to be present at his trial proceedings.  The court's recognition of this right does not inhibit the right to punish behavior committed in open court that is so obvious an affront to the dignity of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>II-B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry contends that the summary contempt procedure of Rule 42(a) was unavailable to the court because the court's action in delaying the imposition of sentence was evidence that immediate punishment was not essential.  If immediate punishment is not necessary, Perry argues, then the procedures outlined in Rule 42(b)--in counsel's words, \"a full fledged hearing,\" with concomitant notice and time for the preparation of a defense--is required by the Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Supreme Court and this court previously have rejected such an argument.  See Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 11, 72 S.Ct. 451, 456, 96 L.Ed. 717 (1952);  Gordon v. United States, 592 F.2d 1215, 1218 (1st Cir.1979);  see also United States v. Vachon, 869 F.2d 653, 660 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that, in Sacher, the Court \"said that 'summary' does not need to mean 'immediate' \").  Perry's suggestion that these cases are distinguishable is not persuasive.  Perry's contemptuous conduct occurred in the midst of the final phase of his trial.  The court did not forgo its authority to use summary process by awaiting the completion of this final phase before imposing sentence for the direct contempt that occurred in the court's presence.III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry urinated on the carpet in open court and in plain view of Judge Lisi.  The court afforded Perry the right of allocution.  He declined.  In then concluding that Perry's conduct was \"in deliberate and willful defiance,\" the judge necessarily rejected any suggestion that he had no control over nature's call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We review a Rule 42(a) order of criminal contempt for abuse of discretion, and we review the court's underlying factual findings for clear error.  See Winter, 70 F.3d at 659.   We see neither here.  As Chief Justice Burger wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Where a court acts immediately to punish for contemptuous conduct committed under its eye, the contemnor is present, of course.  There is then no question of identity, nor is hearing in a formal sense necessary because the judge has personally seen the offense and is acting on the basis of his own observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Groppi v.

Instead, we issued an expedited briefing schedule and we now affirm the judgment of contempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry, a/k/a \"King Animal,\" was recently on trial in the United States District Court in Rhode Island before Judge Lisi in a multiple defendant, multiple count case.  Perry was charged, inter alia, with racketeering.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c).  Some of the underlying criminal activities alleged included murder, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(1), conspiracy to commit the murders of several individuals, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1959(a)(5), carjacking, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began on January 21, 1997, and lasted 44 days.  On April 3, 1997, which was day 40, the government began its closing argument.  After roughly two hours of the government's summation, at about 12:15 pm, Perry's counsel passed a note to Judge Lisi informing her that Perry wished to use the restroom.  Judge Lisi interrupted the government's closing argument and called both counsel to the bench.  Government counsel informed her that he had about five to ten additional minutes of argument.  Judge Lisi told Perry's counsel to tell Perry that proceedings would end in about five to ten minutes.  Counsel did so.  As government counsel resumed his argument, Perry stood up, turned his back to the jury, unzipped his pants, and urinated on the carpet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry was immediately removed from the courtroom by the marshals.  The jury was excused.  Perry was then returned to the courtroom and informed by Judge Lisi that his behavior was contemptuous.  Judge Lisi also related that, after an earlier outburst (not otherwise described) during jury selection in January, she had warned Perry that if he could not conduct himself in a proper manner, he would watch the remainder of the proceedings from the cellblock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry's counsel was allowed to address the court.  He stated that during the ten minutes prior to his passing of the note to the bench, Perry had twice informed him that he needed to use the restroom, the second time in a more urgent manner.  Counsel passed the note to the bench upon Perry's third importuning.  When counsel returned from the sidebar and informed Perry that a recess would not occur until the government had concluded its closing argument, Perry stated to counsel:  \"There's nothing I can do.\"   Perry then relieved himself on the carpet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel moved for a mistrial due to his client's conduct and the court's announced intention to exclude Perry from the courtroom, contending that, in the circumstances, it was now virtually impossible for Perry to get a fair trial.  Government counsel opposed the request.  Perry's codefendants moved for mistrials as well, and, alternatively, sought severance, adding that the jury may have seen the marshals draw batons and put handcuffs on all the defendants as they sought to maintain security while others removed Perry from the courtroom.  Judge Lisi denied the motions for mistrial or severance, ordered Perry removed from the courtroom for the remainder of the government's summation, and stated that she would deal with him after the noon recess.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the jurors returned, the court instructed them to take no adverse inference from Perry's conduct, from the actions of the marshals in securing Perry, or from Perry's absence from the courtroom.  Government counsel then concluded his argument, which took approximately five minutes.  Perry watched this portion of the government's summation on a closed circuit television system from the courthouse cellblock.  He also had available a direct telephone line to his counsel.  The court recessed for lunch after government counsel had concluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, Judge Lisi convened a session with Perry and all counsel in her courtroom, but without the presence of the jury. She labelled this as an opportunity to permit Perry and his counsel to advise her whether Perry wished to return to the courtroom and whether he believed himself capable of appropriate behavior.  Perry apologized and stated that he would maintain himself in a more appropriate manner.  Judge Lisi informed Perry that she would permit him to remain as long as he conducted himself in a decorous fashion.  When a codefendant's counsel objected to Perry's presence in the courtroom as prejudicial to his client in light of Perry's outrageous conduct and the government's prosecuting theory that all the defendants had acted in concert regarding the charged crimes, Judge Lisi responded that Perry \"has a right to be present during the proceedings so long as he behaves himself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then began their closing arguments, which continued through the next day (Friday, April 4).  The government's rebuttal and the court's instructions to the jury occurred on Monday, April 7. These proceedings transpired with Perry in the courtroom and without further incident.  The jury began deliberation on the afternoon of April 7, continued deliberating on April 8 and 9, and rendered verdicts on April 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, Judge Lisi held a hearing at which the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>THE COURT: Mr.  Perry, would you stand up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Perry, on April 3rd, just a few days ago, you behaved with contempt toward this Court.  I need not say again what that behavior consisted of.  At the time, I told you that your behavior was in contempt of this Court and in deliberate and willful defiance of my order that you wait a few moments until the Government completed its closing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this time, I'm advising you that you are in criminal contempt of this Court.  I think I told you that on April 3rd.  I permitted you to return, because you promised to behave yourself and you did behave yourself.  However, your behavior was so outrageous and so despicable that in order to restore the authority and dignity of this Court, I feel I must impose a punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before I do so, is there anything you want to say in your own behalf?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>DEFENDANT PERRY: No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for Perry was permitted to address the court and raise arguments in Perry's behalf.  Judge Lisi then issued a \"certificate of contempt and order.\"   In accordance with Rule 42(a), the certificate recited the facts outlined above and confirmed both that the judge saw the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court.  She sentenced Perry to 90 days' isolated confinement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On appeal, Perry raises two issues (both of which were preserved below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>II-A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry contends that he could not be sentenced for contempt on April 10 once he had accepted and complied with the court's offer of an opportunity to purge himself on April 3. This contention proceeds from Perry's assumption that Judge Lisi's permitting Perry to return to the courtroom for the remainder of the trial proceedings (defense closing and jury charge) was a purge of his contempt and ended the matter.  Nothing in the record, however, indicates that Judge Lisi shared this understanding that the banishment from the courtroom for the remaining five minutes of the government's summation was punishment at all--its seems more in the nature of a step needed to ensure the orderly progress of the trial--let alone that the exclusion sufficed as the full extent of punishment for Perry's contemptuous behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, \"purge\" is a term more appropriately associated with civil, not criminal, contempt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Although certain court orders might contain indicia of both civil and criminal contempt--for example, when a contemnor refuses to testify in an ongoing trial or grand jury proceeding, a judge might craft a determinate sentence of incarceration with an incentive of earlier release if the contemnor decides to comply with the order to testify, see, e.g., United States v. Winter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196418\"><a href=\"/opinion/196418/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 660-65 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Judge Lisi allowed Perry to return to the courtroom for the remaining proceedings because she was sensitive to Perry's right (conditioned on good behavior) to be present at his trial proceedings.  The court's recognition of this right does not inhibit the right to punish behavior committed in open court that is so obvious an affront to the dignity of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>II-B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry contends that the summary contempt procedure of Rule 42(a) was unavailable to the court because the court's action in delaying the imposition of sentence was evidence that immediate punishment was not essential.  If immediate punishment is not necessary, Perry argues, then the procedures outlined in Rule 42(b)--in counsel's words, \"a full fledged hearing,\" with concomitant notice and time for the preparation of a defense--is required by the Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Supreme Court and this court previously have rejected such an argument.  See Sacher v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104987\"><a href=\"/opinion/104987/sacher-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104987\"><a href=\"/opinion/104987/sacher-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Perry's suggestion that these cases are distinguishable is not persuasive.  Perry's contemptuous conduct occurred in the midst of the final phase of his trial.  The court did not forgo its authority to use summary process by awaiting the completion of this final phase before imposing sentence for the direct contempt that occurred in the court's presence.III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perry urinated on the carpet in open court and in plain view of Judge Lisi.  The court afforded Perry the right of allocution.  He declined.  In then concluding that Perry's conduct was \"in deliberate and willful defiance,\" the judge necessarily rejected any suggestion that he had no control over nature's call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We review a Rule 42(a) order of criminal contempt for abuse of discretion, and we review the court's underlying factual findings for clear error.  See Winter, 70 F.3d at 659.   We see neither here.
