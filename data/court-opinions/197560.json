Guiliano Antoine was charged\r\n\nwith conspiracy to engage in the business of dealing in firearms\r\n\nwithout a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. S 371, and with the\r\n\nsubstantive offense of engaging in the business of dealing in\r\n\nfirearms without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 922(a)(1)(A). At trial, the court admitted evidence of flight\r\n\nand instructed the jury regarding that evidence. Antoine was\r\n\nconvicted. This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                               I.\r\n\n          The government's principal witness at trial was Roy\r\n\nBoone. Boone testified that he cooperated with Bureau of Alcohol,\r\n\nTobacco, and Firearms (ATF) agents as required by his plea\r\n\nagreement on firearms charges against him. The government believed\r\n\nAntoine had been illegally purchasing guns from Boone. Boone\r\n\nagreed to offer to sell more guns to Antoine and to allow the\r\n\ngovernment to record his conversations with Antoine and set up the\r\n\narrangements for the \"buy.\" \r\n\n          Boone contacted Antoine and offered to sell him nine\r\n\nmillimeter handguns. Boone told Antoine to meet him at a motel\r\n\nnear Boston to see the guns. A video camera hidden in the room\r\n\nrecorded the events. Antoine and two companions arrived and\r\n\nexamined the guns (provided by the ATF). Boone and Antoine\r\n\nnegotiated a price for the guns. Antoine stated that he was low on\r\n\ncash, but gave Boone a $250 deposit for several of the guns and\r\n\npromised to pay the rest and collect the guns later that night. \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          As soon as Antoine and his companions left the motel\r\n\nroom, ATF agents and Boston Police officers moved in to arrest\r\n\nthem. An ATF agent testified without objection that Antoine ran\r\n\nacross the parking lot \"attempting to flee.\" The agent gave chase,\r\n\nand Antoine was apprehended.\r\n\n          Antoine was indicted and charged with conspiracy to deal\r\n\nin and dealing in firearms without a license. On the fifth day of\r\n\nhis trial, just prior to the closing arguments, the court held a\r\n\nbrief charge conference (having held a more lengthy conference the\r\n\nday before). The court indicated       sua  \r                                                      sponte that it was\r\n\nconsidering giving a consciousness of guilt instruction based on\r\n\nthe testimony that Antoine had fled from police immediately prior\r\n\nto his arrest. After much discussion with counsel, the court gave\r\n\nthe following instruction:\r\n\n            In determining whether the government met\r\n            its burden of proving the defendant acted\r\n            wilfully--remember we discussed this\r\n            before--how do you decide someone's state\r\n            of mind? You may consider the direct\r\n            evidence before you, as well as the\r\n            circumstantial evidence as to his state of\r\n            mind.\r\n\n            The one thing that you can also consider\r\n            is you've heard testimony that Mr. Antoine\r\n            at one point fled right after the purchase\r\n            of--well, right after whatever happened in\r\n            that motel room.\r\n\n            The government claims that the flight or\r\n            the--\r\n\n              (Pause.)\r\n\n            Well, let me just say, if you do find that\r\n            the defendant did flee, if you find that\r\n            he fled, you're permitted to consider\r\n            whether such actions indicate feelings of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n            guilt by Mr. Antoine and whether in terms\r\n            of feeling guilt might tend to show actual\r\n            guilt on these charges.\r\n\n            You are not required to draw such\r\n            inferences and you should not do so unless\r\n            they appear to be reasonable in light of\r\n            all the circumstances of the case. \r\n\n            If you decide that such inferences are\r\n            reasonable, it will be up to you to decide\r\n            how much importance to give them. But you\r\n            should always remember that there may be\r\n            many reasons why an innocent person might\r\n            flee. Such conduct does not necessarily\r\n            reflect feelings of guilt. Please bear in\r\n            mind that a person who's innocent might\r\n            flee and a person having feelings of guilt\r\n            is not necessarily guilty in fact.\r\n            Because such feelings are sometimes found\r\n            in innocent people. \r\n\n            If you find that the defendant did flee,\r\n            the government has proven beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt, in order to divert\r\n            suspicion or for any other reason that you\r\n            find reflect feelings of guilt, you may,\r\n            but are not required to, infer that Mr.\r\n            Antoine believed that he was guilty. You\r\n            may not, however, infer on this basis\r\n            alone that the defendant is, in fact,\r\n            guilty of the crime for which he is\r\n            charged. Whether or not the evidence as\r\n            to the defendant's statements--excuse me,\r\n            to the defendant's fleeing shows that Mr.\r\n            Antoine believed that he was guilty and\r\n            the significance, if any, to be attached\r\n            to any such evidence of flight are matters\r\n            for you, the jury, to decide.\r\n\n            But first you have to decide beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt whether or not the\r\n            government has proven that he fled and\r\n            then you have to decide what inference, if\r\n            any, to draw from that.\r\n\n          At the conclusion of the charge, defense counsel objected\r\n\nto the consciousness of guilt instruction, noting that while the\r\n\ncourt had cautioned the jury that an innocent person might flee, it\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nhad not also stated that a person \"might flee from something he\r\n\nperceived as a crime, which conduct doesn't bear on\" the charged\r\n\noffense. After consultation, the court gave the following\r\n\nsupplemental instruction:\r\n\n            [O]n the tail-end of the charge, I talked\r\n            to you briefly about what weight, if any,\r\n            you were going to give to flight. And I\r\n            just want to point out to you, that not\r\n            only do sometimes innocent people flee,\r\n            but sometimes people can be guilty of a\r\n            crime or think that they are guilty of a\r\n            crime and flee. But that crime may have\r\n            absolutely nothing to do with the crime\r\n            charged here.\r\n\n            So that you have to decide whether or not\r\n            the government has proven flight and\r\n            whether or not there's any inference to be\r\n            drawn from that, given the crime charged\r\n            here. Not some other crime or some other\r\n            perception, but the crime charged here.\r\n\n          Following the supplemental instruction, the court\r\n\ninquired whether either party had any further concerns about the\r\n\ncharge. Both counsel said that they had none.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Antoine raises only one issue on appeal--whether the\r\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by giving a consciousness of\r\n\nguilt jury instruction that was based on his attempt to flee from\r\n\nthe arresting officers. We hold that it did not.\r\n\n          Evidence of flight may be admitted at trial as indicative\r\n\nof a guilty mind, so long as there is an adequate factual predicate\r\n\ncreating an inference of guilt of the crime charged. \r                                                              United States\r\n\nv. Camilo \r                    Montoya, 917 F.2d 680, 683 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting\r\n\nUnited \r                 States v.  Hernandez-Bermudez, 857 F.2d 50, 52 (1st Cir.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n1988)). There was an adequate factual predicate for the charge\r\n\ngiven in this case.\r\n\n          The evidence at trial established that Antoine and Boone\r\n\nhad an agreement whereby Boone would purchase handguns in Georgia,\r\n\ntransport them to Boston, and sell them to Antoine. Pursuant to\r\n\nthis agreement, Boone purchased guns in Georgia which he\r\n\nsubsequently sold to Antoine in Boston. After being confronted by\r\n\nATF agents and agreeing to cooperate with their investigation,\r\n\nBoone had one electronically monitored meeting and several\r\n\ntelephone conversations with Antoine in which they discussed\r\n\nAntoine's purchase of additional handguns from Boone. Antoine went\r\n\nto Boone's motel room for the express purpose of viewing the\r\n\nhandguns. In the room, Antoine and two companions viewed the guns,\r\n\nselected certain of them for purchase, and Antoine made a partial\r\n\npayment to Boone for the weapons. Antoine told Boone he would pay\r\n\nfor and take custody of the remaining guns later that same night\r\n\nafter he acquired more money. After exiting the room, Antoine and\r\n\nthe other two men attempted to flee on foot from the agents. The\r\n\nflight evidence was admitted without objection. \r\n\n          These facts establish a completely adequate factual\r\n\npredicate for the crimes charged against Antoine. Under these\r\n\nfacts, the jury could reasonably infer that Antoine was guilty of\r\n\nillegal dealing in arms. The jury could also reasonably infer that\r\n\nAntoine ran from authorities because he believed his conspiratorial\r\n\ngun dealing activities with Boone had been discovered, i.e., that\r\n\nhe was conscious of his guilt. Based on the presence of numerous\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nagents and police officers outside the motel room, a reasonable\r\n\njury could have inferred that Antoine fled because he recognized\r\n\nthat he had been \"set up\" by Boone and that the authorities were\r\n\nwell aware of their prior course of illegal conduct.   See, e.g.,\r\n\nUnited \r                 States v. Romero-Carrion, 54 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n\n(attempt to flee evidences a keen consciousness of guilt); United\r\n\nStates v. \r                   Luciano-Mosquero, 63 F.3d 1142, 1156 (1st Cir. 1995) (as\r\n\nlong as there is an adequate factual predicate supporting an\r\n\ninference of guilt on the crime charged, evidence of flight may be\r\n\nadmitted to show consciousness of guilt).\r\n\n          Antoine argues that his flight merely reflected knowledge\r\n\nthat he had just left a motel room full of guns, not that he\r\n\nintended to buy any. If so, the fact of flight would not support\r\n\nany inference of guilt as to the offenses charged.\r\n\n          The court, however, very carefully and fully instructed\r\n\nthe jury that Antoine's flight may have been for innocent reasons.\r\n\nThe court reminded the jury that they need not draw any conclusions\r\n\nfrom the flight evidence and to weigh the importance of such\r\n\ninferences should they find them reasonable. This instruction did\r\n\nnot invite the jury to convict based upon an inference of guilt as\r\n\nto another crime, and was not an abuse of discretion.  See United\r\n\n Antoine also argues that the court's instruction allowed the jury\r\nto infer from flight that he knew of the federal license\r\nrequirement for dealing in firearms--a necessary component of the\r\nwillfulness element of the gun-dealing charge. This argument is\r\nwithout merit. The other evidence was sufficient to permit the\r\njury to infer that Antoine knew his course of conduct was illegal.\r\nThe jury was instructed that they might infer from flight that\r\nAntoine was conscious of his guilt.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nStates v.  Hernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 314-15 (1st Cir. 1993)\r\n\n(significance of evidence of flight is for the jury) (citing\r\n\nHernandez-Bermudez, 857 F.2d at 52); United \r                                                      States v. Noone, 913\r\n\nF.2d 20, 29-31 (1st Cir. 1991) (no error if flight instruction sets\r\n\nout appropriate legal framework for jury consideration of\r\n\ncontention that accused fled for entirely innocent reasons); \r                                                                     United\r\n\nStates v. Camilo \r                           Montoya, 917 F.2d 680, 683 (1st Cir. 1990) (no\r\n\nerror if flight instruction has a solid evidentiary basis and the\r\n\ninstruction a correct statement of the law).     See \r                                                               also  United\r\n\nStates v. Martinez, 83 F.3d 371, 373 (11th Cir. 1996) (where the\r\n\nact for which defendant claims to have fled and the offense charged\r\n\nare sufficiently related, evidence of flight and a consciousness of\r\n\nguilt instruction are not abuse of discretion). \r\n\n                              III.\r\n\n          Antoine did not object to the admission of evidence of\r\n\nhis flight from the scene of the crime charged to him. The jury\r\n\nheard this evidence, and they were permitted to consider it. The\r\n\ncourt undertook to instruct them as to its proper use. The court\r\n\ncautioned the jury against overly broad inferences, and against any\r\n\ninference at all if they felt it unreasonable to do so. The\r\n\ninstruction was not an abuse of discretion. The conviction is\r\n\naffirmed.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\n",

Antoine stated that he was low on\r\n\ncash, but gave Boone a $250 deposit for several of the guns and\r\n\npromised to pay the rest and collect the guns later that night. \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          As soon as Antoine and his companions left the motel\r\n\nroom, ATF agents and Boston Police officers moved in to arrest\r\n\nthem. An ATF agent testified without objection that Antoine ran\r\n\nacross the parking lot \"attempting to flee.\" The agent gave chase,\r\n\nand Antoine was apprehended.\r\n\n          Antoine was indicted and charged with conspiracy to deal\r\n\nin and dealing in firearms without a license. On the fifth day of\r\n\nhis trial, just prior to the closing arguments, the court held a\r\n\nbrief charge conference (having held a more lengthy conference the\r\n\nday before). The court indicated       sua  \r                                                      sponte that it was\r\n\nconsidering giving a consciousness of guilt instruction based on\r\n\nthe testimony that Antoine had fled from police immediately prior\r\n\nto his arrest. After much discussion with counsel, the court gave\r\n\nthe following instruction:\r\n\n            In determining whether the government met\r\n            its burden of proving the defendant acted\r\n            wilfully--remember we discussed this\r\n            before--how do you decide someone's state\r\n            of mind? You may consider the direct\r\n            evidence before you, as well as the\r\n            circumstantial evidence as to his state of\r\n            mind.\r\n\n            The one thing that you can also consider\r\n            is you've heard testimony that Mr. Antoine\r\n            at one point fled right after the purchase\r\n            of--well, right after whatever happened in\r\n            that motel room.\r\n\n            The government claims that the flight or\r\n            the--\r\n\n              (Pause.)\r\n\n            Well, let me just say, if you do find that\r\n            the defendant did flee, if you find that\r\n            he fled, you're permitted to consider\r\n            whether such actions indicate feelings of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n            guilt by Mr. Antoine and whether in terms\r\n            of feeling guilt might tend to show actual\r\n            guilt on these charges.\r\n\n            You are not required to draw such\r\n            inferences and you should not do so unless\r\n            they appear to be reasonable in light of\r\n            all the circumstances of the case. \r\n\n            If you decide that such inferences are\r\n            reasonable, it will be up to you to decide\r\n            how much importance to give them. But you\r\n            should always remember that there may be\r\n            many reasons why an innocent person might\r\n            flee. Such conduct does not necessarily\r\n            reflect feelings of guilt. Please bear in\r\n            mind that a person who's innocent might\r\n            flee and a person having feelings of guilt\r\n            is not necessarily guilty in fact.\r\n            Because such feelings are sometimes found\r\n            in innocent people. \r\n\n            If you find that the defendant did flee,\r\n            the government has proven beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt, in order to divert\r\n            suspicion or for any other reason that you\r\n            find reflect feelings of guilt, you may,\r\n            but are not required to, infer that Mr.\r\n            Antoine believed that he was guilty. You\r\n            may not, however, infer on this basis\r\n            alone that the defendant is, in fact,\r\n            guilty of the crime for which he is\r\n            charged. Whether or not the evidence as\r\n            to the defendant's statements--excuse me,\r\n            to the defendant's fleeing shows that Mr.\r\n            Antoine believed that he was guilty and\r\n            the significance, if any, to be attached\r\n            to any such evidence of flight are matters\r\n            for you, the jury, to decide.\r\n\n            But first you have to decide beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt whether or not the\r\n            government has proven that he fled and\r\n            then you have to decide what inference, if\r\n            any, to draw from that.\r\n\n          At the conclusion of the charge, defense counsel objected\r\n\nto the consciousness of guilt instruction, noting that while the\r\n\ncourt had cautioned the jury that an innocent person might flee, it\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nhad not also stated that a person \"might flee from something he\r\n\nperceived as a crime, which conduct doesn't bear on\" the charged\r\n\noffense. After consultation, the court gave the following\r\n\nsupplemental instruction:\r\n\n            [O]n the tail-end of the charge, I talked\r\n            to you briefly about what weight, if any,\r\n            you were going to give to flight. And I\r\n            just want to point out to you, that not\r\n            only do sometimes innocent people flee,\r\n            but sometimes people can be guilty of a\r\n            crime or think that they are guilty of a\r\n            crime and flee. But that crime may have\r\n            absolutely nothing to do with the crime\r\n            charged here.\r\n\n            So that you have to decide whether or not\r\n            the government has proven flight and\r\n            whether or not there's any inference to be\r\n            drawn from that, given the crime charged\r\n            here. Not some other crime or some other\r\n            perception, but the crime charged here.\r\n\n          Following the supplemental instruction, the court\r\n\ninquired whether either party had any further concerns about the\r\n\ncharge. Both counsel said that they had none.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Antoine raises only one issue on appeal--whether the\r\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by giving a consciousness of\r\n\nguilt jury instruction that was based on his attempt to flee from\r\n\nthe arresting officers. We hold that it did not.\r\n\n          Evidence of flight may be admitted at trial as indicative\r\n\nof a guilty mind, so long as there is an adequate factual predicate\r\n\ncreating an inference of guilt of the crime charged. \r                                                              United States\r\n\nv.

There was an adequate factual predicate for the charge\r\n\ngiven in this case.\r\n\n          The evidence at trial established that Antoine and Boone\r\n\nhad an agreement whereby Boone would purchase handguns in Georgia,\r\n\ntransport them to Boston, and sell them to Antoine. Pursuant to\r\n\nthis agreement, Boone purchased guns in Georgia which he\r\n\nsubsequently sold to Antoine in Boston. After being confronted by\r\n\nATF agents and agreeing to cooperate with their investigation,\r\n\nBoone had one electronically monitored meeting and several\r\n\ntelephone conversations with Antoine in which they discussed\r\n\nAntoine's purchase of additional handguns from Boone. Antoine went\r\n\nto Boone's motel room for the express purpose of viewing the\r\n\nhandguns. In the room, Antoine and two companions viewed the guns,\r\n\nselected certain of them for purchase, and Antoine made a partial\r\n\npayment to Boone for the weapons. Antoine told Boone he would pay\r\n\nfor and take custody of the remaining guns later that same night\r\n\nafter he acquired more money. After exiting the room, Antoine and\r\n\nthe other two men attempted to flee on foot from the agents. The\r\n\nflight evidence was admitted without objection. \r\n\n          These facts establish a completely adequate factual\r\n\npredicate for the crimes charged against Antoine. Under these\r\n\nfacts, the jury could reasonably infer that Antoine was guilty of\r\n\nillegal dealing in arms. The jury could also reasonably infer that\r\n\nAntoine ran from authorities because he believed his conspiratorial\r\n\ngun dealing activities with Boone had been discovered, i.e., that\r\n\nhe was conscious of his guilt. Based on the presence of numerous\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nagents and police officers outside the motel room, a reasonable\r\n\njury could have inferred that Antoine fled because he recognized\r\n\nthat he had been \"set up\" by Boone and that the authorities were\r\n\nwell aware of their prior course of illegal conduct.

If so, the fact of flight would not support\r\n\nany inference of guilt as to the offenses charged.\r\n\n          The court, however, very carefully and fully instructed\r\n\nthe jury that Antoine's flight may have been for innocent reasons.\r\n\nThe court reminded the jury that they need not draw any conclusions\r\n\nfrom the flight evidence and to weigh the importance of such\r\n\ninferences should they find them reasonable. This instruction did\r\n\nnot invite the jury to convict based upon an inference of guilt as\r\n\nto another crime, and was not an abuse of discretion.  See United\r\n\n Antoine also argues that the court's instruction allowed the jury\r\nto infer from flight that he knew of the federal license\r\nrequirement for dealing in firearms--a necessary component of the\r\nwillfulness element of the gun-dealing charge. This argument is\r\nwithout merit. The other evidence was sufficient to permit the\r\njury to infer that Antoine knew his course of conduct was illegal.\r\nThe jury was instructed that they might infer from flight that\r\nAntoine was conscious of his guilt.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nStates v.
