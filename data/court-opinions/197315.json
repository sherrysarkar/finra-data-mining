Appellants Barbara F.  and Stanley R.\r                                \r\n\nGreen filed a complaint  in the Massachusetts district court.\r\n\nThe complaint challenges the treatment Mrs. Green received at\r\n\nthe hands of her  employer, the Town of Brookline,  and cites\r\n\ntwo  bases of  jurisdiction: (1)  42 U.S.C.    1983;  and (2)\r\n\nTitle  VII, 42 U.S.C.     2000e-3 and 2000e-5.   The district\r\n\ncourt dismissed the  complaint due to  the expiration of  the\r\n\nstatute of limitations.  We affirm.\r\n\n          1.     We  agree  with  the   district  court  that\r\n\nappellants'     1983  claims  are time-barred.    \"Local  law\r\n\ndetermines the limitations  period for section  1983 claims.\"\r\n\nMorris v. Government Dev.  Bank of Puerto Rico, 27  F.3d 746,\r                                                          \r\n\n748  (1st Cir.  1994).    We  thus  look  to  the  three-year\r\n\nMassachusetts  statute  of  limitations  for  personal injury\r\n\nactions.  Street  v. Vose, 936  F.2d 38, 39  (1st Cir.  1991)\r                                     \r\n\n(per curiam) (citing  M.G.L.c. 260,   2A).  When the cause of\r\n\naction accrued, however, is  a federal question.  Id.  at 40.\r                                                                 \r\n\nIn a case such as this, \"the statute of limitations begins to\r\n\nrun when the  plaintiff learns of  the decision to  terminate\r\n\n[her] employment.  . . .\"   Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,\r                                                                        \r\n\n959 F.2d 349, 353 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n          Mrs.  Green learned  that the  Town had  decided to\r\n\nterminate her on December 10, 1986.  This lawsuit, filed over\r\n\nnine  years after  this  date, plainly  is  late.   The  same\r\n\nconclusion results even  if we consider the Town's threats to\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nuse certain  notes in  evidence in the  workers' compensation\r\n\ncase.  According  to the complaint, these threats  were first\r\n\nmade in 1990.   Because this is about six  years prior to the\r\n\ninitiation of the instant action, the complaint also is time-\r\n\nbarred in relation to these later charges.\r\n\n          Finally, appellants  present no reason to  toll the\r\n\nrunning of the  limitations period.   Even assuming that  the\r\n\nattorney for the Town coerced Mrs. Green  into dismissing her\r\n\ncourt  case  appealing  the  decision of  the  Civil  Service\r\n\nCommission,  this  occurred in  1988.   There  simply  are no\r\n\nfactual allegations  that the  Town or anyone  acting on  its\r\n\nbehalf  did anything  to prevent  appellants from  filing the\r\n\npresent lawsuit.   See Pahlavi v.  Palandjian, 809 F.2d  938,\r                                                         \r\n\n942-43 (1st  Cir. 1987) (in  the absence of  specific factual\r\n\nallegations, a  plaintiff cannot claim that  duress tolls the\r\n\nstatute of limitations).\r\n\n          2.   Title VII has two deadlines which are in issue\r\n\nin this  case.   First,  an  individual in  a  state such  as\r\n\nMassachusetts -- a \"deferral\" state with its own civil rights\r\n\nlaw  and agency  --  must file  a  complaint with  the  Equal\r\n\nEmployment  Opportunity  Commission  (EEOC) within  300  days\r\n\nafter  the \"alleged  unlawful employment  practice occurred.\"\r\n\n42  U.S.C.   2000e-5(e).  See  also Lawton v. State Mut. Life\r                                                                         \r\n\nAssurance  Co., 101 F.3d 218,  221 (1st Cir.  1996).  Second,\r                          \r\n\nthe  individual must  file an  action in  the  district court\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nwithin 90  days of receiving  a right to sue  letter from the\r\n\nEEOC.  42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(f).\r\n\n          \"In  actions  brought  under  Title VII  .  .  .  a\r\n\nplaintiff  must  plead   affirmatively  performance  of   the\r\n\nconditions  precedent to  filing a  lawsuit.\"   2A J.

P. 9(c).\r\n\n          However,  our  review  of the  record  reveals that\r\n\nplaintiffs  never  met  their   burden  of  alleging  general\r                             \r\n\ncompliance with  Title VII's  filing requirements.   That is,\r\n\nthey  never stated in their complaint,  in their responses to\r\n\nthe  Town's motion  to dismiss,  or even  in their  briefs on\r\n\nappeal, that they filed an EEOC charge concerning retaliation\r\n\nwithin  300 days  of Mrs.  Green's termination and  that they\r\n\nfiled the federal  complaint within  90 days  of receiving  a\r\n\nright  to sue letter.   Further, the record  does not contain\r\n\nany documents from which such inferences can be drawn.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
