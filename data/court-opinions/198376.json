This habeas case presents both\r\nprocedural and substantive quandaries.  Procedurally, we must\r\ndetermine the effect of a district court's grant of a certificate\r\nof appealability on some, but not all, of the issues that a habeas\r\npetitioner seeks to pursue.  Substantively, we must determine\r\nwhether the petitioner has shown legal cause for us to set aside\r\nhis state court convictions.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nIn November 1989, police discovered the stabbed bodies of\r\na mother and daughter, Ngoc Le and Dixie Poulin.  Evidence at the\r\ncrime scene (the victims' apartment) suggested that Dixie also had\r\nbeen bludgeoned with a blunt instrument, probably a gun, and that\r\nthe perpetrator(s) likely had absconded with jewelry and cash. \r\nSeveral months later, Thinh Trinh, an acquaintance of the victims,\r\ninformed the authorities that the petitioner, Tam Bui, had boasted\r\nof wielding a gun at the apartment around the time of the murders. \r\nThinh's wife, Linh Nguyen, substantiated the story, recalling that\r\nthe petitioner told her that he had participated in the crime.  As\r\nadditional corroboration, Thinh and Linh produced two pieces of\r\njewelry that they claimed the petitioner had given to Linh.  The\r\njewelry appeared to have belonged to Ngoc Le.\r\nIn due course, the police obtained warrants for the\r\npetitioner and two other suspects.  They first sought to find Bui\r\nat his parents' flat.  He was not there, but police seized a .38\r\ncaliber handgun that Bui's father stated belonged to his son. \r\nShortly thereafter, the authorities apprehended the petitioner and\r\ncharged him (and the other suspects).\r\nAt trial in a Massachusetts state court, the\r\nCommonwealth's most incriminating evidence consisted of (i) certain\r\nstatements that the petitioner had made to police after his arrest,\r\n(ii) the testimony of Thinh and Linh, and (iii) the handgun (which\r\nthe Commonwealth hypothesized had been used to bludgeon Dixie\r\nPoulin).  The jury convicted the petitioner on two counts of first-\r\ndegree murder and one count of armed robbery.  The  court sentenced\r\nhim to serve two consecutive terms of life imprisonment.\r\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed\r\nthe convictions.  See Commonwealth v. Bui, 419 Mass. 392, 645\r\nN.E.2d 689 (1995) (Bui I).  The petitioner then sought habeas\r\ncorpus relief in the federal district court, see 28 U.S.C.  2254,\r\nnaming as respondents two state officials.  His petition enumerated\r\nseveral purported constitutional faults.  The district court found\r\nthe claims of error unpersuasive and declined to disturb the state\r\ncourt judgment.  See Bui v. DiPaolo, 985 F. Supp. 219 (D. Mass.\r\n1997) (Bui II).\r\nBecause Bui filed his application for habeas corpus\r\nrelief in December 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\r\nPenalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217-18\r\n(Apr. 24, 1996) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.),\r\ngoverns this case.  See Lindh v. Murphy, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 2068\r\n(1997) (holding that, in general, AEDPA's provisions apply to cases\r\nfiled after its effective date).  Under the AEDPA amendments, a\r\nhabeas petitioner can prosecute an appeal only if he first obtains\r\na certificate of appealability (COA).  See 28 U.S.C.  2253(c).  In\r\nthis instance the district court, after denying the application for\r\na writ of habeas corpus, certified one issue for appeal   the\r\npetitioner's Sixth Amendment claim that the trial court\r\nimpermissibly thwarted his lawyer's attempts to cross-examine Thinh\r\nbut declined to certify the petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim.\r\nUndaunted, the petitioner sought to proceed in this venue\r\non both claims.  Because we had not had occasion to resolve the\r\nquestion of whether COAs are to be treated as case-specific or\r\nissue-specific, we permitted the petitioner to brief his Fifth\r\nAmendment claim on the merits, but required that he simultaneously\r\nbrief the antecedent procedural question.  Consequently, we begin\r\nby erecting a procedural framework for the handling of COAs in\r\nmulti-issue cases.  We then discuss the petitioner's two\r\nsubstantive contentions.\r\nII.  CERTIFICATES OF APPEALABILITY\r\nBui and the amici argue that we are obligated to mull the\r\nmerits of his Fifth Amendment claim because, in their view, COAs\r\nissued under the AEDPA-spawned habeas amendments should be treated\r\nas case-specific rather than issue-specific.  In other words, they\r\ncontend that the grant of a COA on any one issue opens all issues\r\nin the case to full appellate review.  Although this result would\r\nhave been consistent with practice as it existed before the AEDPA\r\namendments, see Magouirk v. Phillips, 144 F.3d 348, 356 (5th Cir.\r\n1998); Tejeda v. Dubois, 142 F.3d 18, 22 n.4 (1st Cir. 1998), we\r\nthink it is now outmoded.  Congress, in enacting the AEDPA, meant\r\nto change prior practice and succeeded in doing so:  the language\r\nand structure of the amended habeas statute pretermit appellate\r\nconsideration of claims not properly certified for appeal.\r\nThe AEDPA predicates the very issuance of a COA   without\r\nwhich \"an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals,\" 28\r\nU.S.C.  2253(c)(1)   on whether an \"applicant has made a\r\nsubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"  Id.at  2253(c)(2).  A habeas petitioner who fails to demonstrate that\r\nhis claims satisfy the substantial showing standard may not appeal\r\nthe denial of habeas corpus at all.\r\nThis rule is easily applied in situations in which a\r\nhabeas court's decisions on the merits and on the availability of\r\na COA are congruent.  Thus, if a habeas application raises only\r\nissues that, in the district court's opinion, warrant neither\r\nrelief nor a COA, no appeal lies.  Conversely, if the application\r\nraises only issues that, according to the district court, uniformly\r\npass muster under the substantial showing standard and, thus, are\r\ncertifiable (even though in the district court's view they do not\r\njustify relief), then a free-ranging appeal lies.\r\nIn these examples, the COA itself is but a variable that\r\ndepends wholly on the existence of a substantial showing that the\r\npetitioner's constitutional rights have been abridged.  The\r\nquestion at hand is whether this relationship is altered in a\r\nsituation that lacks essential congruence, that is, when the\r\ndistrict court, having denied a habeas application, deems some, but\r\nfewer than all, of the petitioner's claims certifiable.\r\nWe believe that the necessity for a substantial showing\r\nextends independently to each and every issue raised by a habeas\r\npetitioner.  Had the mere existence of a COA been sufficient to\r\nqualify all the issues in a habeas case for appellate review, it\r\nwould have been pointless for Congress to go on to state, in\r\nsection 2253(c)(3), that a COA \"shall indicate which specific issue\r\nor issues satisfy\" the substantial showing standard of section\r\n2253(c)(2).  This language was absent from section 2253's previous\r\nincarnation, and the fact that Congress added it in the AEDPA\r\nsignals an intent that the courts should accord some significance\r\nto it.  The petitioner's reading of the statute would render this\r\nphrase superfluous, for as long as one issue were certifiable, all\r\nothers would be amenable to review.  We customarily read statutes\r\nin a manner that gives effect to all words and phrases, see Waltersv. Metropolitan Educ. Enters., Inc., 117 S. Ct. 660, 664 (1997);\r\nUnited States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir.\r\n1985), and we see no valid reason to deviate from this salutary\r\npractice here.\r\nCommon sense also suggests that such an interpretation\r\nshould be preferred.  Were we to adopt the petitioner's\r\nconstruction of the statute, we would establish a paradigm under\r\nwhich tenuous habeas claims could not be appealed if asserted on\r\ntheir own, but could command appellate attention if accompanied by\r\na solitary claim that met the substantial showing standard.  This\r\ndichotomy lacks rhyme or reason, and there is no indication that\r\nCongress intended to create so curious a structure.  The better\r\nreading of the habeas amendments is one that links section\r\n2253(c)(3)'s insistence on an issue by issue enumeration of what\r\nhas been certified for appeal with the substantial showing\r\nrequirement of section 2253(c)(2).  We hold, therefore, that a\r\ncourt of appeals should not consider the merits of an issue\r\nadvanced by a habeas petitioner unless a COA first has been\r\nobtained with respect to that issue.  Accord Ramsey v. Bowersox,\r\n149 F.3d 749, 759 (8th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 1999 WL 16676\r\n(U.S. Feb. 22, 1999) (No. 98-7613); Murray v. United States, 145\r\nF.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998); Sylvester v. Hanks, 140 F.3d\r\n713, 715 (7th Cir. 1998); Lackey v. Johnson, 116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th\r\nCir. 1997); In re Certificates of Appealability, 106 F.3d 1306,\r\n1308 (6th Cir. 1997).\r\nWere the power to issue a COA exclusively a prerogative\r\nof the district courts, this holding might answer the procedural\r\nquestion that confronts us.  Under the AEDPA amendments, however,\r\na habeas petitioner who fails in his effort to obtain a COA in the\r\ndistrict court may then beseech the court of appeals to issue one. \r\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 22(b)(1) (\"If the district judge has denied the\r\ncertificate, the applicant for the writ may then request issuance\r\nof the certificate by a circuit judge.\").  The procedure for  cases\r\nin which the district court does not grant a COA at all is\r\nuncontroversial:  even if there is no express request for a COA,\r\nthe court of appeals must deem a notice of appeal to represent a\r\nrequest for a COA on all issues raised.  See Fed. R. App. P.\r\n22(b)(1)-(2).  The rules are silent, however, with respect to the\r\nappropriate procedure in hybrid cases.  Thus, we must decide what\r\ncourse a habeas petitioner should follow when the district court\r\ncertifies some, but not all, of the issues that he wishes to vent\r\non appeal.\r\nIf the district court issues a limited COA (i.e., a COA\r\nthat permits the petitioner to go forward on fewer than all of the\r\nissues raised in his petition), the petitioner must present\r\npromptly to the court of appeals an express request for a\r\ncomplementary COA.  Although this court's local rules do not\r\ndefinitively resolve the timing issue, it is our present practice\r\nto notify each habeas petitioner of an outside date by which his\r\nrequest for a COA must be filed in the court of appeals.  Failure\r\nto file within that interval may be deemed to constitute a waiver.\r\nThe request for a complementary COA must be explicit as\r\nto the issues which the petitioner wishes us to consider and, in\r\nsuch circumstances, we will not treat an inexplicit notice of\r\nappeal, without more, as an invitation to review the district\r\ncourt's denial of certification with regard to the petitioner's\r\nremaining claims.  In taking this stance, we adopt the rule stated\r\nin United States v. Kimler, 150 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir. 1998)\r\n(declaring that a notice of appeal in a multi-issue habeas case\r\nwill not be treated as a constructive request for expanding a\r\nlimited COA issued by the district court), and reject the rule\r\nstated in Kincade v. Sparkman, 117 F.3d 949, 953 (6th Cir. 1997)\r\n(treating a notice of appeal in a hybrid case as \"an informal\r\nrequest with this Court to review the district Court's denial as to\r\n[the petitioner's] remaining claims\").  We make one related point: \r\nthe request for a complementary COA, whether contained in a\r\nseparate document or incorporated into the notice of appeal, should\r\nbe accompanied by a copy of the district court's order and a\r\nmemorandum giving specific and substantial reasons (not mere\r\ngeneralizations) why a certificate should be granted.\r\nIn the interests of fairness and judicial economy, we\r\nalso rule that, when the district court grants a limited COA and\r\nthe petitioner seasonably seeks to expand it, his appeal on the\r\ncertified issue(s) should be held in abeyance, and full briefing\r\ndeferred, until this court determines the appealability of the\r\nissues that the district court deemed unworthy of appellate\r\nscrutiny (and, thus, whether we will issue a complementary COA). \r\nAccord  Kimler, 150 F.3d at 431 n.1; Kincade, 117 F.3d at 953;\r\nUnited States v. Simmonds, 111 F.3d 737, 740-41 (10th Cir. 1997). \r\nAs an administrative measure, we advise litigants that, to the\r\nextent practicable, the panel that determines whether to issue a\r\ncomplementary COA also will be the panel that adjudicates the\r\nappeal on the merits.\r\nWe are aware that a few cases are pending in which, as\r\nhere, a motions judge has adopted an ad hoc framework for handling\r\nsituations in which a district court, over a habeas petitioner's\r\nobjection, issued a limited COA.  Such actions were entirely\r\nappropriate in the absence of a definitive resolution of the\r\nattendant procedural questions.  We will, of course, allow those\r\nappeals to proceed in the ordinary course, under the terms of the\r\nprovisional orders previously entered.  In future cases, however,\r\nwe will require habeas petitioners to walk the procedural path that\r\nwe set in place today.  We regard the instant case as\r\ngrandfathered.\r\nIII.  THE FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\r\nWhen the district court issued a COA restricted to the\r\nSixth Amendment  issue, the petitioner's able counsel timely filed\r\na notice of appeal and contemporaneously submitted an application\r\nto the district court to enlarge the COA to encompass the Fifth\r\nAmendment claim.  When no amended certificate emerged, counsel\r\nsought a complementary COA in this court.  We entered an order,\r\npreviously described, directing the petitioner, inter alia, to\r\nbrief his Fifth Amendment claim on the merits.  Reading the new\r\nhabeas amendments literally, we next should consider whether the\r\npetitioner has made a \"substantial showing of the denial of a\r\nconstitutional right\" in respect to this Fifth Amendment point.  28\r\nU.S.C.  2253(c)(2).  Here, however, under the terms of our interim\r\norder, the parties have fully briefed and argued the merits of that\r\nclaim.  Since we decline to take two steps where one will do, we\r\nskip the preliminary \"substantial showing\" inquiry and turn\r\ndirectly to the merits.  We caution, however, that this expedient\r\ndeparts from the norm, and we employ it here solely because of the\r\nterms of the interim order.\r\nThe petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim has its genesis in\r\na 30-minute conversation between him and the police conducted\r\nshortly after his arrest.  The facts surrounding the interview,\r\nderived primarily from a police report, are not in dispute.  When\r\nthe authorities arrested the petitioner on August 18, 1990, they\r\ngave him Miranda warnings in his native language (Vietnamese).  The\r\npetitioner acknowledged that he understood his rights.\r\nBefore interviewing the petitioner, the police again\r\nadvised him of his rights, this time in both English and\r\nVietnamese.  In response, the petitioner proclaimed that he knew\r\nhis rights, that \"my Constitution will protect me,\" and that \"you\r\nhave nothing.\"  When an officer asked if he had anything to say\r\nabout why he was being arrested, the petitioner replied in the\r\nnegative.  Then   before the officer posed another question   he\r\ninquired:  \"Who said I did this?\"  The petitioner thereafter\r\nanswered some questions, while brushing others aside.  The\r\ninterview ended when he declined to respond to a query asking what\r\nhe had \"to say about what happened around [the time of the\r\nmurders].\"\r\nAfter the state trial court had refused to suppress the\r\ninterview, a  number of the petitioner's statements were admitted\r\ninto evidence.  For example, the Commonwealth introduced the\r\npetitioner's comment about the gun that had been found in his\r\nparents' abode and his remark to the police that \"you have\r\nnothing.\"  On direct appeal, the SJC upheld the admissibility of\r\nthese statements.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 396-97, 645 N.E.2d at\r\n692-93.  In considering the petitioner's ensuing habeas\r\napplication, the district court found no unequivocal assertion of\r\nthe right to remain silent and dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim\r\non the authority of Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452 (1994). \r\nSee Bui II, 985 F. Supp. at 226-28.\r\nSeizing on the fact that Davis involved only the right to\r\ncounsel   in Davis, 512 U.S. at 458-59, the Court held that if an\r\naccused wishes to assert a right to counsel, he must so state\r\nunambiguously   the petitioner posits that Davis is inapplicable\r\nwhere, as here, a defendant anchors a Fifth Amendment claim upon\r\nthe right to remain silent.  This means, he says, that we must\r\ngrant habeas relief because Davis does not comprise \"clearly\r\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States,\" within the purview of 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1).\r\nThe petitioner's attempt to characterize Davis as\r\nsomething other than \"clearly established Federal law\" rests on a\r\nmistaken premise:  the idea that, merely because Davis does not\r\ndirectly compel the particular outcome reached by the state court,\r\na federal habeas court perforce must issue the writ.  This is a non\r\nsequitur.  Under the AEDPA amendments, federal courts review state\r\ncourt judgments to determine whether those judgments construe or\r\napply federal law in a manner that is \"contrary to\" or an\r\n\"unreasonable application of\" the Supreme Court's \"clearly\r\nestablished\" jurisprudence.  See O'Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 24\r\n(1st Cir. 1998) (citing statutory language).  The question, then,\r\nis whether the Massachusetts courts' rulings in this case\r\ncontravene the Court's precedents or represent an unreasonable\r\napplication of them.\r\nIf Davis is the relevant precedent, we do not see how we\r\ncan disturb the judgment.  To be sure, Davis concerned  only the\r\nright to counsel recognized in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 486\r\n(1966).  Nonetheless, every circuit that has addressed the issue\r\nsquarely has concluded that Davis applies to both components of\r\nMiranda: the right to counsel and the right to remain silent.  SeeUnited States v. Mills, 122 F.3d 346, 350-51 (7th Cir.) (citing\r\nUnited States v. Banks, 78 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (7th Cir. 1996)),\r\ncert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 637 (1997); Medina v. Singletary, 59 F.3d\r\n1095, 1100-01 (11th Cir. 1995); United States v. Johnson, 56 F.3d\r\n947, 955 (8th Cir. 1995).  For the purposes of habeas corpus\r\nreview, we simply cannot deem unreasonable a conclusion by the\r\nMassachusetts courts that is consistent with the approach taken by\r\nso many respected tribunals.\r\nIn an effort to avoid the force of this reasoning, the\r\npetitioner maintains that Davis is inapposite to Miranda's right to\r\nremain silent.  Although the similarity of the analyses requisite\r\nfor assessing claims anent Miranda's right to counsel and its right\r\nto remain silent suggests that Davis constitutes strong evidence of\r\nhow the Supreme Court likely would decide this right to remain\r\nsilent question, we acknowledge that Davis does not\r\n\"authoritatively\" answer the question in the narrow, technical\r\nsense of that term.  We therefore assume for argument's sake that\r\nDavis is not the relevant precedent.  Even on this assumption, the\r\npetitioner's challenge to the state court judgment fares poorly.\r\nAs the petitioner sees it, his claim implicates a line of\r\nauthority which states that, as long as a criminal defendant\r\narticulates his Fifth Amendment rights in even an equivocal manner,\r\npolice interrogation must cease immediately.  See Michigan v.\r\nMosley, 423 U.S. 96, 103-04 (1975); Quinn v. United States, 349\r\nU.S. 155, 162-64 (1955); United States v. Barone, 968 F.2d 1378,\r\n1384 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Jerold H. Israel,\r\n1 Criminal Procedure  6.9(e), 531-33 (1984 &amp; Supp. 1991)\r\n(discussing implied assertion of Miranda rights).  Under this legal\r\nrubric, the petitioner argues, his statement to the effect that \"my\r\nConstitution will protect me\" and his negative response to the\r\nofficer's query anent whether \"he had anything to say about what he\r\nwas being arrested for\" were, at the very least, equivocal\r\nassertions of the right to remain silent, and, therefore, precluded\r\nthe police from doing more than following up with clarifying\r\nquestions.  See United States v. March, 999 F.2d 456, 461 (10th\r\nCir. 1993) (collecting cases).  Since the police went further, the\r\npetitioner reasons, the trial court should have suppressed all the\r\nstatements.\r\nSetting to one side the question of whether the doctrinal\r\nunderpinnings of the petitioner's argument retain much integrity\r\nafter Davis, we believe that the facts of this case are controlled\r\nby a different line of authority.  In North Carolina v. Butler, 441\r\nU.S. 369, 373 (1979), the Court made it pellucid that an express\r\nstatement is not invariably necessary to support a finding that the\r\ndefendant waived either the right to remain silent or the right to\r\ncounsel.  We, too, have employed this implied waiver doctrine, see \r\nUnited States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1169 (1st Cir. 1993), and\r\nit appears to be the primary ground on which the SJC resolved the\r\npetitioner's Fifth Amendment claim, see Bui I, 419 Mass. at 397,\r\n645 N.E.2d at 692-93. \r\nPrecisely when waiver may be implied depends on the\r\ncircumstances.  Even so, there are certain types of cases in which\r\ncourts routinely conclude that a defendant who has professed an\r\nunderstanding of his right to remain silent has waived that right. \r\nFor example, a defendant will be held to have effected a waiver\r\nwhen, after receiving warnings and asserting (equivocally or\r\nunequivocally) a right to remain silent, he spontaneously\r\nrecommences the dialogue with his interviewers.  See Edwards v.\r\nArizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484-85 (1981); United States v. Conley, 156\r\nF.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir. 1998).  So, too, if a defendant's\r\nincriminating statements were made either as part of a \"steady\r\nstream\" of speech, Bradley v. Meachum, 918 F.2d 338, 342 (2d Cir.\r\n1990), or as part of a back-and-forth conversation with the police,\r\nBaskin v. Clark, 956 F.2d 142, 146 (7th Cir. 1992), courts\r\nregularly have found waivers.  A waiver of Miranda rights also may\r\nbe implied when, after having received Miranda warnings, a criminal\r\ndefendant responds selectively to questions posed to him.  SeeUnited States v. Soliz, 129 F.3d 499, 503 (9th Cir. 1998); United\r\nStates v. Eaton, 890 F.2d 511, 513-14 (1st Cir. 1989) (Breyer, J.);\r\nUnited States v. Chong, 829 F.2d 1572, 1574 (11th Cir. 1987).\r\nThe petitioner's interview displays characteristics that\r\nfit the implied waiver profile.  In his initial statements, uttered\r\nimmediately after the second round of Miranda warnings, the\r\npetitioner proclaimed that he knew his rights and that the\r\nConstitution would protect him.  The petitioner's claim to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding, these comments cannot plausibly be\r\nconstrued to suggest that the speaker intended to assert Mirandarights.  In all events, the spontaneous utterance \"you have\r\nnothing,\" made immediately after those comments and without any\r\nsemblance of police provocation, is not protected by the Fifth\r\nAmendment.  See Conley, 156 F.3d at 83; Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146. \r\nUp to this point, the dialogue has the distinct flavor of a back-\r\nand-forth conversation between the petitioner and his interviewer. \r\nSee, e.g., Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146.\r\nAn examination of the remainder of the interview lends\r\ncredence to this impression.  Once the petitioner boasted that the\r\npolice had nothing, the interviewer legitimately followed up by\r\nasking him whether he had something to say about the reasons for\r\nhis arrest.  The petitioner answered \"no\"   and this is a point at\r\nwhich he now avers the police should have stopped their\r\nquestioning.  He might have had a stronger argument had he not\r\nadded anything to his response, see Conley, 156 F.3d at 83, but he\r\nthen immediately asked the police:  \"who said I did this?\"  The\r\npetitioner's continuation of the conversation by means of this\r\nquestion both negated any effect his prior response may have had as\r\nan assertion of his right to remain silent and confirmed that the\r\ninterview was indeed a back-and-forth exchange.  See Baskin, 956\r\nF.2d at 146.\r\nTo say more on this point would be supererogatory.  The\r\nshort of it is that the petitioner did not unequivocally assert his\r\nright to remain silent, and, moreover, selectively responded to\r\nquestions during what otherwise appears to have been a fairly\r\nstandard two-way conversation with the authorities.  The\r\nprosecution thereupon introduced those responses at trial.  If the\r\nrelevant precedent here is Davis, the petitioner cannot prevail\r\nbecause he made no clear articulation of a desire to stand mute. \r\nIf, however, Davis does not apply, the relevant precedent is\r\nButler, and federal courts have on numerous occasions employed its\r\nimplied waiver principle to uphold the admissibility of evidence\r\nunder circumstances similar to those presented in this case.  See,\r\ne.g., Ramirez, 79 F.3d at 305; Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146; Bradley,\r\n918 F.2d at 342; see generally LaFave &amp; Israel, supra  6.9(d), at\r\n530-31 (discussing implied waivers).  Either way, the SJC's\r\napplication of federal law (and, for that matter, the state trial\r\ncourt's determination of subsidiary facts) does not fall outside\r\nthe sphere of acceptability.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.\r\nIV.  THE SIXTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\r\nWe pause to set the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim\r\ninto perspective.  Thinh was one of two persons who testified that\r\nthe petitioner admitted involvement in the murders, and one of\r\nthree who described him brandishing a knife and suggesting that he\r\nhad used it to commit a crime.  In addition, Thinh recounted\r\nimportant information concerning the petitioner's possession of\r\ncertain items of jewelry ostensibly belonging to Ngoc Le.  See Bui\r\nI, 419 Mass. at 398-99, 645 N.E.2d at 693 (summarizing Thinh's\r\ntestimony).\r\nThe petitioner had hoped to impeach Thinh's credibility\r\nby developing, inter alia, a rather intricate theory of bias.  In\r\nthe petitioner's scenario, Thinh and Linh were coerced into\r\ntestifying falsely by Linh's father, Mong Nguyen, a drug kingpin,\r\nwho took this action because the petitioner had refused, in the\r\npresence of Mong's peers (equally notorious drug lords), to\r\ntransport drugs.  According to the petitioner, extreme retributive\r\ntendencies characterize interpersonal relations in Vietnamese\r\nsociety, and Thinh's rejection so affronted Mong that he exacted\r\nrevenge by directing his daughter and quondam son-in-law to frame\r\nBui.\r\nAt trial, the petitioner's counsel first attempted to\r\ngather support for this hypothesis by questioning Linh on voir\r\ndire, outside the jury's presence.  He drew a blank.  He revisited\r\nthe subject with Thinh, but the trial judge sustained the\r\nprosecution's objections to his initial round of questions. \r\nCounsel thereupon made an offer of proof.  The judge remained\r\nsteadfast and refused, on relevancy grounds, to allow the attorney\r\nto ask the proposed questions.  After the jury convicted the\r\npetitioner, the SJC affirmed this evidentiary ruling, finding the\r\npetitioner's theory of bias too speculative to justify cross-\r\nexamination.  See id. at 401, 645 N.E.2d at 694-95.\r\nThe Confrontation Clause places a high value on the right\r\nto cross-examination.  See Delaware v. van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673,\r\n678-79 (1986).  That right is witness-specific.  See id. at 680. \r\nFurthermore, a criminal defendant's entitlement to cross-examine a\r\nwitness increases in sensitivity in direct proportion to the\r\nwitness's importance to the prosecution's case.  See United Statesv. Mizell, 88 F.3d 288, 292-93 (5th Cir. 1996); United States v.\r\nTaylor, 17 F.3d 333, 340 (11th Cir. 1994); see also United Statesv. Tracey, 675 F.2d 433, 437-38 (1st Cir. 1982) (collecting cases). \r\nGiven Thinh's status as a key figure in the prosecution's case, it\r\nis readily apparent that the petitioner's claim demands close\r\nattention.\r\nThe petitioner exhorts us to hold that the Massachusetts\r\ncourts violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause by\r\nprohibiting all inquiry into a cogent bias theory.  Citing cases\r\nsuch as United States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d 430, 433 (1st Cir. 1988),\r\nhe maintains that the trial court's actions violated the general\r\nrule requiring courts to permit a threshold level of cross-\r\nexamination on bias and, thus, the SJC's holding was \"contrary to\"\r\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent.  We reject this\r\nplaint.\r\nSpeaking in the large, the jurisprudence of the\r\nConfrontation Clause rarely lends itself to Procrustean\r\napplication, see O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 26, and the case law simply\r\ndoes not state the \"threshold level of inquiry\" rule in terms as\r\nabsolute as the petitioner would have it.  Indeed, the van ArsdallCourt explicitly recognized that, under certain circumstances,\r\ntrial judges possess broad discretion to limit cross-examination. \r\nSee van Arsdall, 475  U.S. at 679 (enumerating various factors that\r\nmay justify circumscription of cross-examination).  Thus, to the\r\nextent that the petitioner is suggesting that a criminal defendant\r\nhas license to cross-question a prosecution witness concerning\r\nevery conceivable theory of bias, regardless of the prevailing\r\ncircumstances, he is plainly wrong.  The threshold requirement\r\nimposed by the Confrontation Clause is satisfied as long as the\r\ndefendant is given a fair chance to inquire into a witness's bias. \r\nSee United States v. Sinclair, 109 F.3d 1527, 1537 (10th Cir.\r\n1997); United States v. Guthrie, 931 F.2d 564, 568-69 (9th Cir.\r\n1991); United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254-55 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).  A criminal defendant is not regarded as being deprived of\r\nthat chance if a trial court legitimately determines that his\r\ncross-examination is inappropriate.  See van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at\r\n679.\r\nWith these principles in mind, we cannot say that the\r\nMassachusetts courts acted contrary to established Supreme Court\r\ncase law in regard to this matter.  The petitioner cross-examined\r\nThinh at length with respect to bias, and the trial court based its\r\nrestriction of further cross-examination on relevancy grounds  \r\nsomething van Arsdall, in principle, expressly permits.  Thus, we\r\nmust test the propriety of the Massachusetts courts' conclusions by\r\nasking whether forbidding further cross-questioning  represented an\r\nunreasonable application of the Supreme Court's Confrontation\r\nClause precedents.  See 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1).  In itself, this\r\nis not a surprising development:  when a constitutional claim\r\nrequires balancing rather than applying a strict, one-dimensional\r\nlegal rule, that ordinarily is an indication that a habeas court,\r\nin the end, will have to gauge the reasonableness of the state\r\ncourt's application of the rule.  See, e.g., Holman v. Gilmore, 126\r\nF.3d 876, 881-82 (7th Cir. 1997) (stating that \"when the\r\nconstitutional question is a matter of degree, rather than of\r\nconcrete entitlements, a 'reasonable' decision by the state court\r\nmust be honored\"), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1169 (1998).\r\nBefore turning to specifics, we  reiterate the narrow\r\ncircumference of appellate review in connection with the\r\n\"reasonable application\" standard.  Under this formulation, a\r\nfederal court may not \"grant the writ merely because it disagrees\r\nwith the state court's decision, or because, left to its own\r\ndevices, it would have reached a different result.\"  O'Brien, 145\r\nF.3d at 25; accord Corwin v. Johnson, 150 F.3d 467, 471-72 (5th\r\nCir.), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 613 (1998); Neelley v. Nagle, 138\r\nF.3d 917, 924 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 811\r\n(1999); Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F.3d 330, 334-35 (7th Cir.), cert.denied, 118 S. Ct. 72 (1997).  The question, rather, is whether the\r\nstate court has applied federal law in a manner that is \"so\r\noffensive to existing precedent\" or so lacking in foundation that\r\nits conclusion is \"outside the universe of plausible, credible\r\noutcomes.\"  O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.  As suggested by our\r\ndiscussion of the Fifth Amendment claim, what this standard implies\r\nis that we cannot deem a state court's application of federal law\r\nunreasonable when federal courts   typically, the circuit courts of\r\nappeals   regularly resolve cases in a similar fashion.  SeeWilliams v. Taylor, 163 F.3d 860, 869 (4th Cir. 1998); Davis v.\r\nJohnson, 158 F.3d 806, 813-14 (5th Cir. 1998), petition for cert.\r\nfiled (U.S. Feb. 23, 1999) (No. 98-8209);  O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25;\r\ncf. Lambrix v. Singletary, 117 S. Ct. 1517, 1530 (1997) (engaging\r\nin a similar analysis in a pre-AEDPA habeas proceeding).\r\nAnother dimension of the problem deserves mention.  In\r\norder for a federal court to conclude that a state court has\r\napplied federal law reasonably, it is not necessary that the\r\nfederal court agree with every last detail of the state court's\r\nanalysis.  By like token, state courts are not required to supply\r\nthe specific reasons that a federal court thinks are most\r\npersuasive for upholding the judgment.  Rather, it suffices that\r\nthe state court generally articulates and applies tenets that can\r\nreasonably sustain its judgment.  Thus, the question on habeas\r\ncorpus review is whether the state courts' invocation and reliance\r\non enunciated legal principles are reasonably consistent with the\r\nfacts, circumstances, and outcome of the case.  See, e.g., Hennon,\r\n109 F.3d at 335 (\"It doesn't follow that the criterion of a\r\nreasonable determination is whether it is well reasoned.  It is\r\nnot.  It is whether the determination is at least minimally\r\nconsistent with the facts and circumstances of the case.\").  Were\r\nwe to insist on perfect jurisprudential harmony, not only would we\r\nrisk defying Congress's will by transforming the AEDPA standard\r\ninto one of plenary review, but we also would place ourselves in a\r\nposition in which we might invalidate convictions not because a\r\n\"defendant may have been the victim [] of [a] constitutional error\r\nbut merely of a failure of judicial articulateness.\"  Id.  The\r\nlogic of the AEDPA is flatly inconsistent with such an approach.\r\nMindful of these background principles, we turn to the\r\nSJC's determination that the petitioner was not entitled to inquire\r\nalong the line that he proposed.  As we already have observed,\r\ncross-examination is subject to reasonable restrictions.  One well-\r\nestablished basis for circumscribing cross-examination is a party's\r\ninability to lay a proper evidentiary foundation for the questions\r\nthat he wishes to pose.  See, e.g., United States v. Ovalle-\r\nMarquez, 36 F.3d 212, 218-19 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v.\r\nCarty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1010 (1st Cir. 1993).  The SJC relied upon\r\nthis principle to conclude that the petitioner's Confrontation\r\nClause claim lacked merit.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 401, 645 N.E.2d\r\nat 694-95 (holding that the petitioner's offer of proof was too\r\ntenuous to justify the desired inquiry).\r\nThis brings us to the offer of proof.  It prophesied that\r\nThinh, if allowed to answer the proposed questions, would\r\nacknowledge that the petitioner rebuffed Mong's entreaty to ferry\r\nnarcotics from California to Boston.  Defense counsel purposed to\r\nargue from this response that the repudiation so angered Mong that\r\nhe directed Thinh to frame the petitioner.  But to that point in\r\nthe trial, there had been no evidence even remotely supporting the\r\npetitioner's offer of proof.  When the court inquired into the\r\npredicate for the offer, counsel did not cite any evidence, but\r\nreplied instead that he had a good-faith basis founded on attorney-\r\nclient privilege.  On this exiguous record, the mere invocation of\r\nthe petitioner as the source was not enough to negate the inherent\r\nspeculativeness of the offer, especially since the petitioner\r\nneither testified at trial nor submitted an affidavit as part of\r\nthe proffer.\r\nEven were we to assume, as did the state trial court,\r\nthat petitioner had made a good-faith proffer, we still could not\r\nconclude that the SJC's determination that the offer of proof was\r\nunsatisfactory so offended existing Supreme Court precedent as to\r\nbe unreasonable.  Apart from its foundational infirmities, the\r\npetitioner's offer of proof was inherently defective because it did\r\nnot include crucial elements of his bias theory.  He sought to ask\r\nThinh three questions:  (1) Was Mong present in California while\r\nThinh and the petitioner were there?  (2) Did Mong ever ask the\r\npetitioner to transport drugs to Boston?  (3) If so, did the\r\npetitioner refuse?  However, we agree with the SJC that the\r\npetitioner's theory of bias had more components than could be\r\naddressed by responsive answers to these three questions.  See Bui\r\nI, 419 Mass. at 401-02, 645 N.E.2d at 695.  It ultimately depended\r\non demonstrating facts relating to matters such as the relationship\r\nbetween Mong and the petitioner, the relationship between Mong and\r\nThinh, the presence (and identity) of others in the course of the\r\nalleged repudiation, and the tenor of Mong's reaction.  Neither the\r\nproposed questions nor the petitioner's offer of proof touched upon\r\nthese issues.  On this sparse record, both the trial court's\r\nlimitation on cross-examination and the SJC's affirmance on the\r\nground that the offer of proof was too tenuous were in conformity\r\nwith federal court precedents requiring a satisfactory evidentiary\r\nfoundation for cross-questioning, see, e.g., Ovalle-Marquez, 36\r\nF.3d at 218-19; Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010, and thus neither decision\r\nimplicated the AEDPA standard.\r\nUnited States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d 430, much relied upon by\r\nthe petitioner, does not demand a different result.  If anything,\r\nthe facts of Lynn highlight one of the main shortcomings of the\r\npetitioner's offer of proof.  Lynn exemplifies those cases in which\r\ncourts have disapproved restrictions on questioning about bias when\r\ncross-examination seeks to probe whether a prosecution witness will\r\nget preferential treatment from law enforcement in return for\r\ntestifying.  In these instances, courts have been especially open\r\nto permitting cross-examination about agreements between government\r\nand witness.  In the same vein, courts have recognized, albeit less\r\nfrequently, that similarly distorting influences may arise from\r\nother innately coercive relationships.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nAbel, 469 U.S. 45, 52 (1984) (discussing witness's membership in a\r\ngang or secret group as productive of coercion).\r\nWhatever the source of the alleged coercion, however,\r\ncourts traditionally have required a solid showing that coercion is\r\npresent.  See Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.  Where there is no evidence\r\nof a coercive dimension in the relationship between a witness and\r\nan organization, trial courts cast well within their discretion in\r\nprohibiting cross-examiners from mounting fishing expeditions.  SeeSinclair, 109 F.3d at 1537; United States v. Elkins, 70 F.3d 81,\r\n83-84 (10th Cir. 1995); United States v. Warren, 18 F.3d 602, 603\r\n(8th Cir. 1994);  United States v. Piche, 981 F.2d 706, 715-16 (4th\r\nCir. 1992).  Here, the singularly  essential element of the\r\npetitioner's theory   a relationship of coercion between a person\r\npurportedly interested in the outcome of the trial (Mong) and the\r\nwitness (Thinh)   utterly lacked an evidentiary foundation. \r\nIndeed, the petitioner made no attempt to address this element in\r\nhis offer of proof or contemporaneously in some other fashion. \r\nUnder these circumstances, we do not believe the petitioner can\r\nrely on Lynn to undo the SJC's conclusions.\r\nIn performing our Confrontation Clause analysis in this\r\ncase, we find the opinion in United States v. Lin, 101 F.3d 760\r\n(D.C. Cir 1996), to be particularly instructive because that case\r\npresented circumstances comparable to those that surround this\r\ncase.  There, the defendant sought to assail the government's\r\nwitnesses by suggesting that they were testifying against him\r\nbecause they worked for a competing gambling parlor and wanted him\r\nout of the way.  When Lin attempted to cross-examine one witness by\r\ninquiring into his gambling activities, the government objected and\r\nthe district court requested a proffer.  Defense counsel made an\r\noffer of proof that limned his theory of bias and identified his\r\nclient as the source of the allegations.  The trial court\r\neventually sustained the government's objection.  The court of\r\nappeals affirmed, upholding the trial court's decision not to allow\r\nthe initiation of \"a highly prejudicial line of cross-examination,\"\r\nin circumstances in which the questioner did not show that he\r\npossessed facts sufficient to \"support a genuine belief that the\r\nwitness committed the offense or the degrading act to which the\r\nquestioning relates.\"  Id. at 768 (citation and internal quotations\r\nmarks omitted).  Like Bui, Lin elected not to testify, and the\r\ncourt viewed his proffer as \"too ambiguous\" to indicate that the\r\nproposed questioning had any realistic potential for showing bias.\r\nMany of the principles that animated Lin are pertinent to\r\nthe case at hand.  First and foremost, Lin, like so many of the\r\nprecedents we have culled, holds that cross-examination presupposes\r\nthe existence of a proper foundation.  Offers of proof that do not\r\ncarry the promise of demonstrating bias do not satisfy this\r\nrequirement; indeed, such offers may be considered irrelevant.  See \r\nCarty, 998 F.2d at 1010.  Furthermore, in Lin as in this case, the\r\ntrial court left open the possibility that witnesses could be\r\nrecalled and the line of inquiry reopened if the defense\r\nsubsequently made a better proffer.  Like Lin, Bui never returned\r\nwith a beefed-up presentation.  Finally, as Lin suggests, questions\r\nthat implicate a witness's involvement in elaborate conspiracies to\r\ncommit illegal acts have the potential to be prejudicial and\r\nmisleading.  And when the potential for this kind of prejudice\r\nexists, the need to insist that cross-examination be based on a\r\nsolid foundation is heightened.\r\nIn an effort to deflect this logic, the petitioner seizes\r\nupon the trial judge's comment that the questions his lawyer sought\r\nto ask were irrelevant (and thus inadmissible).  This assessment\r\nwas misguided, the petitioner says, because the general issue of\r\nbias is always relevant.  See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316\r\n(1974).  We are unimpressed by this wordplay.  In context, we\r\ninterpret the trial judge's relevancy ruling to mean that, given\r\nthe scantiness of the record evidence and the incomplete offer of\r\nproof, the petitioner's proposed questions were not sufficiently\r\nprobative of his particular theory of bias, and, therefore, not\r\nrelevant to that issue.\r\nLet us be perfectly clear.  We do not mean to suggest\r\nthat a criminal defendant must testify in his own behalf, or\r\nalternatively, that he must arm himself with irrefutable proof\r\nbefore he may cross-examine witnesses about a particular bias.  We\r\ndo believe, however, that a defendant in such circumstances must\r\npresent a satisfactory foundation for the critical elements on\r\nwhich his hypothesis of bias depends.  In this instance, the\r\npetitioner, having been accorded a fair opportunity to inquire into\r\nThinh's bias, failed to meet that criterion.  Hence, we cannot\r\nfault the trial judge's decision to bar the petitioner from asking\r\nThinh all the specified questions.  See Delaware v. Fensterer, 474\r\nU.S. 15, 20 (1985) (stating that the \"Confrontation Clause\r\nguarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not\r\ncross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to\r\nwhatever extent, the defense might wish\"); Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254\r\n(same).\r\nWe add a coda.  Even under the regime of Teague v. Lane,\r\n489 U.S. 288 (1989), constitutional law was not to be considered\r\nthe \"exclusive province\" of inferior federal courts, Caspari v.\r\nBohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 395 (1994), and such courts, in the absence\r\nof a contrary, established rule announced by the Supreme Court,\r\nwere obliged to \"validate[] reasonable, good-faith interpretations\r\nof existing precedents made by state courts even though they [were]\r\nshown to be contrary to later decisions.\"  Butler v. McKellar, 494\r\nU.S. 407, 414 (1990).  That approach has been underscored by the\r\nAEDPA standard of review.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25; see alsoHennon, 109 F.3d at 335 (stating that, under AEDPA, state courts\r\nare no longer in a \"tutelary relation\" with federal courts).  Thus,\r\nabsent a controlling Supreme Court precedent, mere disagreement\r\nwith a state court's legal analysis is not enough to permit a\r\nfederal court to vacate a state conviction; rather, it must be\r\nshown that the state court's application of federal law was\r\nunreasonable.  This sets the bar quite high.\r\nThere is, of course, some doubt as to the degree of\r\nelevation necessary to separate reasonable and unreasonable\r\napplications of federal law.  Here, however, we need not pinpoint\r\nthat location precisely.  The SJC's analysis regarding the\r\npetitioner's Confrontation Clause claim clears the bar because it\r\ncomports with the approach taken by the courts of appeals in\r\nnumerous cases raising comparable scenarios.  When, as now, a\r\npetitioner can show only that rational minds might differ over how\r\nto apply certain general constitutional principles to the specific\r\ncircumstances of his case, the current habeas corpus standard of\r\nreview does not allow a federal court to invalidate a state\r\nconviction.\r\nV.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  The petitioner fails to convince\r\nus that the SJC's holdings are contrary to, or an unreasonable\r\napplication of, Supreme Court precedent.  Accordingly, the judgment\r\nbelow must be\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, police discovered the stabbed bodies of a mother and daughter, Ngoc Le and Dixie Poulin.  Evidence at the crime scene (the victims' apartment) suggested that Dixie also had been bludgeoned with a blunt instrument, probably a gun, and that the perpetrator(s) likely had absconded with jewelry and cash.  Several months later, Thinh Trinh, an acquaintance of the victims, informed the authorities that the petitioner, Tam Bui, had boasted of wielding a gun at the apartment around the time of the murders.  Thinh's wife, Linh Nguyen, substantiated the story, recalling that the petitioner told her that he had participated in the crime.  As additional corroboration, Thinh and Linh produced two pieces of jewelry that they claimed the petitioner had given to Linh.

They first sought to find Bui at his parents' flat.  He was not there, but police seized a .38 caliber handgun that Bui's father stated belonged to his son.  Shortly thereafter, the authorities apprehended the petitioner and charged him (and the other suspects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial in a Massachusetts state court, the Commonwealth's most incriminating evidence consisted of (i) certain statements that the petitioner had made to police after his arrest, (ii) the testimony of Thinh and Linh, and (iii) the handgun (which the Commonwealth hypothesized had been used to bludgeon Dixie Poulin).  The jury convicted the petitioner on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of armed robbery.  The court sentenced him to serve two consecutive terms of life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed the convictions.  See Commonwealth v. Bui, 419 Mass. 392, 645 N.E.2d 689 (1995) (Bui I ).   The petitioner then sought habeas corpus relief in the federal district court, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, naming as respondents two state officials.  His petition enumerated several purported constitutional faults.  The district court found the claims of error unpersuasive and declined to disturb the state court judgment.  See Bui v. DiPaolo, 985 F.Supp. 219 (D.Mass.1997) (Bui II ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Bui filed his application for habeas corpus relief in December 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217-18 (Apr. 24, 1996) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.), governs this case.  See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 2068, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997) (holding that, in general, AEDPA's provisions apply to cases filed after its effective date).  Under the AEDPA amendments, a habeas petitioner can prosecute an appeal only if he first obtains a certificate of appealability (COA).  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c).  In this instance the district court, after denying the application for a writ of habeas corpus, certified one issue for appeal--the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim that the trial court impermissibly thwarted his lawyer's attempts to cross-examine Thinh--but declined to certify the petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted, the petitioner sought to proceed in this venue on both claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Because we had not had occasion to resolve the question of whether COAs are to be treated as case-specific or issue-specific, we permitted the petitioner to brief his Fifth Amendment claim on the merits, but required that he simultaneously brief the antecedent procedural question.  Consequently, we begin by erecting a procedural framework for the handling of COAs in multi-issue cases.  We then discuss the petitioner's two substantive contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. CERTIFICATES OF APPEALABILITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bui and the amici argue that we are obligated to mull the merits of his Fifth Amendment claim because, in their view, COAs issued under the AEDPA-spawned habeas amendments should be treated as case-specific rather than issue-specific.  In other words, they contend that the grant of a COA on any one issue opens all issues in the case to full appellate review.  Although this result would have been consistent with practice as it existed before the AEDPA amendments, see Magouirk v. Phillips, 144 F.3d 348, 356 (5th Cir.1998);  Tejeda v. Dubois, 142 F.3d 18, 22 n. 4 (1st Cir.1998), we think it is now outmoded.  Congress, in enacting the AEDPA, meant to change prior practice and succeeded in doing so:  the language and structure of the amended habeas statute pretermit appellate consideration of claims not properly certified for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AEDPA predicates the very issuance of a COA--without which \"an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1)--on whether an \"applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"  Id. at &#167; 2253(c)(2).  A habeas petitioner who fails to demonstrate that his claims satisfy the substantial showing standard may not appeal the denial of habeas corpus at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule is easily applied in situations in which a habeas court's decisions on the merits and on the availability of a COA are congruent.  Thus, if a habeas application raises only issues that, in the district court's opinion, warrant neither relief nor a COA, no appeal lies.  Conversely, if the application raises only issues that, according to the district court, uniformly pass muster under the substantial showing standard and, thus, are certifiable (even though in the district court's view they do not justify relief), then a free-ranging appeal lies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these examples, the COA itself is but a variable that depends wholly on the existence of a substantial showing that the petitioner's constitutional rights have been abridged.  The question at hand is whether this relationship is altered in a situation that lacks essential congruence, that is, when the district court, having denied a habeas application, deems some, but fewer than all, of the petitioner's claims certifiable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the necessity for a substantial showing extends independently to each and every issue raised by a habeas petitioner.  Had the mere existence of a COA been sufficient to qualify all the issues in a habeas case for appellate review, it would have been pointless for Congress to go on to state, in section 2253(c)(3), that a COA \"shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy\" the substantial showing standard of section 2253(c)(2).  This language was absent from section 2253's previous incarnation, and the fact that Congress added it in the AEDPA signals an intent that the courts should accord some significance to it.  The petitioner's reading of the statute would render this phrase superfluous, for as long as one issue were certifiable, all others would be amenable to review.  We customarily read statutes in a manner that gives effect to all words and phrases, see Walters v. Metropolitan Educ. Enters., Inc., 519 U.S. 202, 117 S.Ct. 660, 664, 136 L.Ed.2d 644 (1997);  United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985), and we see no valid reason to deviate from this salutary practice here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Common sense also suggests that such an interpretation should be preferred.  Were we to adopt the petitioner's construction of the statute, we would establish a paradigm under which tenuous habeas claims could not be appealed if asserted on their own, but could command appellate attention if accompanied by a solitary claim that met the substantial showing standard.  This dichotomy lacks rhyme or reason, and there is no indication that Congress intended to create so curious a structure.  The better reading of the habeas amendments is one that links section 2253(c)(3)'s insistence on an issue by issue enumeration of what has been certified for appeal with the substantial showing requirement of section 2253(c)(2).  We hold, therefore, that a court of appeals should not consider the merits of an issue advanced by a habeas petitioner unless a COA first has been obtained with respect to that issue.  Accord Ramsey v. Bowersox, 149 F.3d 749, 759 (8th Cir.1998), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 1083, 143 L.Ed.2d 85 (1999);  Murray v. United States, 145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998);  Sylvester v. Hanks, 140 F.3d 713, 715 (7th Cir.1998);  Lackey v. Johnson, 116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1997);  In re Certificates of Appealability, 106 F.3d 1306, 1308 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were the power to issue a COA exclusively a prerogative of the district courts, this holding might answer the procedural question that confronts us.  Under the AEDPA amendments, however, a habeas petitioner who fails in his effort to obtain a COA in the district court may then beseech the court of appeals to issue one.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)(1) (\"If the district judge has denied the certificate, the applicant for the writ may then request issuance of the certificate by a circuit judge.\").  The procedure for cases in which the district court does not grant a COA at all is uncontroversial:  even if there is no express request for a COA, the court of appeals must deem a notice of appeal to represent a request for a COA on all issues raised.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)(1)-(2).  The rules are silent, however, with respect to the appropriate procedure in hybrid cases.  Thus, we must decide what course a habeas petitioner should follow when the district court certifies some, but not all, of the issues that he wishes to vent on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court issues a limited COA (i.e., a COA that permits the petitioner to go forward on fewer than all of the issues raised in his petition), the petitioner must present promptly to the court of appeals an express request for a complementary COA.  Although this court's local rules do not definitively resolve the timing issue, it is our present practice to notify each habeas petitioner of an outside date by which his request for a COA must be filed in the court of appeals.  Failure to file within that interval may be deemed to constitute a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request for a complementary COA must be explicit as to the issues which the petitioner wishes us to consider and, in such circumstances, we will not treat an inexplicit notice of appeal, without more, as an invitation to review the district court's denial of certification with regard to the petitioner's remaining claims.  In taking this stance, we adopt the rule stated in United States v. Kimler, 150 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1998) (declaring that a notice of appeal in a multi-issue habeas case will not be treated as a constructive request for expanding a limited COA issued by the district court), and reject the rule stated in Kincade v. Sparkman, 117 F.3d 949, 953 (6th Cir.1997) (treating a notice of appeal in a hybrid case as \"an informal request with this Court to review the district Court's denial as to [the petitioner's] remaining claims\").  We make one related point:  the request for a complementary COA, whether contained in a separate document or incorporated into the notice of appeal, should be accompanied by a copy of the district court's order and a memorandum giving specific and substantial reasons (not mere generalizations) why a certificate should be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interests of fairness and judicial economy, we also rule that, when the district court grants a limited COA and the petitioner seasonably seeks to expand it, his appeal on the certified issue(s) should be held in abeyance, and full briefing deferred, until this court determines the appealability of the issues that the district court deemed unworthy of appellate scrutiny (and, thus, whether we will issue a complementary COA).  Accord Kimler, 150 F.3d at 431 n. 1;  Kincade, 117 F.3d at 953;  United States v. Simmonds, 111 F.3d 737, 740-41 (10th Cir.1997).  As an administrative measure, we advise litigants that, to the extent practicable, the panel that determines whether to issue a complementary COA also will be the panel that adjudicates the appeal on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aware that a few cases are pending in which, as here, a motions judge has adopted an ad hoc framework for handling situations in which a district court, over a habeas petitioner's objection, issued a limited COA.  Such actions were entirely appropriate in the absence of a definitive resolution of the attendant procedural questions.  We will, of course, allow those appeals to proceed in the ordinary course, under the terms of the provisional orders previously entered.  In future cases, however, we will require habeas petitioners to walk the procedural path that we set in place today.  We regard the instant case as grandfathered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court issued a COA restricted to the Sixth Amendment issue, the petitioner's able counsel timely filed a notice of appeal and contemporaneously submitted an application to the district court to enlarge the COA to encompass the Fifth Amendment claim.  When no amended certificate emerged, counsel sought a complementary COA in this court.  We entered an order, previously described, directing the petitioner, inter alia, to brief his Fifth Amendment claim on the merits.  Reading the new habeas amendments literally, we next should consider whether the petitioner has made a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\" in respect to this Fifth Amendment point.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(2).  Here, however, under the terms of our interim order, the parties have fully briefed and argued the merits of that claim.  Since we decline to take two steps where one will do, we skip the preliminary \"substantial showing\" inquiry and turn directly to the merits.  We caution, however, that this expedient departs from the norm, and we employ it here solely because of the terms of the interim order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim has its genesis in a 30-minute conversation between him and the police conducted shortly after his arrest.  The facts surrounding the interview, derived primarily from a police report, are not in dispute.  When the authorities arrested the petitioner on August 18, 1990, they gave him Miranda warnings in his native language (Vietnamese).  The petitioner acknowledged that he understood his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before interviewing the petitioner, the police again advised him of his rights, this time in both English and Vietnamese.  In response, the petitioner proclaimed that he knew his rights, that \"my Constitution will protect me,\" and that \"you have nothing.\"   When an officer asked if he had anything to say about why he was being arrested, the petitioner replied in the negative.  Then--before the officer posed another question--he inquired:  \"Who said I did this?\"   The petitioner thereafter answered some questions, while brushing others aside.  The interview ended when he declined to respond to a query asking what he had \"to say about what happened around [the time of the murders].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the state trial court had refused to suppress the interview, a number of the petitioner's statements were admitted into evidence.  For example, the Commonwealth introduced the petitioner's comment about the gun that had been found in his parents' abode and his remark to the police that \"you have nothing.\"   On direct appeal, the SJC upheld the admissibility of these statements.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 396-97, 645 N.E.2d at 692-93.   In considering the petitioner's ensuing habeas application, the district court found no unequivocal assertion of the right to remain silent and dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim on the authority of Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994).  See Bui II, 985 F.Supp. at 226-28.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seizing on the fact that Davis involved only the right to counsel--in Davis, 512 U.S. at 458-59, 114 S.Ct. 2350, the Court held that if an accused wishes to assert a right to counsel, he must so state unambiguously--the petitioner posits that Davis is inapplicable where, as here, a defendant anchors a Fifth Amendment claim upon the right to remain silent.  This means, he says, that we must grant habeas relief because Davis does not comprise \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" within the purview of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's attempt to characterize Davis as something other than \"clearly established Federal law\" rests on a mistaken premise:  the idea that, merely because Davis does not directly compel the particular outcome reached by the state court, a federal habeas court perforce must issue the writ.  This is a non sequitur.  Under the AEDPA amendments, federal courts review state court judgments to determine whether those judgments construe or apply federal law in a manner that is \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application of\" the Supreme Court's \"clearly established\" jurisprudence.  See O'Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir.1998) (citing statutory language).  The question, then, is whether the Massachusetts courts' rulings in this case contravene the Court's precedents or represent an unreasonable application of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Davis is the relevant precedent, we do not see how we can disturb the judgment.  To be sure, Davis concerned only the right to counsel recognized in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  Nonetheless, every circuit that has addressed the issue squarely has concluded that Davis applies to both components of Miranda:  the right to counsel and the right to remain silent.  See United States v. Mills, 122 F.3d 346, 350-51 (7th Cir.)  (citing United States v. Banks, 78 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (7th Cir.1996)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 637, 139 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997);  Medina v. Singletary, 59 F.3d 1095, 1100-01 (11th Cir.1995);  United States v. Johnson, 56 F.3d 947, 955 (8th Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  For the purposes of habeas corpus review, we simply cannot deem unreasonable a conclusion by the Massachusetts courts that is consistent with the approach taken by so many respected tribunals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to avoid the force of this reasoning, the petitioner maintains that Davis is inapposite to Miranda 's right to remain silent.  Although the similarity of the analyses requisite for assessing claims anent Miranda 's right to counsel and its right to remain silent suggests that Davis constitutes strong evidence of how the Supreme Court likely would decide this right to remain silent question, we acknowledge that Davis does not \"authoritatively\" answer the question in the narrow, technical sense of that term.  We therefore assume for argument's sake that Davis is not the relevant precedent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Even on this assumption, the petitioner's challenge to the state court judgment fares poorly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the petitioner sees it, his claim implicates a line of authority which states that, as long as a criminal defendant articulates his Fifth Amendment rights in even an equivocal manner, police interrogation must cease immediately.  See Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 103-04, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975);  Quinn v. United States, 349 U.S. 155, 162-64, 75 S.Ct. 668, 99 L.Ed. 964 (1955);  United States v. Barone, 968 F.2d 1378, 1384 (1st Cir.1992);  see also Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Jerold H. Israel, 1  Criminal Procedure &#167; 6.9(e), 531-33 (1984 &amp; Supp.1991) (discussing implied assertion of Miranda rights).  Under this legal rubric, the petitioner argues, his statement to the effect that \"my Constitution will protect me\" and his negative response to the officer's query anent whether \"he had anything to say about what he was being arrested for\" were, at the very least, equivocal assertions of the right to remain silent, and, therefore, precluded the police from doing more than following up with clarifying questions.  See United States v. March, 999 F.2d 456, 461 (10th Cir.1993) (collecting cases).  Since the police went further, the petitioner reasons, the trial court should have suppressed all the statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Setting to one side the question of whether the doctrinal underpinnings of the petitioner's argument retain much integrity after Davis, we believe that the facts of this case are controlled by a different line of authority.  In North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979), the Court made it pellucid that an express statement is not invariably necessary to support a finding that the defendant waived either the right to remain silent or the right to counsel.  We, too, have employed this implied waiver doctrine, see United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1169 (1st Cir.1993), and it appears to be the primary ground on which the SJC resolved the petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim, see Bui I, 419 Mass. at 397, 645 N.E.2d at 692-93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precisely when waiver may be implied depends on the circumstances.  Even so, there are certain types of cases in which courts routinely conclude that a defendant who has professed an understanding of his right to remain silent has waived that right.  For example, a defendant will be held to have effected a waiver when, after receiving warnings and asserting (equivocally or unequivocally) a right to remain silent, he spontaneously recommences the dialogue with his interviewers.  See Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981);  United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.1998).  So, too, if a defendant's incriminating statements were made either as part of a \"steady stream\" of speech, Bradley v. Meachum, 918 F.2d 338, 342 (2d Cir.1990), or as part of a back-and-forth conversation with the police, Baskin v. Clark, 956 F.2d 142, 146 (7th Cir.1992), courts regularly have found waivers.  A waiver of Miranda rights also may be implied when, after having received Miranda warnings, a criminal defendant responds selectively to questions posed to him.  See United States v. Soliz, 129 F.3d 499, 503 (9th Cir.1997);  United States v. Eaton, 890 F.2d 511, 513-14 (1st Cir.1989) (Breyer, J.);  United States v. Chong, 829 F.2d 1572, 1574 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's interview displays characteristics that fit the implied waiver profile.  In his initial statements, uttered immediately after the second round of Miranda warnings, the petitioner proclaimed that he knew his rights and that the Constitution would protect him.  The petitioner's claim to the contrary notwithstanding, these comments cannot plausibly be construed to suggest that the speaker intended to assert Miranda rights.  In all events, the spontaneous utterance \"you have nothing,\" made immediately after those comments and without any semblance of police provocation, is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.  See Conley, 156 F.3d at 83;  Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146.   Up to this point, the dialogue has the distinct flavor of a back-and-forth conversation between the petitioner and his interviewer.  See, e.g., Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the remainder of the interview lends credence to this impression.  Once the petitioner boasted that the police had nothing, the interviewer legitimately followed up by asking him whether he had something to say about the reasons for his arrest.  The petitioner answered \"no\"--and this is a point at which he now avers the police should have stopped their questioning.  He might have had a stronger argument had he not added anything to his response, see Conley, 156 F.3d at 83, but he then immediately asked the police:  \"who said I did this?\"   The petitioner's continuation of the conversation by means of this question both negated any effect his prior response may have had as an assertion of his right to remain silent and confirmed that the interview was indeed a back-and-forth exchange.  See Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory.  The short of it is that the petitioner did not unequivocally assert his right to remain silent, and, moreover, selectively responded to questions during what otherwise appears to have been a fairly standard two-way conversation with the authorities.  The prosecution thereupon introduced those responses at trial.  If the relevant precedent here is Davis, the petitioner cannot prevail because he made no clear articulation of a desire to stand mute.  If, however, Davis does not apply, the relevant precedent is Butler, and federal courts have on numerous occasions employed its implied waiver principle to uphold the admissibility of evidence under circumstances similar to those presented in this case.  See, e.g., Ramirez, 79 F.3d at 305;  Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146;  Bradley, 918 F.2d at 342;  see generally LaFave &amp; Israel, supra &#167; 6.9(d), at 530-31 (discussing implied waivers).  Either way, the SJC's application of federal law (and, for that matter, the state trial court's determination of subsidiary facts) does not fall outside the sphere of acceptability.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE SIXTH AMENDMENT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause to set the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim into perspective.  Thinh was one of two persons who testified that the petitioner admitted involvement in the murders, and one of three who described him brandishing a knife and suggesting that he had used it to commit a crime.  In addition, Thinh recounted important information concerning the petitioner's possession of certain items of jewelry ostensibly belonging to Ngoc Le.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 398-99, 645 N.E.2d at 693 (summarizing Thinh's testimony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner had hoped to impeach Thinh's credibility by developing, inter alia, a rather intricate theory of bias.  In the petitioner's scenario, Thinh and Linh were coerced into testifying falsely by Linh's father, Mong Nguyen, a drug kingpin, who took this action because the petitioner had refused, in the presence of Mong's peers (equally notorious drug lords), to transport drugs.  According to the petitioner, extreme retributive tendencies characterize interpersonal relations in Vietnamese society, and Thinh's rejection so affronted Mong that he exacted revenge by directing his daughter and quondam son-in-law to frame Bui.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the petitioner's counsel first attempted to gather support for this hypothesis by questioning Linh on voir dire, outside the jury's presence.  He drew a blank.  He revisited the subject with Thinh, but the trial judge sustained the prosecution's objections to his initial round of questions.  Counsel thereupon made an offer of proof.  The judge remained steadfast and refused, on relevancy grounds, to allow the attorney to ask the proposed questions.  After the jury convicted the petitioner, the SJC affirmed this evidentiary ruling, finding the petitioner's theory of bias too speculative to justify cross-examination.  See id. at 401, 645 N.E.2d at 694-95.   The Confrontation Clause places a high value on the right to cross-examination.  See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678-79, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986).  That right is witness-specific.  See id. at 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431.   Furthermore, a criminal defendant's entitlement to cross-examine a witness increases in sensitivity in direct proportion to the witness's importance to the prosecution's case.  See United States v. Mizell, 88 F.3d 288, 292-93 (5th Cir.1996);  United States v. Taylor, 17 F.3d 333, 340 (11th Cir.1994);  see also United States v. Tracey, 675 F.2d 433, 437-38 (1st Cir.1982) (collecting cases).  Given Thinh's status as a key figure in the prosecution's case, it is readily apparent that the petitioner's claim demands close attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner exhorts us to hold that the Massachusetts courts violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause by prohibiting all inquiry into a cogent bias theory.  Citing cases such as United States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d 430, 433 (1st Cir.1988), he maintains that the trial court's actions violated the general rule requiring courts to permit a threshold level of cross-examination on bias and, thus, the SJC's holding was \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court precedent.  We reject this plaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Speaking in the large, the jurisprudence of the Confrontation Clause rarely lends itself to Procrustean application, see O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 26, and the case law simply does not state the \"threshold level of inquiry\" rule in terms as absolute as the petitioner would have it.  Indeed, the Van Arsdall Court explicitly recognized that, under certain circumstances, trial judges possess broad discretion to limit cross-examination.  See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431 (enumerating various factors that may justify circumscription of cross-examination).  Thus, to the extent that the petitioner is suggesting that a criminal defendant has license to cross-question a prosecution witness concerning every conceivable theory of bias, regardless of the prevailing circumstances, he is plainly wrong.  The threshold requirement imposed by the Confrontation Clause is satisfied as long as the defendant is given a fair chance to inquire into a witness's bias.  See United States v. Sinclair, 109 F.3d 1527, 1537 (10th Cir.1997);  United States v. Guthrie, 931 F.2d 564, 568-69 (9th Cir.1991);  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254-55 (1st Cir.1990).  A criminal defendant is not regarded as being deprived of that chance if a trial court legitimately determines that his cross-examination is inappropriate.  See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, we cannot say that the Massachusetts courts acted contrary to established Supreme Court case law in regard to this matter.  The petitioner cross-examined Thinh at length with respect to bias, and the trial court based its restriction of further cross-examination on relevancy grounds--something Van Arsdall, in principle, expressly permits.  Thus, we must test the propriety of the Massachusetts courts' conclusions by asking whether forbidding further cross-questioning represented an unreasonable application of the Supreme Court's Confrontation Clause precedents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).  In itself, this is not a surprising development:  when a constitutional claim requires balancing rather than applying a strict, one-dimensional legal rule, that ordinarily is an indication that a habeas court, in the end, will have to gauge the reasonableness of the state court's application of the rule.  See, e.g., Holman v. Gilmore, 126 F.3d 876, 881-82 (7th Cir.1997) (stating that \"when the constitutional question is a matter of degree, rather than of concrete entitlements, a 'reasonable' decision by the state court must be honored\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1169, 140 L.Ed.2d 179 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before turning to specifics, we reiterate the narrow circumference of appellate review in connection with the \"reasonable application\" standard.  Under this formulation, a federal court may not \"grant the writ merely because it disagrees with the state court's decision, or because, left to its own devices, it would have reached a different result.\"  O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25;  accord Corwin v. Johnson, 150 F.3d 467, 471-72 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 613, 142 L.Ed.2d 548 (1998);  Neelley v. Nagle, 138 F.3d 917, 924 (11th Cir.1998), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 811, 142 L.Ed.2d 671 (1999);  Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F.3d 330, 334-35 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 72, 139 L.Ed.2d 32 (1997).  The question, rather, is whether the state court has applied federal law in a manner that is \"so offensive to existing precedent\" or so lacking in foundation that its conclusion is \"outside the universe of plausible, credible outcomes.\"  O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.   As suggested by our discussion of the Fifth Amendment claim, what this standard implies is that we cannot deem a state court's application of federal law unreasonable when federal courts--typically, the circuit courts of appeals--regularly resolve cases in a similar fashion.  See Williams v. Taylor, 163 F.3d 860, 869 (4th Cir.1998);  Davis v. Johnson, 158 F.3d 806, 813-14 (5th Cir.1998), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Feb. 23, 1999) (No. 98-8209);  O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25;  cf. Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U.S. 518, 117 S.Ct. 1517, 1530, 137 L.Ed.2d 771 (1997) (engaging in a similar analysis in a pre-AEDPA habeas proceeding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another dimension of the problem deserves mention.  In order for a federal court to conclude that a state court has applied federal law reasonably, it is not necessary that the federal court agree with every last detail of the state court's analysis.  By like token, state courts are not required to supply the specific reasons that a federal court thinks are most persuasive for upholding the judgment.  Rather, it suffices that the state court generally articulates and applies tenets that can reasonably sustain its judgment.  Thus, the question on habeas corpus review is whether the state courts' invocation and reliance on enunciated legal principles are reasonably consistent with the facts, circumstances, and outcome of the case.  See, e.g., Hennon, 109 F.3d at 335 (\"It doesn't follow that the criterion of a reasonable determination is whether it is well reasoned.  It is not.  It is whether the determination is at least minimally consistent with the facts and circumstances of the case.\").  Were we to insist on perfect jurisprudential harmony, not only would we risk defying Congress's will by transforming the AEDPA standard into one of plenary review, but we also would place ourselves in a position in which we might invalidate convictions not because a \"defendant may have been the victim [ ] of [a] constitutional error but merely of a failure of judicial articulateness.\"  Id. The logic of the AEDPA is flatly inconsistent with such an approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of these background principles, we turn to the SJC's determination that the petitioner was not entitled to inquire along the line that he proposed.  As we already have observed, cross-examination is subject to reasonable restrictions.  One well-established basis for circumscribing cross-examination is a party's inability to lay a proper evidentiary foundation for the questions that he wishes to pose.  See, e.g., United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 218-19 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1010 (1st Cir.1993).  The SJC relied upon this principle to conclude that the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim lacked merit.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 401, 645 N.E.2d at 694-95 (holding that the petitioner's offer of proof was too tenuous to justify the desired inquiry).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the offer of proof.  It prophesied that Thinh, if allowed to answer the proposed questions, would acknowledge that the petitioner rebuffed Mong's entreaty to ferry narcotics from California to Boston.  Defense counsel purposed to argue from this response that the repudiation so angered Mong that he directed Thinh to frame the petitioner.  But to that point in the trial, there had been no evidence even remotely supporting the petitioner's offer of proof.  When the court inquired into the predicate for the offer, counsel did not cite any evidence, but replied instead that he had a good-faith basis founded on attorney-client privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On this exiguous record, the mere invocation of the petitioner as the source was not enough to negate the inherent speculativeness of the offer, especially since the petitioner neither testified at trial nor submitted an affidavit as part of the proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to assume, as did the state trial court, that petitioner had made a good-faith proffer, we still could not conclude that the SJC's determination that the offer of proof was unsatisfactory so offended existing Supreme Court precedent as to be unreasonable.  Apart from its foundational infirmities, the petitioner's offer of proof was inherently defective because it did not include crucial elements of his bias theory.  He sought to ask Thinh three questions:  (1) Was Mong present in California while Thinh and the petitioner were there?  (2) Did Mong ever ask the petitioner to transport drugs to Boston?  (3) If so, did the petitioner refuse?   However, we agree with the SJC that the petitioner's theory of bias had more components than could be addressed by responsive answers to these three questions.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 401-02, 645 N.E.2d at 695.   It ultimately depended on demonstrating facts relating to matters such as the relationship between Mong and the petitioner, the relationship between Mong and Thinh, the presence (and identity) of others in the course of the alleged repudiation, and the tenor of Mong's reaction.  Neither the proposed questions nor the petitioner's offer of proof touched upon these issues.  On this sparse record, both the trial court's limitation on cross-examination and the SJC's affirmance on the ground that the offer of proof was too tenuous were in conformity with federal court precedents requiring a satisfactory evidentiary foundation for cross-questioning, see, e.g., Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d at 218-19;  Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010, and thus neither decision implicated the AEDPA standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d 430, much relied upon by the petitioner, does not demand a different result.  If anything, the facts of Lynn highlight one of the main shortcomings of the petitioner's offer of proof.  Lynn exemplifies those cases in which courts have disapproved restrictions on questioning about bias when cross-examination seeks to probe whether a prosecution witness will get preferential treatment from law enforcement in return for testifying.  In these instances, courts have been especially open to permitting cross-examination about agreements between government and witness.  In the same vein, courts have recognized, albeit less frequently, that similarly distorting influences may arise from other innately coercive relationships.  See, e.g., United States v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45, 52, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984) (discussing witness's membership in a gang or secret group as productive of coercion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the source of the alleged coercion, however, courts traditionally have required a solid showing that coercion is present.  See Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.   Where there is no evidence of a coercive dimension in the relationship between a witness and an organization, trial courts cast well within their discretion in prohibiting cross-examiners from mounting fishing expeditions.  See Sinclair, 109 F.3d at 1537;  United States v. Elkins, 70 F.3d 81, 83-84 (10th Cir.1995);  United States v. Warren, 18 F.3d 602, 603 (8th Cir.1994);  United States v. Piche, 981 F.2d 706, 715-16 (4th Cir.1992).  Here, the singularly essential element of the petitioner's theory--a relationship of coercion between a person purportedly interested in the outcome of the trial (Mong) and the witness (Thinh)--utterly lacked an evidentiary foundation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Indeed, the petitioner made no attempt to address this element in his offer of proof or contemporaneously in some other fashion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Under these circumstances, we do not believe the petitioner can rely on Lynn to undo the SJC's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In performing our Confrontation Clause analysis in this case, we find the opinion in United States v. Lin, 101 F.3d 760 (D.C.Cir.1996), to be particularly instructive because that case presented circumstances comparable to those that surround this case.  There, the defendant sought to assail the government's witnesses by suggesting that they were testifying against him because they worked for a competing gambling parlor and wanted him out of the way.  When Lin attempted to cross-examine one witness by inquiring into his gambling activities, the government objected and the district court requested a proffer.  Defense counsel made an offer of proof that limned his theory of bias and identified his client as the source of the allegations.  The trial court eventually sustained the government's objection.  The court of appeals affirmed, upholding the trial court's decision not to allow the initiation of \"a highly prejudicial line of cross-examination,\" in circumstances in which the questioner did not show that he possessed facts sufficient to \"support a genuine belief that the witness committed the offense or the degrading act to which the questioning relates.\"  Id. at 768 (citation and internal quotations marks omitted).  Like Bui, Lin elected not to testify, and the court viewed his proffer as \"too ambiguous\" to indicate that the proposed questioning had any realistic potential for showing bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of the principles that animated Lin are pertinent to the case at hand.  First and foremost, Lin, like so many of the precedents we have culled, holds that cross-examination presupposes the existence of a proper foundation.  Offers of proof that do not carry the promise of demonstrating bias do not satisfy this requirement;  indeed, such offers may be considered irrelevant.  See Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.   Furthermore, in Lin as in this case, the trial court left open the possibility that witnesses could be recalled and the line of inquiry reopened if the defense subsequently made a better proffer.  Like Lin, Bui never returned with a beefed-up presentation.  Finally, as Lin suggests, questions that implicate a witness's involvement in elaborate conspiracies to commit illegal acts have the potential to be prejudicial and misleading.  And when the potential for this kind of prejudice exists, the need to insist that cross-examination be based on a solid foundation is heightened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to deflect this logic, the petitioner seizes upon the trial judge's comment that the questions his lawyer sought to ask were irrelevant (and thus inadmissible).  This assessment was misguided, the petitioner says, because the general issue of bias is always relevant.  See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974).  We are unimpressed by this wordplay.  In context, we interpret the trial judge's relevancy ruling to mean that, given the scantiness of the record evidence and the incomplete offer of proof, the petitioner's proposed questions were not sufficiently probative of his particular theory of bias, and, therefore, not relevant to that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear.  We do not mean to suggest that a criminal defendant must testify in his own behalf, or alternatively, that he must arm himself with irrefutable proof before he may cross-examine witnesses about a particular bias.  We do believe, however, that a defendant in such circumstances must present a satisfactory foundation for the critical elements on which his hypothesis of bias depends.  In this instance, the petitioner, having been accorded a fair opportunity to inquire into Thinh's bias, failed to meet that criterion.  Hence, we cannot fault the trial judge's decision to bar the petitioner from asking Thinh all the specified questions.  See Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985) (stating that the \"Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish\");  Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda.  Even under the regime of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), constitutional law was not to be considered the \"exclusive province\" of inferior federal courts, Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 395, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994), and such courts, in the absence of a contrary, established rule announced by the Supreme Court, were obliged to \"validate[ ] reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they [were] shown to be contrary to later decisions.\"  Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 414, 110 S.Ct. 1212, 108 L.Ed.2d 347 (1990).  That approach has been underscored by the AEDPA standard of review.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25;  see also Hennon, 109 F.3d at 335 (stating that, under AEDPA, state courts are no longer in a \"tutelary relation\" with federal courts).  Thus, absent a controlling Supreme Court precedent, mere disagreement with a state court's legal analysis is not enough to permit a federal court to vacate a state conviction;  rather, it must be shown that the state court's application of federal law was unreasonable.  This sets the bar quite high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, of course, some doubt as to the degree of elevation necessary to separate reasonable and unreasonable applications of federal law.  Here, however, we need not pinpoint that location precisely.  The SJC's analysis regarding the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim clears the bar because it comports with the approach taken by the courts of appeals in numerous cases raising comparable scenarios.  When, as now, a petitioner can show only that rational minds might differ over how to apply certain general constitutional principles to the specific circumstances of his case, the current habeas corpus standard of review does not allow a federal court to invalidate a state conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The petitioner fails to convince us that the SJC's holdings are contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent.  Accordingly, the judgment below must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioner also has raised a third contention, in the nature of a generalized due process claim based on the Constitution's guarantee to criminal defendants of \"a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\"  Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986).  The protections of the Sixth Amendment are themselves specific means through which the Constitution realizes the aforementioned guarantee.  See id.;   see also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 684-685, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  If the petitioner's due process claim rested on a factual predicate that was not amenable to conventional Sixth Amendment analysis, such as the circumstances presented in Crane or in California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984), we would not hesitate to consider this claim separately.  Here, however, the due process claim relies entirely on the factual predicate of the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim.  Because there is a virtually complete overlap between the Sixth Amendment and due process claims, we need only discuss the former</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure authorize COA determinations to be made by two, or even one, circuit judges.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)(2) (stating that COA requests addressed to the court of appeals \"may be considered by a circuit judge or judges, as the court prescribes\").  Some courts of appeals have exercised that authority.  See, e.g., In re Certificates of Appealability, 106 F.3d at 1307.   This circuit has opted, at least for the time being, to commit all such determinations to three-judge panels</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the SJC did not cite to Davis, its reference to the \"ambiguous\" nature of the petitioner's assertion of his Fifth Amendment rights, see Bui I, 419 Mass. at 397 n. 4, 645 N.E.2d at 693 n. 4, meshes neatly with the district court's rationale</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Two courts, recognizing a possible theoretical distinction between the right to counsel and the right to remain silent, have left the issue open.  See Evans v. Demosthenes, 98 F.3d 1174, 1176 (9th Cir.1996);  United States v. Ramirez, 79 F.3d 298, 305 (2d Cir.1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> There are limits to this assumption.  To the extent that the petitioner calumnizes the district court's reliance on Davis as improperly importing Sixth Amendment principles into the Fifth Amendment context, he is barking up the wrong tree.  Davis did not deal with the Sixth Amendment, but, rather, with the Fifth Amendment right to counsel articulated in Miranda.   See Davis, 512 U.S. at 457-58, 114 S.Ct. 2350</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the petitioner argues that the trial court's conclusion contravened established Supreme Court precedent holding that the issue of bias is always relevant.  See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974).  As we explain below, our review of the record convinces us that the petitioner misconstrues the trial court's ruling and that the \"contrary to\" prong of the AEDPA standard is not implicated here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In his principal brief on appeal, the petitioner now suggests that he had supported his theory by evidence that Mong was Thinh's father-in-law;  that Mong, Thinh, and Bui had been together in California shortly after the murders;  that Thinh had previously been convicted of a drug offense;  and that autopsy reports showed that one of the victims had cocaine in her blood.  This evidence says nothing about Mong's interest or role in framing the petitioner.  Moreover, under the AEDPA standard of review, such a shaky evidentiary foundation would not permit us to discredit the reasonableness of the SJC's conclusions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The trial judge's earlier refusal to permit the petitioner to cross-examine one of the police officers who had investigated the murders about Mong's criminal history does not fill this void.  For one thing, the petitioner does not challenge this ruling on appeal.  For another thing, the attempted cross-examination was not in any way tied either to Thinh's cross-examination or to the petitioner's offer of proof</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The petitioner suggests that two items of evidence sufficed to close this gap.  He says, first, that the idea that Mong would not endanger his daughter and Thinh becomes \"laughable\" when we consider that the latter sometimes sold drugs on Mong's behalf, and second, that in order to understand the reactions of an irate Vietnamese drug lord, we need only refer to a Massachusetts state trooper's testimony that the Vietnamese community is \"closed\" and \"in part controlled by intimidation and retribution.\"   We are unpersuaded by these suggestions.  With respect to the first matter, even if we assume, contrary to the established record, that there was evidence that Mong and Thinh were collaborators in the drug trade, the mere fact that Thinh at one unspecified time may have sold drugs for Mong says little about the existence of coercion, let alone its nature or whether that coercion was continuing.  As for the police officer's testimony (which the petitioner thoroughly mischaracterizes), we decline this invitation to arrive at a legal conclusion based on nothing more than an invidious stereotype of the members of an ethnic community</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Procedurally, we must determine the effect of a district court's grant of a certificate of appealability on some, but not all, of the issues that a habeas petitioner seeks to pursue.  Substantively, we must determine whether the petitioner has shown legal cause for us to set aside his state court convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, police discovered the stabbed bodies of a mother and daughter, Ngoc Le and Dixie Poulin.  Evidence at the crime scene (the victims' apartment) suggested that Dixie also had been bludgeoned with a blunt instrument, probably a gun, and that the perpetrator(s) likely had absconded with jewelry and cash.  Several months later, Thinh Trinh, an acquaintance of the victims, informed the authorities that the petitioner, Tam Bui, had boasted of wielding a gun at the apartment around the time of the murders.  Thinh's wife, Linh Nguyen, substantiated the story, recalling that the petitioner told her that he had participated in the crime.  As additional corroboration, Thinh and Linh produced two pieces of jewelry that they claimed the petitioner had given to Linh.  The jewelry appeared to have belonged to Ngoc Le.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the police obtained warrants for the petitioner and two other suspects.  They first sought to find Bui at his parents' flat.  He was not there, but police seized a .38 caliber handgun that Bui's father stated belonged to his son.  Shortly thereafter, the authorities apprehended the petitioner and charged him (and the other suspects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial in a Massachusetts state court, the Commonwealth's most incriminating evidence consisted of (i) certain statements that the petitioner had made to police after his arrest, (ii) the testimony of Thinh and Linh, and (iii) the handgun (which the Commonwealth hypothesized had been used to bludgeon Dixie Poulin).  The jury convicted the petitioner on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of armed robbery.  The court sentenced him to serve two consecutive terms of life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed the convictions.  See Commonwealth v. Bui, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span> (1995) (Bui I ).   The petitioner then sought habeas corpus relief in the federal district court, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, naming as respondents two state officials.  His petition enumerated several purported constitutional faults.  The district court found the claims of error unpersuasive and declined to disturb the state court judgment.  See Bui v. DiPaolo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></span> (D.Mass.1997) (Bui II ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Bui filed his application for habeas corpus relief in December 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217-18 (Apr. 24, 1996) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.), governs this case.  See Lindh v. Murphy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118135\"><a href=\"/opinion/118135/lindh-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118135\"><a href=\"/opinion/118135/lindh-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (1997) (holding that, in general, AEDPA's provisions apply to cases filed after its effective date).  Under the AEDPA amendments, a habeas petitioner can prosecute an appeal only if he first obtains a certificate of appealability (COA).  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c).  In this instance the district court, after denying the application for a writ of habeas corpus, certified one issue for appeal--the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim that the trial court impermissibly thwarted his lawyer's attempts to cross-examine Thinh--but declined to certify the petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted, the petitioner sought to proceed in this venue on both claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Because we had not had occasion to resolve the question of whether COAs are to be treated as case-specific or issue-specific, we permitted the petitioner to brief his Fifth Amendment claim on the merits, but required that he simultaneously brief the antecedent procedural question.  Consequently, we begin by erecting a procedural framework for the handling of COAs in multi-issue cases.  We then discuss the petitioner's two substantive contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. CERTIFICATES OF APPEALABILITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bui and the amici argue that we are obligated to mull the merits of his Fifth Amendment claim because, in their view, COAs issued under the AEDPA-spawned habeas amendments should be treated as case-specific rather than issue-specific.  In other words, they contend that the grant of a COA on any one issue opens all issues in the case to full appellate review.  Although this result would have been consistent with practice as it existed before the AEDPA amendments, see Magouirk v. Phillips, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754496\"><a href=\"/opinion/754496/kenneth-wayne-magouirk-v-michael-phillips-warden-winn-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 356 (5th Cir.1998);  Tejeda v. Dubois, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197917\"><a href=\"/opinion/197917/tejeda-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 n. 4 (1st Cir.1998), we think it is now outmoded.  Congress, in enacting the AEDPA, meant to change prior practice and succeeded in doing so:  the language and structure of the amended habeas statute pretermit appellate consideration of claims not properly certified for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AEDPA predicates the very issuance of a COA--without which \"an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1)--on whether an \"applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"  Id. at &#167; 2253(c)(2).  A habeas petitioner who fails to demonstrate that his claims satisfy the substantial showing standard may not appeal the denial of habeas corpus at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule is easily applied in situations in which a habeas court's decisions on the merits and on the availability of a COA are congruent.  Thus, if a habeas application raises only issues that, in the district court's opinion, warrant neither relief nor a COA, no appeal lies.  Conversely, if the application raises only issues that, according to the district court, uniformly pass muster under the substantial showing standard and, thus, are certifiable (even though in the district court's view they do not justify relief), then a free-ranging appeal lies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these examples, the COA itself is but a variable that depends wholly on the existence of a substantial showing that the petitioner's constitutional rights have been abridged.  The question at hand is whether this relationship is altered in a situation that lacks essential congruence, that is, when the district court, having denied a habeas application, deems some, but fewer than all, of the petitioner's claims certifiable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the necessity for a substantial showing extends independently to each and every issue raised by a habeas petitioner.  Had the mere existence of a COA been sufficient to qualify all the issues in a habeas case for appellate review, it would have been pointless for Congress to go on to state, in section 2253(c)(3), that a COA \"shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy\" the substantial showing standard of section 2253(c)(2).  This language was absent from section 2253's previous incarnation, and the fact that Congress added it in the AEDPA signals an intent that the courts should accord some significance to it.  The petitioner's reading of the statute would render this phrase superfluous, for as long as one issue were certifiable, all others would be amenable to review.  We customarily read statutes in a manner that gives effect to all words and phrases, see Walters v. Metropolitan Educ. Enters., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118075\"><a href=\"/opinion/118075/walters-v-metropolitan-ed-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118075\"><a href=\"/opinion/118075/walters-v-metropolitan-ed-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Were we to adopt the petitioner's construction of the statute, we would establish a paradigm under which tenuous habeas claims could not be appealed if asserted on their own, but could command appellate attention if accompanied by a solitary claim that met the substantial showing standard.  This dichotomy lacks rhyme or reason, and there is no indication that Congress intended to create so curious a structure.  The better reading of the habeas amendments is one that links section 2253(c)(3)'s insistence on an issue by issue enumeration of what has been certified for appeal with the substantial showing requirement of section 2253(c)(2).  We hold, therefore, that a court of appeals should not consider the merits of an issue advanced by a habeas petitioner unless a COA first has been obtained with respect to that issue.

Under the AEDPA amendments, however, a habeas petitioner who fails in his effort to obtain a COA in the district court may then beseech the court of appeals to issue one.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)(1) (\"If the district judge has denied the certificate, the applicant for the writ may then request issuance of the certificate by a circuit judge.\").  The procedure for cases in which the district court does not grant a COA at all is uncontroversial:  even if there is no express request for a COA, the court of appeals must deem a notice of appeal to represent a request for a COA on all issues raised.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)(1)-(2).  The rules are silent, however, with respect to the appropriate procedure in hybrid cases.  Thus, we must decide what course a habeas petitioner should follow when the district court certifies some, but not all, of the issues that he wishes to vent on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court issues a limited COA (i.e., a COA that permits the petitioner to go forward on fewer than all of the issues raised in his petition), the petitioner must present promptly to the court of appeals an express request for a complementary COA.  Although this court's local rules do not definitively resolve the timing issue, it is our present practice to notify each habeas petitioner of an outside date by which his request for a COA must be filed in the court of appeals.  Failure to file within that interval may be deemed to constitute a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request for a complementary COA must be explicit as to the issues which the petitioner wishes us to consider and, in such circumstances, we will not treat an inexplicit notice of appeal, without more, as an invitation to review the district court's denial of certification with regard to the petitioner's remaining claims.  In taking this stance, we adopt the rule stated in United States v. Kimler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756463\"><a href=\"/opinion/756463/united-states-v-kenneth-karl-kimler/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span>, 430 (5th Cir.1998) (declaring that a notice of appeal in a multi-issue habeas case will not be treated as a constructive request for expanding a limited COA issued by the district court), and reject the rule stated in Kincade v. Sparkman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743092\"><a href=\"/opinion/743092/james-r-kincade-v-emmit-l-sparkman-warden-commonwealth-of-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">949</span></a></span>, 953 (6th Cir.1997) (treating a notice of appeal in a hybrid case as \"an informal request with this Court to review the district Court's denial as to [the petitioner's] remaining claims\").  We make one related point:  the request for a complementary COA, whether contained in a separate document or incorporated into the notice of appeal, should be accompanied by a copy of the district court's order and a memorandum giving specific and substantial reasons (not mere generalizations) why a certificate should be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interests of fairness and judicial economy, we also rule that, when the district court grants a limited COA and the petitioner seasonably seeks to expand it, his appeal on the certified issue(s) should be held in abeyance, and full briefing deferred, until this court determines the appealability of the issues that the district court deemed unworthy of appellate scrutiny (and, thus, whether we will issue a complementary COA).  Accord Kimler, 150 F.3d at 431 n. 1;  Kincade, 117 F.3d at 953;  United States v. Simmonds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739742\"><a href=\"/opinion/739742/united-states-v-christopher-simmonds/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 740-41 (10th Cir.1997).  As an administrative measure, we advise litigants that, to the extent practicable, the panel that determines whether to issue a complementary COA also will be the panel that adjudicates the appeal on the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aware that a few cases are pending in which, as here, a motions judge has adopted an ad hoc framework for handling situations in which a district court, over a habeas petitioner's objection, issued a limited COA.  Such actions were entirely appropriate in the absence of a definitive resolution of the attendant procedural questions.  We will, of course, allow those appeals to proceed in the ordinary course, under the terms of the provisional orders previously entered.  In future cases, however, we will require habeas petitioners to walk the procedural path that we set in place today.  We regard the instant case as grandfathered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court issued a COA restricted to the Sixth Amendment issue, the petitioner's able counsel timely filed a notice of appeal and contemporaneously submitted an application to the district court to enlarge the COA to encompass the Fifth Amendment claim.  When no amended certificate emerged, counsel sought a complementary COA in this court.  We entered an order, previously described, directing the petitioner, inter alia, to brief his Fifth Amendment claim on the merits.  Reading the new habeas amendments literally, we next should consider whether the petitioner has made a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\" in respect to this Fifth Amendment point.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(2).  Here, however, under the terms of our interim order, the parties have fully briefed and argued the merits of that claim.  Since we decline to take two steps where one will do, we skip the preliminary \"substantial showing\" inquiry and turn directly to the merits.  We caution, however, that this expedient departs from the norm, and we employ it here solely because of the terms of the interim order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim has its genesis in a 30-minute conversation between him and the police conducted shortly after his arrest.  The facts surrounding the interview, derived primarily from a police report, are not in dispute.  When the authorities arrested the petitioner on August 18, 1990, they gave him Miranda warnings in his native language (Vietnamese).  The petitioner acknowledged that he understood his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before interviewing the petitioner, the police again advised him of his rights, this time in both English and Vietnamese.  In response, the petitioner proclaimed that he knew his rights, that \"my Constitution will protect me,\" and that \"you have nothing.\"   When an officer asked if he had anything to say about why he was being arrested, the petitioner replied in the negative.  Then--before the officer posed another question--he inquired:  \"Who said I did this?\"   The petitioner thereafter answered some questions, while brushing others aside.  The interview ended when he declined to respond to a query asking what he had \"to say about what happened around [the time of the murders].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the state trial court had refused to suppress the interview, a number of the petitioner's statements were admitted into evidence.  For example, the Commonwealth introduced the petitioner's comment about the gun that had been found in his parents' abode and his remark to the police that \"you have nothing.\"   On direct appeal, the SJC upheld the admissibility of these statements.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 396-97, 645 N.E.2d at 692-93.

This means, he says, that we must grant habeas relief because Davis does not comprise \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" within the purview of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's attempt to characterize Davis as something other than \"clearly established Federal law\" rests on a mistaken premise:  the idea that, merely because Davis does not directly compel the particular outcome reached by the state court, a federal habeas court perforce must issue the writ.  This is a non sequitur.  Under the AEDPA amendments, federal courts review state court judgments to determine whether those judgments construe or apply federal law in a manner that is \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application of\" the Supreme Court's \"clearly established\" jurisprudence.

Although the similarity of the analyses requisite for assessing claims anent Miranda 's right to counsel and its right to remain silent suggests that Davis constitutes strong evidence of how the Supreme Court likely would decide this right to remain silent question, we acknowledge that Davis does not \"authoritatively\" answer the question in the narrow, technical sense of that term.

Under this legal rubric, the petitioner argues, his statement to the effect that \"my Constitution will protect me\" and his negative response to the officer's query anent whether \"he had anything to say about what he was being arrested for\" were, at the very least, equivocal assertions of the right to remain silent, and, therefore, precluded the police from doing more than following up with clarifying questions.

In North Carolina v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span> (1979), the Court made it pellucid that an express statement is not invariably necessary to support a finding that the defendant waived either the right to remain silent or the right to counsel.  We, too, have employed this implied waiver doctrine, see United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598972\"><a href=\"/opinion/598972/united-states-v-jose-a-garcia-united-states-v-pablo-h-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1169 (1st Cir.1993), and it appears to be the primary ground on which the SJC resolved the petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim, see Bui I, 419 Mass. at 397, 645 N.E.2d at 692-93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precisely when waiver may be implied depends on the circumstances.  Even so, there are certain types of cases in which courts routinely conclude that a defendant who has professed an understanding of his right to remain silent has waived that right.  For example, a defendant will be held to have effected a waiver when, after receiving warnings and asserting (equivocally or unequivocally) a right to remain silent, he spontaneously recommences the dialogue with his interviewers.

Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110475\"><a href=\"/opinion/110475/edwards-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 484-85, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110475\"><a href=\"/opinion/110475/edwards-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

So, too, if a defendant's incriminating statements were made either as part of a \"steady stream\" of speech, Bradley v. Meachum, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551286\"><a href=\"/opinion/551286/jonathan-bradley-v-larry-meachum-commissioner-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 342 (2d Cir.1990), or as part of a back-and-forth conversation with the police, Baskin v.

A waiver of Miranda rights also may be implied when, after having received Miranda warnings, a criminal defendant responds selectively to questions posed to him.  See United States v. Soliz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748209\"><a href=\"/opinion/748209/97-cal-daily-op-serv-8595-97-daily-journal-dar-13919-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 503 (9th Cir.1997);  United States v.

In his initial statements, uttered immediately after the second round of Miranda warnings, the petitioner proclaimed that he knew his rights and that the Constitution would protect him.  The petitioner's claim to the contrary notwithstanding, these comments cannot plausibly be construed to suggest that the speaker intended to assert Miranda rights.  In all events, the spontaneous utterance \"you have nothing,\" made immediately after those comments and without any semblance of police provocation, is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.  See Conley, 156 F.3d at 83;  Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146.   Up to this point, the dialogue has the distinct flavor of a back-and-forth conversation between the petitioner and his interviewer.  See, e.g., Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the remainder of the interview lends credence to this impression.  Once the petitioner boasted that the police had nothing, the interviewer legitimately followed up by asking him whether he had something to say about the reasons for his arrest.  The petitioner answered \"no\"--and this is a point at which he now avers the police should have stopped their questioning.  He might have had a stronger argument had he not added anything to his response, see Conley, 156 F.3d at 83, but he then immediately asked the police:  \"who said I did this?\"   The petitioner's continuation of the conversation by means of this question both negated any effect his prior response may have had as an assertion of his right to remain silent and confirmed that the interview was indeed a back-and-forth exchange.  See Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory.  The short of it is that the petitioner did not unequivocally assert his right to remain silent, and, moreover, selectively responded to questions during what otherwise appears to have been a fairly standard two-way conversation with the authorities.  The prosecution thereupon introduced those responses at trial.  If the relevant precedent here is Davis, the petitioner cannot prevail because he made no clear articulation of a desire to stand mute.  If, however, Davis does not apply, the relevant precedent is Butler, and federal courts have on numerous occasions employed its implied waiver principle to uphold the admissibility of evidence under circumstances similar to those presented in this case.  See, e.g., Ramirez, 79 F.3d at 305;  Baskin, 956 F.2d at 146;  Bradley, 918 F.2d at 342;  see generally LaFave &amp; Israel, supra &#167; 6.9(d), at 530-31 (discussing implied waivers).  Either way, the SJC's application of federal law (and, for that matter, the state trial court's determination of subsidiary facts) does not fall outside the sphere of acceptability.  See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE SIXTH AMENDMENT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause to set the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim into perspective.  Thinh was one of two persons who testified that the petitioner admitted involvement in the murders, and one of three who described him brandishing a knife and suggesting that he had used it to commit a crime.  In addition, Thinh recounted important information concerning the petitioner's possession of certain items of jewelry ostensibly belonging to Ngoc Le.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 398-99, 645 N.E.2d at 693 (summarizing Thinh's testimony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner had hoped to impeach Thinh's credibility by developing, inter alia, a rather intricate theory of bias.  In the petitioner's scenario, Thinh and Linh were coerced into testifying falsely by Linh's father, Mong Nguyen, a drug kingpin, who took this action because the petitioner had refused, in the presence of Mong's peers (equally notorious drug lords), to transport drugs.  According to the petitioner, extreme retributive tendencies characterize interpersonal relations in Vietnamese society, and Thinh's rejection so affronted Mong that he exacted revenge by directing his daughter and quondam son-in-law to frame Bui.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the petitioner's counsel first attempted to gather support for this hypothesis by questioning Linh on voir dire, outside the jury's presence.  He drew a blank.  He revisited the subject with Thinh, but the trial judge sustained the prosecution's objections to his initial round of questions.  Counsel thereupon made an offer of proof.  The judge remained steadfast and refused, on relevancy grounds, to allow the attorney to ask the proposed questions.  After the jury convicted the petitioner, the SJC affirmed this evidentiary ruling, finding the petitioner's theory of bias too speculative to justify cross-examination.  See id. at 401, 645 N.E.2d at 694-95.   The Confrontation Clause places a high value on the right to cross-examination.  See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, 678-79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1431</span></a></span>.   Furthermore, a criminal defendant's entitlement to cross-examine a witness increases in sensitivity in direct proportion to the witness's importance to the prosecution's case.  See United States v. Mizell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9453\"><a href=\"/opinion/9453/united-states-v-mizell/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292-93 (5th Cir.1996);  United States v.

Given Thinh's status as a key figure in the prosecution's case, it is readily apparent that the petitioner's claim demands close attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner exhorts us to hold that the Massachusetts courts violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause by prohibiting all inquiry into a cogent bias theory.  Citing cases such as United States v. Lynn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511571\"><a href=\"/opinion/511571/united-states-v-steven-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 433 (1st Cir.1988), he maintains that the trial court's actions violated the general rule requiring courts to permit a threshold level of cross-examination on bias and, thus, the SJC's holding was \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court precedent.  We reject this plaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Speaking in the large, the jurisprudence of the Confrontation Clause rarely lends itself to Procrustean application, see O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 26, and the case law simply does not state the \"threshold level of inquiry\" rule in terms as absolute as the petitioner would have it.  Indeed, the Van Arsdall Court explicitly recognized that, under certain circumstances, trial judges possess broad discretion to limit cross-examination.  See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1431</span></a></span> (enumerating various factors that may justify circumscription of cross-examination).  Thus, to the extent that the petitioner is suggesting that a criminal defendant has license to cross-question a prosecution witness concerning every conceivable theory of bias, regardless of the prevailing circumstances, he is plainly wrong.  The threshold requirement imposed by the Confrontation Clause is satisfied as long as the defendant is given a fair chance to inquire into a witness's bias.  See United States v.

A criminal defendant is not regarded as being deprived of that chance if a trial court legitimately determines that his cross-examination is inappropriate.

The petitioner cross-examined Thinh at length with respect to bias, and the trial court based its restriction of further cross-examination on relevancy grounds--something Van Arsdall, in principle, expressly permits.  Thus, we must test the propriety of the Massachusetts courts' conclusions by asking whether forbidding further cross-questioning represented an unreasonable application of the Supreme Court's Confrontation Clause precedents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).  In itself, this is not a surprising development:  when a constitutional claim requires balancing rather than applying a strict, one-dimensional legal rule, that ordinarily is an indication that a habeas court, in the end, will have to gauge the reasonableness of the state court's application of the rule.

In order for a federal court to conclude that a state court has applied federal law reasonably, it is not necessary that the federal court agree with every last detail of the state court's analysis.  By like token, state courts are not required to supply the specific reasons that a federal court thinks are most persuasive for upholding the judgment.  Rather, it suffices that the state court generally articulates and applies tenets that can reasonably sustain its judgment.  Thus, the question on habeas corpus review is whether the state courts' invocation and reliance on enunciated legal principles are reasonably consistent with the facts, circumstances, and outcome of the case.  See, e.g., Hennon, 109 F.3d at 335 (\"It doesn't follow that the criterion of a reasonable determination is whether it is well reasoned.  It is not.  It is whether the determination is at least minimally consistent with the facts and circumstances of the case.\").  Were we to insist on perfect jurisprudential harmony, not only would we risk defying Congress's will by transforming the AEDPA standard into one of plenary review, but we also would place ourselves in a position in which we might invalidate convictions not because a \"defendant may have been the victim [ ] of [a] constitutional error but merely of a failure of judicial articulateness.\"  Id. The logic of the AEDPA is flatly inconsistent with such an approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of these background principles, we turn to the SJC's determination that the petitioner was not entitled to inquire along the line that he proposed.  As we already have observed, cross-examination is subject to reasonable restrictions.  One well-established basis for circumscribing cross-examination is a party's inability to lay a proper evidentiary foundation for the questions that he wishes to pose.  See, e.g., United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195633\"><a href=\"/opinion/195633/united-states-v-ovalle-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 218-19 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Carty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607110\"><a href=\"/opinion/607110/united-states-v-ralph-h-carty/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1010 (1st Cir.1993).  The SJC relied upon this principle to conclude that the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim lacked merit.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 401, 645 N.E.2d at 694-95 (holding that the petitioner's offer of proof was too tenuous to justify the desired inquiry).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the offer of proof.  It prophesied that Thinh, if allowed to answer the proposed questions, would acknowledge that the petitioner rebuffed Mong's entreaty to ferry narcotics from California to Boston.  Defense counsel purposed to argue from this response that the repudiation so angered Mong that he directed Thinh to frame the petitioner.  But to that point in the trial, there had been no evidence even remotely supporting the petitioner's offer of proof.  When the court inquired into the predicate for the offer, counsel did not cite any evidence, but replied instead that he had a good-faith basis founded on attorney-client privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On this exiguous record, the mere invocation of the petitioner as the source was not enough to negate the inherent speculativeness of the offer, especially since the petitioner neither testified at trial nor submitted an affidavit as part of the proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to assume, as did the state trial court, that petitioner had made a good-faith proffer, we still could not conclude that the SJC's determination that the offer of proof was unsatisfactory so offended existing Supreme Court precedent as to be unreasonable.  Apart from its foundational infirmities, the petitioner's offer of proof was inherently defective because it did not include crucial elements of his bias theory.  He sought to ask Thinh three questions:  (1) Was Mong present in California while Thinh and the petitioner were there?  (2) Did Mong ever ask the petitioner to transport drugs to Boston?  (3) If so, did the petitioner refuse?   However, we agree with the SJC that the petitioner's theory of bias had more components than could be addressed by responsive answers to these three questions.  See Bui I, 419 Mass. at 401-02, 645 N.E.2d at 695.   It ultimately depended on demonstrating facts relating to matters such as the relationship between Mong and the petitioner, the relationship between Mong and Thinh, the presence (and identity) of others in the course of the alleged repudiation, and the tenor of Mong's reaction.  Neither the proposed questions nor the petitioner's offer of proof touched upon these issues.  On this sparse record, both the trial court's limitation on cross-examination and the SJC's affirmance on the ground that the offer of proof was too tenuous were in conformity with federal court precedents requiring a satisfactory evidentiary foundation for cross-questioning, see, e.g., Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d at 218-19;  Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010, and thus neither decision implicated the AEDPA standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

If anything, the facts of Lynn highlight one of the main shortcomings of the petitioner's offer of proof.  Lynn exemplifies those cases in which courts have disapproved restrictions on questioning about bias when cross-examination seeks to probe whether a prosecution witness will get preferential treatment from law enforcement in return for testifying.  In these instances, courts have been especially open to permitting cross-examination about agreements between government and witness.  In the same vein, courts have recognized, albeit less frequently, that similarly distorting influences may arise from other innately coercive relationships.  See, e.g., United States v. Abel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111285\"><a href=\"/opinion/111285/united-states-v-abel/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111285\"><a href=\"/opinion/111285/united-states-v-abel/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.   Where there is no evidence of a coercive dimension in the relationship between a witness and an organization, trial courts cast well within their discretion in prohibiting cross-examiners from mounting fishing expeditions.  See Sinclair, 109 F.3d at 1537;  United States v. Elkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707655\"><a href=\"/opinion/707655/united-states-v-douglas-elkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83-84 (10th Cir.1995);  United States v.

Here, the singularly essential element of the petitioner's theory--a relationship of coercion between a person purportedly interested in the outcome of the trial (Mong) and the witness (Thinh)--utterly lacked an evidentiary foundation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Indeed, the petitioner made no attempt to address this element in his offer of proof or contemporaneously in some other fashion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Under these circumstances, we do not believe the petitioner can rely on Lynn to undo the SJC's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In performing our Confrontation Clause analysis in this case, we find the opinion in United States v. Lin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730818\"><a href=\"/opinion/730818/united-states-v-hung-shun-lin-aka-chang-wu/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1996), to be particularly instructive because that case presented circumstances comparable to those that surround this case.  There, the defendant sought to assail the government's witnesses by suggesting that they were testifying against him because they worked for a competing gambling parlor and wanted him out of the way.  When Lin attempted to cross-examine one witness by inquiring into his gambling activities, the government objected and the district court requested a proffer.  Defense counsel made an offer of proof that limned his theory of bias and identified his client as the source of the allegations.  The trial court eventually sustained the government's objection.  The court of appeals affirmed, upholding the trial court's decision not to allow the initiation of \"a highly prejudicial line of cross-examination,\" in circumstances in which the questioner did not show that he possessed facts sufficient to \"support a genuine belief that the witness committed the offense or the degrading act to which the questioning relates.\"  Id. at 768 (citation and internal quotations marks omitted).  Like Bui, Lin elected not to testify, and the court viewed his proffer as \"too ambiguous\" to indicate that the proposed questioning had any realistic potential for showing bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of the principles that animated Lin are pertinent to the case at hand.  First and foremost, Lin, like so many of the precedents we have culled, holds that cross-examination presupposes the existence of a proper foundation.  Offers of proof that do not carry the promise of demonstrating bias do not satisfy this requirement;  indeed, such offers may be considered irrelevant.  See Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.   Furthermore, in Lin as in this case, the trial court left open the possibility that witnesses could be recalled and the line of inquiry reopened if the defense subsequently made a better proffer.  Like Lin, Bui never returned with a beefed-up presentation.  Finally, as Lin suggests, questions that implicate a witness's involvement in elaborate conspiracies to commit illegal acts have the potential to be prejudicial and misleading.  And when the potential for this kind of prejudice exists, the need to insist that cross-examination be based on a solid foundation is heightened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to deflect this logic, the petitioner seizes upon the trial judge's comment that the questions his lawyer sought to ask were irrelevant (and thus inadmissible).  This assessment was misguided, the petitioner says, because the general issue of bias is always relevant.  See Davis v. Alaska, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 316, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (1974).  We are unimpressed by this wordplay.  In context, we interpret the trial judge's relevancy ruling to mean that, given the scantiness of the record evidence and the incomplete offer of proof, the petitioner's proposed questions were not sufficiently probative of his particular theory of bias, and, therefore, not relevant to that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear.  We do not mean to suggest that a criminal defendant must testify in his own behalf, or alternatively, that he must arm himself with irrefutable proof before he may cross-examine witnesses about a particular bias.  We do believe, however, that a defendant in such circumstances must present a satisfactory foundation for the critical elements on which his hypothesis of bias depends.  In this instance, the petitioner, having been accorded a fair opportunity to inquire into Thinh's bias, failed to meet that criterion.  Hence, we cannot fault the trial judge's decision to bar the petitioner from asking Thinh all the specified questions.  See Delaware v. Fensterer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111535\"><a href=\"/opinion/111535/delaware-v-fensterer/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111535\"><a href=\"/opinion/111535/delaware-v-fensterer/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See O'Brien, 145 F.3d at 25;  see also Hennon, 109 F.3d at 335 (stating that, under AEDPA, state courts are no longer in a \"tutelary relation\" with federal courts).  Thus, absent a controlling Supreme Court precedent, mere disagreement with a state court's legal analysis is not enough to permit a federal court to vacate a state conviction;  rather, it must be shown that the state court's application of federal law was unreasonable.

The SJC's analysis regarding the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim clears the bar because it comports with the approach taken by the courts of appeals in numerous cases raising comparable scenarios.  When, as now, a petitioner can show only that rational minds might differ over how to apply certain general constitutional principles to the specific circumstances of his case, the current habeas corpus standard of review does not allow a federal court to invalidate a state conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The petitioner fails to convince us that the SJC's holdings are contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent.  Accordingly, the judgment below must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioner also has raised a third contention, in the nature of a generalized due process claim based on the Constitution's guarantee to criminal defendants of \"a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\"  Crane v. Kentucky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span>, 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span> (1986).  The protections of the Sixth Amendment are themselves specific means through which the Constitution realizes the aforementioned guarantee.  See id.;   see also Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 684-685, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984).  If the petitioner's due process claim rested on a factual predicate that was not amenable to conventional Sixth Amendment analysis, such as the circumstances presented in Crane or in California v. Trombetta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111206\"><a href=\"/opinion/111206/california-v-trombetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111206\"><a href=\"/opinion/111206/california-v-trombetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span> (1984), we would not hesitate to consider this claim separately.  Here, however, the due process claim relies entirely on the factual predicate of the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim.  Because there is a virtually complete overlap between the Sixth Amendment and due process claims, we need only discuss the former</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure authorize COA determinations to be made by two, or even one, circuit judges.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)(2) (stating that COA requests addressed to the court of appeals \"may be considered by a circuit judge or judges, as the court prescribes\").  Some courts of appeals have exercised that authority.  See, e.g., In re Certificates of Appealability, 106 F.3d at 1307.   This circuit has opted, at least for the time being, to commit all such determinations to three-judge panels</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the SJC did not cite to Davis, its reference to the \"ambiguous\" nature of the petitioner's assertion of his Fifth Amendment rights, see Bui I, 419 Mass. at 397 n. 4, 645 N.E.2d at 693 n. 4, meshes neatly with the district court's rationale</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Two courts, recognizing a possible theoretical distinction between the right to counsel and the right to remain silent, have left the issue open.  See Evans v. Demosthenes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728150\"><a href=\"/opinion/728150/96-cal-daily-op-serv-7836-96-daily-journal-dar-12980-michael-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span>, 1176 (9th Cir.1996);  United States v.

To the extent that the petitioner calumnizes the district court's reliance on Davis as improperly importing Sixth Amendment principles into the Fifth Amendment context, he is barking up the wrong tree.  Davis did not deal with the Sixth Amendment, but, rather, with the Fifth Amendment right to counsel articulated in Miranda.   See Davis, 512 U.S. at 457-58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117863\"><a href=\"/opinion/117863/davis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Davis v. Alaska, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 316, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (1974).  As we explain below, our review of the record convinces us that the petitioner misconstrues the trial court's ruling and that the \"contrary to\" prong of the AEDPA standard is not implicated here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In his principal brief on appeal, the petitioner now suggests that he had supported his theory by evidence that Mong was Thinh's father-in-law;  that Mong, Thinh, and Bui had been together in California shortly after the murders;  that Thinh had previously been convicted of a drug offense;  and that autopsy reports showed that one of the victims had cocaine in her blood.  This evidence says nothing about Mong's interest or role in framing the petitioner.  Moreover, under the AEDPA standard of review, such a shaky evidentiary foundation would not permit us to discredit the reasonableness of the SJC's conclusions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The trial judge's earlier refusal to permit the petitioner to cross-examine one of the police officers who had investigated the murders about Mong's criminal history does not fill this void.  For one thing, the petitioner does not challenge this ruling on appeal.  For another thing, the attempted cross-examination was not in any way tied either to Thinh's cross-examination or to the petitioner's offer of proof</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The petitioner suggests that two items of evidence sufficed to close this gap.  He says, first, that the idea that Mong would not endanger his daughter and Thinh becomes \"laughable\" when we consider that the latter sometimes sold drugs on Mong's behalf, and second, that in order to understand the reactions of an irate Vietnamese drug lord, we need only refer to a Massachusetts state trooper's testimony that the Vietnamese community is \"closed\" and \"in part controlled by intimidation and retribution.\"   We are unpersuaded by these suggestions.  With respect to the first matter, even if we assume, contrary to the established record, that there was evidence that Mong and Thinh were collaborators in the drug trade, the mere fact that Thinh at one unspecified time may have sold drugs for Mong says little about the existence of coercion, let alone its nature or whether that coercion was continuing.  As for the police officer's testimony (which the petitioner thoroughly mischaracterizes), we decline this invitation to arrive at a legal conclusion based on nothing more than an invidious stereotype of the members of an ethnic community</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
