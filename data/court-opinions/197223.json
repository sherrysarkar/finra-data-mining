Ultimately,  the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt  disallowed  the   exemption  claim,  the   district  court\r\n\naffirmed, and Edmonston appealed.  \r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          As the facts  are not  in dispute, we  conduct de  novo\r                                                                           \r\n\nreview of the conclusions of law challenged on appeal.

Edmonston duly claimed the residence exempt, see Bankruptcy Code &#167; 522(b)(2)(B);  Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 209, &#167; 1, estimated its value at $200,000, and indicated that he and his nondebtor spouse were jointly obligated under the $59,000 real estate mortgage and for unsecured indebtedness totaling at least $10,000.  In due course the chapter 7 trustee objected to the exemption claim and Edmonston responded by contesting both the merits of the objection and the trustee's \"standing\" to assert it.  Ultimately, the bankruptcy court disallowed the exemption claim, the district court affirmed, and Edmonston appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the facts are not in dispute, we conduct de novo review of the conclusions of law challenged on appeal.

See Napotnik v. Equibank &amp; Parkvale Sav. Assoc., 679 F.2d 316, 318 (3d Cir.1982) (\"Since property law in general and the law of co-tenancies in particular are creatures of state law, the 'applicable nonbankruptcy law' is the applicable [state] law of tenancy by the entirety.\").  Commonwealth law provides that \"[t]he interest of a debtor spouse in property held as tenants by the entirety shall not be subject to seizure by a creditor of such debtor spouse so long as such property is the principal residence of the nondebtor spouse.\"  Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 209, &#167; 1 (1987) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Thus, a creditor with a claim against both tenants by the entirety (\"joint creditor\") may reach and apply the entireties property.  See Coraccio v. Lowell Five Cents Sav. Bank, 415 Mass. 145, 612 N.E.2d 650, 654 (1993) (\"Nor, by virtue of G.L. c. 209, &#167; 1, may a creditor of either seize the principal residence absent the joint signature of the spouses.\");  In re McConchie, 94 B.R. 245, 247 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988) (\"[T]he property is free from levy and execution from [sic] the creditor of one spouse if the debts are not joint or for necessaries.\").  Accordingly, the present exemption claim is unsupported by Commonwealth law to the extent Edmonston and his nondebtor spouse were jointly indebted.  See, e.g., Sumy v. Schlossberg, 777 F.2d 921, 928 (4th Cir.1985) (\"A debtor does not lose all benefit of &#167; 522(b)(2)(B) when joint creditors are present, but he does not benefit from it to the extent of joint claims.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, an exemption claim becomes effective by operation of law absent a cognizable objection.

Since no joint creditor objected to Edmonston's exemption claim within the allotted time, the present appeal cannot succeed unless the chapter 7 trustee qualifies as a \"party in interest\" within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code &#167; 522(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it clear that Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b)--itself \"derived from &#167; 522(l) of the Code,\" Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4003, Advisory Committee Note--authoritatively defines the section 522(l) term \"party in interest,\" by explicitly stating that the \"trustee or any creditor may file objections to the list of property claimed as exempt.\"  Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4003(b) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Moreover, the position we make explicit today simply gives voice to the longstanding, implicit acknowledgement that a chapter 7 trustee is a \"party in interest\" within the meaning of section 522(l).

Edmonston duly claimed the residence exempt, see Bankruptcy Code &#167; 522(b)(2)(B);  Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 209, &#167; 1, estimated its value at $200,000, and indicated that he and his nondebtor spouse were jointly obligated under the $59,000 real estate mortgage and for unsecured indebtedness totaling at least $10,000.  In due course the chapter 7 trustee objected to the exemption claim and Edmonston responded by contesting both the merits of the objection and the trustee's \"standing\" to assert it.
