Concluding, as we\r\n\ndo,  that  an  administrative  sanction imposed  by  the  Federal\r\n\nDeposit   Insurance   Corporation   (FDIC)   does   not  comprise\r\n\n\"punishment\" within  the purview  of the  Clause,  we uphold  the\r\n\ndistrict court's denial of  a motion to dismiss  criminal charges\r\n\nlater lodged against the same individual.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Following chronological order,  we recount the  details\r\n\nof the  administrative proceeding  and then discuss  the criminal\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n                A.  The Administrative Proceeding.\r                          A.  The Administrative Proceeding.\r                                                           \r\n\n          From  1975  to  1990,  defendant-appellant   Robert  S.\r\n\nStoller  toiled as  the chief  executive officer of  the Coolidge\r\n\nCorner Cooperative Bank  (the Bank).   In 1986,  the Bank  became\r\n\nfederally insured.   Thereafter, Stoller caused it to  make loans\r\n\nto several  real estate trusts with which he was affiliated.  The\r\n\nloans soured and the Bank sustained heavy losses.\r\n\n          In 1990,  the FDIC  instituted  a debarment  proceeding\r\n\nagainst Stoller.   The FDIC  charged, and  an administrative  law\r\n\njudge (ALJ)  found, that  the Bank  underwrote the suspect  loans\r\n\nwithout appropriate disclosure and  in violation of Regulation O,\r\n\n12  C.F.R.    215  (a  rule  that caps  the  amount  of credit  a\r\n\nfederally insured institution may  extend to insiders and imposes\r\n\nlending limits on other extensions of credit).  The ALJ concluded\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthat   Stoller's  transgressions   demonstrated  a   willful  and\r\n\npersistent  disregard for  the  Bank's  soundness, and  therefore\r\n\nwarranted an  order of proscription  under 12 U.S.C.    1818(e).1\r\n\nOn  administrative review,  the  FDIC's board  of directors  (the\r\n\nBoard) affirmed the ALJ's factual determinations and approved his\r\n\nrecommended  order.     Stoller  requested   reconsideration  and\r\n\nclarification.  On September 22, 1992, the Board issued a revised\r\n\ndecision upholding the debarment  order in slightly altered form:\r\n\nin  its  final version,  the order  prevents  Stoller (who  is an\r\n\nattorney) from  serving as an officer or  director of, exercising\r\n\ncontrol  over, or  acting as  counsel to,  any federally  insured\r\n\nfinancial institution.\r\n\n                      B.  The Criminal Case.\r                                B.  The Criminal Case.\r                                                     \r\n\n          In January 1995, a  federal grand jury indicted Stoller\r\n\nfor  divers violations  of federal  banking laws,  including nine\r\n\ncounts of misapplying bank funds, see 18 U.S.C.   656; thirty-one\r                                               \r\n\ncounts of unlawfully receiving loan-procurement  commissions, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.    215; and eight counts  of making false entries,  see id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1005.  Stoller promptly moved to dismiss the first nine counts of\r\n\nthe indictment  on double jeopardy  grounds.  The  district court\r\n\ndenied the  motion, concluding that  the debarment order  did not\r\n\nconstitute punishment in the  relevant constitutional sense.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v. Stoller, 906 F. Supp. 39 (D. Mass. 1995).  This\r                                   \r\n\nappeal followed.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1This  statute and  the  criminal statutes  underpinning the\r\nlater indictment are reprinted in the appendix.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\r          II.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\r\n\n          As  a  general  rule,  federal  appellate  courts  have\r\n\njurisdiction  only over  final orders  and judgments  of district\r\n\ncourts,  and not over interlocutory  decisions.  See  28 U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n1291.   In  Abney  v. United  States, 431  U.S.  651 (1977),  the\r                                              \r\n\nSupreme  Court carved  an  exception to  this  rule for  pretrial\r\n\nrefusals to dismiss criminal  charges on double jeopardy grounds.\r\n\nEmphasizing  that  the Double  Jeopardy  Clause  is a  \"guarantee\r\n\nagainst being twice  put to trial  for the same offense,\"  id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n661,  the Court  held that \"pretrial  orders rejecting  claims of\r\n\nformer  jeopardy .  .  . constitute  `final  decisions' and  thus\r\n\nsatisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites of   1291,\" id. at 662.\r                                                                  \r\n\n          It is possible to read too much into Abney.  The Double\r                                                              \r\n\nJeopardy Clause states that no person \"shall . . . be subject for\r\n\nthe same  offence to be twice  put in jeopardy of  life or limb.\"\r\n\nU.S.  Const.  amend.  V.   This  protection  is  threefold:   \"it\r\n\nsafeguards an individual against (1) a second prosecution for the\r\n\nsame offense,  following an  acquittal; (2) a  second prosecution\r\n\nfor the same  offense, following a  conviction; and (3)  multiple\r\n\npunishments  for the  same offense.\"   United  States v.  Rivera-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMartinez,  931 F.2d 148, 152  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 502 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n862 (1991).    Abney  spoke to  a  situation  involving  multiple\r                              \r\n\nprosecutions.   Cases that involve multiple  punishments arguably\r\n\nraise different jurisdictional concerns for appellate courts.\r\n\n          In  United States  v. Ramirez-Burgos,  44 F.3d  17 (1st\r                                                        \r\n\nCir. 1995), this court dismissed an interlocutory appeal stemming\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nfrom the rejection  of a multiple  punishments claim asserted  in\r\n\nconnection with parallel counts contained in a single indictment.\r\n\nSee id. at  18.  We  ruled that the  defendant's right not to  be\r                 \r\n\npunished   twice  could  be   vindicated  adequately   through  a\r\n\nsubsequent,   end-of-case   appeal,   and   distinguished   those\r\n\ninterlocutory  double jeopardy  appeals (like Abney)  that demand\r                                                             \r\n\nfinal resolution prior to trial because  the defendant advances a\r\n\nclaim alleging  impermissible multiple prosecutions.   See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n18-19.\r\n\n          Stoller's   case  falls  somewhere  between  Abney  and\r                                                                      \r\n\nRamirez-Burgos.  Unlike in Abney, his double jeopardy claim rests\r                                          \r\n\non the prospect of  multiple punishments rather than the  fear of\r\n\nmultiple  prosecutions.   Unlike in Ramirez-Burgos,  however, the\r                                                            \r\n\nalleged multiple punishments arise in the course  of two separate\r\n\nand   successive  proceedings   rather  than   within  a   single\r\n\nproceeding.  To complicate matters further,  the fate of Ramirez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBurgos  is  uncertain in  light  of  the  Supreme Court's  recent\r                \r\n\ndecision  in Witte  v. United  States, 115  S. Ct.  2199 (1995).2\r                                               \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2In Witte, the defendant  moved to dismiss an indictment  on\r                        \r\nthe  ground that the conduct underlying it had already been taken\r\ninto account  when he was  sentenced on a  previous charge.   The\r\ndefendant argued that the prosecution of the new charge subjected\r\nhim  to multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of\r\nthe double jeopardy guarantee.  See Witte, 115 S. Ct. at 2204-05.\r                                                   \r\nHe  convinced  the  district  court  but  the  court  of  appeals\r\nreversed.   25 F.3d 250, 252 (5th Cir. 1994).  On certiorari, the\r\nSupreme Court declared the claim to be \"ripe at this stage of the\r\nprosecution   although petitioner  has not yet been convicted  of\r\nthe [second charge]    because, as we have said,  `courts may not\r\nimpose  more  than  one  punishment  for  the  same  offense  and\r\nprosecutors ordinarily may not  attempt to secure that punishment\r\nin more than one  trial.'\"  115 S. Ct. at  2205 (quoting Brown v.\r                                                                        \r\nOhio, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977)).\r              \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nAlthough Witte and Ramirez-Burgos  can perhaps be reconciled, the\r                                           \r\n\nmost  obvious  basis  for  harmonizing   them     the  number  of\r\n\nproceedings  involved    would, if  accepted, remove  this appeal\r\n\nfrom the reach of Ramirez-Burgos.  Moreover, at least one circuit\r                                          \r\n\nhas observed that, under Witte, all double  jeopardy appeals that\r                                        \r\n\nraise nonfrivolous  multiple punishments  arguments  must now  be\r\n\nconsidered  ripe  for immediate  review.   See  United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBaird, 63 F.3d 1213, 1215 &amp; n.4 (3d Cir. 1995), cert. denied,    \r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct.     (1996).\r\n\n          We elect to  detour around this Serbonian bog.  It is a\r\n\nfamiliar  tenet that  when  an appeal  presents a  jurisdictional\r\n\nquandary, yet  the merits of  the underlying  issue, if  reached,\r\n\nwill  in any event be resolved in  favor of the party challenging\r\n\nthe  court's  jurisdiction,  then   the  court  may  forsake  the\r\n\njurisdictional  riddle and  simply dispose  of the appeal  on the\r\n\nmerits.   See  Norton v.  Mathews, 427  U.S. 524,  530-31 (1976);\r                                           \r\n\nSecretary of the Navy v.

We  follow  that course,  leaving  for another  day  the\r\n\nquestions surrounding the continued vitality of Ramirez-Burgos.\r                                                                        \r\n\nIII.  THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAIM\r          III.  THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAIM\r\n\n          We confine our discussion to  the branch of the  Double\r\n\nJeopardy  Clause  that  embodies  the  constitutional  protection\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nagainst multiple  punishments.3  Though our  analysis proceeds in\r\n\nthree segments, we pause  at the brink to acknowledge a few well-\r\n\nestablished principles.\r\n\n          First,  though  former  jeopardy  is  a   criminal  law\r\n\nconcept, it is by now settled  that, if other conditions are met,\r\n\neither criminal prosecutions  or civil proceedings  instituted by\r\n\nthe  same  sovereign  may  result  in  punishment  sufficient  to\r\n\nimplicate the  Double  Jeopardy Clause.    See United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHalper,  490 U.S.  435,  443  (1989).    Second,  not  all  civil\r                \r\n\nsanctions constitute cognizable  punishment.   To separate  wheat\r\n\nfrom chaff, an  inquiring court must scrutinize  a civil sanction\r\n\nobjectively rather  than subjectively for,  from the  defendant's\r\n\nstandpoint,   \"even  remedial   sanctions  carry  the   sting  of\r\n\npunishment.\"  Id. at 447 n.7.  Third, as long as a civil sanction\r                           \r\n\nconstitutes punishment  in the relevant sense, it does not matter\r\n\nif the \"multiple\" punishment    presumably a criminal  sentence  \r\n\nprecedes  the attempt to  impose the sanction,  or conversely, if\r\n\nthe  sanction  precedes the  attempt  to  convict the  defendant.\r\n\nNotwithstanding the  difference in sequence,  the Double Jeopardy\r\n\nClause  reaches both situations.  See United States v. Hudson, 14\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 536, 540 (10th Cir. 1994);  United States v.

Since he did not raise this  theory below, we will\r\nnot waste time on it  now.  See United States v. Slade,  980 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n27,  30 (1st Cir. 1992).   In all  events, the belated contention\r\nadds nothing of consequence to Stoller's asseverational array.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          These  principles  help  courts to  solve  the  routine\r\n\nquestions  that are posed when civil sanctions are alleged to run\r\n\nafoul  of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Nevertheless, when a court\r\n\nconfronts  the task  of determining  the status  of  a particular\r\n\ncivil  penalty   under   double  jeopardy   analysis,   extremely\r\n\nsophisticated  questions can  sometimes  arise.   The answers  to\r\n\nthose  questions may depend on the trilogy of Supreme Court cases\r\n\nto which we now repair.\r\n\n                         A.  The Trilogy.\r                                   A.  The Trilogy.\r                                                  \r\n\n          The  seminal  case is  Halper.    There the  government\r                                                 \r\n\nsuccessfully prosecuted criminal charges against a physician who,\r\n\nit asserted, had defrauded the federal Medicare program on sixty-\r\n\nfive separate occasions.  The judge imposed a prison sentence and\r\n\na fine.  See Halper, 490 U.S. at 437.  Thereafter, the government\r                             \r\n\nbrought  a civil suit against  Dr. Halper under  the False Claims\r\n\nAct,  31 U.S.C.    3729-3730,  seeking to recover  damages plus a\r\n\npenalty equal to $2,000 per violation.  The district judge, after\r\n\ncontrasting the extent of the  government's claim for these items\r\n\n($131,170) with the provable amount of the loss occasioned by Dr.\r\n\nHalper's defalcations  ($585),  awarded the  government  $16,000.\r\n\nThe  judge  reasoned that  a more  munificent  award would  be so\r\n\ndisproportionate as to constitute  punishment and would therefore\r\n\nraise double jeopardy questions.  See Halper, 490 U.S. at 438-39.\r                                                      \r\n\nThe Supreme Court  ultimately accepted  this reasoning,4  finding\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The Court did not affirm, but instead vacated the award and\r\nremanded  for a  more precise  determination of  the government's\r\nactual loses.  See Halper, 490 U.S. at 452.\r                                   \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ndouble  jeopardy to be a matter of concern \"where a fixed-penalty\r\n\nprovision  subjects   a[n]  .   .  .   offender  to   a  sanction\r\n\noverwhelmingly disproportionate to  the damages  he has  caused.\"\r\n\nId. at 449.\r             \r\n\n          The  Halper  Court  offered  some  insights  into  when\r                               \r\n\nparticular civil  penalties might  be regarded as  punishments in\r\n\nthe  relevant  sense.   Making such  a determination  \"requires a\r\n\nparticularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes\r\n\nthe penalty may fairly be said to  serve.  Simply put, a civil as\r\n\nwell  as  a criminal  sanction  constitutes  punishment when  the\r\n\nsanction  as applied in the  individual case serves  the goals of\r\n\npunishment.\"   Id. at  448.  Withal,  Halper did not  brand every\r                                                      \r\n\nmonetary penalty exceeding actual  financial loss as punitive per\r\n\nse.   To the  contrary, the Court stated  that \"the Government is\r\n\nentitled  to  rough  remedial justice,  that  is,  it  may demand\r\n\ncompensation according  to somewhat  imprecise formulas,  such as\r\n\nreasonable liquidated damages or a fixed sum plus double damages,\r\n\nwithout  being deemed to have imposed a second punishment for the\r\n\npurpose of  double jeopardy analysis.\"   Id. at 446.   It is only\r                                                      \r\n\nwhen  the  recovery is  \"not rationally  related  to the  goal of\r\n\nmaking  the  Government  whole\"  that the  prospect  of  multiple\r\n\npunishment looms.   Id. at 451.   It is in this  context that the\r                                 \r\n\nHalper dichotomy surfaced:  Justice Blackmun wrote  that \"a civil\r                \r\n\nsanction  that cannot fairly be  said solely to  serve a remedial\r\n\npurpose,  but rather can only be explained as also serving either\r\n\nretributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nto understand the term.\"  Id. at 448.\r                                       \r\n\n          In Austin v.

After  deciding that the Excessive Fines\r\n\nClause, U.S.  Const.  amend.  VIII,  reached  punitive  sanctions\r\n\nlevied  in  nominally  civil  proceedings, see  id.  at  2805-06,\r                                                             \r\n\nJustice Blackmun invoked his own invention   the Halper dichotomy\r                                                                 \r\n\n  as an  aid in determining  how a particular  sanction might  be\r\n\ncharacterized.  Responding  to concerns  articulated by  Justices\r\n\nScalia  and Kennedy (each of  whom concurred in  the judgment but\r\n\nwrote separately),  Justice Blackmun suggested  that under Halper\r                                                                           \r\n\n\"the question is whether forfeiture serves in part to punish, and\r                                                            \r\n\none need not exclude the possibility that forfeiture serves other\r\n\npurposes to reach that  conclusion.\"  Id. at 2810  n.12 (emphasis\r                                                   \r\n\nin  original).   While  Justice Blackmun  acknowledged that  \"the\r\n\nforfeiture of contraband itself  may be characterized as remedial\r\n\nbecause it removes  dangerous or illegal items  from society,\" he\r\n\ndeclined to extend that reasoning to the sovereign's confiscation\r\n\nof a defendant's home and  business (even though drug trafficking\r\n\nmay have occurred  there).  Id. at 2811.  Moreover, \"the dramatic\r                                         \r\n\nvariations in the value of . .  . property forfeitable\" under the\r\n\napplicable civil forfeiture statutes undermined any serious claim\r\n\nthat  such forfeitures  merely provided  appropriate compensation\r\n\nfor the  government's  losses.   Id. at  2812.   In other  words,\r                                              \r\n\nforfeitures of  random magnitude  were punitive in  nature mainly\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nbecause of sheer vagariousness.5\r\n\n          The capstone of the trilogy is Department of Revenue v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nKurth  Ranch, 114 S.

There  the Supreme Court\r                      \r\n\nrevisited  its double  jeopardy  jurisprudence and  found that  a\r\n\nMontana tax  on  the possession  of illegal  drugs constituted  a\r\n\npunishment.   See id. at 1948.   Justice Stevens, writing for the\r                               \r\n\nmajority, abjured the Halper dichotomy.   He explained this shift\r                                      \r\n\nof  focus  on the  basis  that  \"Halper's  method of  determining\r                                                 \r\n\nwhether the  exaction was  remedial or  punitive simply  does not\r\n\nwork  in the case of a tax  statute.\"  Id.

We hold that the dichotomy   \r\n\nthe  Halper Court's litmus test  for determining the  nature of a\r                     \r\n\ncivil   sanction      is  limited   to  cases   involving  fines,\r\n\nforfeitures, and  other monetary  penalties designed to  make the\r\n\nsovereign whole for harm  or loss that is quantifiable  in actual\r\n\nor  approximate monetary  terms.   In other cases,  the preferred\r\n\nmethod  of analysis  is  the  totality-of-the-circumstances  test\r\n\nemployed   in  Kurth  Ranch.    Thus,  the  Halper  dichotomy  is\r                                                            \r\n\ninapposite in the typical debarment case (as here).\r\n\n          1.   In  Kurth Ranch,  114 S.  Ct. at  1948, the  Court\r                    1.                  \r\n\nrecognized the  limitations of the dichotomy  conceived in Halper\r                                                                           \r\n\nand  nourished in Austin.  The Halper dichotomy is serviceable in\r                                               \r\n\nthe context of a fine, forfeiture, or other monetary penalty that\r\n\nis itself quantifiable in dollars  and is intended to  correspond\r\n\nwith  a   quantifiable  loss.    In  such  situations,  a  simple\r\n\nmathematical  computation reveals with  some degree  of precision\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nwhether  the penalty is in  proportion to the  misconduct.7  This\r\n\ncomparison,  in turn, determines the nature of the sanction:  the\r\n\nsanction is  either restitutionary in an  approximate sense (and,\r\n\nhence, remedial) or it  is not (and, hence, punitive).  This is a\r\n\npractical,  easily administered rule  of thumb    but it operates\r\n\nsatisfactorily  only  because  the  extent to  which  a  monetary\r\n\nexaction exceeds actual loss is quantifiable.  Where that is so  \r\n\nas in Halper    the test works; but in other  kinds of cases   as\r                      \r\n\nin Kurth Ranch and here   the dichotomy is dysfunctional.8\r                        \r\n\n          We   think  that   Halper   itself   recognized   these\r                                             \r\n\nlimitations.

Non-monetary\r\n\nsanctions elude  such facile  classification.  Indeed,  many non-\r\n\nmonetary  sanctions are hybrids;  while not solely  in service to\r\n\nremedial goals,  they cannot  fairly be characterized  as serving\r\n\nonly punitive  purposes.  We believe  it is for  this reason that\r\n\nthe  Halper Court, knowing many civil sanctions would not fit the\r                     \r\n\nanalytic  mold it  had cast  for use  in connection  with certain\r\n\ntypes of monetary penalties, stressed the circumscribed nature of\r\n\nits  holding and styled its  dichotomous approach as  \"a rule for\r\n\nthe rare case.\"  Id. at 449.\r                              \r\n\n          We  are unwilling  to accept Stoller's  contention that\r\n\nAustin  signals   a  widening  of  Halper's  purposefully  narrow\r                                                   \r\n\nholding.  In Austin,  the applicable statute purportedly entitled\r                             \r\n\nthe  government  to  recover  property used  to  facilitate  drug\r\n\ntransactions regardless  of the  property's value in  relation to\r\n\nthe  amount of  drugs purveyed  or the  losses to  the government\r\n\noccasioned  thereby.   See  Austin,  113 S.  Ct.  at  2812.   The\r                                            \r\n\ndefendant's challenge to the  forfeiture pivoted on the Excessive\r\n\nFines Clause, not  the Double Jeopardy Clause.   See id.  at 2812\r                                                                  \r\n\nn.14.   Although  the Court  often interchanges  precedents under\r\n\nthese clauses,  Austin  is a  case  in which  the  source of  the\r                                \r\n\nchallenge  possessed   decretory  significance.     In  assessing\r\n\nmultiple  punishment claims under  double jeopardy  analysis, the\r\n\nanswer to the dispositive  question ultimately depends on whether\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\na  sanction is  \"punitive.\"   By contrast,  in pondering  a claim\r\n\nunder the Excessive  Fines Clause, the answer  to the dispositive\r\n\nquestion ultimately depends on whether a sanction is \"excessive.\"\r\n\nSee  id.  To arrive  at a judgment  on excessiveness, a reviewing\r                  \r\n\ncourt  must necessarily determine if the fine is in proportion to\r\n\nthe harm inflicted and/or the loss sustained   and  it must apply\r\n\nthat  criterion  regardless  of  whether  the  harm  or  loss  is\r\n\nquantifiable.  See Alexander  v. United States, 113 S.  Ct. 2766,\r                                                        \r\n\n2776 (1993).  It follows that, in double jeopardy cases involving\r\n\nnon-monetary sanctions,  we can read very little  into the Austin\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt's commentary.\r\n\n          2.  Moving beyond the trilogy, the weight  of appellate\r                    2.\r\n\nauthority   buttresses  our  binary  conclusion  that  in  double\r\n\njeopardy cases (a) the Halper method of analysis is the exception\r                                       \r\n\nwhile  the  Kurth  Ranch method  is  the  general  rule, and  (b)\r                                  \r\n\nstrictly speaking, the  Halper dichotomy does  not apply to  non-\r                                        \r\n\nmonetary  sanctions.   See,  e.g.,  United  States v.  Hernandez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFundora,  58  F.3d 802,  806 (2d  Cir.)

The court labelled the Halper dichotomy \"inapposite\" in\r                                                 \r\n\ncases involving non-monetary  sanctions.   Id. at 578.

The court  found guidance    as do  we   in  the\r                \r\n\ngeneral   principles  discussed   by   the  Halper   Court,  and,\r                                                            \r\n\nadumbrating the methodology that  the Supreme Court later adopted\r\n\nin Kurth Ranch, the Reed panel examined the overall circumstances\r                                  \r\n\nin order to determine whether the proscriptive sanction should be\r\n\ncharacterized as punitive or remedial.  See id.\r                                                         \r\n\n          The  same court also declined to apply Halper in a case\r                                                                 \r\n\nthat bears a distinct family resemblance  to the case at bar.  In\r\n\nManocchio  v. Kusserow, 961 F.2d 1539 (11th Cir. 1992), the court\r                                \r\n\nfound  no  double jeopardy  barrier  to  an administrative  order\r\n\nexcluding a physician from  participating in the federal Medicare\r\n\nprogram  for at least five  years, notwithstanding that the order\r\n\nfollowed  the  doctor's  conviction and  sentencing  on  criminal\r\n\ncharges  of Medicare  fraud.   Dismissing the  physician's lament\r\n\nthat the  debarment order,  from his perspective,  was unarguably\r\n\npunitive,  the court determined the sanction to be remedial.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nid.  at 1542  (stating, inter alia,  that \"the  purpose of  . . .\r                                            \r\n\nexclusion  is to  protect  the public,  a legitimate  nonpunitive\r\n\ngoal\").

The court\r                              \r\n\nthen  pointed  out  that while     1818(e)  may  serve to  punish\r\n\nlawbreakers,  \"it   does  not  follow  that   all  sanctions  are\r\n\nnecessarily presumed to be  punitive when the [statute's] express\r\n\nlanguage .  . . also allows for remedial sanctions.\"  Id. at 541.\r                                                                   \r\n\nApplying  these tenets,  the court  concluded that  the debarment\r\n\norders did not comprise  punishments and, therefore, rebuffed the\r\n\nclaim of former jeopardy.

The Eleventh  Circuit, while  eschewing the\r\n\nHalper   dichotomy  in   debarment  situations,   heeds  Halper's\r                                                                         \r\n\nanimating  principle.

Writing  with the  added\r\n\nillumination  of Kurth Ranch, we conclude that, to the extent the\r                                      \r\n\ncircuits'  approaches  are inconsistent,  the  directness  of the\r\n\nEleventh Circuit's analysis in Reed is preferable because it best\r                                             \r\n\neffectuates  the  Supreme  Court's  admonition  that  the  Halper\r                                                                           \r\n\ndichotomy  should not be applied too far afield from its original\r\n\ncontext (monetary sanctions designed to make the government whole\r\n\nfor traceable losses).  See Kurth Ranch,  114 S. Ct. at 1948.  In\r                                                 \r\n\naddition, the more  inclusive totality-of-the-circumstances  test\r\n\nprovides a  sounder barometer  for measuring whether  a debarment\r\n\norder   or   an  analogous   non-monetary   sanction  constitutes\r\n\npunishment.

This task does not require us  to make a\r\n\nblanket  determination  of  whether  all  debarment  orders   are\r                                                  \r\n\nremedial  as opposed to punitive.   Rather, we shine the light of\r\n\nour  gleaned  understanding  on the  particular  sanction imposed\r\n\nunder the particular circumstances on the particular defendant in\r\n\norder to ascertain  its character.   See Halper, 490 U.S.  at 448\r                                                         \r\n\n(directing \"a particularized  assessment of  the penalty  imposed\r\n\nand the purposes that the penalty may  fairly be said to serve\").\r\n\nFor  this purpose,  we assume     but do  not decide    that  the\r\n\ndebarment order  and the  nine \"misapplication\" counts  lodged in\r\n\nthe  indictment arise out  of the same  events and  rest upon the\r\n\nsame elements.11\r\n\n          We conduct  our inquiry by considering  the totality of\r\n\nthe circumstances,  including the  source of the  authority under\r\n\nwhich  the debarment  is  imposable, the  goals underpinning  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11Under  United States v.

Rather, the  defendant\r\nmust  demonstrate that  the charges  contain  identical elements.\r\nSee  id.  at  2856, 2860.    Stoller  claims  that the  requisite\r                  \r\nidentity exists  here between  the FDIC's  administrative charges\r\nand the first nine counts  of the indictment (alleging violations\r\nof 18 U.S.C.   656).  The government disagrees.  It suggests that\r\nthe elements  are not congruent because   656 requires proof of a\r\nmisapplication of  bank funds and willfulness or intent to injure\r                                           \r\nthe bank, whereas   1818(e) contains an element of loss causation\r\nin  lieu  of the  willfulness requirement.   Since  the debarment\r\norder does not constitute punishment, see text infra,  we emulate\r                                                              \r\nthe court below and  leave this issue unaddressed.

In the course of this tamisage, we\r               \r\n\ngive  weight to a variety of factors  such as the severity of the\r\n\ncivil  sanction;  its  relationship  to  legitimate, non-punitive\r\n\naims;  the  extent  to  which  the  legislature  acted  to  deter\r\n\npotential wrongdoers,  or conversely,  to shield the  public; and\r\n\nthe nexus (if any) between the  civil sanction and the crime that\r\n\nit allegedly  punishes.   See  id.   Because our  interest is  in\r                                            \r\n\ndeterrating the overall  nature of the  sanction, no one  factor,\r\n\nstanding alone, is likely to be determinative.\r\n\n          1.  The authorizing statute, 12 U.S.C.   1818(e)(1), is\r                    1.\r\n\nreprinted in the  appendix.  The statute itself offers relatively\r\n\nlittle guidance;  it simply permits regulators  to seek debarment\r\n\norders as long  as three  conditions are fulfilled.   First,  the\r\n\npredicate  conduct   must  consist   of  (a)  violating   a  law,\r\n\nregulation,  or agency order,  (b) engaging in  (or condoning) an\r\n\nunsafe or unsound banking practice, or (c) committing a breach of\r\n\nfiduciary  duty.  See id.    1818(e)(1)(A).   Second, the conduct\r                                   \r\n\nmust  have  (a) caused  real or  probable  loss, (b)  actually or\r\n\npotentially prejudiced  depositors' interests, or (c) resulted in\r\n\ngain to the  perpetrator.  See id.    1818(e)(1)(B).  Third,  the\r                                            \r\n\nconduct  must  have  (a)  involved personal  dishonesty,  or  (b)\r\n\n\"demonstrate[d]  willful or  continuing disregard  . . .  for the\r\n\nsafety  or  soundness  of\"  the  financial institution.    Id.   \r                                                                        \r\n\n1818(e)(1)(C).   Whenever  these  three conditions  coalesce, the\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nagency  (here, the FDIC) may issue a  debarment order.  See id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1818(e)(1).    Such  an  order will  apply  industry-wide  unless\r\n\notherwise specified.  See id.   1818(e)(7)(A).\r                                       \r\n\n          These   conditions,   on  their   face,   are  arguably\r\n\nconsistent with  punishment and remediation alike.   For example,\r\n\nalthough  the statute's culpability requirement is reminiscent of\r\n\nthe criminal code, such a requirement, in and of itself, does not\r\n\nmandate a  finding of punitive  intent.   See Hudson, 14  F.3d at\r                                                              \r\n\n542.   By the same token, the  statute's evident concern for both\r\n\ndepositors'  interests  and  financial  institutions'  well-being\r\n\nstrongly  suggests a  remedial  goal, but  does  not, in  and  of\r\n\nitself, mandate a finding of remedial intent.  What tends to  tip\r\n\nthe balance is that,  under   1818(e)(1), the authority  to debar\r\n\nis  not  tied  to a  finding  that  the  targeted individual  has\r\n\ncommitted  a crime.   Just  as the presence  of an  explicit link\r\n\nbetween a  civil penalty and the  commission of a crime  makes it\r\n\nmore likely that the  penalty will be deemed punitive  for double\r\n\njeopardy purposes,  see Kurth Ranch, 114 S. Ct. at 1947, so, too,\r                                             \r\n\nthe  fact that a civil penalty can  be imposed whether or not the\r\n\ntargeted individual  has committed a  crime makes it  more likely\r\n\nthat  the penalty will be  deemed remedial, see,  e.g., Thomas v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCommissioner, 62 F.3d 97, 101 (4th Cir. 1995).\r                      \r\n\n          In reaching  the conclusion  that   1818(e)(1),  on its\r\n\nface, displays  colors more consistent  with the remedial  end of\r\n\nthe  spectrum,  we  reject  Stoller's  argument  that  Congress's\r\n\nfailure  to  enact  stringent  standards   circumscribing  agency\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\ndiscretion  in  respect  to debarment  renders  debarment  orders\r\n\npunitive in nature.   Simple logic refutes  this proposition, and\r\n\nthe  case law  uniformly contradicts  it.12   See, e.g.,  Bae, 44\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at  496  (characterizing  a   debarment  order  as  remedial\r\n\nnotwithstanding  the  authorizing  statute's  lack   of  limiting\r\n\nstandards); Hudson, 14 F.3d at 542 (similar).\r                            \r\n\n          The  legislative history  of    1818(e)(1)  is helpful.\r\n\nFairly read,  this history  reflects congressional aims  far more\r\n\ncompatible with remediation than with punishment.  Congress first\r\n\nenacted the  proscription provision  in  1966.   The report  that\r\n\naccompanied  the bill  limned the  reasons prompting  the desired\r\n\nreforms:\r\n\n               The  Federal   supervisory  agencies  in\r\n          varying    degrees   have    been   seriously\r\n          handicapped  in  their  efforts   to  prevent\r\n          irresponsible  and  undesirable practices  by\r\n          deficiencies   in  the   statutory  remedies.\r\n          Experience  has  often demonstrated  that the\r\n          remedies   now   available  to   the  Federal\r\n          supervisory agencies are not only too drastic\r\n          for  use  in many  cases,  but  are also  too\r\n          cumbersome to bring  about prompt  correction\r\n          and   promptness   is   very  often   vitally\r\n          important.\r\n\nS.

See Hudson,\r                                                                          \r\n\n14 F.3d at 541-42.\r\n\n          Nothing in the Financial Institutions  Reform, Recovery\r\n\nand Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) alters this outlook.  Though\r\n\nFIRREA  expanded the  scope of  possible proscription  beyond the\r\n\noffending  official's  own  bailiwick  and  for  the  first  time\r\n\nauthorized  an industry-wide ban, see 12  U.S.C.   1818(e)(7), it\r                                               \r\n\ndid  not   otherwise  change  the  substance   of  the  debarment\r\n\nprovision.  The only significant legislative history dealing with\r\n\nthe  industry-wide ban  addresses the  exceptions regulators  are\r\n\nempowered  to  make and  explains  them  in essentially  remedial\r\n\nterms.  See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 54(I), 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 1,\r                           \r\n\n468, (1989), reprinted  in 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 86,  264; H.R.

The other changes accomplished by\r            \r\n\nTitle IX  of FIRREA are a  mixed bag and, in  the aggregate, shed\r\n\nlittle  illumination.   The  short of  it is  that the  annals of\r\n\nFIRREA offer no convincing reason to infer that Congress intended\r\n\nto  alter  the fundamental  (remedial)  nature  of the  debarment\r\n\nprovision.\r\n\n          Stoller  resists  this  conclusion,  plucking  a single\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nsentence from  FIRREA's lengthy  legislative history.   The House\r\n\nReport,  in its  introduction  to FIRREA  Title  IX, states  that\r\n\n\"[t]his Title gives the regulators and the Justice Department the\r\n\ntools  which they need .  . . to  punish culpable individuals, to\r\n\nturn  this  situation around,  and  to  prevent these  tremendous\r\n\nlosses  to the  Federal deposit  insurance funds from  ever again\r\n\nrecurring.\"  H.R.  Rep. No.  54(I), supra,  1989 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at\r                                                   \r\n\n262.  But this language  applies to Title IX  as a whole, not  to\r\n\nthe  debarment  provision  per  se.   The  immediately  preceding\r\n\nsentence explains that Title  IX is intended both to  enhance the\r\n\nFDIC's  regulatory powers and  to strengthen  applicable criminal\r\n\njustice provisions with a view to \"restoring public confidence in\r\n\nthe nation's financial system and serv[ing] to protect the public\r\n\ninterest.\"  Id.   Read  in tandem, these  sentences suggest  that\r                         \r\n\nCongress visualized industry-wide debarment as a remedial device,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  that the  bill included  other emendations  that\r\n\nwere calculated to increase punishments.\r\n\n          To sum  up,  the legislative  history undergirding  the\r\n\ndebarment provision indicates that Congress gave the FDIC removal\r\n\npower for  remedial purposes,  and FIRREA  does not  suggest that\r\n\nCongress experienced a change of heart.\r\n\n          2.  Double  jeopardy problems must be examined in their\r                    2.\r\n\nactual application.  See  Halper, 490 U.S.  at 447.  Moving  from\r                                          \r\n\nthe general to the  specific, we inspect the circumstances  under\r\n\nwhich the FDIC sanctioned Stoller.  Our assay is hampered because\r\n\nthe  regulators' decisions are  opaque in certain  respects.  The\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nALJ did little more than find that the statutory preconditions to\r\n\nproscription  had  been  met.   Similarly,  the  Board's  initial\r\n\ndecision merely  stated that  \"the serious nature  of [Stoller's]\r\n\nunsafe or unsound  conduct and serious breaches of fiduciary duty\r\n\nmerit  prohibition  from  participating  in the  conduct  of  the\r\n\naffairs of any  other federally insured  depository institution.\"\r\n\nIn re  Stoller, No. 90-115e, at 23-24 (FDIC Feb. 18, 1992) (Board\r                        \r\n\nDec. I).   This explanation seems equally consistent  with either\r\n\nremedial or punitive aims; the  Board might have thought Stoller,\r\n\nas a  continuing participant in the banking  community, likely to\r\n\npresent an ongoing threat to the public,  or it might simply have\r\n\nthought that he deserved severe punishment.\r\n\n          The   Board's  second   decision   furnishes   a   more\r\n\ntransparent  window into  its  cerebrations,  and  resolves  this\r\n\namphiboly.   That decision (in which the Board extended Stoller's\r\n\nexile  by prohibiting him from acting as counsel to any financial\r\n\ninstitution)  persuasively demonstrates  that the  Board intended\r\n\ndebarment to serve a remedial  end.  The Board reasoned  that the\r\n\nvery nature of  a lawyer's  relationship with a  bank provides  a\r\n\nunique  opportunity for double dealing.   See In  re Stoller, No.\r                                                                      \r\n\n90-115e,  at 9  (FDIC Sept.  22, 1992)  (Board Dec. II).

Because  \"an  attorney  representing  a  financial\r             \r\n\ninstitution,  like  the  institution's  directors  and  officers,\r\n\noccupies  a  position  of   trust  and  has  important  fiduciary\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nobligations to the financial institution,\" id. at 9, the attorney\r                                                        \r\n\nhas \"a  significant opportunity  to harm  the institution.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nApplying  these principles,  the Board  ordered debarment  in the\r\n\nmost wide-ranging terms.   It  wrote \"that Stoller  could not  be\r\n\ntrusted to  put the bank's interests before his own.\"  Id. at 10.\r                                                                    \r\n\nOn this basis, the order seems unquestionably to be remedial.\r\n\n          Struggling  against this  pointed  explication  of  the\r\n\nBoard's rationale,  Stoller asseverates that the  debarment order\r\n\ncannot be viewed as remedial because the FDIC did not  assess the\r\n\ndanger  that continued  involvement  on  his  part posed  to  the\r\n\nbanking system or to depositors.  His asseveration lacks force.\r\n\n          In  the first place, the  FDIC is not  required to make\r\n\nspecific findings on the  magnitude of a potential threat  to the\r\n\nnation's financial  institutions.   Halper  expressly  recognizes\r                                                    \r\n\nthat civil sanctions need not be precisely calibrated in order to\r\n\nsurvive scrutiny under the Double Jeopardy Clause as long as they\r\n\nwork \"rough remedial justice.\"   490 U.S. at 446.  We  think that\r\n\nthis principle  is fully  transferable to the  debarment context.\r\n\nWhen, as now, the government demonstrates a pattern of systematic\r\n\nwrongdoing involving large  sums of money, a  debarment order may\r\n\nproperly  be  said  to  work  rough  remedial  justice without  a\r\n\ndetailed  prognostication regarding  the probable  extent of  the\r\n\nwrongdoer's future  misconduct, if unchecked.   See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Furlett, 974  F.2d 839,  844 (7th Cir.  1992); Manocchio,  961\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at  1542; see also United  States v. Winter, 22  F.3d 15, 17\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1994)  (\"It is  common wisdom  that past  is prologue,\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nforeshadowing the future.\").  Here, the Board, based on Stoller's\r\n\npervasive  misconduct,   could   reasonably  conclude   that   he\r\n\nrepresented  a major threat to  the banking industry,  and that a\r\n\nbroad debarment order would serve prophylactic purposes.\r\n\n          In the second place, Stoller's claim that the Board did\r\n\nnot consider the  risk he  presented to the  banking industry  is\r\n\nincorrect  as a  matter of fact.   The Board's  attention to this\r\n\nissue is not only evident from the parts of the decisions that we\r\n\nhave  cited,  but  it  is  also  made  manifest  by  the  Board's\r\n\ndiscussion of a possible reprieve from the industry-wide ban.  In\r\n\nthat regard, the  Board wrote that the  FDIC would have a  future\r\n\nopportunity to  determine whether Stoller \"could  perform work on\r\n\nbehalf  of  [federally insured  depository  institutions] without\r\n\nundue risk  to those institutions.\"   Board Dec. II at  11.  This\r\n\nstatement not only reflects the Board's worries about imperilling\r\n\nthe  public but also highlights the conditional nature of the ban\r\n\n   a fact that  itself militates in  favor of a  finding that the\r\n\nsanction  is remedial as opposed  to punitive.13   See Hudson, 14\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 542.\r\n\n          3.   Where, as here, double  jeopardy analysis proceeds\r                    3.\r\n\nunder  an appraisal of the totality of the circumstances, a civil\r\n\nsanction  need  not be  solely  remedial  to pass  constitutional\r\n\nmuster.   In  other  words,  the  fact  that  something  akin  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13We  do  not mean  to suggest  that  a permanent  ban would\r\nnecessarily be punitive.   See  Bae, 44 F.3d  at 495  (explaining\r                                             \r\nthat \"the duration or severity of an employment  restriction will\r\nnot mark  it as  punishment where  it  is intended  to further  a\r\nlegitimate governmental purpose\").\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\npunishment  occurs along  with, and  incidental to,  a sanction's\r\n\noverriding  remedial purpose  will  not  transform a  permissible\r\n\ncivil  penalty  into  a  prohibited  multiple  punishment.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHernandez-Fundora, 58 F.3d at  806; Bae, 44 F.3d at  493.  Having\r                                                 \r\n\nexamined    1818(e)(1), the applicable  legislative history,  the\r\n\ncircumstances attendant to Stoller's duplicity, and the rationale\r\n\nunderlying the  Board's issuance of the  specific debarment order\r\n\nat issue here, we  discern a single unifying thread:   protection\r\n\nof the  integrity of the  nation's financial institutions.   This\r\n\ncomports  with the root purpose of debarment:  to purge sensitive\r\n\nindustries of  corruption and thereby  protect the public.   This\r\n\npurpose, evident here, is essentially remedial in nature.\r\n\n          We  need  go no  further.    Although the  durationally\r\n\nindefinite  order  of  proscription directed  against  Stoller is\r\n\nharsh,  we  do not  believe that  it  is disproportionate  to the\r\n\nremedial goals of    1818(e)(1).  Nor is the  debarment order out\r\n\nof proportion  to  Stoller's  wrongdoing.    This  is  a  salient\r\n\nconsideration  because  an  individual's   misconduct  frequently\r\n\ninforms the  need for remediation.   See Hudson, 14 F.3d  at 542;\r                                                         \r\n\nFurlett, 974  F.2d at  844.   Here,  Stoller caused  the Bank  to\r                 \r\n\nsuffer extensive losses, and did so  by the most devious means   \r\n\nplaying  shell games with real  estate trusts, abusing a position\r\n\nof  trust,  and  duping  others by  concealing  his  interests in\r\n\nfinancial transactions.  In our judgment, the Board's decision to\r\n\nban Stoller  indefinitely from  all association with  the banking\r\n\nindustry  \"reasonably  can  be   viewed  as  a  remedial  measure\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\ncommensurate  with his  wrongdoing.\"  Furlett,  974 F.2d  at 844.\r                                                       \r\n\nPut another way, industry-wide debarment, in the circumstances of\r\n\nthis case, produces rough remedial justice.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          When the  powers of  government are arrayed  against an\r\n\nindividual, courts must be vigilant to ensure that the individual\r\n\nis not punished twice for the same offense through an artifice in\r\n\nwhich  one punishment masquerades as  a civil sanction.   Yet the\r\n\nfear  of  potential abuse  should not  be  allowed to  sweep away\r\n\ncommon sense.   Regulators who act  principally to safeguard  the\r\n\nintegrity  of the industries that  they oversee or  to shield the\r\n\npublic  from   the  machinations  of   unscrupulous  persons  are\r\n\nrepresentatives  of the sovereign   but they are not purveyors of\r\n\npunishment  in a constitutionally  relevant sense.   In  the end,\r\n\nthen, courts  must distinguish carefully between  those sanctions\r\n\nthat constitute impermissible exercises of the government's power\r\n\nto  punish and those that constitute permissible exercises of the\r\n\ngovernment's remedial authority (even if effectuating  a specific\r\n\nremedy  sometimes carries  with  it an  unavoidable component  of\r\n\ndeterrence or retribution).\r\n\n          Taking into  account the totality of the circumstances,\r\n\nwe  hold  that  the  debarment  order  imposed  by  the  FDIC  is\r\n\npredominantly remedial in nature.  Because it does not constitute\r\n\na  punishment  under appropriate  double  jeopardy  analysis, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  did not  err in  denying  the motion  to dismiss\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nvarious counts contained in the indictment.14\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14We note in passing that we would reach an identical result\r\nif  we  evaluated  the   debarment  order  under  the  Hudson/Bae\r                                                                           \r\nvariation  on the Halper theme  instead of under  the totality of\r                                  \r\nthe circumstances. \r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\n                        STATUTORY APPENDIX\r                                  STATUTORY APPENDIX\r\n\nI.

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Following chronological order,  we recount the  details\r\n\nof the  administrative proceeding  and then discuss  the criminal\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n                A.  The Administrative Proceeding.\r                          A.  The Administrative Proceeding.\r                                                           \r\n\n          From  1975  to  1990,  defendant-appellant   Robert  S.\r\n\nStoller  toiled as  the chief  executive officer of  the Coolidge\r\n\nCorner Cooperative Bank  (the Bank).   In 1986,  the Bank  became\r\n\nfederally insured.   Thereafter, Stoller caused it to  make loans\r\n\nto several  real estate trusts with which he was affiliated.  The\r\n\nloans soured and the Bank sustained heavy losses.\r\n\n          In 1990,  the FDIC  instituted  a debarment  proceeding\r\n\nagainst Stoller.   The FDIC  charged, and  an administrative  law\r\n\njudge (ALJ)  found, that  the Bank  underwrote the suspect  loans\r\n\nwithout appropriate disclosure and  in violation of Regulation O,\r\n\n12  C.F.R.    215  (a  rule  that caps  the  amount  of credit  a\r\n\nfederally insured institution may  extend to insiders and imposes\r\n\nlending limits on other extensions of credit).  The ALJ concluded\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthat   Stoller's  transgressions   demonstrated  a   willful  and\r\n\npersistent  disregard for  the  Bank's  soundness, and  therefore\r\n\nwarranted an  order of proscription  under 12 U.S.C.    1818(e).1\r\n\nOn  administrative review,  the  FDIC's board  of directors  (the\r\n\nBoard) affirmed the ALJ's factual determinations and approved his\r\n\nrecommended  order.     Stoller  requested   reconsideration  and\r\n\nclarification.  On September 22, 1992, the Board issued a revised\r\n\ndecision upholding the debarment  order in slightly altered form:\r\n\nin  its  final version,  the order  prevents  Stoller (who  is an\r\n\nattorney) from  serving as an officer or  director of, exercising\r\n\ncontrol  over, or  acting as  counsel to,  any federally  insured\r\n\nfinancial institution.\r\n\n                      B.  The Criminal Case.\r                                B.  The Criminal Case.\r                                                     \r\n\n          In January 1995, a  federal grand jury indicted Stoller\r\n\nfor  divers violations  of federal  banking laws,  including nine\r\n\ncounts of misapplying bank funds, see 18 U.S.C.   656; thirty-one\r                                               \r\n\ncounts of unlawfully receiving loan-procurement  commissions, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.    215; and eight counts  of making false entries,  see id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1005.  Stoller promptly moved to dismiss the first nine counts of\r\n\nthe indictment  on double jeopardy  grounds.  The  district court\r\n\ndenied the  motion, concluding that  the debarment order  did not\r\n\nconstitute punishment in the  relevant constitutional sense.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v.

There the  government\r                                                 \r\n\nsuccessfully prosecuted criminal charges against a physician who,\r\n\nit asserted, had defrauded the federal Medicare program on sixty-\r\n\nfive separate occasions.  The judge imposed a prison sentence and\r\n\na fine.  See Halper, 490 U.S. at 437.  Thereafter, the government\r                             \r\n\nbrought  a civil suit against  Dr. Halper under  the False Claims\r\n\nAct,  31 U.S.C.    3729-3730,  seeking to recover  damages plus a\r\n\npenalty equal to $2,000 per violation.  The district judge, after\r\n\ncontrasting the extent of the  government's claim for these items\r\n\n($131,170) with the provable amount of the loss occasioned by Dr.\r\n\nHalper's defalcations  ($585),  awarded the  government  $16,000.\r\n\nThe  judge  reasoned that  a more  munificent  award would  be so\r\n\ndisproportionate as to constitute  punishment and would therefore\r\n\nraise double jeopardy questions.  See Halper, 490 U.S. at 438-39.\r                                                      \r\n\nThe Supreme Court  ultimately accepted  this reasoning,4  finding\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The Court did not affirm, but instead vacated the award and\r\nremanded  for a  more precise  determination of  the government's\r\nactual loses.

Making such  a determination  \"requires a\r\n\nparticularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes\r\n\nthe penalty may fairly be said to  serve.  Simply put, a civil as\r\n\nwell  as  a criminal  sanction  constitutes  punishment when  the\r\n\nsanction  as applied in the  individual case serves  the goals of\r\n\npunishment.\"   Id. at  448.

To the  contrary, the Court stated  that \"the Government is\r\n\nentitled  to  rough  remedial justice,  that  is,  it  may demand\r\n\ncompensation according  to somewhat  imprecise formulas,  such as\r\n\nreasonable liquidated damages or a fixed sum plus double damages,\r\n\nwithout  being deemed to have imposed a second punishment for the\r\n\npurpose of  double jeopardy analysis.\"   Id. at 446.

It is in this  context that the\r                                 \r\n\nHalper dichotomy surfaced:  Justice Blackmun wrote  that \"a civil\r                \r\n\nsanction  that cannot fairly be  said solely to  serve a remedial\r\n\npurpose,  but rather can only be explained as also serving either\r\n\nretributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nto understand the term.\"  Id. at 448.\r                                       \r\n\n          In Austin v.

Responding  to concerns  articulated by  Justices\r\n\nScalia  and Kennedy (each of  whom concurred in  the judgment but\r\n\nwrote separately),  Justice Blackmun suggested  that under Halper\r                                                                           \r\n\n\"the question is whether forfeiture serves in part to punish, and\r                                                            \r\n\none need not exclude the possibility that forfeiture serves other\r\n\npurposes to reach that  conclusion.\"  Id. at 2810  n.12 (emphasis\r                                                   \r\n\nin  original).   While  Justice Blackmun  acknowledged that  \"the\r\n\nforfeiture of contraband itself  may be characterized as remedial\r\n\nbecause it removes  dangerous or illegal items  from society,\" he\r\n\ndeclined to extend that reasoning to the sovereign's confiscation\r\n\nof a defendant's home and  business (even though drug trafficking\r\n\nmay have occurred  there).  Id. at 2811.  Moreover, \"the dramatic\r                                         \r\n\nvariations in the value of . .  . property forfeitable\" under the\r\n\napplicable civil forfeiture statutes undermined any serious claim\r\n\nthat  such forfeitures  merely provided  appropriate compensation\r\n\nfor the  government's  losses.

We hold that the dichotomy   \r\n\nthe  Halper Court's litmus test  for determining the  nature of a\r                     \r\n\ncivil   sanction      is  limited   to  cases   involving  fines,\r\n\nforfeitures, and  other monetary  penalties designed to  make the\r\n\nsovereign whole for harm  or loss that is quantifiable  in actual\r\n\nor  approximate monetary  terms.   In other cases,  the preferred\r\n\nmethod  of analysis  is  the  totality-of-the-circumstances  test\r\n\nemployed   in  Kurth  Ranch.    Thus,  the  Halper  dichotomy  is\r                                                            \r\n\ninapposite in the typical debarment case (as here).\r\n\n          1.   In  Kurth Ranch,  114 S.  Ct. at  1948, the  Court\r                    1.                  \r\n\nrecognized the  limitations of the dichotomy  conceived in Halper\r                                                                           \r\n\nand  nourished in Austin.  The Halper dichotomy is serviceable in\r                                               \r\n\nthe context of a fine, forfeiture, or other monetary penalty that\r\n\nis itself quantifiable in dollars  and is intended to  correspond\r\n\nwith  a   quantifiable  loss.    In  such  situations,  a  simple\r\n\nmathematical  computation reveals with  some degree  of precision\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nwhether  the penalty is in  proportion to the  misconduct.7  This\r\n\ncomparison,  in turn, determines the nature of the sanction:  the\r\n\nsanction is  either restitutionary in an  approximate sense (and,\r\n\nhence, remedial) or it  is not (and, hence, punitive).  This is a\r\n\npractical,  easily administered rule  of thumb    but it operates\r\n\nsatisfactorily  only  because  the  extent to  which  a  monetary\r\n\nexaction exceeds actual loss is quantifiable.  Where that is so  \r\n\nas in Halper    the test works; but in other  kinds of cases   as\r                      \r\n\nin Kurth Ranch and here   the dichotomy is dysfunctional.8\r                        \r\n\n          We   think  that   Halper   itself   recognized   these\r                                             \r\n\nlimitations.

Tax statutes are not usually predicated on a\r\ncalculation  of  damages  or  costs sustained  by  the  sovereign\r\nthrough  the taxpayer's  acts, and  the tax  statute at  issue in\r\nKurth Ranch (which imposed a tax of the greater of $100 per ounce\r                     \r\nof marijuana or ten percent  of its market value, see 114  S.

Non-monetary\r\n\nsanctions elude  such facile  classification.  Indeed,  many non-\r\n\nmonetary  sanctions are hybrids;  while not solely  in service to\r\n\nremedial goals,  they cannot  fairly be characterized  as serving\r\n\nonly punitive  purposes.  We believe  it is for  this reason that\r\n\nthe  Halper Court, knowing many civil sanctions would not fit the\r                     \r\n\nanalytic  mold it  had cast  for use  in connection  with certain\r\n\ntypes of monetary penalties, stressed the circumscribed nature of\r\n\nits  holding and styled its  dichotomous approach as  \"a rule for\r\n\nthe rare case.\"  Id. at 449.\r                              \r\n\n          We  are unwilling  to accept Stoller's  contention that\r\n\nAustin  signals   a  widening  of  Halper's  purposefully  narrow\r                                                   \r\n\nholding.

See  Austin,  113 S.  Ct.  at  2812.   The\r                                            \r\n\ndefendant's challenge to the  forfeiture pivoted on the Excessive\r\n\nFines Clause, not  the Double Jeopardy Clause.   See id.  at 2812\r                                                                  \r\n\nn.14.   Although  the Court  often interchanges  precedents under\r\n\nthese clauses,  Austin  is a  case  in which  the  source of  the\r                                \r\n\nchallenge  possessed   decretory  significance.     In  assessing\r\n\nmultiple  punishment claims under  double jeopardy  analysis, the\r\n\nanswer to the dispositive  question ultimately depends on whether\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\na  sanction is  \"punitive.\"   By contrast,  in pondering  a claim\r\n\nunder the Excessive  Fines Clause, the answer  to the dispositive\r\n\nquestion ultimately depends on whether a sanction is \"excessive.\"\r\n\nSee  id.  To arrive  at a judgment  on excessiveness, a reviewing\r                  \r\n\ncourt  must necessarily determine if the fine is in proportion to\r\n\nthe harm inflicted and/or the loss sustained   and  it must apply\r\n\nthat  criterion  regardless  of  whether  the  harm  or  loss  is\r\n\nquantifiable.  See Alexander  v. United States, 113 S.  Ct. 2766,\r                                                        \r\n\n2776 (1993).  It follows that, in double jeopardy cases involving\r\n\nnon-monetary sanctions,  we can read very little  into the Austin\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt's commentary.\r\n\n          2.

The\r\n\nother two  circuits embrace this same  principle whilst departing\r\n\nfrom a strict rendition of the Halper dichotomy.  See, e.g., Bae,\r                                                                          \r\n\n44  F.3d at 493.

Rather, the  defendant\r\nmust  demonstrate that  the charges  contain  identical elements.\r\nSee  id.  at  2856, 2860.    Stoller  claims  that the  requisite\r                  \r\nidentity exists  here between  the FDIC's  administrative charges\r\nand the first nine counts  of the indictment (alleging violations\r\nof 18 U.S.C.   656).  The government disagrees.  It suggests that\r\nthe elements  are not congruent because   656 requires proof of a\r\nmisapplication of  bank funds and willfulness or intent to injure\r                                           \r\nthe bank, whereas   1818(e) contains an element of loss causation\r\nin  lieu  of the  willfulness requirement.

In the course of this tamisage, we\r               \r\n\ngive  weight to a variety of factors  such as the severity of the\r\n\ncivil  sanction;  its  relationship  to  legitimate, non-punitive\r\n\naims;  the  extent  to  which  the  legislature  acted  to  deter\r\n\npotential wrongdoers,  or conversely,  to shield the  public; and\r\n\nthe nexus (if any) between the  civil sanction and the crime that\r\n\nit allegedly  punishes.   See  id.   Because our  interest is  in\r                                            \r\n\ndeterrating the overall  nature of the  sanction, no one  factor,\r\n\nstanding alone, is likely to be determinative.\r\n\n          1.  The authorizing statute, 12 U.S.C.   1818(e)(1), is\r                    1.\r\n\nreprinted in the  appendix.  The statute itself offers relatively\r\n\nlittle guidance;  it simply permits regulators  to seek debarment\r\n\norders as long  as three  conditions are fulfilled.   First,  the\r\n\npredicate  conduct   must  consist   of  (a)  violating   a  law,\r\n\nregulation,  or agency order,  (b) engaging in  (or condoning) an\r\n\nunsafe or unsound banking practice, or (c) committing a breach of\r\n\nfiduciary  duty.  See id.    1818(e)(1)(A).   Second, the conduct\r                                   \r\n\nmust  have  (a) caused  real or  probable  loss, (b)  actually or\r\n\npotentially prejudiced  depositors' interests, or (c) resulted in\r\n\ngain to the  perpetrator.  See id.    1818(e)(1)(B).  Third,  the\r                                            \r\n\nconduct  must  have  (a)  involved personal  dishonesty,  or  (b)\r\n\n\"demonstrate[d]  willful or  continuing disregard  . . .  for the\r\n\nsafety  or  soundness  of\"  the  financial institution.    Id.   \r                                                                        \r\n\n1818(e)(1)(C).   Whenever  these  three conditions  coalesce, the\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nagency  (here, the FDIC) may issue a  debarment order.  See id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1818(e)(1).    Such  an  order will  apply  industry-wide  unless\r\n\notherwise specified.  See id.   1818(e)(7)(A).\r                                       \r\n\n          These   conditions,   on  their   face,   are  arguably\r\n\nconsistent with  punishment and remediation alike.   For example,\r\n\nalthough  the statute's culpability requirement is reminiscent of\r\n\nthe criminal code, such a requirement, in and of itself, does not\r\n\nmandate a  finding of punitive  intent.   See Hudson, 14  F.3d at\r                                                              \r\n\n542.   By the same token, the  statute's evident concern for both\r\n\ndepositors'  interests  and  financial  institutions'  well-being\r\n\nstrongly  suggests a  remedial  goal, but  does  not, in  and  of\r\n\nitself, mandate a finding of remedial intent.  What tends to  tip\r\n\nthe balance is that,  under   1818(e)(1), the authority  to debar\r\n\nis  not  tied  to a  finding  that  the  targeted individual  has\r\n\ncommitted  a crime.   Just  as the presence  of an  explicit link\r\n\nbetween a  civil penalty and the  commission of a crime  makes it\r\n\nmore likely that the  penalty will be deemed punitive  for double\r\n\njeopardy purposes,  see Kurth Ranch, 114 S. Ct. at 1947, so, too,\r                                             \r\n\nthe  fact that a civil penalty can  be imposed whether or not the\r\n\ntargeted individual  has committed a  crime makes it  more likely\r\n\nthat  the penalty will be  deemed remedial, see,  e.g., Thomas v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCommissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701319\"><a href=\"/opinion/701319/paul-l-thomas-v-commissioner-of-the-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (4th Cir. 1995).\r                      \r\n\n          In reaching  the conclusion  that   1818(e)(1),  on its\r\n\nface, displays  colors more consistent  with the remedial  end of\r\n\nthe  spectrum,  we  reject  Stoller's  argument  that  Congress's\r\n\nfailure  to  enact  stringent  standards   circumscribing  agency\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\ndiscretion  in  respect  to debarment  renders  debarment  orders\r\n\npunitive in nature.

Though\r\n\nFIRREA  expanded the  scope of  possible proscription  beyond the\r\n\noffending  official's  own  bailiwick  and  for  the  first  time\r\n\nauthorized  an industry-wide ban, see 12  U.S.C.   1818(e)(7), it\r                                               \r\n\ndid  not   otherwise  change  the  substance   of  the  debarment\r\n\nprovision.  The only significant legislative history dealing with\r\n\nthe  industry-wide ban  addresses the  exceptions regulators  are\r\n\nempowered  to  make and  explains  them  in essentially  remedial\r\n\nterms.

The  short of  it is  that the  annals of\r\n\nFIRREA offer no convincing reason to infer that Congress intended\r\n\nto  alter  the fundamental  (remedial)  nature  of the  debarment\r\n\nprovision.\r\n\n          Stoller  resists  this  conclusion,  plucking  a single\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nsentence from  FIRREA's lengthy  legislative history.   The House\r\n\nReport,  in its  introduction  to FIRREA  Title  IX, states  that\r\n\n\"[t]his Title gives the regulators and the Justice Department the\r\n\ntools  which they need .  . . to  punish culpable individuals, to\r\n\nturn  this  situation around,  and  to  prevent these  tremendous\r\n\nlosses  to the  Federal deposit  insurance funds from  ever again\r\n\nrecurring.\"  H.R.  Rep. No.  54(I), supra,  1989 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at\r                                                   \r\n\n262.  But this language  applies to Title IX  as a whole, not  to\r\n\nthe  debarment  provision  per  se.   The  immediately  preceding\r\n\nsentence explains that Title  IX is intended both to  enhance the\r\n\nFDIC's  regulatory powers and  to strengthen  applicable criminal\r\n\njustice provisions with a view to \"restoring public confidence in\r\n\nthe nation's financial system and serv[ing] to protect the public\r\n\ninterest.\"  Id.   Read  in tandem, these  sentences suggest  that\r                         \r\n\nCongress visualized industry-wide debarment as a remedial device,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  that the  bill included  other emendations  that\r\n\nwere calculated to increase punishments.\r\n\n          To sum  up,  the legislative  history undergirding  the\r\n\ndebarment provision indicates that Congress gave the FDIC removal\r\n\npower for  remedial purposes,  and FIRREA  does not  suggest that\r\n\nCongress experienced a change of heart.\r\n\n          2.  Double  jeopardy problems must be examined in their\r                    2.\r\n\nactual application.  See  Halper, 490 U.S.  at 447.  Moving  from\r                                          \r\n\nthe general to the  specific, we inspect the circumstances  under\r\n\nwhich the FDIC sanctioned Stoller.  Our assay is hampered because\r\n\nthe  regulators' decisions are  opaque in certain  respects.  The\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nALJ did little more than find that the statutory preconditions to\r\n\nproscription  had  been  met.   Similarly,  the  Board's  initial\r\n\ndecision merely  stated that  \"the serious nature  of [Stoller's]\r\n\nunsafe or unsound  conduct and serious breaches of fiduciary duty\r\n\nmerit  prohibition  from  participating  in the  conduct  of  the\r\n\naffairs of any  other federally insured  depository institution.\"\r\n\nIn re  Stoller, No. 90-115e, at 23-24 (FDIC Feb. 18, 1992) (Board\r                        \r\n\nDec. I).   This explanation seems equally consistent  with either\r\n\nremedial or punitive aims; the  Board might have thought Stoller,\r\n\nas a  continuing participant in the banking  community, likely to\r\n\npresent an ongoing threat to the public,  or it might simply have\r\n\nthought that he deserved severe punishment.\r\n\n          The   Board's  second   decision   furnishes   a   more\r\n\ntransparent  window into  its  cerebrations,  and  resolves  this\r\n\namphiboly.   That decision (in which the Board extended Stoller's\r\n\nexile  by prohibiting him from acting as counsel to any financial\r\n\ninstitution)  persuasively demonstrates  that the  Board intended\r\n\ndebarment to serve a remedial  end.  The Board reasoned  that the\r\n\nvery nature of  a lawyer's  relationship with a  bank provides  a\r\n\nunique  opportunity for double dealing.   See In  re Stoller, No.\r                                                                      \r\n\n90-115e,  at 9  (FDIC Sept.  22, 1992)  (Board Dec. II).   Hence,\r\n\ndebarment  orders  should  sweep  broadly to  ensure  that  rogue\r\n\nlawyers  do not have repeated  opportunities to bilk  banks.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at  8.    Because  \"an  attorney  representing  a  financial\r             \r\n\ninstitution,  like  the  institution's  directors  and  officers,\r\n\noccupies  a  position  of   trust  and  has  important  fiduciary\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nobligations to the financial institution,\" id. at 9, the attorney\r                                                        \r\n\nhas \"a  significant opportunity  to harm  the institution.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nApplying  these principles,  the Board  ordered debarment  in the\r\n\nmost wide-ranging terms.   It  wrote \"that Stoller  could not  be\r\n\ntrusted to  put the bank's interests before his own.\"  Id. at 10.\r                                                                    \r\n\nOn this basis, the order seems unquestionably to be remedial.\r\n\n          Struggling  against this  pointed  explication  of  the\r\n\nBoard's rationale,  Stoller asseverates that the  debarment order\r\n\ncannot be viewed as remedial because the FDIC did not  assess the\r\n\ndanger  that continued  involvement  on  his  part posed  to  the\r\n\nbanking system or to depositors.  His asseveration lacks force.\r\n\n          In  the first place, the  FDIC is not  required to make\r\n\nspecific findings on the  magnitude of a potential threat  to the\r\n\nnation's financial  institutions.   Halper  expressly  recognizes\r                                                    \r\n\nthat civil sanctions need not be precisely calibrated in order to\r\n\nsurvive scrutiny under the Double Jeopardy Clause as long as they\r\n\nwork \"rough remedial justice.\"   490 U.S. at 446.  We  think that\r\n\nthis principle  is fully  transferable to the  debarment context.\r\n\nWhen, as now, the government demonstrates a pattern of systematic\r\n\nwrongdoing involving large  sums of money, a  debarment order may\r\n\nproperly  be  said  to  work  rough  remedial  justice without  a\r\n\ndetailed  prognostication regarding  the probable  extent of  the\r\n\nwrongdoer's future  misconduct, if unchecked.   See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Here, the Board, based on Stoller's\r\n\npervasive  misconduct,   could   reasonably  conclude   that   he\r\n\nrepresented  a major threat to  the banking industry,  and that a\r\n\nbroad debarment order would serve prophylactic purposes.\r\n\n          In the second place, Stoller's claim that the Board did\r\n\nnot consider the  risk he  presented to the  banking industry  is\r\n\nincorrect  as a  matter of fact.   The Board's  attention to this\r\n\nissue is not only evident from the parts of the decisions that we\r\n\nhave  cited,  but  it  is  also  made  manifest  by  the  Board's\r\n\ndiscussion of a possible reprieve from the industry-wide ban.  In\r\n\nthat regard, the  Board wrote that the  FDIC would have a  future\r\n\nopportunity to  determine whether Stoller \"could  perform work on\r\n\nbehalf  of  [federally insured  depository  institutions] without\r\n\nundue risk  to those institutions.\"   Board Dec. II at  11.  This\r\n\nstatement not only reflects the Board's worries about imperilling\r\n\nthe  public but also highlights the conditional nature of the ban\r\n\n   a fact that  itself militates in  favor of a  finding that the\r\n\nsanction  is remedial as opposed  to punitive.13   See Hudson, 14\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 542.\r\n\n          3.   Where, as here, double  jeopardy analysis proceeds\r                    3.\r\n\nunder  an appraisal of the totality of the circumstances, a civil\r\n\nsanction  need  not be  solely  remedial  to pass  constitutional\r\n\nmuster.   In  other  words,  the  fact  that  something  akin  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13We  do  not mean  to suggest  that  a permanent  ban would\r\nnecessarily be punitive.   See  Bae, 44 F.3d  at 495  (explaining\r                                             \r\nthat \"the duration or severity of an employment  restriction will\r\nnot mark  it as  punishment where  it  is intended  to further  a\r\nlegitimate governmental purpose\").\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\npunishment  occurs along  with, and  incidental to,  a sanction's\r\n\noverriding  remedial purpose  will  not  transform a  permissible\r\n\ncivil  penalty  into  a  prohibited  multiple  punishment.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHernandez-Fundora, 58 F.3d at  806; Bae, 44 F.3d at  493.  Having\r                                                 \r\n\nexamined    1818(e)(1), the applicable  legislative history,  the\r\n\ncircumstances attendant to Stoller's duplicity, and the rationale\r\n\nunderlying the  Board's issuance of the  specific debarment order\r\n\nat issue here, we  discern a single unifying thread:   protection\r\n\nof the  integrity of the  nation's financial institutions.   This\r\n\ncomports  with the root purpose of debarment:  to purge sensitive\r\n\nindustries of  corruption and thereby  protect the public.   This\r\n\npurpose, evident here, is essentially remedial in nature.\r\n\n          We  need  go no  further.    Although the  durationally\r\n\nindefinite  order  of  proscription directed  against  Stoller is\r\n\nharsh,  we  do not  believe that  it  is disproportionate  to the\r\n\nremedial goals of    1818(e)(1).  Nor is the  debarment order out\r\n\nof proportion  to  Stoller's  wrongdoing.    This  is  a  salient\r\n\nconsideration  because  an  individual's   misconduct  frequently\r\n\ninforms the  need for remediation.   See Hudson, 14 F.3d  at 542;\r                                                         \r\n\nFurlett, 974  F.2d at  844.   Here,  Stoller caused  the Bank  to\r                 \r\n\nsuffer extensive losses, and did so  by the most devious means   \r\n\nplaying  shell games with real  estate trusts, abusing a position\r\n\nof  trust,  and  duping  others by  concealing  his  interests in\r\n\nfinancial transactions.  In our judgment, the Board's decision to\r\n\nban Stoller  indefinitely from  all association with  the banking\r\n\nindustry  \"reasonably  can  be   viewed  as  a  remedial  measure\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\ncommensurate  with his  wrongdoing.\"  Furlett,  974 F.2d  at 844.\r                                                       \r\n\nPut another way, industry-wide debarment, in the circumstances of\r\n\nthis case, produces rough remedial justice.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          When the  powers of  government are arrayed  against an\r\n\nindividual, courts must be vigilant to ensure that the individual\r\n\nis not punished twice for the same offense through an artifice in\r\n\nwhich  one punishment masquerades as  a civil sanction.   Yet the\r\n\nfear  of  potential abuse  should not  be  allowed to  sweep away\r\n\ncommon sense.   Regulators who act  principally to safeguard  the\r\n\nintegrity  of the industries that  they oversee or  to shield the\r\n\npublic  from   the  machinations  of   unscrupulous  persons  are\r\n\nrepresentatives  of the sovereign   but they are not purveyors of\r\n\npunishment  in a constitutionally  relevant sense.   In  the end,\r\n\nthen, courts  must distinguish carefully between  those sanctions\r\n\nthat constitute impermissible exercises of the government's power\r\n\nto  punish and those that constitute permissible exercises of the\r\n\ngovernment's remedial authority (even if effectuating  a specific\r\n\nremedy  sometimes carries  with  it an  unavoidable component  of\r\n\ndeterrence or retribution).\r\n\n          Taking into  account the totality of the circumstances,\r\n\nwe  hold  that  the  debarment  order  imposed  by  the  FDIC  is\r\n\npredominantly remedial in nature.  Because it does not constitute\r\n\na  punishment  under appropriate  double  jeopardy  analysis, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  did not  err in  denying  the motion  to dismiss\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nvarious counts contained in the indictment.14\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14We note in passing that we would reach an identical result\r\nif  we  evaluated  the   debarment  order  under  the  Hudson/Bae\r                                                                           \r\nvariation  on the Halper theme  instead of under  the totality of\r                                  \r\nthe circumstances. \r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\n                        STATUTORY APPENDIX\r                                  STATUTORY APPENDIX\r\n\nI.
