Jos Antonio Fust, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n        Alexander Zeno for appellant.\r\n        Timothy Faerber, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States\r\nAttorney, Jos A. Quiles-Espinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, and\r\nNelson Prez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nJuly 23, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Robert Ali Hernandez-Wilson\r\nchallenges the validity of his guilty plea to a charge of\r\nconspiracy to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C.  846. \r\nThe record reveals that the guilty plea accepted by the district\r\ncourt was the product of confusion on the part of defense counsel,\r\nthe prosecutor, and the court.  Under these circumstances, we\r\nconclude that Hernandez reasonably misunderstood the consequences\r\nof his guilty plea.  Therefore, we must vacate the conviction and\r\nsentence, set aside the guilty plea, and remand to the district\r\ncourt for further proceedings.  See United States v. Gray, 63 F.3d\r\n57, 58 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n                             I.\r\nIn April 1997, Hernandez was indicted on four counts\r\nrelated to his participation in a conspiracy to distribute heroin. \r\nHernandez originally entered a plea of not guilty, but on July 18,\r\n1997 a change-of-plea hearing (Rule 11 hearing) was held before the\r\ndistrict court.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c) (requiring that before\r\na guilty plea can be accepted the district court must \"address the\r\ndefendant personally in open court\" to ensure that the plea is a\r\nknowing and voluntary waiver of the defendant's constitutional\r\nrights).  In part based on the government's promise to recommend\r\nthat he be sentenced under 18 U.S.C.  3553(f), Hernandez changed\r\nhis plea to guilty on Count One of the indictment, admitting to a\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  846 (conspiracy to distribute heroin). \r\nThe sentencing provision that was central to the plea\r\nagreement, 18 U.S.C.  3553(f), commonly referred to in sentencing\r\nparlance as the \"safety valve,\" allows courts to sentence\r\ndefendants who have little or no prior criminal history \"without\r\nregard to any statutory minimum sentence\" under certain\r\ncircumstances.  At the time of the July 18, 1997 Rule 11 hearing,\r\nHernandez's defense counsel, the Assistant United States Attorney\r\nprosecuting the case, and the district court were all under the\r\nimpression that Hernandez was preliminarily eligible for sentencing\r\nunder the safety valve, meaning that his prison sentence could have\r\nbeen as low as 30 months.  On the other hand, if Hernandez did not\r\nreceive the benefit of the safety valve provision, the crime to\r\nwhich he was pleading guilty carried a mandatory minimum sentence\r\nof 60 months.\r\nWe can best explain the handling of the \"safety valve\"\r\nprovision at Hernandez's Rule 11 hearing on July 18, 1997 by\r\nquoting extensively from the hearing:\r\n  The Court: You have a plea agreement which I\r\nhave examined.  The plea agreement says that\r\nyou are pleading guilty to this drug\r\nconspiracy count.  It also spells out the\r\npenalties that we discussed earlier on in this\r\ncolloquy.  It also says here that you're going\r\nto try to comply with the safety valve\r\nprovisions of Guideline section 5(c)(1).2. \r\nAnd if you do so then I will be able to\r\nsentence you without making reference to the\r\nstatutory mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment.  Do you understand that?\r\n\n  The Defendant: I don't understand.  I don't\r\nunderstand.  I didn't understand that part.\r\n\n  The Court: Have you heard about the safety\r\nvalve provisions?\r\n\n  Defense Counsel: You Honor, if I may?  His big\r\nconcern is that you stated that there is a\r\nstatutory minimum of five years.  And all the\r\ntime he has been considering level nineteen\r\nwhich is thirty [months].\r\n\n  The Court: Let me clarify that confusion that\r\nyou have.  When I mentioned the five years\r\nstatutory minimum term of imprisonment I\r\nmentioned it because I have an obligation to\r\ntell you about that. Do you understand that?\r\n\n  The Defendant: I understand.\r\n\n  The Court: Also, I have an obligation [to tell\r\nyou] about the forty years which is the\r\nmaximum.  Do you understand that?\r\n\n  The Defendant: I do.\r\n\n  The Court: But I also have an obligation to\r\ntell you that you can escape that and be\r\nsentenced without reference to that mandatory\r\nminimum if you comply with the safety valve\r\nprovision of section 5(c)(1).2.  Do you\r\nunderstand that?\r\n\n  The Defendant: I do.\r\n\n  The Court: That requires that you sit down\r\nwith an agent, tell them everything you know\r\nabout this case.  And if you have no criminal\r\nrecord, if you have no criminal record and you\r\nwere not involved with firearms and things of\r\nthat sort, then I can give you the benefit of\r\nsentencing you without reference to the\r\nstatutory minimum.  For example, to a level\r\nnineteen.  Do you understand that?\r\n\n  The Defendant: I understand.\r\n\n                         *   *   *\r\n\n  The Court: And if you have no criminal history\r\nyour Guideline imprisonment range with a level\r\nnineteen will be thirty to thirty-seven\r\nmonths.  However, if you do not comply with\r\nthe safety valve obligations that you have,\r\nthat becomes a sixty month sentence.  Do you\r\nunderstand that?  So it is in your best\r\ninterest to comply.\r\n\n  The Defendant: Well, okay.  What I don't\r\nunderstand is I just signed for thirty months. \r\nAnd what I don't understand is if after that\r\nthey can give me sixty months.  I don't\r\nunderstand that.\r\n\n  The Court: Let me explain to you. [Y]ou're not\r\nsigning for thirty months.  You are expecting\r\nto be sentenced to thirty months.  And I hope\r\nthat that will be the case.  Do you\r\nunderstand?  But you still have to meet with\r\nan agent, and you have to comply with the\r\nsafety valve provision.  You will have to sit\r\ndown with this agent and you will have to tell\r\nhim this is what happened. . . .  The\r\ngovernment will check that you have no\r\ncriminal record.  Which you don't.  And then I\r\nwill give you [the] benefits of the safety\r\nvalve.  Do you understand that?\r\n\n  The Defendant: I understand.\r\n\n                         *   *   *\r\n\n  The Court: Okay.  The government is going to\r\nrecommend a thirty month sentence.  You\r\nunderstand that?\r\n\n  The Defendant: Ah-ha.\r\n\n  The Court: And the government expects that\r\nyou will comply with the safety valve\r\nprovision.  You understand?\r\n\n  The Defendant: Right now they will offer the\r\nsame thing to my codefendants, right?\r\n\n  The Court: Let me say this.  Let me see if I\r\ncan   let me open the book here.  For you to\r\nqualify for the safety valve you have to\r\ncomply with five things.  Number one: No\r\ncriminal record.  Do you have a criminal\r\nrecord?\r\n\n  Defense Counsel: No, your Honor.  There is a\r\nLaw fifty-four charges, but that's not    \r\n\n  The Court: Let me change that.  You cannot\r\nhave more than one point of criminal record. \r\nIt seems to me that you're okay in that\r\nsense.\r\n\n(emphasis added).\r\n\nIn fact, as discussed more fully below, at the time of\r\nthe Rule 11 hearing Hernandez was ineligible for the safety valve. \r\nIn order to qualify for sentencing under the safety valve, a\r\ndefendant may \"not have more than 1 criminal history point.\"  See\r\n18 U.S.C.  3553(f)(1).  All the participants (i.e., the\r\nprosecutor, the court, defense counsel and Hernandez) were aware\r\nthat Hernandez had one prior criminal conviction at the time of the\r\nplea hearing.  In November of 1995, Hernandez pled guilty to one\r\ncount of simple assault in violation of Law 54 (Puerto Rico's\r\ndomestic violence statute).  On January 9, 1996, Hernandez was\r\nsentenced to eighteen (18) months probation pursuant to his\r\nconviction under Law 54.  All of the participants correctly\r\nunderstood that this conviction gave Hernandez only one criminal\r\nhistory point.  However, either they did not know or they did not\r\nappreciate the significance of the fact that Hernandez had\r\ncommitted the offense for which he was pleading guilty while on\r\nprobation for the Puerto Rico Law 54 conviction.  Under the\r\nsentencing guidelines, this fact added two more points to\r\nHernandez's criminal history score, thereby disqualifying him from\r\nthe benefits of the safety valve.  See U.S.S.G.  4A1.1(d) (\"Add 2\r\npoints [to the defendant's criminal history score] if the defendant\r\ncommitted the instant offense while under any criminal justice\r\nsentence, including probation . . . .\"); see also 18 U.S.C. \r\n3553(f) (restricting sentencing under the safety valve to\r\ndefendants that \"do[] not have more than 1 criminal history\r\npoint\").  Therefore, at the time Hernandez negotiated his plea\r\nbargain with the government and at the time he entered his plea of\r\nguilty, there was no possibility that Hernandez could be sentenced\r\nto anything less than 60 months, the statutory mandatory minimum\r\nsentence for the crime to which Hernandez was pleading guilty.\r\nOn October 17, 1997, Hernandez's former defense counsel\r\nmoved for leave to withdraw as counsel for the defendant citing\r\nirreconcilable differences.  On October 19, 1997, Hernandez moved\r\npro se for dismissal of his counsel.  In addition, Hernandez\r\nrequested (1) a continuance of the sentencing hearing; (2)\r\nappointment of new counsel; and (3) a hearing concerning whether\r\nHernandez had been adequately counseled as to the terms and\r\nconditions of the plea agreement.  By margin order, the district\r\ncourt appointed new counsel to represent Hernandez and continued\r\nthe sentencing hearing until January 1998.  By the time of\r\nsentencing in January 1998, Hernandez was represented by different\r\ncounsel.  Hernandez's new counsel did not renew or otherwise pursue\r\nHernandez's motion for a hearing on the validity of the guilty\r\nplea.\r\nThe district court held a sentencing hearing on January\r\n22, 1998.  Pursuant to the pre-sentence report, Hernandez was\r\nassigned a criminal history score of three.  At sentencing,\r\nHernandez exhibited a lack of understanding about the reasons for\r\nthe unavailability of a thirty month sentence.  The court responded\r\nthat \"we have already discussed this; that you were   that when I\r\ntook your plea, I do think that it was very carefully explained to\r\nyou, all the consequences of your plea.  You agree to that, that in\r\nthat sense that I did not misrepresent anything to you, correct?\" \r\nHernandez responded that he was \"not very good at English,\" that\r\nthe interpreter was speaking very fast and that he \"had already\r\nsigned [the plea agreement] when you talked to me about the safety\r\nvalve.\"  Later in the sentencing hearing, Hernandez's counsel\r\nindicated Hernandez's belief that he had not been adequately\r\ncounseled \"about the impact of [the Law 54] charge in the State\r\ncourts.\"  Despite this indication of a problem with Hernandez's\r\nplea, and Hernandez's earlier pro se request for a hearing on\r\nwhether he had been adequately counseled about the terms and\r\nconditions of his plea agreement, the district court made no\r\nfurther inquiry into whether Hernandez had understood the\r\nconsequences of his guilty plea at the time that it was entered,\r\nand proceeded to sentence Hernandez to the statutory minimum\r\nsentence of 60 months incarceration.  Hernandez now appeals from\r\nhis conviction and sentence.  \r\n                            II.\r\nRule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\r\ngoverns the acceptance of guilty pleas to federal criminal\r\nviolations.  Pursuant to Rule 11, in order for a plea of guilty to\r\nconstitute a valid waiver of the defendant's right to trial, guilty\r\npleas must be knowing and voluntary: \"Rule 11 was intended to\r\nensure that a defendant who pleads guilty does so with an\r\n'understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of\r\nhis plea.'\" United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (quoting McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467\r\n(1969)).  A breach of Rule 11 that \"implicates one of the rule's\r\n'core concerns' mandates that the plea be set aside.\"  United\r\nStates v. Medina-Silverio, 30 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal\r\nquotations omitted).  In previous cases we have identified three\r\ncore concerns: \"1) absence of coercion; 2) understanding of the\r\ncharges; and 3) knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea.\" \r\nCotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4 (citing United States v. Allard, 926\r\nF.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991)).  Rule 11 by its terms excuses\r\nharmless errors, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h), and focuses the\r\ncourt's attention instead on \"whether any particular defect in the\r\nRule 11 hearing affected the defendant's 'substantial rights.'\"\r\nUnited States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 348 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nIn determining whether defendant's substantial rights were\r\nabridged, we consider the totality of the circumstances to\r\ndetermine \"what was communicated by the trial court, and what\r\nshould reasonably have been understood by the defendant.\"  Cotal-\r\nCrespo, 47 F.3d at 4.\r\nDespite the failure of Hernandez's new attorney to renew\r\nexplicitly at the sentencing hearing his client's request that the\r\ndistrict court examine Hernandez's understanding of the\r\nconsequences of his plea at the time of the Rule 11 hearing,\r\nHernandez has not waived this issue on appeal.  Contrary to most\r\nallegations of error, \"a Rule 11 challenge will not be deemed\r\nwaived upon a party's failure to raise it in the district court.\" \r\nUnited States v. Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588, 593 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nBecause of the important concerns protected by Rule 11, we \"must\r\ndetermine compliance with Rule 11, even if a claim of noncompliance\r\nwas never presented to the trial court.\"  Id. (citation omitted). \r\nHowever, in recognition of the limits of appellate review, we are\r\nconstrained to consider only the record that was created in the\r\ndistrict court in considering a Rule 11 challenge on direct appeal. \r\nSee id.  Because Hernandez's appeal \"can be decided wholly on the\r\nbasis of the formal record accumulated thus far . . . [Hernandez's]\r\nRule 11 challenge is properly before us,\" id. at 594, and we\r\nconsider it on the merits.\r\n                            III.\r\nHernandez alleges that he was misled by the prosecutor,\r\nthe court, and his own counsel at his Rule 11 hearing and thus his\r\nguilty plea was not \"given voluntarily and intelligently.\"  See\r\nUnited States v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 1995).  On the\r\nbasis of our review of the Rule 11 hearing transcript, we agree.\r\nThe prosecutor, the court and defense counsel believed\r\nthat Hernandez would be eligible for sentencing under the safety\r\nvalve, 18 U.S.C.  3553(f).  Indeed, in explaining the terms of the\r\nplea to Hernandez, the court at two points affirmatively\r\nrepresented to Hernandez that his criminal history made him\r\neligible for sentencing under the safety valve.  Although the\r\ncourt's representations about the availability of the safety valve\r\nwere phrased conditionally several times, the court assumed that\r\nHernandez's criminal history was not a problem.  Instead, the court\r\nused conditional language to caution Hernandez that in order to get\r\nthe benefit of the safety valve, he needed to truthfully and\r\ncompletely describe his involvement in the conspiracy to government\r\nagents.  The court was thus referring to a condition within\r\nHernandez's control when he told Hernandez that \"it is in your best\r\ninterest to comply [with the conditions of 18 U.S.C.  3553(f)].\" \r\nThe court specifically pointed out to Hernandez more than once that\r\nhe would be obligated to de-brief government agents about his\r\ninvolvement in the conspiracy in order to comply with the safety\r\nvalve.  If he did so, the court indicated, he would be eligible for\r\nsentencing under the safety valve.\r\nIn United States v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 1995), we\r\nfaced an analogous situation.  When the district court, pursuant to\r\nRule 11, asked Gray whether he understood the consequences of his\r\nproffered guilty plea, Gray responded, \"Not exactly.\"  Id. at 60. \r\nIn subsequently explaining Gray's potential sentence, \"the court\r\nmistakenly stated, 'The maximum punishment is ten years to life.'\"\r\nId.  In fact, the mandatory minimum for the crime to which Gray was\r\npleading guilty was ten years; the court had no discretion to\r\nimpose a lower sentence.  Id.  We vacated Gray's conviction:\r\n  We think that the substance of what was\r\ncommunicated to Gray, specifically the\r\ndistrict court's incorrect and misleading\r\nexplanation of the mandatory minimum sentence,\r\ncould have led a reasonable person to\r\nmisunderstand the consequences of his guilty\r\nplea in this context, thus implicating one of\r\nRule 11's core concerns.\r\n\n    Although the court's error is not a\r\n\"total failure to address\" one of Rule 11's\r\ncore concerns, see Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 5,\r\nwe cannot say with any certainty that Gray's\r\nreasonable misunderstanding of his sentence\r\ndid not affect his substantial rights within\r\nthe meaning of Rule 11. . . . It seems likely,\r\nat the very least, that if Gray had clearly\r\nand accurately understood the consequences of\r\na guilty plea, he would have decided\r\ndifferently.  The court's error leading to\r\nGray's misunderstanding therefore affected\r\nGray's substantial rights, and Gray's guilty\r\nplea cannot be said to have been given\r\nvoluntarily and intelligently.\r\n\nGray, 63 F.3d at 61.\r\nA similar result obtains in this case.  Hernandez was\r\nclearly concerned with the length of his sentence before he pled\r\nguilty.  He was told that he would be eligible for a lighter\r\nsentence for which he was not eligible.  This misunderstanding\r\nimplicates one of Rule 11's core concerns (i.e., the defendant's\r\nknowledge of the consequences of his plea).  See Cotal-Crespo, 47\r\nF.3d at 4.  Hernandez's plea was unmistakably induced at least in\r\npart by an inaccurate representation by the court about the\r\nconsequences of his plea, thereby affecting his substantial rights. \r\nHis guilty plea must therefore be set aside.  See McCarthy v.\r\nUnited States, 394 U.S. 459, 466 (1969) (\"[I]f a defendant's guilty\r\nplea is not equally voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in\r\nviolation of due process and is therefore void.\"); see also United\r\nStates v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 1995); Correale v. United\r\nStates, 479 F.2d 944 (1st Cir. 1973).  \r\nAccordingly, we vacate the judgment of conviction and the\r\nsentence, set aside the guilty plea, and remand the case for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",

In order to qualify for sentencing under the safety valve, a defendant may \"not have more than 1 criminal history point.\" See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> All the participants (i.e., the prosecutor, the court, defense counsel and Hernandez) were aware that Hernandez had one prior criminal conviction at the time of the plea hearing. In November of 1995, Hernandez pled guilty to one count of simple assault in violation of Law 54 (Puerto Rico's domestic violence statute). On January 9, 1996, Hernandez was sentenced to eighteen (18) months probation pursuant to his conviction under Law 54. All of the participants correctly understood that this conviction gave Hernandez only one criminal history point. However, either they did not know or they did not appreciate the significance of the fact that Hernandez had committed the offense for which he was pleading guilty while on probation for the Puerto Rico Law 54 conviction. Under the sentencing guidelines, this fact added two more points to Hernandez's criminal history score, thereby disqualifying him from the benefits of the safety valve. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d) (\"Add 2 points [to the defendant's criminal history score] if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation . . . .\"); see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) (restricting sentencing under the safety valve to defendants that \"do[] not have more than 1 criminal history point\"). Therefore, at the time Hernandez negotiated his plea bargain with the government and at the time he entered his plea of guilty, there was no possibility that Hernandez could be sentenced to anything less than 60 months, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for the crime to which Hernandez was pleading guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1997, Hernandez's former defense counsel moved for leave to withdraw as counsel for the defendant citing irreconcilable differences. On October 19, 1997, Hernandez moved pro se for dismissal of his counsel. In addition, Hernandez requested (1) a continuance of the sentencing hearing; (2) appointment of new counsel; and (3) a hearing concerning whether Hernandez had been adequately counseled as to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement. By margin order, the district court appointed new counsel to represent Hernandez and continued the sentencing hearing until January 1998. By the time of sentencing in January 1998, Hernandez was represented by different counsel. Hernandez's new counsel did not renew or otherwise pursue Hernandez's motion for a hearing on the validity of the guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on January 22, 1998. Pursuant to the pre-sentence report, Hernandez was assigned a criminal history score of three. At sentencing, Hernandez exhibited a lack of understanding about the reasons for the unavailability of a thirty month sentence. The court responded that \"we have already discussed this; that you were -- that when I took your plea, I do think that it was very carefully explained to you, all the consequences of your plea. You agree to that, that in that sense that I did not misrepresent anything to you, correct?\" Hernandez responded that he was \"not very good at English,\" that the interpreter was speaking very fast and that he \"had already signed [the plea agreement] when you talked to me about the safety valve.\" Later in the sentencing hearing, Hernandez's counsel indicated Hernandez's belief that he had not been adequately counseled \"about the impact of [the Law 54] charge in the State courts.\" Despite this indication of a problem with Hernandez's plea, and Hernandez's earlier pro se request for a hearing on whether he had been adequately counseled about the terms and conditions of his plea agreement, the district court made no further inquiry into whether Hernandez had understood the consequences of his guilty plea at the time that it was entered, and proceeded to sentence Hernandez to the statutory minimum sentence of 60 months incarceration. Hernandez now appeals from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the acceptance of guilty pleas to federal criminal violations. Pursuant to Rule 11, in order for a plea of guilty to constitute a valid waiver of the defendant's right to trial, guilty pleas must be knowing and voluntary: \"Rule 11 was intended to ensure that a defendant who pleads guilty does so with an 'understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.'\" United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 (1969)). A breach of Rule 11 that \"implicates one of the rule's 'core concerns' mandates that the plea be set aside.\" United States v. Medina-Silverio, 30 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted). In previous cases we have identified three core concerns: \"1) absence of coercion; 2) understanding of the charges; and 3) knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea.\" Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4 (citing United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991)). Rule 11 by its terms excuses harmless errors, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h), and focuses the court's attention instead on \"whether any particular defect in the Rule 11 hearing affected the defendant's 'substantial rights.'\" United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 348 (1st Cir. 1997). In determining whether defendant's substantial rights were abridged, we consider the totality of the circumstances to determine \"what was communicated by the trial court, and what should reasonably have been understood by the defendant.\" Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the failure of Hernandez's new attorney to renew explicitly at the sentencing hearing his client's request that the district court examine Hernandez's understanding of the consequences of his plea at the time of the Rule 11 hearing, Hernandez has not waived this issue on appeal. Contrary to most allegations of error, \"a Rule 11 challenge will not be deemed waived upon a party's failure to raise it in the district court.\" United States v. Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588, 593 (1st Cir. 1991). Because of the important concerns protected by Rule 11,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we \"must determine compliance with Rule 11, even if a claim of noncompliance was never presented to the trial court.\" Id. (citation omitted). However, in recognition of the limits of appellate review, we are constrained to consider only the record that was created in the district court in considering a Rule 11 challenge on direct appeal. See id. Because Hernandez's appeal \"can be decided wholly on the basis of the formal record accumulated thus far . . . [Hernandez's] Rule 11 challenge is properly before us,\" id. at 594, and we consider it on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez alleges that he was misled by the prosecutor, the court, and his own counsel at his Rule 11 hearing and thus his guilty plea was not \"given voluntarily and intelligently.\" See United States v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 1995). On the basis of our review of the Rule 11 hearing transcript, we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor, the court and defense counsel believed that Hernandez would be eligible for sentencing under the safety valve, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f). Indeed, in explaining the terms of the plea to Hernandez, the court at two points affirmatively represented to Hernandez that his criminal history made him eligible for sentencing under the safety valve. Although the court's representations about the availability of the safety valve were phrased conditionally several times, the court assumed that Hernandez's criminal history was not a problem. Instead, the court used conditional language to caution Hernandez that in order to get the benefit of the safety valve, he needed to truthfully and completely describe his involvement in the conspiracy to government agents. The court was thus referring to a condition within Hernandez's control when he told Hernandez that \"it is in your best interest to comply [with the conditions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)].\" The court specifically pointed out to Hernandez more than once that he would be obligated to de-brief government agents about his involvement in the conspiracy in order to comply with the safety valve. If he did so, the court indicated, he would be eligible for sentencing under the safety valve.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 1995), we faced an analogous situation. When the district court, pursuant to Rule 11, asked Gray whether he understood the consequences of his proffered guilty plea, Gray responded, \"Not exactly.\" Id. at 60. In subsequently explaining Gray's potential sentence, \"the court mistakenly stated, 'The maximum punishment is ten years to life.'\" Id. In fact, the mandatory minimum for the crime to which Gray was pleading guilty was ten years; the court had no discretion to impose a lower sentence. Id. We vacated Gray's conviction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the substance of what was communicated to Gray, specifically the district court's incorrect and misleading explanation of the mandatory minimum sentence, could have led a reasonable person to misunderstand the consequences of his guilty plea in this context, thus implicating one of Rule 11's core concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the court's error is not a \"total failure to address\" one of Rule 11's core concerns, see Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 5, we cannot say with any certainty that Gray's reasonable misunderstanding of his sentence did not affect his substantial rights within the meaning of Rule 11. . . . It seems likely, at the very least, that if Gray had clearly and accurately understood the consequences of a guilty plea, he would have decided differently. The court's error leading to Gray's misunderstanding therefore affected Gray's substantial rights, and Gray's guilty plea cannot be said to have been given voluntarily and intelligently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gray, 63 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar result obtains in this case. Hernandez was clearly concerned with the length of his sentence before he pled guilty. He was told that he would be eligible for a lighter sentence for which he was not eligible. This misunderstanding implicates one of Rule 11's core concerns (i.e., the defendant's knowledge of the consequences of his plea). See Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4. Hernandez's plea was unmistakably induced at least in part by an inaccurate representation by the court about the consequences of his plea, thereby affecting his substantial rights. His guilty plea must therefore be set aside. See McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466 (1969) (\"[I]f a defendant's guilty plea is not equally voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore void.\"); see also United States v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 1995); Correale v.

The record reveals that the guilty plea accepted by the district court was the product of confusion on the part of defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the court. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Hernandez reasonably misunderstood the consequences of his guilty plea. Therefore, we must vacate the conviction and sentence, set aside the guilty plea, and remand to the district court for further proceedings. See United States v.

Hernandez originally entered a plea of not guilty, but on July 18, 1997 a change-of-plea hearing (Rule 11 hearing) was held before the district court. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c) (requiring that before a guilty plea can be accepted the district court must \"address the defendant personally in open court\" to ensure that the plea is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the defendant's constitutional rights). In part based on the government's promise to recommend that he be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), Hernandez changed his plea to guilty on Count One of the indictment, admitting to a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (conspiracy to distribute heroin).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing provision that was central to the plea agreement, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), commonly referred to in sentencing parlance as the \"safety valve,\" allows courts to sentence defendants who have little or no prior criminal history \"without regard to any statutory minimum sentence\" under certain circumstances. At the time of the July 18, 1997 Rule 11 hearing, Hernandez's defense counsel, the Assistant United States Attorney prosecuting the case, and the district court were all under the impression that Hernandez was preliminarily eligible for sentencing under the safety valve, meaning that his prison sentence could have been as low as 30 months. On the other hand, if Hernandez did not receive the benefit of the safety valve provision, the crime to which he was pleading guilty carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can best explain the handling of the \"safety valve\" provision at Hernandez's Rule 11 hearing on July 18, 1997 by quoting extensively from the hearing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court: You have a plea agreement which I have examined.

In order to qualify for sentencing under the safety valve, a defendant may \"not have more than 1 criminal history point.\" See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> All the participants (i.e., the prosecutor, the court, defense counsel and Hernandez) were aware that Hernandez had one prior criminal conviction at the time of the plea hearing. In November of 1995, Hernandez pled guilty to one count of simple assault in violation of Law 54 (Puerto Rico's domestic violence statute). On January 9, 1996, Hernandez was sentenced to eighteen (18) months probation pursuant to his conviction under Law 54. All of the participants correctly understood that this conviction gave Hernandez only one criminal history point. However, either they did not know or they did not appreciate the significance of the fact that Hernandez had committed the offense for which he was pleading guilty while on probation for the Puerto Rico Law 54 conviction. Under the sentencing guidelines, this fact added two more points to Hernandez's criminal history score, thereby disqualifying him from the benefits of the safety valve. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d) (\"Add 2 points [to the defendant's criminal history score] if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation . . . .\"); see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) (restricting sentencing under the safety valve to defendants that \"do[] not have more than 1 criminal history point\"). Therefore, at the time Hernandez negotiated his plea bargain with the government and at the time he entered his plea of guilty, there was no possibility that Hernandez could be sentenced to anything less than 60 months, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for the crime to which Hernandez was pleading guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1997, Hernandez's former defense counsel moved for leave to withdraw as counsel for the defendant citing irreconcilable differences. On October 19, 1997, Hernandez moved pro se for dismissal of his counsel. In addition, Hernandez requested (1) a continuance of the sentencing hearing; (2) appointment of new counsel; and (3) a hearing concerning whether Hernandez had been adequately counseled as to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement. By margin order, the district court appointed new counsel to represent Hernandez and continued the sentencing hearing until January 1998. By the time of sentencing in January 1998, Hernandez was represented by different counsel. Hernandez's new counsel did not renew or otherwise pursue Hernandez's motion for a hearing on the validity of the guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on January 22, 1998. Pursuant to the pre-sentence report, Hernandez was assigned a criminal history score of three. At sentencing, Hernandez exhibited a lack of understanding about the reasons for the unavailability of a thirty month sentence. The court responded that \"we have already discussed this; that you were -- that when I took your plea, I do think that it was very carefully explained to you, all the consequences of your plea. You agree to that, that in that sense that I did not misrepresent anything to you, correct?\" Hernandez responded that he was \"not very good at English,\" that the interpreter was speaking very fast and that he \"had already signed [the plea agreement] when you talked to me about the safety valve.\" Later in the sentencing hearing, Hernandez's counsel indicated Hernandez's belief that he had not been adequately counseled \"about the impact of [the Law 54] charge in the State courts.\" Despite this indication of a problem with Hernandez's plea, and Hernandez's earlier pro se request for a hearing on whether he had been adequately counseled about the terms and conditions of his plea agreement, the district court made no further inquiry into whether Hernandez had understood the consequences of his guilty plea at the time that it was entered, and proceeded to sentence Hernandez to the statutory minimum sentence of 60 months incarceration. Hernandez now appeals from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the acceptance of guilty pleas to federal criminal violations. Pursuant to Rule 11, in order for a plea of guilty to constitute a valid waiver of the defendant's right to trial, guilty pleas must be knowing and voluntary: \"Rule 11 was intended to ensure that a defendant who pleads guilty does so with an 'understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.'\" United States v. Cotal-Crespo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195871\"><a href=\"/opinion/195871/united-states-v-cotal-crespo/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting McCarthy v.

A breach of Rule 11 that \"implicates one of the rule's 'core concerns' mandates that the plea be set aside.\" United States v. Medina-Silverio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195500\"><a href=\"/opinion/195500/united-states-v-medina-silverio/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted). In previous cases we have identified three core concerns: \"1) absence of coercion; 2) understanding of the charges; and 3) knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea.\" Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4 (citing United States v. Allard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556604\"><a href=\"/opinion/556604/united-states-v-raymond-p-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991)). Rule 11 by its terms excuses harmless errors, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h), and focuses the court's attention instead on \"whether any particular defect in the Rule 11 hearing affected the defendant's 'substantial rights.'\" United States v. Marrero-Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197543\"><a href=\"/opinion/197543/united-states-v-marrero-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 348 (1st Cir. 1997). In determining whether defendant's substantial rights were abridged, we consider the totality of the circumstances to determine \"what was communicated by the trial court, and what should reasonably have been understood by the defendant.\" Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the failure of Hernandez's new attorney to renew explicitly at the sentencing hearing his client's request that the district court examine Hernandez's understanding of the consequences of his plea at the time of the Rule 11 hearing, Hernandez has not waived this issue on appeal. Contrary to most allegations of error, \"a Rule 11 challenge will not be deemed waived upon a party's failure to raise it in the district court.\" United States v. Parra-Ibanez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563642\"><a href=\"/opinion/563642/united-states-v-francisco-j-parra-ibanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 593 (1st Cir. 1991). Because of the important concerns protected by Rule 11,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we \"must determine compliance with Rule 11, even if a claim of noncompliance was never presented to the trial court.\" Id. (citation omitted). However, in recognition of the limits of appellate review, we are constrained to consider only the record that was created in the district court in considering a Rule 11 challenge on direct appeal. See id. Because Hernandez's appeal \"can be decided wholly on the basis of the formal record accumulated thus far . . . [Hernandez's] Rule 11 challenge is properly before us,\" id. at 594, and we consider it on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez alleges that he was misled by the prosecutor, the court, and his own counsel at his Rule 11 hearing and thus his guilty plea was not \"given voluntarily and intelligently.\" See United States v. Gray, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799747\"><a href=\"/opinion/799747/united-states-v-roy-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir. 1995). On the basis of our review of the Rule 11 hearing transcript, we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor, the court and defense counsel believed that Hernandez would be eligible for sentencing under the safety valve, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f). Indeed, in explaining the terms of the plea to Hernandez, the court at two points affirmatively represented to Hernandez that his criminal history made him eligible for sentencing under the safety valve. Although the court's representations about the availability of the safety valve were phrased conditionally several times, the court assumed that Hernandez's criminal history was not a problem. Instead, the court used conditional language to caution Hernandez that in order to get the benefit of the safety valve, he needed to truthfully and completely describe his involvement in the conspiracy to government agents. The court was thus referring to a condition within Hernandez's control when he told Hernandez that \"it is in your best interest to comply [with the conditions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)].\" The court specifically pointed out to Hernandez more than once that he would be obligated to de-brief government agents about his involvement in the conspiracy in order to comply with the safety valve. If he did so, the court indicated, he would be eligible for sentencing under the safety valve.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Gray, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799747\"><a href=\"/opinion/799747/united-states-v-roy-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1995), we faced an analogous situation. When the district court, pursuant to Rule 11, asked Gray whether he understood the consequences of his proffered guilty plea, Gray responded, \"Not exactly.\" Id. at 60. In subsequently explaining Gray's potential sentence, \"the court mistakenly stated, 'The maximum punishment is ten years to life.'\" Id. In fact, the mandatory minimum for the crime to which Gray was pleading guilty was ten years; the court had no discretion to impose a lower sentence. Id. We vacated Gray's conviction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the substance of what was communicated to Gray, specifically the district court's incorrect and misleading explanation of the mandatory minimum sentence, could have led a reasonable person to misunderstand the consequences of his guilty plea in this context, thus implicating one of Rule 11's core concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the court's error is not a \"total failure to address\" one of Rule 11's core concerns, see Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 5, we cannot say with any certainty that Gray's reasonable misunderstanding of his sentence did not affect his substantial rights within the meaning of Rule 11. . . . It seems likely, at the very least, that if Gray had clearly and accurately understood the consequences of a guilty plea, he would have decided differently. The court's error leading to Gray's misunderstanding therefore affected Gray's substantial rights, and Gray's guilty plea cannot be said to have been given voluntarily and intelligently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gray, 63 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar result obtains in this case. Hernandez was clearly concerned with the length of his sentence before he pled guilty. He was told that he would be eligible for a lighter sentence for which he was not eligible. This misunderstanding implicates one of Rule 11's core concerns (i.e., the defendant's knowledge of the consequences of his plea). See Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4. Hernandez's plea was unmistakably induced at least in part by an inaccurate representation by the court about the consequences of his plea, thereby affecting his substantial rights. His guilty plea must therefore be set aside. See McCarthy v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107892\"><a href=\"/opinion/107892/mccarthy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span>, 466 (1969) (\"[I]f a defendant's guilty plea is not equally voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore void.\"); see also United States v.
