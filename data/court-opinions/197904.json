In these circumstances, we need not\r\ndetermine the validity of any additional departure grounds, as\r\nwe are convinced that excision of the challenged grounds would\r\nnot have altered the sentence imposed.  See United States v.\r\nBrewster, 127 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    We also conclude that the district court did not clearly\r\nerr in denying an adjustment under U.S.S.G.  3B1.2 for\r\ndefendant's role in the offense.  The finding that defendant's\r\nrole was neither minimal nor minor was well supported by the\r\ninformation about defendant's multiple cross-country deliveries\r\nof large quantities of marijuana.\r\n    Affirmed.
