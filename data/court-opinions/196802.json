We  will  not   reweigh  the  factors\r\n\nconsidered by the district court; nor can we say as a  matter\r\n\nof  law  that  defendant's  letter  to  the  victim  was  not\r\n\nthreatening   and   inconsistent   with  an   acceptance   of\r\n\nresponsibility  as contemplated  by  U.S.S.G.    3E1.1.
