After   a  jury  trial,  appellant  Luis\r                            \r\n\nRodriguez-Carmona  was convicted of  aiding and  abetting the\r\n\nimportation  and   possession  of  heroin   with  intent   to\r\n\ndistribute in violation of  21 U.S.C.    841(a), 952,  and 18\r\n\nU.S.C.     2.    He  was  sentenced  to  sixty-three  months'\r\n\nimprisonment   and   five   years  of   supervised   release.\r\n\nProceeding pro se  on appeal, appellant seeks to overturn his\r                             \r\n\nconviction  due  to  alleged  prosecutorial   misconduct  and\r\n\nineffective  assistance of  defense counsel.   We  affirm the\r\n\nconviction, but  we decline to  reach appellant's ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel claims.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     Because appellant does not  challenge the sufficiency of\r\n\nthe evidence, we provide a neutral summary of the evidence to\r\n\nenable  us  to  determine  whether  the  events  about  which\r\n\nappellant  complains on appeal  were harmless or prejudicial.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., United States  v. Morla-Trinidad,  100 F.3d  1, 2\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996);  United States  v. Hardy, 37  F.3d 753,  755\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).  \r\n\n     Acting in  response to  an intelligence alert,  two U.S.\r\n\nCustoms  inspectors identified  appellant  and Edward  Iba ez\r\n\nCosme (Iba ez), when they arrived at Puerto Rico's Luis Mu oz\r\n\nMar n  International  Airport  on  a  flight   from  Caracas,\r\n\nVenezuela.   Upon  inquiring  where  he should  go  to  clear\r\n\ncustoms, Iba ez was taken for a secondary inspection.  During\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthe course of this inspection a customs inspector performed a\r\n\npat-down   search  and  identified   something  concealed  in\r\n\nIba ez's crotch.  When instructed  to lower his pants, Iba ez\r\n\nstated, \"me  mangaste, you caught me\" and  revealed a package\r\n\ncontaining  36  pellets  of  heroin similar  to  those  often\r\n\nswallowed by drug smugglers.  Iba ez was immediately arrested\r\n\nand  given  the  Miranda  warnings.    He  told  the  customs\r                                    \r\n\ninspectors  that he was  travelling alone and  that the drugs\r\n\nbelonged to him.  \r\n\n     After  the  heroin had  been found  on Iba ez,  a senior\r\n\ncustoms  inspector took  appellant to a  secondary inspection\r\n\narea for questioning  and examination of his  luggage.  Seven\r\n\nWestern Union money transfer receipts bearing appellant's and\r\n\nIba ez's names were  found in appellant's bag,  five of which\r\n\nhad been signed by Iba ez.  Although appellant  had initially\r\n\nstated that he was  travelling alone, when questioned further\r\n\nhe  said that Iba ez had  given him the  receipts.  Appellant\r\n\nwas also placed under arrest and taken with Iba ez to a local\r\n\nhospital for x-rays, which proved negative.1\r                                                       1\r\n\n     Appellant  and   Iba ez  were  both  indicted   on  drug\r\n\ntrafficking charges.   Shortly  before trial,  Iba ez entered\r\n\ninto a plea agreement.  He thereafter became the government's\r\n\nstar witness  at appellant's trial.   After acknowledging the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1At the  hospital, Iba ez encountered  a male acquaintance\r               1\r\nand told him that he had been caught drug trafficking.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nplea  agreement, which  was admitted  into evidence,  and the\r\n\nfact that  he could be prosecuted for perjury if he failed to\r\n\ntell the  truth, Iba ez  testified at  some length  about his\r\n\npast criminal  exploits  -  without  objection  from  defense\r\n\ncounsel.2  \r                    2\r\n\n     Iba ez  then described  two smuggling  ventures that  he\r\n\nclaimed to  have undertaken  on appellant's  behalf.  In  the\r\n\nfirst  such venture, Iba ez and a friend went to Venezuela to\r\n\nprocure  a heroin sample for appellant.  As the return flight\r\n\nto Puerto Rico was  delayed, appellant wired Iba ez  money so\r\n\nthat he and his friend could  fly to Puerto Rico first class.\r\n\nIba ez identified one of the  Western Union receipts that had\r\n\nbeen found  in appellant's  luggage  as the  receipt for  the\r\n\nfunds that had been used for the return plane tickets on that\r\n\noccasion.   He claimed that he delivered 10 pellets of heroin\r\n\nto appellant as a result of this trip.  Iba ez testified that\r\n\nthe heroin that he  delivered to appellant was supplied  by a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2The  prosecutor first elicited  Iba ez's criminal record,\r               2\r\nwhich  included  convictions for  theft  of  a toolbox,  auto\r\ntheft, and contempt.   In an effort  to minimize the  risk of\r\nimpeachment   on   cross-examination,  the   prosecutor  next\r\nrequired Iba ez to describe  his criminal activities that had\r\nnot resulted in  convictions.  Iba ez then  testified that he\r\nhad transported drugs to Spain via Puerto  Rico the preceding\r\nNovember  and  that  he  had  participated  in  an  elaborate\r\nescapade  which  included  a hold-up  of  a  gas  station, an\r\nensuing  shoot-out,  hit-and-run, carjacking,  and automobile\r\ncrash,  after  which Iba ez and his cohorts eluded the police\r\nby escaping through a waterfall.  While the trial judge twice\r\nconvened bench conferences to  question the relevance of this\r\ntestimony, defense counsel raised no objection to it.     \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nColombian,  Cesar  Augusto Buendia,  and  that  the remaining\r\n\nWestern Union receipts found in appellant's luggage reflected\r\n\ndrug payments that appellant had made to Buendia.3  \r                                                             3\r\n\n     With regard  to  the  second  smuggling  venture,  which\r\n\nresulted  in  the arrests  of  Iba ez  and appellant,  Iba ez\r\n\ntestified that he recruited his cousin Jose Iba ez  (Jose) to\r\n\nassist  in carrying the  drugs but that  Jose did not  have a\r\n\npassport.  As a result all three men - appellant, Iba ez, and\r\n\nJose - travelled to  Connecticut to secure passports so  that\r\n\nthey could travel to  Venezuela and return carrying  drugs to\r\n\nPuerto Rico.4   Because  Iba ez informed the  passport agency\r                        4\r\n\nthat the  three were  scheduled to  travel to  Venezuela very\r\n\nsoon, the agency  issued the  men passports on  the very  day\r\n\nthat  they  applied for  them.   The  three then  returned to\r\n\nPuerto Rico and left for Venezuela on March 22, 1995.\r\n\n     Iba ez  related that after  staying in Venezuela briefly\r\n\nthe  three men travelled to Colombia and checked into a hotel\r\n\nin  accordance  with  the  instructions  of  their  supplier,\r\n\nBuendia.    Eventually,  Buendia  caused  the  heroin  to  be\r\n\ndelivered to appellant's hotel  room, where Iba ez washed the\r\n\npellets and  divided them  into two  packages.   According to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   3Iba ez described how appellant  sent him to Western Union\r               3\r\non multiple occasions to wire money to Buendia. \r\n\n   4Iba ez  testified  that it  was  necessary  to travel  to\r               4\r\nConnecticut, where Jose had been born, to secure Jose's birth\r\ncertificate for his passport application.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nIba ez, appellant  was present when the  heroin was delivered\r\n\nand while  he  was  packaging  it.    Iba ez  testified  that\r\n\nappellant had business at  his drug point in Puerto  Rico, so\r\n\nhe and Iba ez decided to return there with the heroin.   Jose\r\n\nwas  left behind  to return  later with  two pairs  of tennis\r\n\nshoes that were being loaded with heroin.  \r\n\n     Iba ez  testified  that, initially,  Iba ez body-carried\r\n\none  package  with  20  pellets of  heroin,  while  appellant\r\n\ncarried a  similar package with 16 pellets.  Appellant became\r\n\nscared  after their  luggage was  searched at  the Venezuelan\r\n\nborder, so  he  instructed Iba ez  to  carry all  the  heroin\r\n\nthereafter.  The two flew to Caracas and from there to Puerto\r\n\nRico  without  incident.    Upon  arriving  in  Puerto  Rico,\r\n\nappellant  instructed Iba ez  to go  up front  to be  checked\r\n\nfirst.  Iba ez testified that although he initially  told the\r\n\nauthorities that the drugs were his, in fact they belonged to\r\n\nappellant. \r\n\n      Iba ez's  testimony was  corroborated by  the passports\r\n\nand  plane  tickets  of  appellant  and  Iba ez,  which  were\r\n\nadmitted  into   evidence,  and  the  testimony   of  Richard\r\n\nHerdmann, a  senior customs  supervisor.   Herdmann testified\r\n\nthat  after Iba ez had been found with the heroin, he noticed\r\n\nthat  the  defendants'  passports  and  plane   tickets  bore\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nsequential numbers  interrupted by  one digit.5   As Herdmann\r                                                          5\r\n\nwas responsible  for  determining whether  any other  persons\r\n\nwere  involved  in drug  trafficking,  he  made inquiries  to\r\n\ndetermine who  had been issued the passport  and plane ticket\r\n\nwith the intervening numbers.   Herdmann testified that these\r\n\nitems had been  issued to Jose, but  that he had not  boarded\r\n\nthe plane in Venezuela.6    \r                                   6\r\n\n     Appellant  did  not  testify  at his  trial.    Although\r\n\ndefense counsel  had announced that Jose  would be testifying\r\n\nin appellant's  defense, the  record indicates that  Jose was\r\n\narrested  at the outset of appellant's trial and charged with\r\n\nthe same  crime as appellant  (i.e., aiding and  abetting the\r\n\nimportation of heroin), and conspiring to import heroin. Jose\r\n\nwas  never called as a  witness.7  Defense  counsel relied on\r                                            7\r\n\nexcerpts  from  the testimony  of  the  customs officers  and\r\n\nIba ez  to argue  that Iba ez  acted alone  in  the smuggling\r\n\nendeavor  and that  appellant  was a  legitimate  businessman\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   5Iba ez's   passport  bore  the   number  140533715  while\r               5\r\nappellant's passport bore  number 140533717.  Both  passports\r\nhad  been issued in Connecticut on March 3, 1995.  Similarly,\r\nIba ez's  plane ticket for  his return flight  to Puerto Rico\r\nbore a number  ending in 10,  while appellant's plane  ticket\r\nended in 12.   \r\n\n   6Herdmann also ascertained  that Jose's passport  had been\r               6\r\nissued  at the same time and place  as those of appellant and\r\nIba ez. \r\n\n   7It is undisputed that Jose was tried after  appellant and\r               7\r\nacquitted on all  charges. See United States v.  Jose Iba ez-\r                                                                         \r\nMaldonado, #95-CR-195(SEC). \r                     \r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nunaware of the drug venture.  The jury rejected this defense.\r\n\nRemaining facts  will  be discussed  in  the context  of  the\r\n\narguments that appellant raises.      \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     On appeal, appellant asserts that the prosecutor pursued\r\n\na   \"carefully  tailored\"  strategy   that  was  designed  to\r\n\nimpermissibly  bolster  the credibility  of  the government's\r\n\nchief  witness  (Iba ez),   while  simultaneously   depriving\r\n\nappellant  of his  own star  witness (Jose).  Consistent with\r\n\nthis general  theme, appellant  contends that  his conviction\r\n\nshould be reversed on three grounds.  First, appellant argues\r\n\nthat certain remarks that the prosecutor made in his rebuttal\r\n\nargument improperly vouched for the credibility of Iba ez and\r\n\nexpressed the  prosecutor's personal opinion  about how  drug\r\n\ntraffickers  work.    Second,  appellant  contends  that  the\r\n\nprosecutor violated his Sixth  Amendment right to  compulsory\r\n\nprocess by arresting Jose  solely to cause him to  invoke his\r\n\nprivilege   against  self-incrimination,   thereby  depriving\r\n\nappellant of his testimony.  Finally, appellant contends that\r\n\nhe  was  deprived  of  the effective  assistance  of  counsel\r\n\nbecause  his trial  counsel  failed to  move to  suppress the\r\n\nevidence seized by the customs officers and further failed to\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nprotect  appellant's  right to  compulsory process  by taking\r\n\nsteps to ameliorate the government's arrest of Jose.  \r\n\n     We first examine the prosecutor's conduct, mindful  that\r\n\nbecause defense counsel did not object to it below, we review\r\n\nonly for plain  error. See, e.g., United  States v. Sullivan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n85 F.3d  743, 751 (1st Cir.  1996).  This means  that we must\r\n\nview the prosecutor's  conduct in the  context of the  entire\r\n\ntrial  and that we may reverse only  if we conclude that, \"'a\r\n\nmiscarriage of  justice would  otherwise result,'\" or  that a\r\n\nplain error \"'seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or\r\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nOlano, 507  U.S. 725,  736 (1993)(citations omitted);  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Josleyn,  99  F.3d  1182,  1197 (1st  Cir.  1996).\r                              \r\n\nAppellant has failed to meet this \"hard-to-satisfy standard.\"\r\n\nUnited States v.

Defense counsel's  closing\r\n\nargument  implied  that  Iba ez  had  changed  his  story  to\r\n\nincriminate appellant only after he executed the government's\r                                            \r\n\nplea agreement.8  Appellant  now contends that the prosecutor\r                           8\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   8Referring to Iba ez, defense counsel argued that, \"it was\r               8\r\nnot until  the  government made  a  plea agreement  with  him\r\n[that] he reverted (sic) his testimony.\"\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nengaged  in  improper witness-vouching  when he  attempted to\r\n\nrebut defense counsel's insinuation  by referring to the plea\r\n\nagreement as follows:\r\n\n          ....  that piece  of  evidence  ...  will\r\n          reflect  that  definitely Mr.  Iba ez was\r\n          fully debriefed and examined prior to the\r\n          signing  of the plea  agreement.   So the\r                                                               \r\n          government    already     heard,    knew,\r                                                               \r\n          investigated,   and    corroborated   the\r                                                               \r\n          information  given by Iba ez prior to the\r                                                               \r\n          signing of  the plea agreement  and prior\r                                                    \r\n          to bringing him here to  testify [to] the\r\n          facts to you.  Simply it did not become a\r\n          magic  act as  presented by  defendant in\r\n          saying that after the plea  agreement was\r\n          made then he changed his -- his  version.\r\n          No. \r\n\n          These things  are investigated thoroughly\r                                                               \r\n          first before  even thinking of  signing a\r                                                               \r\n          plea   agreement,  corroborated   by  the\r                                                               \r\n          agency  and also  investigated.

Just don't\r\n          take  a word  of mouth  explanation. Just\r\n          read   the   evidence.   It's  there   in\r\n          evidence.    So  you will  know  how this\r\n          takes place, and that will assist  you in\r\n          reaching the truth in your deliberations.\r\n          (emphasis supplied). \r\n\n     \"[A] prosecutor  may not  imply that the  government has\r\n\ninculpatory  information that  is not  in evidence.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nTajjedini,  996 F.2d  at  1284 (\"it  is  ... improper  for  a\r                     \r\n\nprosecutor  to insert  his own  credibility or  opinions into\r\n\nargument\").   \r\n\n     Nevertheless,  we  do  not  think  that   these  remarks\r\n\nconstitute plain error,  for the record  suggests that it  is\r\n\nhighly unlikely that  appellant was prejudiced by them.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nOlano,  507 U.S.  at 735  (specific showing  of prejudice  is\r                 \r\n\nnormally required  to establish plain error).10   To be sure,\r                                                         10\r\n\nthe government's case hinged  upon the credibility of Iba ez,\r\n\nand  the government could ill afford  to vouch improperly for\r\n\nhim.    Nevertheless, both  of  the  remarks challenged  here\r\n\nappear to be instances of  accidental overkill rather than  a\r\n\ndeliberate attempt  to mislead the jury.

The  weight of  the\r\nevidence  of guilt or innocence is  the most important factor\r\nin this  analysis. See  Arrieta-Agressot v. United  States, 3\r                                                                      \r\nF.3d 525, 528 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nwas,  in  fact,  corroborated   by  the  plane  tickets,  the\r\n\npassports, and the Western Union receipts that had been found\r\n\nin  appellant's  luggage.    We think  it  likely  that  this\r\n\nevidence   was  the   outside  corroboration  to   which  the\r\n\nprosecutor  referred  in  his  remarks  concerning  the  plea\r\n\nagreement  and that the jury understood as much.  Finally, we\r\n\nnote that the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that\r\n\nthe arguments of counsel do not constitute  evidence and that\r\n\nits  decision was to  be based  on the  evidence alone.   The\r\n\nrecord  indicates  that  the  jury  returned  three questions\r\n\nbefore  reaching  its   verdict,  thus  indicating   that  it\r\n\ncarefully deliberated  over the elements of  the offenses and\r\n\ndid  not simply  accept  the prosecutor's  arguments at  face\r\n\nvalue.11   We think this  sound evidence that the jury obeyed\r                  11\r\n\nthe court's instructions to resolve the case on  the evidence\r\n\nand was not seduced to convict on speculation prompted by the\r\n\nprosecutor's rebuttal.   Accordingly, we  are confident  that\r\n\nthe prosecutor's improper remarks did not so poison the trial\r\n\nas to require reversal for plain error.12\r                                                   12\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   11The jury  requested a  copy of the  court's instructions\r               11\r\nand  the relevant statutes.  It also requested that the court\r\nclearly  define the  term  \"possession\" and  a  copy of  that\r\nportion  of  Iba ez's  testimony   wherein  he  alleged  that\r\nappellant had instructed him to carry all of the heroin. \r\n\n   12Appellant  also contends that  the prosecutor improperly\r               12\r\nelicited evidence of Iba ez's prior bad  acts under the guise\r\nof  fulfilling  the  plea  agreement's  requirement  that  he\r\ntestify truthfully and  that the trial judge should  not have\r\nadmitted  this testimony.  See  note 2, supra.  We agree that\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nThe Arrest of Jose   \r                              \r\n\n     Appellant next contends that the prosecutor violated his\r\n\nSixth Amendment right to  compulsory process by arresting his\r\n\nstar  witness, Jose Iba ez, solely  as a ploy  to prevent him\r\n\nfrom  testifying  for  the  defense.    In  a  related  vein,\r\n\nappellant contends that  defense counsel rendered ineffective\r\n\nassistance  because he failed to  object to Jose's arrest and\r\n\nfailed  to seek a court  order that granted  Jose immunity or\r\n\nrequired that the government do so.  Both  claims rely on the\r\n\nfollowing  additional facts,  some  of which  are beyond  the\r\n\nscope  of  the  record  but  are  conceded  as  true  by  the\r\n\ngovernment.13    \r                       13\r\n\n     It appears  that Jose arrived in Puerto  Rico three days\r\n\nafter  appellant and  Iba ez were  arrested and  that he  was\r\n\nimmediately   questioned   and   released  by   the   customs\r\n\nauthorities, who found  no drugs.   A few  months later,  and\r\n\napproximately eleven  days  before appellant's  trial  began,\r\n\nIba ez agreed to plead guilty and testify for the government.\r\n\nShortly thereafter, defense counsel announced that Jose would\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nmuch  of this evidence might have been excluded.  But defense\r\ncounsel raised  no objection to  its admission.   Instead, he\r\nrelied on  it as grounds for  attacking Iba ez's credibility.\r\nAs Iba ez's criminal exploits were just as likely to make the\r\njury disbelieve  him as otherwise, we cannot say admission of\r\nthis evidence was plain error.\r\n\n   13These  facts pertain  to appellant's  compulsory process\r               13\r\nclaim  and  one  of  his ineffective  assistance  of  counsel\r\nclaims.  The latter is discussed in part IV, infra.\r                                                              \r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nbe called  as a witness  for the defense.14   As noted above,\r                                                     14\r\n\nJose was arrested on the first day of appellant's trial, when\r\n\nhe arrived at the courthouse to testify for appellant.\r\n\n     The record discloses that after announcing that Jose had\r\n\nbeen arrested,  the Assistant  United States Attorney  (AUSA)\r\n\nimmediately agreed to make  Jose available to defense counsel\r\n\nto interview and call  as a witness.   He also observed  that\r\n\nJose would  probably reevaluate with his  own counsel whether\r\n\nhe wished  to testify.  (Tr. 9-11).    Defense counsel  never\r\n\nobjected to Jose's  arrest.  Instead,  he proceeded with  the\r\n\ntrial and made no complaints about a violation of appellant's\r\n\nright  to compulsory  process.   Appellant alleges  that \"the\r\n\nscuffle created  by\" Jose's arrest prevented  defense counsel\r\n\nfrom calling him as a witness.  He has submitted an affidavit\r\n\nfrom his trial counsel to support this assertion.15\r                                                             15\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   14This  is  apparent  from  defense  counsel's  motion  to\r               14\r\ncontinue  the  trial  (original  paper  #28).    That  motion\r\nindicates that  defense counsel  first interviewed  a witness\r\nwho  could provide  exculpatory  testimony on  June 7,  1995,\r\ni.e., five days after  Iba ez executed his plea agreement  on\r\nJune 2, 1995.  We presume that the witness identified  in the\r\nmotion is Jose.\r\n\n   15Defense  counsel averred that  Jose could  have provided\r               15\r\nmaterial, exculpatory testimony to the effect that he did not\r\nobserve any  drug-related activities by  appellant during the\r\ntime  that they spent together  in Venezuela.   Once Jose was\r\narrested,  counsel  believed  that  his  ethical  obligations\r\nprohibited  him  from  contacting  Jose until  after  he  was\r\nproperly represented by  counsel.  Counsel swore  that due to\r\nthe fact that he was \"heavily engaged\" in appellant's defense\r\nduring the course of the two-day trial, it was impossible for\r\nhim to ascertain the  status of Jose's case or  to coordinate\r\nwith  Jose's  counsel  to   address  Jose's  Fifth  Amendment\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n     Appellant now complains  that the  only explanation  for\r\n\nthe timing  of the arrest is  that it was  designed to compel\r\n\nJose to  invoke his privilege  against self-incrimination and\r\n\nthereby deprive appellant of his testimony.16  At the  outset\r                                                       16\r\n\nwe  are compelled to observe  that this claim  was not raised\r\n\nbelow.    A strong  argument  can be  made that  it  has been\r\n\nwaived.   Cf. United  States v.  Theresius Filippi, 918  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n244, 246  (1st Cir.  1990)(holding defendant waived  right to\r\n\ncompulsory  process when defense  counsel decided  to proceed\r\n\nwith trial without material witness).   But as the government\r\n\ndoes not  make  this argument,  we  will give  appellant  the\r\n\nbenefit  of the doubt and assume the claim was forfeited, not\r\n\nwaived. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34 (discussing distinction\r                             \r\n\nbetween  \"waiver\"  and \"forfeiture\").    This  benefit is  of\r\n\nlittle moment, for the record, even as supplemented, does not\r\n\nestablish  that the  arrest of  Jose was  a plain  error that\r\n\nviolated appellant's right to compulsory process.    \r\n\n     In  order  to  make out  a  violation  of  the right  to\r\n\ncompulsory  process,  the  appellant  must  show  that  \"some\r\n\ncontested  act  or omission  (1)  can  be  attributed to  the\r\n\nsovereign and  (2) causes  the loss  or erosion  of testimony\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nconcerns.  Counsel's affidavit  concludes with  the assertion\r\nthat \"these circumstances prevented  me from calling ... Jose\r\n...  as a witness despite  the fact that  his testimony could\r\nha[ve] changed the outcome of the trial.\" \r\n\n   16Appellant says that this  conclusion is bolstered by the\r               16\r\nfact that Jose was ultimately acquitted on all charges. \r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\nwhich  is both (3) material to  the case and (4) favorable to\r\n\nthe accused.\" United  States v.

For while it is clear  that the\r\n\ngovernment  is responsible  for  Jose's arrest,  and we  will\r\n\nassume, for  the sake  of argument  only, that his  testimony\r\n\nwould have  been material and exculpatory,  the record simply\r\n\ndoes  not  show that  the arrest  caused  the loss  of Jose's\r\n\ntestimony.  Defense  counsel never subpoenaed  Jose.  He  did\r\n\nnot  even ascertain  that, if  subpoenaed, Jose  would indeed\r\n\ninvoke   the  Fifth   Amendment  and   decline   to  testify.\r\n\nConsequently,  it  is not  at  all clear  that  Jose's arrest\r\n\nactually rendered his testimony unavailable.  Accordingly, we\r\n\ncannot say that this arrest was a \"plain error\" that violated\r\n\nappellant's right  to compulsory process.   Cf.

Upon  inquiring  where  he should  go  to  clear\r\n\ncustoms, Iba ez was taken for a secondary inspection.  During\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthe course of this inspection a customs inspector performed a\r\n\npat-down   search  and  identified   something  concealed  in\r\n\nIba ez's crotch.  When instructed  to lower his pants, Iba ez\r\n\nstated, \"me  mangaste, you caught me\" and  revealed a package\r\n\ncontaining  36  pellets  of  heroin similar  to  those  often\r\n\nswallowed by drug smugglers.  Iba ez was immediately arrested\r\n\nand  given  the  Miranda  warnings.    He  told  the  customs\r                                    \r\n\ninspectors  that he was  travelling alone and  that the drugs\r\n\nbelonged to him.  \r\n\n     After  the  heroin had  been found  on Iba ez,  a senior\r\n\ncustoms  inspector took  appellant to a  secondary inspection\r\n\narea for questioning  and examination of his  luggage.  Seven\r\n\nWestern Union money transfer receipts bearing appellant's and\r\n\nIba ez's names were  found in appellant's bag,  five of which\r\n\nhad been signed by Iba ez.  Although appellant  had initially\r\n\nstated that he was  travelling alone, when questioned further\r\n\nhe  said that Iba ez had  given him the  receipts.  Appellant\r\n\nwas also placed under arrest and taken with Iba ez to a local\r\n\nhospital for x-rays, which proved negative.1\r                                                       1\r\n\n     Appellant  and   Iba ez  were  both  indicted   on  drug\r\n\ntrafficking charges.   Shortly  before trial,  Iba ez entered\r\n\ninto a plea agreement.  He thereafter became the government's\r\n\nstar witness  at appellant's trial.   After acknowledging the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1At the  hospital, Iba ez encountered  a male acquaintance\r               1\r\nand told him that he had been caught drug trafficking.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nplea  agreement, which  was admitted  into evidence,  and the\r\n\nfact that  he could be prosecuted for perjury if he failed to\r\n\ntell the  truth, Iba ez  testified at  some length  about his\r\n\npast criminal  exploits  -  without  objection  from  defense\r\n\ncounsel.2  \r                    2\r\n\n     Iba ez  then described  two smuggling  ventures that  he\r\n\nclaimed to  have undertaken  on appellant's  behalf.  In  the\r\n\nfirst  such venture, Iba ez and a friend went to Venezuela to\r\n\nprocure  a heroin sample for appellant.  As the return flight\r\n\nto Puerto Rico was  delayed, appellant wired Iba ez  money so\r\n\nthat he and his friend could  fly to Puerto Rico first class.\r\n\nIba ez identified one of the  Western Union receipts that had\r\n\nbeen found  in appellant's  luggage  as the  receipt for  the\r\n\nfunds that had been used for the return plane tickets on that\r\n\noccasion.   He claimed that he delivered 10 pellets of heroin\r\n\nto appellant as a result of this trip.  Iba ez testified that\r\n\nthe heroin that he  delivered to appellant was supplied  by a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2The  prosecutor first elicited  Iba ez's criminal record,\r               2\r\nwhich  included  convictions for  theft  of  a toolbox,  auto\r\ntheft, and contempt.   In an effort  to minimize the  risk of\r\nimpeachment   on   cross-examination,  the   prosecutor  next\r\nrequired Iba ez to describe  his criminal activities that had\r\nnot resulted in  convictions.  Iba ez then  testified that he\r\nhad transported drugs to Spain via Puerto  Rico the preceding\r\nNovember  and  that  he  had  participated  in  an  elaborate\r\nescapade  which  included  a hold-up  of  a  gas  station, an\r\nensuing  shoot-out,  hit-and-run, carjacking,  and automobile\r\ncrash,  after  which Iba ez and his cohorts eluded the police\r\nby escaping through a waterfall.  While the trial judge twice\r\nconvened bench conferences to  question the relevance of this\r\ntestimony, defense counsel raised no objection to it.     \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nColombian,  Cesar  Augusto Buendia,  and  that  the remaining\r\n\nWestern Union receipts found in appellant's luggage reflected\r\n\ndrug payments that appellant had made to Buendia.3  \r                                                             3\r\n\n     With regard  to  the  second  smuggling  venture,  which\r\n\nresulted  in  the arrests  of  Iba ez  and appellant,  Iba ez\r\n\ntestified that he recruited his cousin Jose Iba ez  (Jose) to\r\n\nassist  in carrying the  drugs but that  Jose did not  have a\r\n\npassport.  As a result all three men - appellant, Iba ez, and\r\n\nJose - travelled to  Connecticut to secure passports so  that\r\n\nthey could travel to  Venezuela and return carrying  drugs to\r\n\nPuerto Rico.4   Because  Iba ez informed the  passport agency\r                        4\r\n\nthat the  three were  scheduled to  travel to  Venezuela very\r\n\nsoon, the agency  issued the  men passports on  the very  day\r\n\nthat  they  applied for  them.   The  three then  returned to\r\n\nPuerto Rico and left for Venezuela on March 22, 1995.\r\n\n     Iba ez  related that after  staying in Venezuela briefly\r\n\nthe  three men travelled to Colombia and checked into a hotel\r\n\nin  accordance  with  the  instructions  of  their  supplier,\r\n\nBuendia.    Eventually,  Buendia  caused  the  heroin  to  be\r\n\ndelivered to appellant's hotel  room, where Iba ez washed the\r\n\npellets and  divided them  into two  packages.   According to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   3Iba ez described how appellant  sent him to Western Union\r               3\r\non multiple occasions to wire money to Buendia. \r\n\n   4Iba ez  testified  that it  was  necessary  to travel  to\r               4\r\nConnecticut, where Jose had been born, to secure Jose's birth\r\ncertificate for his passport application.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nIba ez, appellant  was present when the  heroin was delivered\r\n\nand while  he  was  packaging  it.    Iba ez  testified  that\r\n\nappellant had business at  his drug point in Puerto  Rico, so\r\n\nhe and Iba ez decided to return there with the heroin.   Jose\r\n\nwas  left behind  to return  later with  two pairs  of tennis\r\n\nshoes that were being loaded with heroin.  \r\n\n     Iba ez  testified  that, initially,  Iba ez body-carried\r\n\none  package  with  20  pellets of  heroin,  while  appellant\r\n\ncarried a  similar package with 16 pellets.  Appellant became\r\n\nscared  after their  luggage was  searched at  the Venezuelan\r\n\nborder, so  he  instructed Iba ez  to  carry all  the  heroin\r\n\nthereafter.  The two flew to Caracas and from there to Puerto\r\n\nRico  without  incident.    Upon  arriving  in  Puerto  Rico,\r\n\nappellant  instructed Iba ez  to go  up front  to be  checked\r\n\nfirst.  Iba ez testified that although he initially  told the\r\n\nauthorities that the drugs were his, in fact they belonged to\r\n\nappellant. \r\n\n      Iba ez's  testimony was  corroborated by  the passports\r\n\nand  plane  tickets  of  appellant  and  Iba ez,  which  were\r\n\nadmitted  into   evidence,  and  the  testimony   of  Richard\r\n\nHerdmann, a  senior customs  supervisor.   Herdmann testified\r\n\nthat  after Iba ez had been found with the heroin, he noticed\r\n\nthat  the  defendants'  passports  and  plane   tickets  bore\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nsequential numbers  interrupted by  one digit.5   As Herdmann\r                                                          5\r\n\nwas responsible  for  determining whether  any other  persons\r\n\nwere  involved  in drug  trafficking,  he  made inquiries  to\r\n\ndetermine who  had been issued the passport  and plane ticket\r\n\nwith the intervening numbers.   Herdmann testified that these\r\n\nitems had been  issued to Jose, but  that he had not  boarded\r\n\nthe plane in Venezuela.6    \r                                   6\r\n\n     Appellant  did  not  testify  at his  trial.    Although\r\n\ndefense counsel  had announced that Jose  would be testifying\r\n\nin appellant's  defense, the  record indicates that  Jose was\r\n\narrested  at the outset of appellant's trial and charged with\r\n\nthe same  crime as appellant  (i.e., aiding and  abetting the\r\n\nimportation of heroin), and conspiring to import heroin. Jose\r\n\nwas  never called as a  witness.7  Defense  counsel relied on\r                                            7\r\n\nexcerpts  from  the testimony  of  the  customs officers  and\r\n\nIba ez  to argue  that Iba ez  acted alone  in  the smuggling\r\n\nendeavor  and that  appellant  was a  legitimate  businessman\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   5Iba ez's   passport  bore  the   number  140533715  while\r               5\r\nappellant's passport bore  number 140533717.  Both  passports\r\nhad  been issued in Connecticut on March 3, 1995.  Similarly,\r\nIba ez's  plane ticket for  his return flight  to Puerto Rico\r\nbore a number  ending in 10,  while appellant's plane  ticket\r\nended in 12.   \r\n\n   6Herdmann also ascertained  that Jose's passport  had been\r               6\r\nissued  at the same time and place  as those of appellant and\r\nIba ez. \r\n\n   7It is undisputed that Jose was tried after  appellant and\r               7\r\nacquitted on all  charges. See United States v.  Jose Iba ez-\r                                                                         \r\nMaldonado, #95-CR-195(SEC). \r                     \r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nunaware of the drug venture.  The jury rejected this defense.\r\n\nRemaining facts  will  be discussed  in  the context  of  the\r\n\narguments that appellant raises.      \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     On appeal, appellant asserts that the prosecutor pursued\r\n\na   \"carefully  tailored\"  strategy   that  was  designed  to\r\n\nimpermissibly  bolster  the credibility  of  the government's\r\n\nchief  witness  (Iba ez),   while  simultaneously   depriving\r\n\nappellant  of his  own star  witness (Jose).  Consistent with\r\n\nthis general  theme, appellant  contends that  his conviction\r\n\nshould be reversed on three grounds.  First, appellant argues\r\n\nthat certain remarks that the prosecutor made in his rebuttal\r\n\nargument improperly vouched for the credibility of Iba ez and\r\n\nexpressed the  prosecutor's personal opinion  about how  drug\r\n\ntraffickers  work.    Second,  appellant  contends  that  the\r\n\nprosecutor violated his Sixth  Amendment right to  compulsory\r\n\nprocess by arresting Jose  solely to cause him to  invoke his\r\n\nprivilege   against  self-incrimination,   thereby  depriving\r\n\nappellant of his testimony.  Finally, appellant contends that\r\n\nhe  was  deprived  of  the effective  assistance  of  counsel\r\n\nbecause  his trial  counsel  failed to  move to  suppress the\r\n\nevidence seized by the customs officers and further failed to\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nprotect  appellant's  right to  compulsory process  by taking\r\n\nsteps to ameliorate the government's arrest of Jose.  \r\n\n     We first examine the prosecutor's conduct, mindful  that\r\n\nbecause defense counsel did not object to it below, we review\r\n\nonly for plain  error.

We think  it  likely  that  this\r\n\nevidence   was  the   outside  corroboration  to   which  the\r\n\nprosecutor  referred  in  his  remarks  concerning  the  plea\r\n\nagreement  and that the jury understood as much.  Finally, we\r\n\nnote that the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that\r\n\nthe arguments of counsel do not constitute  evidence and that\r\n\nits  decision was to  be based  on the  evidence alone.   The\r\n\nrecord  indicates  that  the  jury  returned  three questions\r\n\nbefore  reaching  its   verdict,  thus  indicating   that  it\r\n\ncarefully deliberated  over the elements of  the offenses and\r\n\ndid  not simply  accept  the prosecutor's  arguments at  face\r\n\nvalue.11   We think this  sound evidence that the jury obeyed\r                  11\r\n\nthe court's instructions to resolve the case on  the evidence\r\n\nand was not seduced to convict on speculation prompted by the\r\n\nprosecutor's rebuttal.   Accordingly, we  are confident  that\r\n\nthe prosecutor's improper remarks did not so poison the trial\r\n\nas to require reversal for plain error.12\r                                                   12\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   11The jury  requested a  copy of the  court's instructions\r               11\r\nand  the relevant statutes.  It also requested that the court\r\nclearly  define the  term  \"possession\" and  a  copy of  that\r\nportion  of  Iba ez's  testimony   wherein  he  alleged  that\r\nappellant had instructed him to carry all of the heroin. \r\n\n   12Appellant  also contends that  the prosecutor improperly\r               12\r\nelicited evidence of Iba ez's prior bad  acts under the guise\r\nof  fulfilling  the  plea  agreement's  requirement  that  he\r\ntestify truthfully and  that the trial judge should  not have\r\nadmitted  this testimony.  See  note 2, supra.

In  a  related  vein,\r\n\nappellant contends that  defense counsel rendered ineffective\r\n\nassistance  because he failed to  object to Jose's arrest and\r\n\nfailed  to seek a court  order that granted  Jose immunity or\r\n\nrequired that the government do so.  Both  claims rely on the\r\n\nfollowing  additional facts,  some  of which  are beyond  the\r\n\nscope  of  the  record  but  are  conceded  as  true  by  the\r\n\ngovernment.13    \r                       13\r\n\n     It appears  that Jose arrived in Puerto  Rico three days\r\n\nafter  appellant and  Iba ez were  arrested and  that he  was\r\n\nimmediately   questioned   and   released  by   the   customs\r\n\nauthorities, who found  no drugs.   A few  months later,  and\r\n\napproximately eleven  days  before appellant's  trial  began,\r\n\nIba ez agreed to plead guilty and testify for the government.\r\n\nShortly thereafter, defense counsel announced that Jose would\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nmuch  of this evidence might have been excluded.  But defense\r\ncounsel raised  no objection to  its admission.   Instead, he\r\nrelied on  it as grounds for  attacking Iba ez's credibility.\r\nAs Iba ez's criminal exploits were just as likely to make the\r\njury disbelieve  him as otherwise, we cannot say admission of\r\nthis evidence was plain error.\r\n\n   13These  facts pertain  to appellant's  compulsory process\r               13\r\nclaim  and  one  of  his ineffective  assistance  of  counsel\r\nclaims.  The latter is discussed in part IV, infra.\r                                                              \r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nbe called  as a witness  for the defense.14   As noted above,\r                                                     14\r\n\nJose was arrested on the first day of appellant's trial, when\r\n\nhe arrived at the courthouse to testify for appellant.\r\n\n     The record discloses that after announcing that Jose had\r\n\nbeen arrested,  the Assistant  United States Attorney  (AUSA)\r\n\nimmediately agreed to make  Jose available to defense counsel\r\n\nto interview and call  as a witness.   He also observed  that\r\n\nJose would  probably reevaluate with his  own counsel whether\r\n\nhe wished  to testify.  (Tr. 9-11).    Defense counsel  never\r\n\nobjected to Jose's  arrest.  Instead,  he proceeded with  the\r\n\ntrial and made no complaints about a violation of appellant's\r\n\nright  to compulsory  process.   Appellant alleges  that \"the\r\n\nscuffle created  by\" Jose's arrest prevented  defense counsel\r\n\nfrom calling him as a witness.  He has submitted an affidavit\r\n\nfrom his trial counsel to support this assertion.15\r                                                             15\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   14This  is  apparent  from  defense  counsel's  motion  to\r               14\r\ncontinue  the  trial  (original  paper  #28).    That  motion\r\nindicates that  defense counsel  first interviewed  a witness\r\nwho  could provide  exculpatory  testimony on  June 7,  1995,\r\ni.e., five days after  Iba ez executed his plea agreement  on\r\nJune 2, 1995.  We presume that the witness identified  in the\r\nmotion is Jose.\r\n\n   15Defense  counsel averred that  Jose could  have provided\r               15\r\nmaterial, exculpatory testimony to the effect that he did not\r\nobserve any  drug-related activities by  appellant during the\r\ntime  that they spent together  in Venezuela.   Once Jose was\r\narrested,  counsel  believed  that  his  ethical  obligations\r\nprohibited  him  from  contacting  Jose until  after  he  was\r\nproperly represented by  counsel.  Counsel swore  that due to\r\nthe fact that he was \"heavily engaged\" in appellant's defense\r\nduring the course of the two-day trial, it was impossible for\r\nhim to ascertain the  status of Jose's case or  to coordinate\r\nwith  Jose's  counsel  to   address  Jose's  Fifth  Amendment\r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n     Appellant now complains  that the  only explanation  for\r\n\nthe timing  of the arrest is  that it was  designed to compel\r\n\nJose to  invoke his privilege  against self-incrimination and\r\n\nthereby deprive appellant of his testimony.16  At the  outset\r                                                       16\r\n\nwe  are compelled to observe  that this claim  was not raised\r\n\nbelow.    A strong  argument  can be  made that  it  has been\r\n\nwaived.   Cf. United  States v.  Theresius Filippi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551272\"><a href=\"/opinion/551272/united-states-v-robert-jean-theresius-filippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r                                                              \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246  (1st Cir.  1990)(holding defendant waived  right to\r\n\ncompulsory  process when defense  counsel decided  to proceed\r\n\nwith trial without material witness).   But as the government\r\n\ndoes not  make  this argument,  we  will give  appellant  the\r\n\nbenefit  of the doubt and assume the claim was forfeited, not\r\n\nwaived. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34 (discussing distinction\r                             \r\n\nbetween  \"waiver\"  and \"forfeiture\").    This  benefit is  of\r\n\nlittle moment, for the record, even as supplemented, does not\r\n\nestablish  that the  arrest of  Jose was  a plain  error that\r\n\nviolated appellant's right to compulsory process.    \r\n\n     In  order  to  make out  a  violation  of  the right  to\r\n\ncompulsory  process,  the  appellant  must  show  that  \"some\r\n\ncontested  act  or omission  (1)  can  be  attributed to  the\r\n\nsovereign and  (2) causes  the loss  or erosion  of testimony\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nconcerns.  Counsel's affidavit  concludes with  the assertion\r\nthat \"these circumstances prevented  me from calling ... Jose\r\n...  as a witness despite  the fact that  his testimony could\r\nha[ve] changed the outcome of the trial.\" \r\n\n   16Appellant says that this  conclusion is bolstered by the\r               16\r\nfact that Jose was ultimately acquitted on all charges. \r\n\n                             -16-\r\r\n\nwhich  is both (3) material to  the case and (4) favorable to\r\n\nthe accused.\" United  States v.

It  is  on  this  block  that\r                                        \r\n\nappellant's claim stumbles.   For while it is clear  that the\r\n\ngovernment  is responsible  for  Jose's arrest,  and we  will\r\n\nassume, for  the sake  of argument  only, that his  testimony\r\n\nwould have  been material and exculpatory,  the record simply\r\n\ndoes  not  show that  the arrest  caused  the loss  of Jose's\r\n\ntestimony.  Defense  counsel never subpoenaed  Jose.  He  did\r\n\nnot  even ascertain  that, if  subpoenaed, Jose  would indeed\r\n\ninvoke   the  Fifth   Amendment  and   decline   to  testify.\r\n\nConsequently,  it  is not  at  all clear  that  Jose's arrest\r\n\nactually rendered his testimony unavailable.  Accordingly, we\r\n\ncannot say that this arrest was a \"plain error\" that violated\r\n\nappellant's right  to compulsory process.   Cf.
