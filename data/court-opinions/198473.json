Before the Court is defendant-\nappellant Kmart Corporation's (\"Kmart\") appeal of a jury verdict in\nfavor of husband and wife plaintiffs-appellees Delia Smith and\nJames Orth.  Smith and Orth brought a negligence suit when Smith\nwas struck by a falling ice cooler while shopping with Orth in a\nKmart store.  The jury awarded Smith and Orth damages totaling \n$800,590, including $500,000 to Smith and $250,000 to Orth for\nnoneconomic damages.  After plaintiffs accepted a remittitur of one\nportion of the award in the amount of $8,611.20, the district court\nentered final judgment in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of\n$1,186,428.37, representing: (1) the remitted damage awards of\n$791,978.80; (2) prejudgment interest in the amount of $123,933.57;\n(3) costs in the amount of $6,516; and (4) attorneys' fees in the\namount of $264,000.  Kmart appeals from this judgment, requesting\nthat this Court: (1) vacate the award due to errors allegedly\ncommitted at trial, or (2) remit certain components of the damage\naward due to their excessiveness.  We reject Kmart's claims of\nreversible error, but agree that a portion of the damage award is\nso excessive as to warrant a remittitur.\n                          BACKGROUND\nBecause Kmart asks us to review a jury award of damages\nfor excessiveness, we must examine the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the award, drawing all possible inferences in its\nfavor.  See Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., 24 F.3d\n1480, 1483 (1st Cir. 1994).\nAt approximately 11:00 a.m. on March 4, 1995, Smith and\nOrth were shopping at the Kmart store in Humacao, Puerto Rico. \nThey were looking at lounge chair cushions which hung from the\nceiling, and they asked a Kmart employee to assist them in bringing\none of the cushions down.  While Smith and Orth waited for that\nassistance, a 48-quart Coleman ice cooler fell from a shelf behind\nthem.  The 8.5-pound cooler fell from a height of approximately\n10.5 feet, struck Smith on the back of her head, and rolled down\nher neck and shoulders.  Smith fell to her knees and then backwards\nto the ground.  She lost consciousness for 40-45 seconds and\nbriefly stopped breathing, prompting Orth to administer mouth-to-\nmouth resuscitation.\nWhen Smith regained consciousness, she felt a sharp pain\nin her head and heard ringing in her ears.  Smith could not feel\nher left side, causing her to fear that she was permanently\nparalyzed.  When the paramedics arrived, they placed a cervical\ncollar on Smith's neck, placed a board underneath her, and moved\nher into an ambulance.  Smith was taken to the Ryder Memorial\nHospital and was diagnosed with a cerebral trauma.  A CAT Scan was\nperformed, but the results were normal.  She was released a few\nhours later with a prescription for pain medication and\ninstructions to remain under observation for 24 to 48 hours.\nAt home, Smith suffered from dizziness, nausea,\nheadaches, numbness and weakness on her left side.  She also began\nto experience anxiety, restlessness, irritability, sleeplessness,\ndifficulty with her speech, and short-term memory loss.  Smith\nreturned to Ryder Hospital on March 7, 1998.  She was continued on\npain medication and was prescribed a muscle relaxant and an anti-\ninflammatory medication.  She was ordered to continue to rest and\nto see a neurologist.  On March 16, 1995, Dr. Hctor Cases Gallardo\ndiagnosed Smith as suffering from a cervical radiculopathy, which\nis inflammation of the nerve in the cervical root.  Dr. Cases\nordered a cervical MRI, which revealed ligament inflammation and\nthe swelling and sliding of a posterior disc in her neck. \nDr. Cases determined that the resulting compression on the nerve in\nher cervical spine caused Smith muscle spasms, inflammation and\npain in her neck.\nSmith continued to experience muscle spasms, pain and\nmovement limitations, so she went to another neurologist, Dr. Angel\nChinea, on August 24, 1995.  Dr. Chinea diagnosed Smith as\nsuffering from a post-concussion syndrome, cervical whiplash, and\na muscular-skeletal injury to her cervical area.  Dr. Chinea also\nmade a clinical finding of cervical radiculopathy.  In December of\n1995, Smith went to the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas,\nTexas.  She was examined by Dr. Sam Finn and placed on a six-week\nrehabilitation program.  She also began a home therapy program,\nwhich she was still engaging in as of the time of trial.\nOn February 29, 1996, Smith and Orth filed a complaint\nagainst Kmart on behalf of themselves and the legal conjugal\npartnership formed by them.  The complaint was premised on\ndiversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1332(a).  It alleged that Kmart\nwas negligently responsible for the accident and sought damages in\nthe form of: (1) Smith's physical and emotional pain and suffering;\n(2) Orth's emotional pain and suffering and loss of consortium;\n(3) the loss of work that Smith could no longer perform; (4) past\nand future medical expenses; and (5) attorneys' fees and interest. \nMeanwhile, on June 12, 1996, Smith went to see\nDr. Fernando Cabrera, a psychiatrist, for the first time. \nDr. Cabrera diagnosed Smith with post-traumatic stress disorder\n(\"PTSD\").  Dr. Cabrera found that Smith suffered from nightmares,\nirritability, mood changes, chronic major depression, difficulty\nsleeping, and impairment in her social and occupational\nrelationships.  Dr. Cabrera recommended that Smith continue\npsychiatric treatments for three to five years.\nDuring the course of discovery, the district court\nordered Kmart to produce its loss control manager, Ben Guffy, for\ndeposition on June 13, 1997 in Puerto Rico.  Despite the order,\nKmart failed to produce Guffy on that day and offered no\nsatisfactory reason for its failure.  Plaintiffs moved for\nsanctions.  Although Guffy was later made available for deposition\nby telephone, the district court issued a September 15, 1997 Order\nnoting Kmart's \"reprehensible\" conduct during discovery, including\nits refusal to produce Guffy on the proper day and its refusal to\nprovide other discovery requested by plaintiffs and ordered by the\ncourt.  The court then stated that it was considering sanctioning\nKmart by instructing the jury: (1) that Kmart refused to produce\nGuffy for deposition; (2) that the jury should infer from that\nrefusal that Guffy's statements would have been harmful to Kmart's\ncase; and (3) that the jury must accept as true that Kmart knew\nthat merchandise in its stores was often stacked in an unsafe\nmanner, frequently causing that merchandise to fall from shelves\nand severely injure Kmart's customers.  Kmart objected to the\ngiving of a sanction instruction, but did not object to the\nlanguage of the instruction.\nTrial commenced the following day.  In addition to the\nmedical testimony mentioned above, Dr. Chinea testified at trial\nthat Smith still suffers from many of the symptoms of the whiplash\ninjury, including muscle spasms, nerve damage, severe pain, and\ndecreased functioning of the cervical muscles.  Dr. Chinea\ntestified that this condition is permanent, meaning that the\nsymptoms will recur and aggravate whenever Smith engages in\nphysical activity.  Dr. Chinea testified that Smith will experience\npain intermittently for the rest of her life and at times will be\ncompletely disabled for days at a time.  Dr. Chinea also testified\nthat Smith will have to continue with her medication and therapy\nindefinitely.\nSmith and Orth testified about the accident and the\neffect Smith's injury had on their lives.  Smith testified that, at\nthe time of her injury, she was forty-three years old and had been\nmarried to Orth approximately three years and three months.  Smith\ntestified that, due to her injury, she could no longer: (1) travel\nor continue with her responsibilities in their business;\n(2) perform normal household chores; or (3) engage in the daily\nactivities of walking, dancing, and taking aerobics classes.  She\nalso testified that she experiences constant pain and continually\nfears additional injury, to the extent that she does not go\nanywhere, does not allow anyone to stand behind her, does not go\ninto stores like Kmart, and does not drive.\nOrth testified that he saw the accident and feared that\nSmith was dead.  He testified to his observations regarding Smith's\ncondition and their multiple visits to various doctors.  He\ntestified to the medication Smith has taken and will continue to\ntake and to the therapy that Smith has undergone and will continue\nto undergo.  He testified that he and Smith have had a strained\nrelationship since the accident in that they do not touch, talk, or\nhave a physical relationship any longer.  He testified that Smith\ncould no longer meaningfully help with their business and that he\nnow works 18 to 20 hours per day and has no personal life.  He\ntestified that he was also forced to do many of the household\nchores Smith had done previously.  He stated that he constantly\nworries about Smith's condition, but has never seen a psychiatrist\nor other professional about his mental condition.\nPlaintiffs also presented testimony from their friends\nand neighbors, Arlene and Patrick Fromer.  They testified that they\nmet the plaintiffs approximately three years before trial and that\nSmith became a \"different person\" after the accident.  They\ntestified that Smith no longer engaged in activities such as\ndancing, walking, and taking aerobics classes.  They testified that\ntheir once-frequent socializing \"pretty much stopped.\"  They also\ntestified that when the two couples did spend time together, Smith \nwas in constant pain and discomfort.\nDuring his closing argument, plaintiffs' counsel reviewed\nthe evidence presented at trial and argued that Kmart was negligent\nand that this negligence caused Smith's injuries and the damages\nsuffered by Smith and Orth.  Plaintiffs' counsel stressed that\nKmart had a duty to keep its premises safe for its customers, but\nsimply \"did not care\" enough to do so.  Plaintiffs' counsel argued\nthat Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith, her condition, or the safety\nconditions of its stores.  The only objection raised by defense\ncounsel complained of plaintiffs' counsel's mention of \"post-\nconcussion syndrome,\" rather than post-traumatic stress disorder. \nRather than objecting to what Kmart describes now as \"improper\nargument,\" defense counsel responded with an inflammatory argument\nof his own, focusing mainly on the plaintiffs' credibility in\narguing that Kmart was not negligent and that plaintiffs were\nmotivated by money and were deceptively inflating their damages. \nIn rebuttal, plaintiffs' counsel again argued that Kmart and its\ndoctors did not \"care\" about Smith.  Counsel also argued that\nplaintiffs were not seeking to profit and were not asking for\npunishment.  Counsel argued that plaintiffs sought only the full\namount of their damages in order to send a message to Kmart. \nCounsel also reminded the jury that Ben Guffy committed an act of\ndefiance of the court and asked the jury to send him a message that\n\"in Puerto Rico we won't take this.\"  Defense counsel did not\nobject to any portion of plaintiffs' counsel's rebuttal argument.\nThe district court then instructed the jury on the\napplicable law.  The only instruction to which appellant objects on\nappeal is the instruction given as a sanction due to Kmart's\nfailure to produce Guffy for deposition as ordered.  The district\ncourt gave the instruction it previewed to the parties in its\nSeptember 15, 1997 Order.  While Kmart objected before the\ninstruction was given to the giving of any sanction instruction, it\ndid not object -- either before or after the sanction instruction\nwas given -- to the specific language of the instruction. \nThe jury retired to deliberate and returned with a\nverdict in favor of plaintiffs.  The jury found Kmart to have been\nnegligent and awarded: (1) $25,000 to the conjugal partnership for\npast medical expenses; (2) $25,590 to the conjugal partnership for\nprojected medical expenses in the future; (3) $500,000 to Smith for\ndamages excluding medical expenses; and (4) $250,000 to Orth for\ndamages excluding medical expenses.\nAfter the jury rendered its verdict, Kmart moved for a\nnew trial or a remittitur of all of the awards.  The district court\nfound all components of the award to be amply supported by the\nevidence, except the award for past medical expenses.  Thus, the\ncourt conditionally granted the motion for a new trial.  The court\nstated that it would not order a new trial if plaintiffs accepted\na remittitur of $8,611.20 of the award for past medical expenses. \nPlaintiffs agreed to the remittitur, and the $25,000 award for past\nmedical expenses was reduced to $16,388.80, while all other\ncomponents of the damage award remained unchanged.  The court then\nentered judgment awarding: (1) the remitted amount; (2) prejudgment\ninterest on the remitted amount; (3) costs and attorneys' fees; and\n(4) post-judgment interest on the total.  Kmart immediately\nappealed.\n                          DISCUSSION\nI.  Improper Closing Argument of Plaintiffs' Counsel\nKmart first argues that plaintiffs' counsel's closing\nargument interjected purely emotional, inflammatory, and\nprejudicial elements into the jury deliberations.  Kmart argues\nthat this closing argument constituted plain error, warranting a\nnew trial despite its failure to object to the arguments at trial\nand its failure to request a new trial on this basis.\nKmart argues that plaintiffs' counsel made three types of \npurely emotional, inflammatory, and prejudicial statements during\nhis closing argument.  First, Kmart objects to counsel's repeated\narguments that Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith, her alleged\ncondition, or the safety conditions in Kmart stores.  Second, Kmart\ncomplains that counsel improperly asked the jury to punish Kmart\nfor the failure to produce Guffy for deposition.  Third, Kmart\nargues that plaintiffs' counsel encouraged the jury to award\npunitive damages against defendants by requesting that the jury\nconsider the damages associated with other potential customers.\nA.  Standard of Review\nKmart admits that it failed to object to any of these\nallegedly improper arguments and concludes from this that the\nstandard of review is plain error.  See Fernndez v. Corporacin\nInsular De Seguros, 79 F.3d 207, 210 (1st Cir. 1996); Johnson v.\nNational Sea Products, Ltd., 35 F.3d 626, 631 (1st Cir. 1994). \nAppellees counter that Kmart's failure to raise the improper\nargument issue at any point prior to its brief on appeal results in\na total waiver of the issue, rather than plain error review. \nAppellees cite two cases for the general proposition that \"[i]f any\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"\nTeamsters, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21\n(1st Cir. 1992): see also Noonan v. Winston Co., 135 F.3d 85, 89-90\n(1st Cir. 1998).  Appellees also cite cases in which this court has\nstated that \"[w]e will not consider arguments which could have\nbeen, but were not, advanced below,\" Sullivan v. National Football\nLeague, 34 F.3d 1091, 1097 n.1 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513\nU.S. 1190 (1995), and that \"it is a bedrock rule that when a party\nhas not presented an argument to the district court, she may not\nunveil it in the court of appeals,\" United States v. Slade, 980\nF.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992).\nThe appellees' citations overlook the basic difference\nbetween waiver and forfeiture.  See United States v. Olano, 507\nU.S. 725, 732-33 (1993); United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800,\n807-08 (1st Cir. 1996).  The overwhelming weight of the authority\nsupports the rule that, when no timely objection is made, claims of\nimproper closing argument are forfeited, not waived, and thus\namenable to review for plain error.  See Fernndez, 79 F.3d at 210;\nJohnson, 35 F.3d at 631; Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Services, Inc.,\n17 F.3d 490, 496 n.7 (1st Cir. 1994); DeVasto v. Faherty, 658 F.2d\n859, 864 (1st Cir. 1981).  Even courts which purport to foreclose\nreview of such claims due to the absence of an objection make\nexceptions tantamount to plain error review.  See, e.g., Doty v.\nSewall, 908 F.2d 1053, 1056 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating that issues\nregarding twelve items of impermissible argument or evidence were\nnot properly preserved for appeal due to the failure to object, but\nstill allowing review upon a showing of \"substantial injustice\");\nWildman v. Lerner Stores Corp., 771 F.2d 605, 609 (1st Cir. 1985)\n(stating that review of a claim of improper closing argument was\n\"foreclosed\" due to the failure to object, but still determining\nwhether review was required to prevent a miscarriage of justice\ndespite the lack of an objection).  Thus, we review Kmart's claims\nfor plain error.\nUnder plain error review, we will consider a forfeited\nobjection only if: (1) an error was committed; (2) the error was\n\"plain\" (i.e. obvious and clear under current law); (3) the error\nwas prejudicial (i.e. affected substantial rights); and (4) review\nis needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  See Chute v. Sears\nRoebuck and Co., 143 F.3d 629, 631 (1st Cir. 1998); United States\nv. Bartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 673 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 119\nS. Ct. 241 (1998).  To merit reversal, the error must have\n\"resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial\nproceedings.\"  Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean\nPetroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 189 (1st Cir.) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 294 (1996). \nPlain error is a \"rare species in civil litigation,\" encompassing\nonly those errors that reach the \"pinnacle of fault\" envisioned by\nthe standard set forth above.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v.\nNapco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 767 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations omitted).\nB.  The Alleged Instances of Improper Argument\nKmart's first claim of improper argument centers on\nplaintiffs' counsel's nine references that Kmart did not \"care\"\nabout Smith or safety conditions at its stores.  As noted by\nappellant, \"[i]ntroduction of purely emotional elements into the\njury's deliberations is clearly prohibited conduct.\"  Doty, 908\nF.2d at 1059 (citing Polansky v. CNA Ins. Co., 852 F.2d 626, 630\n(1st Cir. 1988)).  Appellees argue that counsel's references were\nnot such emotional appeals, but rather were proper arguments\naddressed to the negligence issues of whether Kmart knew or could\nforesee that injuries would occur, but still failed to prevent\nthem.  \nViewed in context, some of plaintiffs' counsel's\nreferences do appear to have been properly directed towards the\nknowledge, foreseeability, and breach of duty questions.  Others,\nhowever, do not.  For example, counsel argued at one point that\nKmart and its doctors \"don't care at all\" about Smith personally,\nwhich is quite different than arguing that Kmart did not care about\nor take steps to prevent the possibility of injury.  There were\nother instances in which plaintiffs' counsel argued that Kmart\n\"does not care,\" in the present tense, which has little bearing on\nthe question of Kmart's negligence at the time of the accident. \nCounsel also argued that Kmart did not even care enough to make\nGuffy available to give a deposition in the case.  Finally, counsel\nargued that Kmart did not care because it was not paying the true\namount of damages that it caused.  The import of these remarks was\nto stain the corporate character of Kmart in front of the jury. \nThis is improper argument.\nKmart's second claim is that plaintiffs' counsel\nimproperly asked the jury to punish Kmart for failing to produce\nGuffy for deposition by awarding a greater amount of damages. \nAppellees argue that their counsel made no such argument.  During\nrebuttal, plaintiffs' counsel argued:\n  Now, what we do want here is that this same\nthing not continue to happen.  And I am not\nasking for punishment, I'm asking to send a\nmessage to this guy, [Ben Guffy], who even\ncommitted an act of defiance to this Court. \nThat's why an order is here.  And you send a\nmessage to this guy, that in Puerto Rico we\nwon't take this.  And if they allow it, they\nwere to pay the full price.\nAppellees claim that when counsel argued \"we don't take\nthis,\" he meant that the public would not tolerate the unsafe\nconditions in the Humacao Kmart store.  We agree with appellees\nthat it is reasonable to interpret this passage as asking the jury\nto send a message about the unsafe conditions that caused the\naccident, while simultaneously reminding the jury that Guffy failed\nto appear for deposition and that an instruction existed to punish\nKmart for that failure. \nStill, counsel's reminder was improper to the extent that\nit was a request for a punitive form of damages, and it was also\nimproper because it attempted to sanction Kmart a second time for\nits failure to produce Guffy for deposition.  Because the district\ncourt had already determined that it would punish Kmart for that\nfailure in the form of an instruction to accept certain facts as\ntrue, this solicitation of a second sanction was improper.  Cf.\nWerbungs Und Commerz Union Austalt v. Collectors' Guild, Ltd., 930\nF.2d 1021, 1027 (2d Cir. 1991) (finding error when a district court\nfirst sanctioned a party for late production of documents by\nprecluding the introduction of evidence and then effectively\nallowed the jury to sanction the party a second time by instructing\nthe jury that it could consider the late production).\nKmart's final claim of improper argument asserts that\nplaintiffs' counsel encouraged the jury to award punitive damages\nagainst Kmart in excess of any compensable damages for injuries\nactually suffered by appellees.  Kmart claims that counsel asked\nthe jury to consider the injuries allegedly suffered by other\nindividuals.  We cannot agree with this contention.  Even the\nexcerpt cited by Kmart specifically states that plaintiffs' counsel\nwas asking for \"the full price, not more than that.\"  Counsel did\nattempt to portray the magnitude of the alleged safety problem by\nestimating the number of accidents in Kmart stores nationally. \nCounsel also spoke in general terms in stating that \"every customer\nis entitled to be safe\" and that \"if you have an injury, you have\na right to be treated fairly.\"  However, Kmart points to no\ninstance -- and we can find none -- in which counsel argued that\nthe jury should award appellees additional damages for this general\nproblem or for any injuries allegedly suffered by others.\nIn sum, while some of the arguments complained of by\nKmart were proper, others were clearly not.\nC.  Prejudice to Substantial Rights\nKmart faces an uphill battle in attempting to show\nprejudice because, on this record, we are confident in stating that\na verdict in favor of the plaintiffs was inevitable.  Whether the\nimproper arguments identified above were responsible for elevating\nthe award to an excessive one is highly debatable.  Kmart now\nargues that the excessive award was caused by the improper argument\nof plaintiffs' counsel, but it made no such claim in its post-trial\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, or remittitur. \nNor did Kmart raise the improper argument issue in its statement of\nissues filed under former Fed. R. App. P. Rule 30(b).  These\nomissions cast doubt on whether Kmart itself believed that the\nalleged excessiveness of the award was caused by plaintiffs'\ncounsel's closing argument.\nSeveral other factors could have caused or contributed to\nthe substantiality of the award.  We have already found many of\nappellees' counsel's arguments to be proper, and the jury may well\nhave been influenced to grant such a substantial award by those\nproper arguments.  The jury may have been swayed by the extensive\nexpert medical testimony in this case or by the emotional testimony\nof Smith or Orth.  Or the jury may have been inflamed by Kmart's\ntrial tactics (including the choice to dangle the offending cooler\nover Smith's head) or by Kmart's own improper argument. \nAdditionally, the district court took precautions in its\ninstructions to minimize the chance of a verdict based on passion\nor prejudice.  The jury was instructed that: (1) its duty was to\nfollow the law; (2) the attorneys' statements were not evidence;\n(3) it should apply the law without being governed by sympathy or\nprejudice; and (4) plaintiffs were only entitled to receive\ncompensatory damages for injuries they had suffered and proven.  As\na result, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs' counsel's improper\nargument caused whatever excessiveness may exist in the award.\nD.  Miscarriage of Justice\nEven if Kmart could demonstrate some degree of prejudice\nresulting from  plaintiffs' counsel's argument, we still would not\ncount this case among the \"rare species\" of civil cases that must\nbe reversed due to plain error.  Kmart must demonstrate that the\nerror \"resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously affected\nthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial\nproceedings.\"  Coastal Fuels, 79 F.3d at 189.  We do not find such\na miscarriage in this case, where Kmart's own closing argument was\nnearly as improper as that of which it complains.  Kmart repeatedly\nintroduced emotional elements of its own into the jury's\ndeliberations in response to plaintiffs' counsel's attempts to\npaint Kmart as an uncaring villain.  Kmart sought to demonize the\nplaintiffs when, under the guise of credibility arguments, defense\ncounsel argued: (1) that Smith forgot she was supposed to be in\npain until her lawyer reminded her; (2) that Orth was planning\nlitigation rather than attending to his supposedly injured wife;\nand (3) that Orth claimed to have seen another person express shock\nat \"what [they]'ve done\" to hide the fact that he caused the\naccident himself.  Both sides made emotional arguments in this\ncase, sometimes proper, sometimes not.  But it is hardly a\nmiscarriage of justice when a party fails to object to improper\nargument by its opponent and chooses to retaliate with improper\nargument of its own, only to have this strategic decision backfire\nwhen the jury returns a substantial award against it.\nFor all of these reasons, we find no reversible error\neither in plaintiffs' counsel's summation or in the district\ncourt's failure sua sponte to grant a new trial due to that\nsummation.\nII.  Improper Sanction Instruction\nKmart's second argument is that the district court abused\nits discretion in giving the sanction instruction that it gave to\npunish Kmart for failing to produce Guffy for deposition.  Kmart\nrecognizes that the choice of sanctions for failing to comply with\na discovery order lies within the sound discretion of the court. \nSee Marx v. Kelly, Hart &amp; Hallman, P.C., 929 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.\n1991).  Kmart also concedes that it is proper for a trial judge to\nsanction a party for its failure to appear for deposition pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B) and  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) by\ninstructing the jury to assume that the party's testimony would\nhave been unfavorable.  What Kmart objects to here is the language\nof the sanction instruction given.\nKmart acknowledges that it would not have been an abuse\nof the district court's discretion to have instructed the jury to\naccept as true that Kmart was on notice that merchandise in the\nHumacao store was stacked in a dangerous manner.  Kmart argues that\nthe district court crossed the line when it instead instructed:\n  From K-Mart's refusal to produce its loss\ncontrol manager, the Court instructs you that\nthe loss control manager's statements would\nhave been harmful to K-Mart's case. \nTherefore, you are instructed to accept as\ntrue that K-Mart knew that merchandise in its\nstore was often stacked in an unsafe manner,\nfrequently causing that merchandise to fall\nfrom shelves and injuring K-Mart customers. \n\nKmart argues that this instruction improperly\ncommunicated to the jury that Kmart knew of a serious, nationwide\nsafety problem that frequently caused injuries to Kmart customers. \nKmart argues that this message caused the jury to award damages\ndesigned to punish Kmart for this nationwide problem.\nAgain, Kmart complains after failing to raise an\nobjection before the trial court, as is required by Rule 51 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Therefore, we review the\nchallenged jury instruction for plain error.  See Chute, 143 F.3d\nat 631; TransAmerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, 107 F.3d 925, 933\n(1st Cir. 1997); Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 982 (1st Cir. 1994).\nWhile the language of the instruction was not perfect,\nthere was no plain error.  We do not read the instruction, as Kmart\ndoes, to establish that Kmart had a nationwide safety problem.  The\nsanction instruction referred only to \"the store\" and did not\nattempt to establish any facts regarding other Kmart stores.  With\nregard to the statements that merchandise in the store was \"often\"\nstacked in an unsafe manner and that merchandise \"frequently\" fell\nand injured customers, we do not find this language, in the absence\nof a focused objection, to fall outside the scope of the district\ncourt's discretion.  Rule 37(b)(2)(A) authorizes the district court\nto enter an order stating that the matters that were the subject of\nthe discovery order that was violated shall be taken to be\nestablished.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A).  Guffy was Kmart's loss\ncontrol manager, and the purpose of taking his deposition was to\ndetermine facts regarding: (1) merchandise display and storage, and\n(2) the extent of similar accidents and injuries occurring in Kmart\nstores.  When Kmart violated the court's order by failing to\nproduce Guffy for deposition, it was proper for the district court\nto sanction Kmart by instructing the jury to accept the unfavorable\nproposition that plaintiffs hoped to prove during Guffy's\ntestimony: that unsafe merchandise display practices had caused\nsimilar accidents and injuries in the relevant Kmart store. \nTherefore, the giving of this particular sanction instruction does\nnot warrant a new trial.\nIII.  Grossly Excessive Damage Awards\nKmart's final argument requests a remittitur of the\ndamages awarded to Smith and Orth because the amounts of those\nawards are so grossly excessive as to constitute a miscarriage of\njustice.  Kmart does not challenge the awards to the conjugal\npartnership for past and future medical expenses in the combined\namount of $41,978.80.  Rather, Kmart challenges only the awards to\nSmith and Orth for damages excluding medical expenses in the\namounts of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively.\nKmart has apparently dropped its request for a new trial\non this ground and argues only that this Court should order a\nremittitur of both awards.  We review the denial of a motion for a\nremittitur for abuse of discretion.  See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 493;\nMcDonald v. Federal Laboratories, Inc., 724 F.2d 243, 246 (1st Cir.\n1984).  We will find an abuse of discretion only if the jury's\nverdict exceeds \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages\nthat could be based on the evidence before the jury.\"  Milone v.\nMoceri Family, Inc., 847 F.2d 35, 36 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Segal\nv. Gilbert Color Systems, Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 1984)). \nWe have noted that \"the obstacles which stand in the path of\" such\nclaims of excessiveness \"are formidable ones.\"  Wagenmann v. Adams,\n829 F.2d 196, 215 (1st Cir. 1987).  Translating legal damage into\nmoney damages is a matter \"peculiarly within a jury's ken,\"\nespecially in cases involving intangible, non-economic losses. \nId.; see also Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1197\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"An appellate court's normal disinclination to\nsecond-guess a jury's evaluation of the proper amount of damages is\nmagnified where, as here, the damages entail a monetary valuation\nof intangible losses, and the trial judge, having seen and heard\nthe witnesses at first hand, accepts the jury's appraisal.\"), cert.\ndenied, 517 U.S. 1136 (1996). Viewing the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the verdict, the jury's assessment of damages\nwill not be disturbed unless it is \"grossly excessive, inordinate,\nshocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would\nbe a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Id. (quoting Segal,\n746 F.2d at 80-81) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe district court instructed the jury that plaintiffs'\ndamages excluding medical expenses were for \"physical and emotional\npain and suffering already suffered or to be suffered in the\nfuture.\"  The court defined \"pain and suffering\" damages to include\nany damages for loss of enjoyment of life that he or she is\nreasonably certain to suffer in the future, taking into account\neach plaintiff's past interests and way of life.  The court then\ndefined \"damages for enjoyment of life\" to include damages for\n\"loss of consortium, including reduction in sexual relations,\naffection, comfort, companionship, conjugal life, fellowship,\nsociety and/or the assistance that accompanies the marriage\nrelationship.\"  The court then instructed the jury that it could\naward only those types of damages.  As a result, the two awards at\nissue can only be said to reflect damages for: (1) past and future\nphysical pain and suffering; (2) past and future emotional pain and\nsuffering; and (3) loss of enjoyment of life, including loss of\nconsortium.\nA.  Smith's Award of $500,000\nIn light of the deference owed the jury award under this\nstandard, we do not find that the $500,000 award to Smith is so\nexcessive as to warrant a remittitur.  The evidence of Smith's\nphysical and emotional pain and suffering is abundant.  There was\nevidence that Smith has been in near-constant pain since the blow\nto her head, neck and shoulders at approximately 11:00 a.m. on\nMarch 4, 1995.  Smith stopped breathing and was unconscious for\napproximately forty seconds.  She lost feeling on the left side of\nher body, causing her to fear paralysis.  She was then rushed to\nthe hospital in a cervical collar and given pain medication for a\nhead trauma.  Smith then experienced additional pain, numbness,\ndifficulty speaking, and muscle limitations, causing her to visit\nseveral other doctors.  Smith has been under various medications\nfor pain and inflammation since her first visit to the hospital. \nSmith has experienced severe depression, anxiety, irritability,\nrestlessness, sleeplessness, and short-term memory loss. \nDr. Chinea testified that Smith will suffer from intermittent pain,\nmuscle spasms, and decreased functioning of her cervical muscles\nfor the rest of her life.  Dr. Chinea also testified that these\nsymptoms recur and aggravate whenever Smith engages in the simplest\nof physical activity, and will continue to do so.  Smith has been\ndiagnosed with PTSD, exhibiting the symptoms of nightmares, mood\nchanges, major depression, sleeplessness, and impairment of\nrelationships.  While Kmart took steps to minimize this physical\nand emotional pain and suffering before the jury, we must now view\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.  Viewed in\nthat light, we note that the record teems with evidence of Smith's\npast and future pain and suffering.\nThere was also substantial evidence presented regarding\nSmith's loss of enjoyment of life.  Testimony by Smith and her\ndoctors established that Smith was simply unable to engage in many\nof the physical activities she had enjoyed in the past, including\ndancing, walking, and taking aerobics classes.  Smith testified\nthat she is unable to drive a car or venture out beyond her house\ndue to her fear of additional injury.  Smith and Orth testified to\nthe great strain that has been placed on their relationship and to\nthe marked decrease in the amount of socializing with friends.  If\nthe jury believed this testimony -- which it is entitled to do\nwithout judicial second-guessing of its credibility determinations\n-- the jury was faced with a plaintiff who is virtually unable to\nleave her home, unable to perform any physical activity, and unable\nto maintain normal social relationships.  Such limitations amount\nto a substantial loss of the opportunity to enjoy life as Smith had\nprior to the accident.\nWhile we agree with Kmart that this award was certainly\ngenerous, we do not find it to be \"grossly excessive\" or \"shocking\nto the conscience,\" in light of the extensive evidence of the pain\nand suffering endured and yet to be endured by Smith and the\nlimitations that her condition has placed on her ability to enjoy\nlife.  We have upheld awards for pain and suffering and lost\nenjoyment damages in the range of the damages awarded to Smith. \nSee, e.g., Correa, 69 F.3d at 1198 (upholding: (1) a $200,000 award\nfor the pain and suffering experienced by Carmen Gonzlez Figueroa\nfor the few hours prior to her death, following the negligence of\nthe hospital she appeared at complaining of dizziness and chest\npains, and (2) a combined $500,000 award for the pain and suffering\nof Gonzlez' heirs); Hogan v. Bangor and Aroostook Railroad Co., 61\nF.3d 1034, 1037-38  (1st Cir. 1995) (upholding $200,000 award for\nemotional distress, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of\nenjoyment of life in the absence of any physical injury, when\ndefendant refused to allow plaintiff to return to work, causing\nplaintiff to be depressed and to give up his usual activities);\nHavinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., 24 F.3d 1480, 1483 (1st\nCir. 1994) (upholding several awards for pain and suffering and\nloss of enjoyment of life ranging from $200,000 to $450,000 when\nevidence was presented that the plaintiffs suffered severe\nemotional and psychological injuries which significantly affected\nthe quality of their lives and caused each to avoid activities in\nwhich he had previously engaged); Ruiz v. Gonzlez, 929 F.2d 31,\n34-35 (1st Cir. 1991) (upholding a past and future damages award of\n$350,000 when there was evidence that plaintiff was diagnosed with\npost-traumatic stress disorder and suffered a permanent partial\ndisability, although a portion of the award could have represented\nlost future earnings).\nIn Anthony, we found a $566,765 award for pain and\nsuffering to be so grossly disproportionate to the plaintiff's\ninjury as to be unconscionable.  See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 494. \nHowever, in that case, we based our finding of excessiveness on\nseveral factors.  First, there was no evidence that the plaintiff's\nleg injury prevented him from engaging in any particular\nactivities.  See id.  Second, there was no evidence that the injury\notherwise interfered with the plaintiff's professional,\nrecreational, or personal life.  See id.  Third, the physical\ninjury was not particularly severe or painful and required no major\nmedical treatment.  See id.  Finally, there was no evidence that\nthe plaintiff's injury was permanent.  See id.  While each\naggravating factor was absent in Anthony, each aggravating factor\nis present in Smith's case.  Thus, our holding in Anthony is of\nlittle assistance.\nKmart offers a series of damage awards in various state\ncourts ranging from $3,000 to $132,215 for what Kmart terms \"soft\ntissue injuries\" comparable to Smith's injuries.  From this, Kmart\nargues that the award to Smith should be reduced to more closely\nmatch those awards.  However, even if we could accept Kmart's\nbelittling characterization of Smith's injuries, the existence of\nsmaller damage awards in other jurisdictions, based upon different\nfactual scenarios, does not render the present award \"grossly\nexcessive.\"  We do not disagree that the present award is generous\nin comparison to the awards given by Kmart as examples, but we have\nstated in the past that \"merely showing that the damage award is\ngenerous in comparison to other (hand-picked) cases is insufficient\nto warrant relief.\"  See Correa, 69 F.3d at 1198 (citing Havinga,\n24 F.3d at 1488-89).  Thus, Kmart's tour of personal injury cases\nin courts from California to Maine does not dissuade us from\nfinding that the evidence before the jury was sufficient to support\nthe $500,000 award to Smith for past and future pain and suffering,\nemotional distress, and lost enjoyment of life.\nB.  Orth's Award of $250,000\nUnfortunately for plaintiffs, the same cannot be said of\nthe $250,000 award to Orth.  As a bystander to Smith's injury, Orth\nhas no physical injuries of his own.  While this does not preclude\nOrth from recovering for his emotional pain and suffering and for\nhis lost enjoyment of life, it does preclude him from recovering\nfor a category of injury -- past and future physical pain and\nsuffering -- that makes up a substantial portion of Smith's award. \nAdditionally, the evidence of Orth's emotional pain and\nsuffering was considerably less than the evidence of Smith's\nemotional pain and suffering. Since Orth has not seen a\npsychologist, psychiatrist or therapist for his emotional distress,\nthere was no expert testimony on this issue whatsoever.  Orth\ntestified to his horror in watching as Smith was struck by the\ncooler and lost consciousness.  Orth testified that he performed\nCPR on Smith and thought, at various times, that she was either\ndead or paralyzed.  Orth testified to all of the medical visits on\nwhich he accompanied Smith and testified to his constant worry over\nher condition.  He testified that he was \"emotionally tired,\nmentally tired, [with] periods of fear.\"  In addition to Orth's\ntestimony, Arlene Fromer (and Patrick Fromer, through a\nstipulation) testified that the accident \"really impacted James\"\nand that Orth was constantly worried about Smith's condition.  This\nevidence amply demonstrates that Orth witnessed a distressing event\nand is now often a tired and worried individual, but hardly\napproaches the emotional pain and suffering required to sustain\nsuch a substantial award.\nRegarding Orth's loss of enjoyment of life, including\nloss of consortium, the evidence is nearly as limited.  Orth\ntestified that Smith performed two to three hours of housekeeping\nwork per day before the accident, but could only manage 45 minutes\nto an hour of such work after the accident.  Orth testified that he\nwas forced to do all of the cooking each night, but that they hired\nsomeone to help with the other housework.  Orth testified that he\nno longer has a personal life because he works 18-20 hours per day\nto compensate for the amount of work that Smith can no longer\nperform.  Orth testified that he and Smith have a strained\nrelationship in that \"we don't touch, we don't talk, we don't have\na physical relationship anymore.\"  Orth testified that, before the\naccident, they had considered starting a family.  The Fromers\ntestified that Orth had to take over many of the household\nresponsibilities that Smith was once able to do.  The Fromers also\ntestified that Smith and Orth stopped socializing with them after\nthe accident.  This evidence of Orth's loss of enjoyment of life\nand loss of consortium simply does not rise to a level commensurate\nwith the amount of damages awarded.\nIn short, we find the jury's $250,000 award to Orth for\npast and future emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of\nlife, and loss of consortium to be \"grossly excessive, inordinate,\nshocking to the conscience of the court, [and] so high that it\nwould be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Correa, 69\nF.3d at 1197 (quoting Segal, 746 F.2d at 80-81) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).  Because the jury's verdict in this regard exceeds\n\"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be\nbased on the evidence before the jury,\" Milone, 847 F.2d at 36, we\nfind that the district court abused its discretion in denying\nKmart's motion for a remittitur of Orth's award.  Accordingly, we\nremand this case with instructions to vacate the $250,000 award to\nOrth for his damages excluding medical expenses and order a new\ntrial on this issue, unless Orth agrees to remit all of that award\nin excess of $100,000.  After carefully reviewing the evidence of\nOrth's damages that was presented at trial and examining the\nvarious types of injuries and damage awards of the cases cited\nsupra at pp. 22 and 25, we conclude that $100,000 represents the\nupper limit of a rational appraisal of Orth's damages.\n                          CONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, the portion of the judgment\nawarding Smith $500,000 in damages excluding medical expenses is\nAFFIRMED.  This case is REMANDED to the district court with\ninstructions to set a deadline by which plaintiffs must accept or\nreject a remittitur of the $250,000 award for Orth's damages\nexcluding medical expenses to $100,000.  If plaintiffs elect to\naccept this remittitur, the district court shall modify the\njudgment accordingly.  If plaintiffs elect not to accept this\nremittitur, the district court shall vacate the judgment and order\na new trial on the issue of Orth's damages excluding medical\nexpenses.\n",

Smith and Orth brought a negligence suit when Smith was struck by a falling ice cooler while shopping with Orth in a Kmart store.  The jury awarded Smith and Orth damages totaling $800,590, including $500,000 to Smith and $250,000 to Orth for noneconomic damages.  After plaintiffs accepted a remittitur of one portion of the award in the amount of $8,611.20, the district court entered final judgment in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of $1,186,428.37, representing:  (1) the remitted damage awards of $791,978.80;  (2) prejudgment interest in the amount of $123,933.57;  (3) costs in the amount of $6,516;  and (4) attorneys' fees in the amount of $264,000.  Kmart appeals from this judgment, requesting that this Court:  (1) vacate the award due to errors allegedly committed at trial, or (2) remit certain components of the damage award due to their excessiveness.  We reject Kmart's claims of reversible error, but agree that a portion of the damage award is so excessive as to warrant a remittitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Kmart asks us to review a jury award of damages for excessiveness, we must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the award, drawing all possible inferences in its favor.  See Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., 24 F.3d 1480, 1483 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 11:00 a.m. on March 4, 1995, Smith and Orth were shopping at the Kmart store in Humacao, Puerto Rico.  They were looking at lounge chair cushions which hung from the ceiling, and they asked a Kmart employee to assist them in bringing one of the cushions down.  While Smith and Orth waited for that assistance, a 48-quart Coleman ice cooler fell from a shelf behind them.  The 8.5-pound cooler fell from a height of approximately 10.5 feet, struck Smith on the back of her head, and rolled down her neck and shoulders.  Smith fell to her knees and then backwards to the ground.  She lost consciousness for 40-45 seconds and briefly stopped breathing, prompting Orth to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Smith regained consciousness, she felt a sharp pain in her head and heard ringing in her ears.  Smith could not feel her left side, causing her to fear that she was permanently paralyzed.  When the paramedics arrived, they placed a cervical collar on Smith's neck, placed a board underneath her, and moved her into an ambulance.  Smith was taken to the Ryder Memorial Hospital and was diagnosed with a cerebral trauma.  A CAT Scan was performed, but the results were normal.  She was released a few hours later with a prescription for pain medication and instructions to remain under observation for 24 to 48 hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At home, Smith suffered from dizziness, nausea, headaches, numbness and weakness on her left side.  She also began to experience anxiety, restlessness, irritability, sleeplessness, difficulty with her speech, and short-term memory loss.  Smith returned to Ryder Hospital on March 7, 1995.  She was continued on pain medication and was prescribed a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication.  She was ordered to continue to rest and to see a neurologist.  On March 16, 1995, Dr. Hector Cases Gallardo diagnosed Smith as suffering from a cervical radiculopathy, which is inflammation of the nerve in the cervical root.  Dr. Cases ordered a cervical MRI, which revealed ligament inflammation and the swelling and sliding of a posterior disc in her neck.  Dr. Cases determined that the resulting compression on the nerve in her cervical spine caused Smith muscle spasms, inflammation and pain in her neck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith continued to experience muscle spasms, pain and movement limitations, so she went to another neurologist, Dr. Angel Chinea, on August 24, 1995.  Dr. Chinea diagnosed Smith as suffering from a post-concussion syndrome, cervical whiplash, and a muscular-skeletal injury to her cervical area.  Dr. Chinea also made a clinical finding of cervical radiculopathy.  In December of 1995, Smith went to the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.  She was examined by Dr. Sam Finn and placed on a six-week rehabilitation program.  She also began a home therapy program, which she was still engaging in as of the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 29, 1996, Smith and Orth filed a complaint against Kmart on behalf of themselves and the legal conjugal partnership formed by them.  The complaint was premised on diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a).  It alleged that Kmart was negligently responsible for the accident and sought damages in the form of:  (1) Smith's physical and emotional pain and suffering;  (2) Orth's emotional pain and suffering and loss of consortium;  (3) the loss of work that Smith could no longer perform;  (4) past and future medical expenses;  and (5) attorneys' fees and interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on June 12, 1996, Smith went to see Dr. Fernando Cabrera, a psychiatrist, for the first time.  Dr. Cabrera diagnosed Smith with post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\").  Dr. Cabrera found that Smith suffered from nightmares, irritability, mood changes, chronic major depression, difficulty sleeping, and impairment in her social and occupational relationships.  Dr. Cabrera recommended that Smith continue psychiatric treatments for three to five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of discovery, the district court ordered Kmart to produce its loss control manager, Ben Guffy, for deposition on June 13, 1997 in Puerto Rico.  Despite the order, Kmart failed to produce Guffy on that day and offered no satisfactory reason for its failure.  Plaintiffs moved for sanctions.  Although Guffy was later made available for deposition by telephone, the district court issued a September 15, 1997 Order noting Kmart's \"reprehensible\" conduct during discovery, including its refusal to produce Guffy on the proper day and its refusal to provide other discovery requested by plaintiffs and ordered by the court.  The court then stated that it was considering sanctioning Kmart by instructing the jury:  (1) that Kmart refused to produce Guffy for deposition;  (2) that the jury should infer from that refusal that Guffy's statements would have been harmful to Kmart's case;  and (3) that the jury must accept as true that Kmart knew that merchandise in its stores was often stacked in an unsafe manner, frequently causing that merchandise to fall from shelves and severely injure Kmart's customers.  Kmart objected to the giving of a sanction instruction, but did not object to the language of the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial commenced the following day.  In addition to the medical testimony mentioned above, Dr. Chinea testified at trial that Smith still suffers from many of the symptoms of the whiplash injury, including muscle spasms, nerve damage, severe pain, and decreased functioning of the cervical muscles.  Dr. Chinea testified that this condition is permanent, meaning that the symptoms will recur and aggravate whenever Smith engages in physical activity.  Dr. Chinea testified that Smith will experience pain intermittently for the rest of her life and at times will be completely disabled for days at a time.  Dr. Chinea also testified that Smith will have to continue with her medication and therapy indefinitely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith and Orth testified about the accident and the effect Smith's injury had on their lives.  Smith testified that, at the time of her injury, she was forty-three years old and had been married to Orth approximately three years and three months.  Smith testified that, due to her injury, she could no longer:  (1) travel or continue with her responsibilities in their business;  (2) perform normal household chores;  or (3) engage in the daily activities of walking, dancing, and taking aerobics classes.  She also testified that she experiences constant pain and continually fears additional injury, to the extent that she does not go anywhere, does not allow anyone to stand behind her, does not go into stores like Kmart, and does not drive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orth testified that he saw the accident and feared that Smith was dead.  He testified to his observations regarding Smith's condition and their multiple visits to various doctors.  He testified to the medication Smith has taken and will continue to take and to the therapy that Smith has undergone and will continue to undergo.  He testified that he and Smith have had a strained relationship since the accident in that they do not touch, talk, or have a physical relationship any longer.  He testified that Smith could no longer meaningfully help with their business and that he now works 18 to 20 hours per day and has no personal life.  He testified that he was also forced to do many of the household chores Smith had done previously.  He stated that he constantly worries about Smith's condition, but has never seen a psychiatrist or other professional about his mental condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also presented testimony from their friends and neighbors, Arlene and Patrick Fromer.  They testified that they met the plaintiffs approximately three years before trial and that Smith became a \"different person\" after the accident.  They testified that Smith no longer engaged in activities such as dancing, walking, and taking aerobics classes.  They testified that their once-frequent socializing \"pretty much stopped.\"   They also testified that when the two couples did spend time together, Smith was in constant pain and discomfort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his closing argument, plaintiffs' counsel reviewed the evidence presented at trial and argued that Kmart was negligent and that this negligence caused Smith's injuries and the damages suffered by Smith and Orth.  Plaintiffs' counsel stressed that Kmart had a duty to keep its premises safe for its customers, but simply \"did not care\" enough to do so.  Plaintiffs' counsel argued that Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith, her condition, or the safety conditions of its stores.  The only objection raised by defense counsel complained of plaintiffs' counsel's mention of \"post-concussion syndrome,\" rather than post-traumatic stress disorder.  Rather than objecting to what Kmart describes now as \"improper argument,\" defense counsel responded with an inflammatory argument of his own, focusing mainly on the plaintiffs' credibility in arguing that Kmart was not negligent and that plaintiffs were motivated by money and were deceptively inflating their damages.  In rebuttal, plaintiffs' counsel again argued that Kmart and its doctors did not \"care\" about Smith.  Counsel also argued that plaintiffs were not seeking to profit and were not asking for punishment.  Counsel argued that plaintiffs sought only the full amount of their damages in order to send a message to Kmart.  Counsel also reminded the jury that Ben Guffy committed an act of defiance of the court and asked the jury to send him a message that \"in Puerto Rico we won't take this.\"   Defense counsel did not object to any portion of plaintiffs' counsel's rebuttal argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then instructed the jury on the applicable law.  The only instruction to which appellant objects on appeal is the instruction given as a sanction due to Kmart's failure to produce Guffy for deposition as ordered.  The district court gave the instruction it previewed to the parties in its September 15, 1997 Order.  While Kmart objected before the instruction was given to the giving of any sanction instruction, it did not object--either before or after the sanction instruction was given--to the specific language of the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury retired to deliberate and returned with a verdict in favor of plaintiffs.  The jury found Kmart to have been negligent and awarded:  (1) $25,000 to the conjugal partnership for past medical expenses;  (2) $25,590 to the conjugal partnership for projected medical expenses in the future;  (3) $500,000 to Smith for damages excluding medical expenses;  and (4) $250,000 to Orth for damages excluding medical expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury rendered its verdict, Kmart moved for a new trial or a remittitur of all of the awards.  The district court found all components of the award to be amply supported by the evidence, except the award for past medical expenses.  Thus, the court conditionally granted the motion for a new trial.  The court stated that it would not order a new trial if plaintiffs accepted a remittitur of $8,611.20 of the award for past medical expenses.  Plaintiffs agreed to the remittitur, and the $25,000 award for past medical expenses was reduced to $16,388.80, while all other components of the damage award remained unchanged.  The court then entered judgment awarding:  (1) the remitted amount;  (2) prejudgment interest on the remitted amount;  (3) costs and attorneys' fees;  and (4) post-judgment interest on the total.  Kmart immediately appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>I. Improper Closing Argument of Plaintiffs' Counsel</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart first argues that plaintiffs' counsel's closing argument interjected purely emotional, inflammatory, and prejudicial elements into the jury deliberations.  Kmart argues that this closing argument constituted plain error, warranting a new trial despite its failure to object to the arguments at trial and its failure to request a new trial on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart argues that plaintiffs' counsel made three types of purely emotional, inflammatory, and prejudicial statements during his closing argument.  First, Kmart objects to counsel's repeated arguments that Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith, her alleged condition, or the safety conditions in Kmart stores.  Second, Kmart complains that counsel improperly asked the jury to punish Kmart for the failure to produce Guffy for deposition.  Third, Kmart argues that plaintiffs' counsel encouraged the jury to award punitive damages against defendants by requesting that the jury consider the damages associated with other potential customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart admits that it failed to object to any of these allegedly improper arguments and concludes from this that the standard of review is plain error.  See Fernandez v. Corporacion Insular De Seguros, 79 F.3d 207, 210 (1st Cir.1996);  Johnson v. National Sea Products, Ltd., 35 F.3d 626, 631 (1st Cir.1994).  Appellees counter that Kmart's failure to raise the improper argument issue at any point prior to its brief on appeal results in a total waiver of the issue, rather than plain error review.  Appellees cite two cases for the general proposition that \"[i]f any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992):  see also Noonan v. Winston Co., 135 F.3d 85, 89-90 (1st Cir.1998).  Appellees also cite cases in which this court has stated that \"[w]e will not consider arguments which could have been, but were not, advanced below,\" Sullivan v. National Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1097 n. 1 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1190, 115 S.Ct. 1252, 131 L.Ed.2d 133 (1995), and that \"it is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals,\" United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees' citations overlook the basic difference between waiver and forfeiture.  See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);  United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807-08 (1st Cir.1996).  The overwhelming weight of the authority supports the rule that, when no timely objection is made, claims of improper closing argument are forfeited, not waived, and thus amenable to review for plain error.  See Fernandez, 79 F.3d at 210;  Johnson, 35 F.3d at 631;  Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Services, Inc., 17 F.3d 490, 496 n. 7 (1st Cir.1994);  DeVasto v. Faherty, 658 F.2d 859, 864 (1st Cir.1981).  Even courts which purport to foreclose review of such claims due to the absence of an objection make exceptions tantamount to plain error review.  See, e.g., Doty v. Sewall, 908 F.2d 1053, 1056 (1st Cir.1990) (stating that issues regarding twelve items of impermissible argument or evidence were not properly preserved for appeal due to the failure to object, but still allowing review upon a showing of \"substantial injustice\");  Wildman v. Lerner Stores Corp., 771 F.2d 605, 609 (1st Cir.1985) (stating that review of a claim of improper closing argument was \"foreclosed\" due to the failure to object, but still determining whether review was required to prevent a miscarriage of justice despite the lack of an objection).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thus, we review Kmart's claims for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under plain error review, we will consider a forfeited objection only if:  (1) an error was committed;  (2) the error was \"plain\" (i.e. obvious and clear under current law);  (3) the error was prejudicial (i.e. affected substantial rights);  and (4) review is needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  See Chute v. Sears Roebuck and Co., 143 F.3d 629, 631 (1st Cir.1998);  United States v. Bartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 673 (1st Cir.1997), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 241, 142 L.Ed.2d 198 (1998).  To merit reversal, the error must have \"resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"  Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 189 (1st Cir.)  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 927, 117 S.Ct. 294, 136 L.Ed.2d 214 (1996).  Plain error is a \"rare species in civil litigation,\" encompassing only those errors that reach the \"pinnacle of fault\" envisioned by the standard set forth above.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 767 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Alleged Instances of Improper Argument</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's first claim of improper argument centers on plaintiffs' counsel's nine references that Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith or safety conditions at its stores.  As noted by appellant, \"[i]ntroduction of purely emotional elements into the jury's deliberations is clearly prohibited conduct.\"  Doty, 908 F.2d at 1059 (citing Polansky v. CNA Ins. Co., 852 F.2d 626, 630 (1st Cir.1988)).  Appellees argue that counsel's references were not such emotional appeals, but rather were proper arguments addressed to the negligence issues of whether Kmart knew or could foresee that injuries would occur, but still failed to prevent them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, some of plaintiffs' counsel's references do appear to have been properly directed towards the knowledge, foreseeability, and breach of duty questions.  Others, however, do not.  For example, counsel argued at one point that Kmart and its doctors \"don't care at all\" about Smith personally, which is quite different than arguing that Kmart did not care about or take steps to prevent the possibility of injury.  There were other instances in which plaintiffs' counsel argued that Kmart \"does not care,\" in the present tense, which has little bearing on the question of Kmart's negligence at the time of the accident.  Counsel also argued that Kmart did not even care enough to make Guffy available to give a deposition in the case.  Finally, counsel argued that Kmart did not care because it was not paying the true amount of damages that it caused.  The import of these remarks was to stain the corporate character of Kmart in front of the jury.  This is improper argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's second claim is that plaintiffs' counsel improperly asked the jury to punish Kmart for failing to produce Guffy for deposition by awarding a greater amount of damages.  Appellees argue that their counsel made no such argument.  During rebuttal, plaintiffs' counsel argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Now, what we do want here is that this same thing not continue to happen.  And I am not asking for punishment, I'm asking to send a message to this guy, [Ben Guffy], who even committed an act of defiance to this Court.  That's why an order is here.  And you send a message to this guy, that in Puerto Rico we won't take this.  And if they allow it, they were to pay the full price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees claim that when counsel argued \"we don't take this,\" he meant that the public would not tolerate the unsafe conditions in the Humacao Kmart store.  We agree with appellees that it is reasonable to interpret this passage as asking the jury to send a message about the unsafe conditions that caused the accident, while simultaneously reminding the jury that Guffy failed to appear for deposition and that an instruction existed to punish Kmart for that failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, counsel's reminder was improper to the extent that it was a request for a punitive form of damages, and it was also improper because it attempted to sanction Kmart a second time for its failure to produce Guffy for deposition.  Because the district court had already determined that it would punish Kmart for that failure in the form of an instruction to accept certain facts as true, this solicitation of a second sanction was improper.  Cf. Werbungs Und Commerz Union Austalt v. Collectors' Guild, Ltd., 930 F.2d 1021, 1027 (2d Cir.1991) (finding error when a district court first sanctioned a party for late production of documents by precluding the introduction of evidence and then effectively allowed the jury to sanction the party a second time by instructing the jury that it could consider the late production).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's final claim of improper argument asserts that plaintiffs' counsel encouraged the jury to award punitive damages against Kmart in excess of any compensable damages for injuries actually suffered by appellees.  Kmart claims that counsel asked the jury to consider the injuries allegedly suffered by other individuals.  We cannot agree with this contention.  Even the excerpt cited by Kmart specifically states that plaintiffs' counsel was asking for \"the full price, not more than that.\"   Counsel did attempt to portray the magnitude of the alleged safety problem by estimating the number of accidents in Kmart stores nationally.  Counsel also spoke in general terms in stating that \"every customer is entitled to be safe\" and that \"if you have an injury, you have a right to be treated fairly.\"   However, Kmart points to no instance--and we can find none--in which counsel argued that the jury should award appellees additional damages for this general problem or for any injuries allegedly suffered by others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while some of the arguments complained of by Kmart were proper, others were clearly not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Prejudice to Substantial Rights</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart faces an uphill battle in attempting to show prejudice because, on this record, we are confident in stating that a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs was inevitable.  Whether the improper arguments identified above were responsible for elevating the award to an excessive one is highly debatable.  Kmart now argues that the excessive award was caused by the improper argument of plaintiffs' counsel, but it made no such claim in its post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, or remittitur.  Nor did Kmart raise the improper argument issue in its statement of issues filed under former Fed.  R.App. P. Rule 30(b).  These omissions cast doubt on whether Kmart itself believed that the alleged excessiveness of the award was caused by plaintiffs' counsel's closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other factors could have caused or contributed to the substantiality of the award.  We have already found many of appellees' counsel's arguments to be proper, and the jury may well have been influenced to grant such a substantial award by those proper arguments.  The jury may have been swayed by the extensive expert medical testimony in this case or by the emotional testimony of Smith or Orth.  Or the jury may have been inflamed by Kmart's trial tactics (including the choice to dangle the offending cooler over Smith's head) or by Kmart's own improper argument.  Additionally, the district court took precautions in its instructions to minimize the chance of a verdict based on passion or prejudice.  The jury was instructed that:  (1) its duty was to follow the law;  (2) the attorneys' statements were not evidence;  (3) it should apply the law without being governed by sympathy or prejudice;  and (4) plaintiffs were only entitled to receive compensatory damages for injuries they had suffered and proven.  As a result, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs' counsel's improper argument caused whatever excessiveness may exist in the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Miscarriage of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Kmart could demonstrate some degree of prejudice resulting from plaintiffs' counsel's argument, we still would not count this case among the \"rare species\" of civil cases that must be reversed due to plain error.  Kmart must demonstrate that the error \"resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"  Coastal Fuels, 79 F.3d at 189.   We do not find such a miscarriage in this case, where Kmart's own closing argument was nearly as improper as that of which it complains.  Kmart repeatedly introduced emotional elements of its own into the jury's deliberations in response to plaintiffs' counsel's attempts to paint Kmart as an uncaring villain.  Kmart sought to demonize the plaintiffs when, under the guise of credibility arguments, defense counsel argued:  (1) that Smith forgot she was supposed to be in pain until her lawyer reminded her;  (2) that Orth was planning litigation rather than attending to his supposedly injured wife;  and (3) that Orth claimed to have seen another person express shock at \"what [they]'ve done\" to hide the fact that he caused the accident himself.  Both sides made emotional arguments in this case, sometimes proper, sometimes not.  But it is hardly a miscarriage of justice when a party fails to object to improper argument by its opponent and chooses to retaliate with improper argument of its own, only to have this strategic decision backfire when the jury returns a substantial award against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we find no reversible error either in plaintiffs' counsel's summation or in the district court's failure sua sponte to grant a new trial due to that summation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Improper Sanction Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's second argument is that the district court abused its discretion in giving the sanction instruction that it gave to punish Kmart for failing to produce Guffy for deposition.  Kmart recognizes that the choice of sanctions for failing to comply with a discovery order lies within the sound discretion of the court.  See Marx v. Kelly, Hart &amp; Hallman, P.C., 929 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1991).  Kmart also concedes that it is proper for a trial judge to sanction a party for its failure to appear for deposition pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(d) by instructing the jury to assume that the party's testimony would have been unfavorable.  What Kmart objects to here is the language of the sanction instruction given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart acknowledges that it would not have been an abuse of the district court's discretion to have instructed the jury to accept as true that Kmart was on notice that merchandise in the Humacao store was stacked in a dangerous manner.  Kmart argues that the district court crossed the line when it instead instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>From K-Mart's refusal to produce its loss control manager, the Court instructs you that the loss control manager's statements would have been harmful to K-Mart's case.  Therefore, you are instructed to accept as true that K-Mart knew that merchandise in its store was often stacked in an unsafe manner, frequently causing that merchandise to fall from shelves and injuring K-Mart customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart argues that this instruction improperly communicated to the jury that Kmart knew of a serious, nationwide safety problem that frequently caused injuries to Kmart customers.  Kmart argues that this message caused the jury to award damages designed to punish Kmart for this nationwide problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Kmart complains after failing to raise an objection before the trial court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as is required by Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Therefore, we review the challenged jury instruction for plain error.  See Chute, 143 F.3d at 631;  Transamerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, 107 F.3d 925, 933 (1st Cir.1997);  Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 982 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the language of the instruction was not perfect, there was no plain error.  We do not read the instruction, as Kmart does, to establish that Kmart had a nationwide safety problem.  The sanction instruction referred only to \"the store\" and did not attempt to establish any facts regarding other Kmart stores.  With regard to the statements that merchandise in the store was \"often\" stacked in an unsafe manner and that merchandise \"frequently\" fell and injured customers, we do not find this language, in the absence of a focused objection, to fall outside the scope of the district court's discretion.  Rule 37(b)(2)(A) authorizes the district court to enter an order stating that the matters that were the subject of the discovery order that was violated shall be taken to be established.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A).  Guffy was Kmart's loss control manager, and the purpose of taking his deposition was to determine facts regarding:  (1) merchandise display and storage, and (2) the extent of similar accidents and injuries occurring in Kmart stores.  When Kmart violated the court's order by failing to produce Guffy for deposition, it was proper for the district court to sanction Kmart by instructing the jury to accept the unfavorable proposition that plaintiffs hoped to prove during Guffy's testimony:  that unsafe merchandise display practices had caused similar accidents and injuries in the relevant Kmart store.  Therefore, the giving of this particular sanction instruction does not warrant a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Grossly Excessive Damage Awards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's final argument requests a remittitur of the damages awarded to Smith and Orth because the amounts of those awards are so grossly excessive as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.  Kmart does not challenge the awards to the conjugal partnership for past and future medical expenses in the combined amount of $41,978.80.  Rather, Kmart challenges only the awards to Smith and Orth for damages excluding medical expenses in the amounts of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart has apparently dropped its request for a new trial on this ground and argues only that this Court should order a remittitur of both awards.  We review the denial of a motion for a remittitur for abuse of discretion.  See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 493;  McDonald v. Federal Laboratories, Inc., 724 F.2d 243, 246 (1st Cir.1984).  We will find an abuse of discretion only if the jury's verdict exceeds \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the evidence before the jury.\"  Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc., 847 F.2d 35, 36 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Segal v. Gilbert Color Systems, Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir.1984)).  We have noted that \"the obstacles which stand in the path of\" such claims of excessiveness \"are formidable ones.\"  Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 215 (1st Cir.1987).  Translating legal damage into money damages is a matter \"peculiarly within a jury's ken,\" especially in cases involving intangible, non-economic losses.  Id.;  see also Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1197 (1st Cir.1995) (\"An appellate court's normal disinclination to second-guess a jury's evaluation of the proper amount of damages is magnified where, as here, the damages entail a monetary valuation of intangible losses, and the trial judge, having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand, accepts the jury's appraisal.\"), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1136, 116 S.Ct. 1423, 134 L.Ed.2d 547 (1996).  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the jury's assessment of damages will not be disturbed unless it is \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Id. (quoting Segal, 746 F.2d at 80-81) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury that plaintiffs' damages excluding medical expenses were for \"physical and emotional pain and suffering already suffered or to be suffered in the future.\"   The court defined \"pain and suffering\" damages to include any damages for loss of enjoyment of life that he or she is reasonably certain to suffer in the future, taking into account each plaintiff's past interests and way of life.  The court then defined \"damages for enjoyment of life\" to include damages for \"loss of consortium, including reduction in sexual relations, affection, comfort, companionship, conjugal life, fellowship, society and/or the assistance that accompanies the marriage relationship.\"   The court then instructed the jury that it could award only those types of damages.  As a result, the two awards at issue can only be said to reflect damages for:  (1) past and future physical pain and suffering;  (2) past and future emotional pain and suffering;  and (3) loss of enjoyment of life, including loss of consortium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Smith's Award of $500,000</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the deference owed the jury award under this standard, we do not find that the $500,000 award to Smith is so excessive as to warrant a remittitur.  The evidence of Smith's physical and emotional pain and suffering is abundant.  There was evidence that Smith has been in near-constant pain since the blow to her head, neck and shoulders at approximately 11:00 a.m. on March 4, 1995.  Smith stopped breathing and was unconscious for approximately forty seconds.  She lost feeling on the left side of her body, causing her to fear paralysis.  She was then rushed to the hospital in a cervical collar and given pain medication for a head trauma.  Smith then experienced additional pain, numbness, difficulty speaking, and muscle limitations, causing her to visit several other doctors.  Smith has been under various medications for pain and inflammation since her first visit to the hospital.  Smith has experienced severe depression, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, sleeplessness, and short-term memory loss.  Dr. Chinea testified that Smith will suffer from intermittent pain, muscle spasms, and decreased functioning of her cervical muscles for the rest of her life.  Dr. Chinea also testified that these symptoms recur and aggravate whenever Smith engages in the simplest of physical activity, and will continue to do so.  Smith has been diagnosed with PTSD, exhibiting the symptoms of nightmares, mood changes, major depression, sleeplessness, and impairment of relationships.  While Kmart took steps to minimize this physical and emotional pain and suffering before the jury, we must now view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.  Viewed in that light, we note that the record teems with evidence of Smith's past and future pain and suffering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also substantial evidence presented regarding Smith's loss of enjoyment of life.  Testimony by Smith and her doctors established that Smith was simply unable to engage in many of the physical activities she had enjoyed in the past, including dancing, walking, and taking aerobics classes.  Smith testified that she is unable to drive a car or venture out beyond her house due to her fear of additional injury.  Smith and Orth testified to the great strain that has been placed on their relationship and to the marked decrease in the amount of socializing with friends.  If the jury believed this testimony--which it is entitled to do without judicial second-guessing of its credibility determinations--the jury was faced with a plaintiff who is virtually unable to leave her home, unable to perform any physical activity, and unable to maintain normal social relationships.  Such limitations amount to a substantial loss of the opportunity to enjoy life as Smith had prior to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we agree with Kmart that this award was certainly generous, we do not find it to be \"grossly excessive\" or \"shocking to the conscience,\" in light of the extensive evidence of the pain and suffering endured and yet to be endured by Smith and the limitations that her condition has placed on her ability to enjoy life.  We have upheld awards for pain and suffering and lost enjoyment damages in the range of the damages awarded to Smith.  See, e.g., Correa, 69 F.3d at 1198 (upholding:  (1) a $200,000 award for the pain and suffering experienced by Carmen Gonzalez Figueroa for the few hours prior to her death, following the negligence of the hospital she appeared at complaining of dizziness and chest pains, and (2) a combined $500,000 award for the pain and suffering of Gonzalez' heirs);  Hogan v. Bangor and Aroostook Railroad Co., 61 F.3d 1034, 1037-38 (1st Cir.1995) (upholding $200,000 award for emotional distress, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life in the absence of any physical injury, when defendant refused to allow plaintiff to return to work, causing plaintiff to be depressed and to give up his usual activities);  Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., 24 F.3d 1480, 1483 (1st Cir.1994) (upholding several awards for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life ranging from $200,000 to $450,000 when evidence was presented that the plaintiffs suffered severe emotional and psychological injuries which significantly affected the quality of their lives and caused each to avoid activities in which he had previously engaged);  Ruiz v. Gonzalez, 929 F.2d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir.1991) (upholding a past and future damages award of $350,000 when there was evidence that plaintiff was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered a permanent partial disability, although a portion of the award could have represented lost future earnings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Anthony, we found a $566,765 award for pain and suffering to be so grossly disproportionate to the plaintiff's injury as to be unconscionable.  See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 494.   However, in that case, we based our finding of excessiveness on several factors.  First, there was no evidence that the plaintiff's leg injury prevented him from engaging in any particular activities.  See id.   Second, there was no evidence that the injury otherwise interfered with the plaintiff's professional, recreational, or personal life.  See id.   Third, the physical injury was not particularly severe or painful and required no major medical treatment.  See id.   Finally, there was no evidence that the plaintiff's injury was permanent.  See id.   While each aggravating factor was absent in Anthony, each aggravating factor is present in Smith's case.  Thus, our holding in Anthony is of little assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart offers a series of damage awards in various state courts ranging from $3,000 to $132,215 for what Kmart terms \"soft tissue injuries\" comparable to Smith's injuries.  From this, Kmart argues that the award to Smith should be reduced to more closely match those awards. However, even if we could accept Kmart's belittling characterization of Smith's injuries, the existence of smaller damage awards in other jurisdictions, based upon different factual scenarios, does not render the present award \"grossly excessive.\"   We do not disagree that the present award is generous in comparison to the awards given by Kmart as examples, but we have stated in the past that \"merely showing that the damage award is generous in comparison to other (hand-picked) cases is insufficient to warrant relief.\"   See Correa, 69 F.3d at 1198 (citing Havinga, 24 F.3d at 1488-89).   Thus, Kmart's tour of personal injury cases in courts from California to Maine does not dissuade us from finding that the evidence before the jury was sufficient to support the $500,000 award to Smith for past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and lost enjoyment of life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Orth's Award of $250,000</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for plaintiffs, the same cannot be said of the $250,000 award to Orth.  As a bystander to Smith's injury, Orth has no physical injuries of his own.  While this does not preclude Orth from recovering for his emotional pain and suffering and for his lost enjoyment of life, it does preclude him from recovering for a category of injury--past and future physical pain and suffering--that makes up a substantial portion of Smith's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the evidence of Orth's emotional pain and suffering was considerably less than the evidence of Smith's emotional pain and suffering.  Since Orth has not seen a psychologist, psychiatrist or therapist for his emotional distress, there was no expert testimony on this issue whatsoever.  Orth testified to his horror in watching as Smith was struck by the cooler and lost consciousness.  Orth testified that he performed CPR on Smith and thought, at various times, that she was either dead or paralyzed.  Orth testified to all of the medical visits on which he accompanied Smith and testified to his constant worry over her condition.  He testified that he was \"emotionally tired, mentally tired, [with] periods of fear.\"   In addition to Orth's testimony, Arlene Fromer (and Patrick Fromer, through a stipulation) testified that the accident \"really impacted James\" and that Orth was constantly worried about Smith's condition.  This evidence amply demonstrates that Orth witnessed a distressing event and is now often a tired and worried individual, but hardly approaches the emotional pain and suffering required to sustain such a substantial award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding Orth's loss of enjoyment of life, including loss of consortium, the evidence is nearly as limited.  Orth testified that Smith performed two to three hours of housekeeping work per day before the accident, but could only manage 45 minutes to an hour of such work after the accident.  Orth testified that he was forced to do all of the cooking each night, but that they hired someone to help with the other housework.  Orth testified that he no longer has a personal life because he works 18-20 hours per day to compensate for the amount of work that Smith can no longer perform.  Orth testified that he and Smith have a strained relationship in that \"we don't touch, we don't talk, we don't have a physical relationship anymore.\"   Orth testified that, before the accident, they had considered starting a family.  The Fromers testified that Orth had to take over many of the household responsibilities that Smith was once able to do.  The Fromers also testified that Smith and Orth stopped socializing with them after the accident.  This evidence of Orth's loss of enjoyment of life and loss of consortium simply does not rise to a level commensurate with the amount of damages awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we find the jury's $250,000 award to Orth for past and future emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of consortium to be \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, [and] so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Correa, 69 F.3d at 1197 (quoting Segal, 746 F.2d at 80-81) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the jury's verdict in this regard exceeds \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the evidence before the jury,\" Milone, 847 F.2d at 36, we find that the district court abused its discretion in denying Kmart's motion for a remittitur of Orth's award.  Accordingly, we remand this case with instructions to vacate the $250,000 award to Orth for his damages excluding medical expenses and order a new trial on this issue, unless Orth agrees to remit all of that award in excess of $100,000.  After carefully reviewing the evidence of Orth's damages that was presented at trial and examining the various types of injuries and damage awards of the cases cited supra at pp. ---- and ----, we conclude that $100,000 represents the upper limit of a rational appraisal of Orth's damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing, the portion of the judgment awarding Smith $500,000 in damages excluding medical expenses is AFFIRMED.  This case is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to set a deadline by which plaintiffs must accept or reject a remittitur of the $250,000 award for Orth's damages excluding medical expenses to $100,000.  If plaintiffs elect to accept this remittitur, the district court shall modify the judgment accordingly.  If plaintiffs elect not to accept this remittitur, the district court shall vacate the judgment and order a new trial on the issue of Orth's damages excluding medical expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We do note the existence of American Universal Ins.

See Werbungs, 930 F.2d at 1027.   This argument is meritless.  The district court did not instruct the jury to punish Kmart for its abuses, and Kmart agrees that it is a permissible sanction to instruct a jury to accept certain facts as true.  If the jury does in fact accept those facts and finds liability based on those facts, the resulting damage award is in no sense a sanction by the jury for discovery abuses</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> While our calculation of this amount is admittedly imprecise, converting feelings such as pain and suffering and the loss of enjoyment of life into dollars is not an exact science.

Smith and Orth brought a negligence suit when Smith was struck by a falling ice cooler while shopping with Orth in a Kmart store.  The jury awarded Smith and Orth damages totaling $800,590, including $500,000 to Smith and $250,000 to Orth for noneconomic damages.  After plaintiffs accepted a remittitur of one portion of the award in the amount of $8,611.20, the district court entered final judgment in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of $1,186,428.37, representing:  (1) the remitted damage awards of $791,978.80;  (2) prejudgment interest in the amount of $123,933.57;  (3) costs in the amount of $6,516;  and (4) attorneys' fees in the amount of $264,000.  Kmart appeals from this judgment, requesting that this Court:  (1) vacate the award due to errors allegedly committed at trial, or (2) remit certain components of the damage award due to their excessiveness.  We reject Kmart's claims of reversible error, but agree that a portion of the damage award is so excessive as to warrant a remittitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Kmart asks us to review a jury award of damages for excessiveness, we must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the award, drawing all possible inferences in its favor.  See Havinga v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670668\"><a href=\"/opinion/670668/berend-jd-havinga-v-crowley-towing-and-transportation-company-berend/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span>, 1483 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 11:00 a.m. on March 4, 1995, Smith and Orth were shopping at the Kmart store in Humacao, Puerto Rico.  They were looking at lounge chair cushions which hung from the ceiling, and they asked a Kmart employee to assist them in bringing one of the cushions down.  While Smith and Orth waited for that assistance, a 48-quart Coleman ice cooler fell from a shelf behind them.  The 8.5-pound cooler fell from a height of approximately 10.5 feet, struck Smith on the back of her head, and rolled down her neck and shoulders.  Smith fell to her knees and then backwards to the ground.  She lost consciousness for 40-45 seconds and briefly stopped breathing, prompting Orth to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Smith regained consciousness, she felt a sharp pain in her head and heard ringing in her ears.  Smith could not feel her left side, causing her to fear that she was permanently paralyzed.  When the paramedics arrived, they placed a cervical collar on Smith's neck, placed a board underneath her, and moved her into an ambulance.  Smith was taken to the Ryder Memorial Hospital and was diagnosed with a cerebral trauma.  A CAT Scan was performed, but the results were normal.  She was released a few hours later with a prescription for pain medication and instructions to remain under observation for 24 to 48 hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At home, Smith suffered from dizziness, nausea, headaches, numbness and weakness on her left side.  She also began to experience anxiety, restlessness, irritability, sleeplessness, difficulty with her speech, and short-term memory loss.  Smith returned to Ryder Hospital on March 7, 1995.  She was continued on pain medication and was prescribed a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication.  She was ordered to continue to rest and to see a neurologist.  On March 16, 1995, Dr. Hector Cases Gallardo diagnosed Smith as suffering from a cervical radiculopathy, which is inflammation of the nerve in the cervical root.  Dr. Cases ordered a cervical MRI, which revealed ligament inflammation and the swelling and sliding of a posterior disc in her neck.  Dr. Cases determined that the resulting compression on the nerve in her cervical spine caused Smith muscle spasms, inflammation and pain in her neck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith continued to experience muscle spasms, pain and movement limitations, so she went to another neurologist, Dr. Angel Chinea, on August 24, 1995.  Dr. Chinea diagnosed Smith as suffering from a post-concussion syndrome, cervical whiplash, and a muscular-skeletal injury to her cervical area.  Dr. Chinea also made a clinical finding of cervical radiculopathy.  In December of 1995, Smith went to the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.  She was examined by Dr. Sam Finn and placed on a six-week rehabilitation program.  She also began a home therapy program, which she was still engaging in as of the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 29, 1996, Smith and Orth filed a complaint against Kmart on behalf of themselves and the legal conjugal partnership formed by them.  The complaint was premised on diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a).  It alleged that Kmart was negligently responsible for the accident and sought damages in the form of:  (1) Smith's physical and emotional pain and suffering;  (2) Orth's emotional pain and suffering and loss of consortium;  (3) the loss of work that Smith could no longer perform;  (4) past and future medical expenses;  and (5) attorneys' fees and interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on June 12, 1996, Smith went to see Dr. Fernando Cabrera, a psychiatrist, for the first time.  Dr. Cabrera diagnosed Smith with post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\").  Dr. Cabrera found that Smith suffered from nightmares, irritability, mood changes, chronic major depression, difficulty sleeping, and impairment in her social and occupational relationships.  Dr. Cabrera recommended that Smith continue psychiatric treatments for three to five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of discovery, the district court ordered Kmart to produce its loss control manager, Ben Guffy, for deposition on June 13, 1997 in Puerto Rico.  Despite the order, Kmart failed to produce Guffy on that day and offered no satisfactory reason for its failure.  Plaintiffs moved for sanctions.  Although Guffy was later made available for deposition by telephone, the district court issued a September 15, 1997 Order noting Kmart's \"reprehensible\" conduct during discovery, including its refusal to produce Guffy on the proper day and its refusal to provide other discovery requested by plaintiffs and ordered by the court.  The court then stated that it was considering sanctioning Kmart by instructing the jury:  (1) that Kmart refused to produce Guffy for deposition;  (2) that the jury should infer from that refusal that Guffy's statements would have been harmful to Kmart's case;  and (3) that the jury must accept as true that Kmart knew that merchandise in its stores was often stacked in an unsafe manner, frequently causing that merchandise to fall from shelves and severely injure Kmart's customers.  Kmart objected to the giving of a sanction instruction, but did not object to the language of the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial commenced the following day.  In addition to the medical testimony mentioned above, Dr. Chinea testified at trial that Smith still suffers from many of the symptoms of the whiplash injury, including muscle spasms, nerve damage, severe pain, and decreased functioning of the cervical muscles.  Dr. Chinea testified that this condition is permanent, meaning that the symptoms will recur and aggravate whenever Smith engages in physical activity.  Dr. Chinea testified that Smith will experience pain intermittently for the rest of her life and at times will be completely disabled for days at a time.  Dr. Chinea also testified that Smith will have to continue with her medication and therapy indefinitely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith and Orth testified about the accident and the effect Smith's injury had on their lives.  Smith testified that, at the time of her injury, she was forty-three years old and had been married to Orth approximately three years and three months.  Smith testified that, due to her injury, she could no longer:  (1) travel or continue with her responsibilities in their business;  (2) perform normal household chores;  or (3) engage in the daily activities of walking, dancing, and taking aerobics classes.  She also testified that she experiences constant pain and continually fears additional injury, to the extent that she does not go anywhere, does not allow anyone to stand behind her, does not go into stores like Kmart, and does not drive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orth testified that he saw the accident and feared that Smith was dead.  He testified to his observations regarding Smith's condition and their multiple visits to various doctors.  He testified to the medication Smith has taken and will continue to take and to the therapy that Smith has undergone and will continue to undergo.  He testified that he and Smith have had a strained relationship since the accident in that they do not touch, talk, or have a physical relationship any longer.  He testified that Smith could no longer meaningfully help with their business and that he now works 18 to 20 hours per day and has no personal life.  He testified that he was also forced to do many of the household chores Smith had done previously.  He stated that he constantly worries about Smith's condition, but has never seen a psychiatrist or other professional about his mental condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also presented testimony from their friends and neighbors, Arlene and Patrick Fromer.  They testified that they met the plaintiffs approximately three years before trial and that Smith became a \"different person\" after the accident.  They testified that Smith no longer engaged in activities such as dancing, walking, and taking aerobics classes.  They testified that their once-frequent socializing \"pretty much stopped.\"   They also testified that when the two couples did spend time together, Smith was in constant pain and discomfort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his closing argument, plaintiffs' counsel reviewed the evidence presented at trial and argued that Kmart was negligent and that this negligence caused Smith's injuries and the damages suffered by Smith and Orth.  Plaintiffs' counsel stressed that Kmart had a duty to keep its premises safe for its customers, but simply \"did not care\" enough to do so.  Plaintiffs' counsel argued that Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith, her condition, or the safety conditions of its stores.  The only objection raised by defense counsel complained of plaintiffs' counsel's mention of \"post-concussion syndrome,\" rather than post-traumatic stress disorder.  Rather than objecting to what Kmart describes now as \"improper argument,\" defense counsel responded with an inflammatory argument of his own, focusing mainly on the plaintiffs' credibility in arguing that Kmart was not negligent and that plaintiffs were motivated by money and were deceptively inflating their damages.  In rebuttal, plaintiffs' counsel again argued that Kmart and its doctors did not \"care\" about Smith.  Counsel also argued that plaintiffs were not seeking to profit and were not asking for punishment.  Counsel argued that plaintiffs sought only the full amount of their damages in order to send a message to Kmart.  Counsel also reminded the jury that Ben Guffy committed an act of defiance of the court and asked the jury to send him a message that \"in Puerto Rico we won't take this.\"   Defense counsel did not object to any portion of plaintiffs' counsel's rebuttal argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then instructed the jury on the applicable law.  The only instruction to which appellant objects on appeal is the instruction given as a sanction due to Kmart's failure to produce Guffy for deposition as ordered.  The district court gave the instruction it previewed to the parties in its September 15, 1997 Order.  While Kmart objected before the instruction was given to the giving of any sanction instruction, it did not object--either before or after the sanction instruction was given--to the specific language of the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury retired to deliberate and returned with a verdict in favor of plaintiffs.  The jury found Kmart to have been negligent and awarded:  (1) $25,000 to the conjugal partnership for past medical expenses;  (2) $25,590 to the conjugal partnership for projected medical expenses in the future;  (3) $500,000 to Smith for damages excluding medical expenses;  and (4) $250,000 to Orth for damages excluding medical expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury rendered its verdict, Kmart moved for a new trial or a remittitur of all of the awards.  The district court found all components of the award to be amply supported by the evidence, except the award for past medical expenses.  Thus, the court conditionally granted the motion for a new trial.  The court stated that it would not order a new trial if plaintiffs accepted a remittitur of $8,611.20 of the award for past medical expenses.  Plaintiffs agreed to the remittitur, and the $25,000 award for past medical expenses was reduced to $16,388.80, while all other components of the damage award remained unchanged.  The court then entered judgment awarding:  (1) the remitted amount;  (2) prejudgment interest on the remitted amount;  (3) costs and attorneys' fees;  and (4) post-judgment interest on the total.  Kmart immediately appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>I.

First, Kmart objects to counsel's repeated arguments that Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith, her alleged condition, or the safety conditions in Kmart stores.  Second, Kmart complains that counsel improperly asked the jury to punish Kmart for the failure to produce Guffy for deposition.  Third, Kmart argues that plaintiffs' counsel encouraged the jury to award punitive damages against defendants by requesting that the jury consider the damages associated with other potential customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

The Alleged Instances of Improper Argument</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's first claim of improper argument centers on plaintiffs' counsel's nine references that Kmart did not \"care\" about Smith or safety conditions at its stores.  As noted by appellant, \"[i]ntroduction of purely emotional elements into the jury's deliberations is clearly prohibited conduct.\"  Doty, 908 F.2d at 1059 (citing Polansky v. CNA Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509282\"><a href=\"/opinion/509282/glenn-polansky-v-cna-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 630 (1st Cir.1988)).  Appellees argue that counsel's references were not such emotional appeals, but rather were proper arguments addressed to the negligence issues of whether Kmart knew or could foresee that injuries would occur, but still failed to prevent them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, some of plaintiffs' counsel's references do appear to have been properly directed towards the knowledge, foreseeability, and breach of duty questions.  Others, however, do not.  For example, counsel argued at one point that Kmart and its doctors \"don't care at all\" about Smith personally, which is quite different than arguing that Kmart did not care about or take steps to prevent the possibility of injury.  There were other instances in which plaintiffs' counsel argued that Kmart \"does not care,\" in the present tense, which has little bearing on the question of Kmart's negligence at the time of the accident.  Counsel also argued that Kmart did not even care enough to make Guffy available to give a deposition in the case.  Finally, counsel argued that Kmart did not care because it was not paying the true amount of damages that it caused.  The import of these remarks was to stain the corporate character of Kmart in front of the jury.  This is improper argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's second claim is that plaintiffs' counsel improperly asked the jury to punish Kmart for failing to produce Guffy for deposition by awarding a greater amount of damages.  Appellees argue that their counsel made no such argument.  During rebuttal, plaintiffs' counsel argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Now, what we do want here is that this same thing not continue to happen.  And I am not asking for punishment, I'm asking to send a message to this guy, [Ben Guffy], who even committed an act of defiance to this Court.  That's why an order is here.  And you send a message to this guy, that in Puerto Rico we won't take this.  And if they allow it, they were to pay the full price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees claim that when counsel argued \"we don't take this,\" he meant that the public would not tolerate the unsafe conditions in the Humacao Kmart store.  We agree with appellees that it is reasonable to interpret this passage as asking the jury to send a message about the unsafe conditions that caused the accident, while simultaneously reminding the jury that Guffy failed to appear for deposition and that an instruction existed to punish Kmart for that failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, counsel's reminder was improper to the extent that it was a request for a punitive form of damages, and it was also improper because it attempted to sanction Kmart a second time for its failure to produce Guffy for deposition.  Because the district court had already determined that it would punish Kmart for that failure in the form of an instruction to accept certain facts as true, this solicitation of a second sanction was improper.  Cf. Werbungs Und Commerz Union Austalt v. Collectors' Guild, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559511\"><a href=\"/opinion/559511/werbungs-und-commerz-union-austalt-v-collectors-guild-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1021</span></a></span>, 1027 (2d Cir.1991) (finding error when a district court first sanctioned a party for late production of documents by precluding the introduction of evidence and then effectively allowed the jury to sanction the party a second time by instructing the jury that it could consider the late production).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's final claim of improper argument asserts that plaintiffs' counsel encouraged the jury to award punitive damages against Kmart in excess of any compensable damages for injuries actually suffered by appellees.  Kmart claims that counsel asked the jury to consider the injuries allegedly suffered by other individuals.  We cannot agree with this contention.  Even the excerpt cited by Kmart specifically states that plaintiffs' counsel was asking for \"the full price, not more than that.\"   Counsel did attempt to portray the magnitude of the alleged safety problem by estimating the number of accidents in Kmart stores nationally.  Counsel also spoke in general terms in stating that \"every customer is entitled to be safe\" and that \"if you have an injury, you have a right to be treated fairly.\"   However, Kmart points to no instance--and we can find none--in which counsel argued that the jury should award appellees additional damages for this general problem or for any injuries allegedly suffered by others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while some of the arguments complained of by Kmart were proper, others were clearly not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Prejudice to Substantial Rights</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart faces an uphill battle in attempting to show prejudice because, on this record, we are confident in stating that a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs was inevitable.  Whether the improper arguments identified above were responsible for elevating the award to an excessive one is highly debatable.  Kmart now argues that the excessive award was caused by the improper argument of plaintiffs' counsel, but it made no such claim in its post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, or remittitur.  Nor did Kmart raise the improper argument issue in its statement of issues filed under former Fed.  R.App. P. Rule 30(b).  These omissions cast doubt on whether Kmart itself believed that the alleged excessiveness of the award was caused by plaintiffs' counsel's closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other factors could have caused or contributed to the substantiality of the award.  We have already found many of appellees' counsel's arguments to be proper, and the jury may well have been influenced to grant such a substantial award by those proper arguments.  The jury may have been swayed by the extensive expert medical testimony in this case or by the emotional testimony of Smith or Orth.  Or the jury may have been inflamed by Kmart's trial tactics (including the choice to dangle the offending cooler over Smith's head) or by Kmart's own improper argument.  Additionally, the district court took precautions in its instructions to minimize the chance of a verdict based on passion or prejudice.  The jury was instructed that:  (1) its duty was to follow the law;  (2) the attorneys' statements were not evidence;  (3) it should apply the law without being governed by sympathy or prejudice;  and (4) plaintiffs were only entitled to receive compensatory damages for injuries they had suffered and proven.  As a result, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs' counsel's improper argument caused whatever excessiveness may exist in the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Miscarriage of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Kmart could demonstrate some degree of prejudice resulting from plaintiffs' counsel's argument, we still would not count this case among the \"rare species\" of civil cases that must be reversed due to plain error.  Kmart must demonstrate that the error \"resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"  Coastal Fuels, 79 F.3d at 189.   We do not find such a miscarriage in this case, where Kmart's own closing argument was nearly as improper as that of which it complains.  Kmart repeatedly introduced emotional elements of its own into the jury's deliberations in response to plaintiffs' counsel's attempts to paint Kmart as an uncaring villain.  Kmart sought to demonize the plaintiffs when, under the guise of credibility arguments, defense counsel argued:  (1) that Smith forgot she was supposed to be in pain until her lawyer reminded her;  (2) that Orth was planning litigation rather than attending to his supposedly injured wife;  and (3) that Orth claimed to have seen another person express shock at \"what [they]'ve done\" to hide the fact that he caused the accident himself.  Both sides made emotional arguments in this case, sometimes proper, sometimes not.  But it is hardly a miscarriage of justice when a party fails to object to improper argument by its opponent and chooses to retaliate with improper argument of its own, only to have this strategic decision backfire when the jury returns a substantial award against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we find no reversible error either in plaintiffs' counsel's summation or in the district court's failure sua sponte to grant a new trial due to that summation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Improper Sanction Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's second argument is that the district court abused its discretion in giving the sanction instruction that it gave to punish Kmart for failing to produce Guffy for deposition.  Kmart recognizes that the choice of sanctions for failing to comply with a discovery order lies within the sound discretion of the court.  See Marx v. Kelly, Hart &amp; Hallman, P.C., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558018\"><a href=\"/opinion/558018/james-m-marx-v-kelly-hart-hallman-pc-dba-kelly-appleman-hart/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1991).  Kmart also concedes that it is proper for a trial judge to sanction a party for its failure to appear for deposition pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A) &amp; (B) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(d) by instructing the jury to assume that the party's testimony would have been unfavorable.  What Kmart objects to here is the language of the sanction instruction given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart acknowledges that it would not have been an abuse of the district court's discretion to have instructed the jury to accept as true that Kmart was on notice that merchandise in the Humacao store was stacked in a dangerous manner.  Kmart argues that the district court crossed the line when it instead instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>From K-Mart's refusal to produce its loss control manager, the Court instructs you that the loss control manager's statements would have been harmful to K-Mart's case.  Therefore, you are instructed to accept as true that K-Mart knew that merchandise in its store was often stacked in an unsafe manner, frequently causing that merchandise to fall from shelves and injuring K-Mart customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart argues that this instruction improperly communicated to the jury that Kmart knew of a serious, nationwide safety problem that frequently caused injuries to Kmart customers.  Kmart argues that this message caused the jury to award damages designed to punish Kmart for this nationwide problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Kmart complains after failing to raise an objection before the trial court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as is required by Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Therefore, we review the challenged jury instruction for plain error.  See Chute, 143 F.3d at 631;  Transamerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197226\"><a href=\"/opinion/197226/transamerica-v-ober/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span>, 933 (1st Cir.1997);  Poulin v. Greer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195263\"><a href=\"/opinion/195263/poulin-v-greer/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 982 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the language of the instruction was not perfect, there was no plain error.  We do not read the instruction, as Kmart does, to establish that Kmart had a nationwide safety problem.  The sanction instruction referred only to \"the store\" and did not attempt to establish any facts regarding other Kmart stores.  With regard to the statements that merchandise in the store was \"often\" stacked in an unsafe manner and that merchandise \"frequently\" fell and injured customers, we do not find this language, in the absence of a focused objection, to fall outside the scope of the district court's discretion.  Rule 37(b)(2)(A) authorizes the district court to enter an order stating that the matters that were the subject of the discovery order that was violated shall be taken to be established.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A).  Guffy was Kmart's loss control manager, and the purpose of taking his deposition was to determine facts regarding:  (1) merchandise display and storage, and (2) the extent of similar accidents and injuries occurring in Kmart stores.  When Kmart violated the court's order by failing to produce Guffy for deposition, it was proper for the district court to sanction Kmart by instructing the jury to accept the unfavorable proposition that plaintiffs hoped to prove during Guffy's testimony:  that unsafe merchandise display practices had caused similar accidents and injuries in the relevant Kmart store.  Therefore, the giving of this particular sanction instruction does not warrant a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Grossly Excessive Damage Awards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart's final argument requests a remittitur of the damages awarded to Smith and Orth because the amounts of those awards are so grossly excessive as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.  Kmart does not challenge the awards to the conjugal partnership for past and future medical expenses in the combined amount of $41,978.80.  Rather, Kmart challenges only the awards to Smith and Orth for damages excluding medical expenses in the amounts of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart has apparently dropped its request for a new trial on this ground and argues only that this Court should order a remittitur of both awards.  We review the denial of a motion for a remittitur for abuse of discretion.  See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 493;  McDonald v. Federal Laboratories, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429385\"><a href=\"/opinion/429385/william-d-mcdonald-v-federal-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, 246 (1st Cir.1984).  We will find an abuse of discretion only if the jury's verdict exceeds \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the evidence before the jury.\"  Milone v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span> (1996).  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the jury's assessment of damages will not be disturbed unless it is \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Id. (quoting Segal, 746 F.2d at 80-81) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury that plaintiffs' damages excluding medical expenses were for \"physical and emotional pain and suffering already suffered or to be suffered in the future.\"   The court defined \"pain and suffering\" damages to include any damages for loss of enjoyment of life that he or she is reasonably certain to suffer in the future, taking into account each plaintiff's past interests and way of life.  The court then defined \"damages for enjoyment of life\" to include damages for \"loss of consortium, including reduction in sexual relations, affection, comfort, companionship, conjugal life, fellowship, society and/or the assistance that accompanies the marriage relationship.\"   The court then instructed the jury that it could award only those types of damages.  As a result, the two awards at issue can only be said to reflect damages for:  (1) past and future physical pain and suffering;  (2) past and future emotional pain and suffering;  and (3) loss of enjoyment of life, including loss of consortium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Smith's Award of $500,000</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the deference owed the jury award under this standard, we do not find that the $500,000 award to Smith is so excessive as to warrant a remittitur.  The evidence of Smith's physical and emotional pain and suffering is abundant.  There was evidence that Smith has been in near-constant pain since the blow to her head, neck and shoulders at approximately 11:00 a.m. on March 4, 1995.  Smith stopped breathing and was unconscious for approximately forty seconds.  She lost feeling on the left side of her body, causing her to fear paralysis.  She was then rushed to the hospital in a cervical collar and given pain medication for a head trauma.  Smith then experienced additional pain, numbness, difficulty speaking, and muscle limitations, causing her to visit several other doctors.  Smith has been under various medications for pain and inflammation since her first visit to the hospital.  Smith has experienced severe depression, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, sleeplessness, and short-term memory loss.  Dr. Chinea testified that Smith will suffer from intermittent pain, muscle spasms, and decreased functioning of her cervical muscles for the rest of her life.  Dr. Chinea also testified that these symptoms recur and aggravate whenever Smith engages in the simplest of physical activity, and will continue to do so.  Smith has been diagnosed with PTSD, exhibiting the symptoms of nightmares, mood changes, major depression, sleeplessness, and impairment of relationships.  While Kmart took steps to minimize this physical and emotional pain and suffering before the jury, we must now view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.  Viewed in that light, we note that the record teems with evidence of Smith's past and future pain and suffering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also substantial evidence presented regarding Smith's loss of enjoyment of life.  Testimony by Smith and her doctors established that Smith was simply unable to engage in many of the physical activities she had enjoyed in the past, including dancing, walking, and taking aerobics classes.  Smith testified that she is unable to drive a car or venture out beyond her house due to her fear of additional injury.  Smith and Orth testified to the great strain that has been placed on their relationship and to the marked decrease in the amount of socializing with friends.  If the jury believed this testimony--which it is entitled to do without judicial second-guessing of its credibility determinations--the jury was faced with a plaintiff who is virtually unable to leave her home, unable to perform any physical activity, and unable to maintain normal social relationships.  Such limitations amount to a substantial loss of the opportunity to enjoy life as Smith had prior to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we agree with Kmart that this award was certainly generous, we do not find it to be \"grossly excessive\" or \"shocking to the conscience,\" in light of the extensive evidence of the pain and suffering endured and yet to be endured by Smith and the limitations that her condition has placed on her ability to enjoy life.  We have upheld awards for pain and suffering and lost enjoyment damages in the range of the damages awarded to Smith.  See, e.g., Correa, 69 F.3d at 1198 (upholding:  (1) a $200,000 award for the pain and suffering experienced by Carmen Gonzalez Figueroa for the few hours prior to her death, following the negligence of the hospital she appeared at complaining of dizziness and chest pains, and (2) a combined $500,000 award for the pain and suffering of Gonzalez' heirs);  Hogan v.

See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 494.   However, in that case, we based our finding of excessiveness on several factors.  First, there was no evidence that the plaintiff's leg injury prevented him from engaging in any particular activities.  See id.   Second, there was no evidence that the injury otherwise interfered with the plaintiff's professional, recreational, or personal life.  See id.   Third, the physical injury was not particularly severe or painful and required no major medical treatment.  See id.   Finally, there was no evidence that the plaintiff's injury was permanent.  See id.   While each aggravating factor was absent in Anthony, each aggravating factor is present in Smith's case.  Thus, our holding in Anthony is of little assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kmart offers a series of damage awards in various state courts ranging from $3,000 to $132,215 for what Kmart terms \"soft tissue injuries\" comparable to Smith's injuries.  From this, Kmart argues that the award to Smith should be reduced to more closely match those awards. However, even if we could accept Kmart's belittling characterization of Smith's injuries, the existence of smaller damage awards in other jurisdictions, based upon different factual scenarios, does not render the present award \"grossly excessive.\"   We do not disagree that the present award is generous in comparison to the awards given by Kmart as examples, but we have stated in the past that \"merely showing that the damage award is generous in comparison to other (hand-picked) cases is insufficient to warrant relief.\"   See Correa, 69 F.3d at 1198 (citing Havinga, 24 F.3d at 1488-89).   Thus, Kmart's tour of personal injury cases in courts from California to Maine does not dissuade us from finding that the evidence before the jury was sufficient to support the $500,000 award to Smith for past and future pain and suffering, emotional distress, and lost enjoyment of life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Orth's Award of $250,000</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for plaintiffs, the same cannot be said of the $250,000 award to Orth.  As a bystander to Smith's injury, Orth has no physical injuries of his own.  While this does not preclude Orth from recovering for his emotional pain and suffering and for his lost enjoyment of life, it does preclude him from recovering for a category of injury--past and future physical pain and suffering--that makes up a substantial portion of Smith's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the evidence of Orth's emotional pain and suffering was considerably less than the evidence of Smith's emotional pain and suffering.  Since Orth has not seen a psychologist, psychiatrist or therapist for his emotional distress, there was no expert testimony on this issue whatsoever.  Orth testified to his horror in watching as Smith was struck by the cooler and lost consciousness.  Orth testified that he performed CPR on Smith and thought, at various times, that she was either dead or paralyzed.  Orth testified to all of the medical visits on which he accompanied Smith and testified to his constant worry over her condition.  He testified that he was \"emotionally tired, mentally tired, [with] periods of fear.\"   In addition to Orth's testimony, Arlene Fromer (and Patrick Fromer, through a stipulation) testified that the accident \"really impacted James\" and that Orth was constantly worried about Smith's condition.  This evidence amply demonstrates that Orth witnessed a distressing event and is now often a tired and worried individual, but hardly approaches the emotional pain and suffering required to sustain such a substantial award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding Orth's loss of enjoyment of life, including loss of consortium, the evidence is nearly as limited.  Orth testified that Smith performed two to three hours of housekeeping work per day before the accident, but could only manage 45 minutes to an hour of such work after the accident.  Orth testified that he was forced to do all of the cooking each night, but that they hired someone to help with the other housework.  Orth testified that he no longer has a personal life because he works 18-20 hours per day to compensate for the amount of work that Smith can no longer perform.  Orth testified that he and Smith have a strained relationship in that \"we don't touch, we don't talk, we don't have a physical relationship anymore.\"   Orth testified that, before the accident, they had considered starting a family.  The Fromers testified that Orth had to take over many of the household responsibilities that Smith was once able to do.  The Fromers also testified that Smith and Orth stopped socializing with them after the accident.  This evidence of Orth's loss of enjoyment of life and loss of consortium simply does not rise to a level commensurate with the amount of damages awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we find the jury's $250,000 award to Orth for past and future emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of consortium to be \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, [and] so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"  Correa, 69 F.3d at 1197 (quoting Segal, 746 F.2d at 80-81) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the jury's verdict in this regard exceeds \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the evidence before the jury,\" Milone, 847 F.2d at 36, we find that the district court abused its discretion in denying Kmart's motion for a remittitur of Orth's award.  Accordingly, we remand this case with instructions to vacate the $250,000 award to Orth for his damages excluding medical expenses and order a new trial on this issue, unless Orth agrees to remit all of that award in excess of $100,000.  After carefully reviewing the evidence of Orth's damages that was presented at trial and examining the various types of injuries and damage awards of the cases cited supra at pp. ---- and ----, we conclude that $100,000 represents the upper limit of a rational appraisal of Orth's damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing, the portion of the judgment awarding Smith $500,000 in damages excluding medical expenses is AFFIRMED.  This case is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to set a deadline by which plaintiffs must accept or reject a remittitur of the $250,000 award for Orth's damages excluding medical expenses to $100,000.  If plaintiffs elect to accept this remittitur, the district court shall modify the judgment accordingly.  If plaintiffs elect not to accept this remittitur, the district court shall vacate the judgment and order a new trial on the issue of Orth's damages excluding medical expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We do note the existence of American Universal Ins.

In that per curiam opinion, this court found that review of a claim of improper argument was \"precluded\" by the lack of objection or motion for a mistrial;  the court conducted no plain error review.  See id. at 67.   While Falzone has not been expressly overruled, the mode of analysis employed in this very brief consideration of the issue has clearly been abandoned in this circuit in favor of plain error review.

See Werbungs, 930 F.2d at 1027.   This argument is meritless.  The district court did not instruct the jury to punish Kmart for its abuses, and Kmart agrees that it is a permissible sanction to instruct a jury to accept certain facts as true.  If the jury does in fact accept those facts and finds liability based on those facts, the resulting damage award is in no sense a sanction by the jury for discovery abuses</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> While our calculation of this amount is admittedly imprecise, converting feelings such as pain and suffering and the loss of enjoyment of life into dollars is not an exact science.
