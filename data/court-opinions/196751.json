We affirm essentially for the reasons\r\n\nstated  in the  district court's  memorandum, dated  June 29,\r\n\n1995.  We add only the following.\r\n\n     Even  were we  to  assume, as  appellant Ervin  Triplett\r\n\nargues, that he  alleged, and the district  court should have\r\n\nconsidered,  facts  in his  own  motion  for partial  summary\r\n\njudgment that specified the  defendants' personal role in the\r\n\nalleged deprivation of his rights,  he would not be  entitled\r\n\nto relief in this   1983  action, based on those \"facts.\"  He\r\n\nclaims that he was unlawfully deprived  of his television set\r\n\nwithout  being afforded predeprivation  due process, pursuant\r\n\nto  a policy  announced  by defendant  Pepe  and condoned  by\r\n\ndefendant Dubois, that authorizes the removal of a television\r\n\nset from  the cell of an  inmate who is on  \"awaiting action\"\r\n\nstatus  for  receipt  of  a disciplinary  report.    Triplett\r\n\ncontends  that  this  policy  is unlawful  as,  according  to\r\n\nTriplett, there is no statutory  authorization for it.   Even\r\n\nassuming,  arguendo,  that   Triplett  is  correct   in  this\r                               \r\n\ncontention,1  he, nonetheless,  would  not  prevail.    \"[A]n\r                       1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1But  see Mass.
