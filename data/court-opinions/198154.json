Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n James MacFarlane on brief pro se.\r\n Diane M. Gorrow and Soule, Leslie, Kidder, Sayward &amp; Loughmanon Motion for Summary Disposition for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 13, 1998\r\n\n                                                     Per Curiam.  James MacFarlane appeals pro se from the\r\ndistrict court's dismissal of his complaint pursuant to\r\nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  MacFarlane concedes that the district\r\ncourt properly dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it\r\n1) fails to adequately allege state action and 2) fails to\r\nstate a cause of action under New Hampshire law because the\r\ncontested alimony order has not yet been overturned in state\r\ncourt. We affirm the dismissal of the complaint on those two\r\ngrounds. See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
