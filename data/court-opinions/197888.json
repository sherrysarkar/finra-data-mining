Walsh, and Roche, Carens &amp;\r\nDeGiamcomo, P.C. on brief for appellee.\r\n\nApril 2, 1998\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  The sole issue before us\r\nis the scope of the application of 11 U.S.C.  523(a)(6), which\r\nprovides that a debtor is not discharged from any debt, \"for\r\nwillful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to\r\nthe property of another entity.\"  The facts are clear and\r\nundisputed.\r\n                              I\r\nPlaintiff-appellant John Roumeliotis was employed as an\r\nautomobile service station attendant by defendant-appellee George\r\nPopa.  While working alone at night on November 2, 1994, plaintiff\r\nwas severely beaten.  He suffered multiple fractures to his skull,\r\nthe loss of his left eye, and severe burns on his back.  There was\r\nevidence from which it could be found that Popa knew that his\r\nservice station was located in a high-crime area.  Within a period\r\nof less than a year prior to the assault on plaintiff, the service\r\nstation had been robbed twice.\r\nPlaintiff filed for workers' compensation with the\r\nMassachusetts Industrial Accident Board.  He was informed that Popa\r\nhad not obtained workmen's compensation insurance from a private\r\ncarrier and that he did not qualify as a self-insurer.  Popa,\r\ntherefore, had violated Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152,  25A (West\r\n1988).\r\nOn February 1, 1985, plaintiff brought suit against Popa\r\nin Massachusetts, alleging that Popa was strictly liable for\r\nfailing to obtain Massachusetts workers' compensation insurance and\r\nthat Popa failed to provide adequate safety for plaintiff at the\r\nservice station.  On May 3, 1996, Popa filed for chapter 7\r\nbankruptcy protection.  Plaintiff was scheduled by the debtor,\r\nPopa, as holding a contingent and unliquidated claim for an unknown\r\namount.  On July 10, 1996, plaintiff filed an adversary complaint\r\nin the Bankruptcy Court, seeking to have his state court claims\r\ndetermined to be non-dischargeable.  The complaint was dismissed on\r\nOctober 31, 1996.  An appeal was taken to the Bankruptcy Appellate\r\nPanel, which affirmed the dismissal by the Bankruptcy Court.  This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n                              II\r\nThe Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion by Justice\r\nGinsburg, has spoken directly on the question of the scope of the\r\napplication of 11 U.S.C.  523(a)(6) in a very recent case,\r\nKawaauhau v. Geiger, 118 S. Ct. 974 (1998).\r\nThe facts as stated by the Court are:\r\n  In January 1983, petitioner Margaret\r\nKawaauhau sought treatment from respondent Dr.\r\nPaul Geiger for a foot injury.  Geiger\r\nexamined Kawaauhau and admitted her to the\r\nhospital to attend to the risk of infection\r\nresulting from the injury.  Although Geiger\r\nknew that intravenous penicillin would have\r\nbeen more effective, he prescribed oral\r\npenicillin, explaining in his testimony that\r\nhe understood his patient wished to minimize\r\nthe cost of her treatment.\r\n\n  Geiger then departed on a business trip,\r\nleaving Kawaauhau in the care of other\r\nphysicians, who decided she should be\r\ntransferred to an infectious disease\r\nspecialist.  When Geiger returned, he canceled\r\nthe transfer and discontinued all antibiotics\r\nbecause he believed the infection had\r\nsubsided.  Kawaauhau's condition deteriorated\r\nover the next few days, requiring the\r\namputation of her right leg below the knee.\r\n\nId. at 976.\r\n\nThe Court's analysis is compelling:\r\n\n  We confront this pivotal question concerning\r\nthe scope of the \"willful and malicious\r\ninjury\" exception:  Does  523(a)(6)'s compass\r\ncover acts, done intentionally, that cause\r\ninjury (as the Kawaauhaus urge), or only acts\r\ndone with the actual intent to cause injury\r\n(as the Eighth Circuit ruled)?  The words of\r\nthe statute strongly support the Eighth\r\nCircuit's reading.\r\n\n  . . . .\r\n\n  The word \"willful\" in (a)(6) modifies the\r\nword \"injury,\" indicating that nondischarge-\r\nability takes a deliberate or intentional\r\ninjury, not merely a deliberate or intentional\r\nact that leads to injury.  Had Congress meant\r\nto exempt debts resulting from unintentionally\r\ninflicted injuries, it might have described\r\ninstead \"willful acts that cause injury.\"  Or,\r\nCongress might have selected an additional\r\nword or words, i.e., \"reckless\" or\r\n\"negligent,\" to modify \"injury.\"  Moreover, as\r\nthe Eighth Circuit observed, the (a)(6)\r\nformulation triggers in the lawyer's mind the\r\ncategory \"intentional torts,\" as distinguished\r\nfrom negligent or reckless torts.  Intentional\r\ntorts generally require that the actor intend\r\n\"the consequences of an act,\" not simply \"the\r\nact itself.\"  Restatement (Second) of Torts\r\n 8A, comment a, p. 15 (1964) (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n\nId. at 977.\r\n\nThe Court held, \"We hold that debts arising from\r\nrecklessly or negligently inflicted injuries do not fall within the\r\ncompass of  523(a)(6).\"\r\nIt is clear in the case before us that the failure of\r\nPopa to obtain workmen's compensation insurance was an intentional\r\nact that caused injury, as were the doctor's actions in Geiger, but\r\nPopa's failure to obtain insurance was not done, as in Geiger, with\r\nthe actual intent to cause injury.\r\nWe hold that Geiger clearly and unmistakably means that\r\nplaintiff's expenses and damages arising out of the assault on him \r\ndo not fall within the compass of U.S.C.  523(a)(6).\r\nThe judgment of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel is\r\naffirmed. \r\nNo costs to either party.\n",
