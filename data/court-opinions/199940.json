Zonay and Ford & Zonay, P.C. on brief for appellant.\n\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, Michael J.\nPelgro, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Susan M. Poswistilo, Assistant\nU.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 8, 2002\n\f              BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.      Defendant-appellant Jose\n\nMarte, along with nineteen other individuals, was charged in a\n\nmulti-count indictment of knowingly and intentionally conspiring to\n\npossess with intent to distribute and distributing quantities of\n\nheroin in violation of Title 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).          Page three of\n\nthe indictment stated that because the conspiracy described in\n\nCount I involved one kilogram or more of a heroin mixture, the\n\nprovisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(i) applied, and therefore a\n\nminimum sentence of ten years was mandated.\n\n              Marte entered a guilty plea to Count I pursuant to a\n\nwritten plea agreement with the government.           After a sentencing\n\nhearing, the district court sentenced Marte to 168 months (14\n\nyears) in prison and 5 years supervised release.\n\n              Two issues are before us: (1) whether the district court\n\nerred in determining that the amount of heroin Marte conspired to\n\ndistribute amounted to one kilogram or more; and (2) whether the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding that Marte was a supervisor or\n\nmanager in the framework of the heroin conspiracy.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n              The investigation that culminated in this case started in\n\nAugust, 1996, and ended in July, 1999.               It ferreted out an\n\nextensive conspiracy to purchase heroin from sellers in New York\n\nCity    and   transport   it   to   Lynn,   Massachusetts,   where   it   was\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fprocessed and stored.      The heroin was then sold to customers in\n\nMassachusetts, Vermont, and other states.\n\n          Starting in 1996, a Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\")\n\nundercover agent bought good-sized quantities of heroin from Angel\n\nLopez and others in Lynn.        In June, 1998, the DEA was judicially\n\nauthorized to place wiretaps on three telephones used by Lopez and\n\nothers so as to obtain information about their heroin trafficking.\n\nThe wiretapped conversations led the DEA to conclude that Domingo\n\nAcevedo and his brother, Rafael, were the sources of Lopez's heroin\n\npurchases and that Domingo's apartment at 193 Essex Street was used\n\nas an office in which heroin sales were discussed and settled by\n\ntelephone.\n\n          The DEA was judicially authorized to install a wiretap on\n\nthe phone in Domingo Acevedo's apartment at 193 Essex Street in\n\nLynn. Based on the conversations recorded by this wiretap, the DEA\n\nlearned that Marte and Nicholas Moreno, inter alia, regularly\n\nbought large amounts of heroin in New York City.               The heroin was\n\nsupplied to the Acevedo brothers, who in turn resold it to Lopez\n\nand others.     The DEA also learned that Marte and Moreno used the\n\napartment at 193 Essex Street as a base of operation for planning\n\nheroin sales and trips to New York City to obtain heroin.\n\n             In the fall of 1998 the DEA in Vermont investigated\n\nheroin trafficking in Barre, Vermont, and its environs.                     The\n\nVermont DEA     learned   that   heroin   was   being   sold    regularly    to\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fresidents   of   Vermont   by    Jesus   Veadejo,   who   resided   in   Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts.     Veadejo was arrested in early December, 1998.           As\n\na result, it was determined that Marte regularly sold heroin to\n\nVeadejo, who resold it to Vermont dealers, who took it to Vermont\n\nfor sale to retail customers.\n\n            In early February, 1999, the DEA obtained authorization\n\nfor four more wiretaps.     Three of the wiretaps were the sources of\n\nincriminating evidence.         These wiretaps established, inter alia,\n\nthat an apartment at 345 Essex Street in Lynn, shared by two of the\n\nindicted conspirators, was also used as an office for discussing\n\nand consummating heroin transactions.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            Clear error is the standard we apply in assessing the\n\ndistrict court's findings concerning the quantity of heroin and\n\nMarte's role in the conspiracy.          United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d\n\n98, 102 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Hernandez, 218 F.3d 58,\n\n71 (1st Cir. 2000).        We review de novo the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and its application of\n\nthe law.    United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            We first set forth the pertinent law of sentencing.             We\n\nstart with the Guidelines:        \"Where there is no drug seizure or the\n\namount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court\n\nshall approximate the quantity of controlled substance.\"            U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1, cmt. n.12 (2001)(emphasis added).                The rule in this\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fCircuit is that a reasonable determination of drug quantity may be\n\nused where \"it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug\n\nquantity for sentencing purposes.\"              United States v. Morrill, 8\n\nF.3d   864,    871   (1st       Cir.   1993);   see   also    United    States    v.\n\nHuddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 149 (1st Cir. 1998).                 We have also held,\n\nhowever, that a reasonable estimate of drug quantity must be based\n\non adequate indicia of reliability and support in the record.\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 228 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).        Moreover,     a    district   court     judge    should   follow    a\n\n\"conservative approach\" when determining huge quantities.                  United\n\nStates v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 113-14 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              As is usual in sentencing appeals, the district court\n\nused the presentence report (PSR) as the primary source for its\n\nfindings of facts.        It also examined witness statements and three\n\naffidavits of co-conspirators submitted by the government.                       Our\n\ncareful examination of the evidence, as contained in the PSR and\n\naffidavits, convinces us that the district court did not clearly\n\nerr in finding that Marte conspired to distribute more than one\n\nkilogram of heroin.       Nor was it clearly erroneous for the district\n\ncourt to find that Marte's role in the conspiracy was that of a\n\nmanager or supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f             The evidence as to drug quantity is to the following\n\neffect.     Marte was involved in the heroin business with Moreno.1\n\nAt times Marte was a wholesale buyer for Moreno and at other times\n\nhe   and    Moreno,     working   together,       supplied     heroin    to   joint\n\ncustomers. Although the district court did not explicitly so find,\n\nwe think the evidence amply permitted it to have found that Marte\n\nand Moreno knowingly worked together as the principal wholesale\n\nsuppliers for the conspiracy.             Under well-established conspiracy\n\ndoctrine, either could be found responsible for the sales by the\n\nother.     See, e.g., United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1021\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             Sometime in 1998, Moreno introduced Marte to Moreno's New\n\nYork heroin source. From then on Marte bought heroin directly from\n\nthe source rather than from Moreno.            Moreno told another indicted\n\nconspirator,      Rafael     Acevedo,       that    he    (Moreno)        \"provided\n\napproximately     200    grams    every   25-30    days   to   Marte\"     from   the\n\nbeginning of 1998.\n\n             Acevedo, who usually purchased from Moreno, stated in an\n\naffidavit that he purchased heroin directly from Marte \"more than\n\nfive times.\"     These purchases amounted to at least forty to fifty\n\ngrams.     Marte and Moreno used agents to go to New York and purchase\n\nheroin for him.         Bolivar Jiminez went to New York on several\n\noccasions and picked up hundreds of grams of heroin.                    Rome Godoy,\n\n\n     1\n         Moreno fled before he could be arrested.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fa.k.a. Elizabeth Ruiz, also went to New York for Moreno and Marte\n\nseveral times; on one such occasion she picked up 100 grams of\n\nheroin.\n\n              On June 9, 1998, Marte was arrested by the police in\n\nChelsea, Massachusetts, after he had struck one of the arresting\n\nofficers with his automobile in an attempt to escape.                     Over 110\n\nbags of heroin with a net weight of 2.01 grams were found in his\n\ncar.    On August 10 and 11, 1998, wiretap conversation established\n\nthat Marte supplied Lopez with 58.6 grams of heroin, which Lopez\n\nsold to an undercover DEA agent for $7,000.                 On August 15, another\n\nwiretap conversation established that Marte told Moreno that he had\n\ngiven \"500\" to another person in the past week.\n\n              Additional findings as to drug quantity were set forth in\n\nthe PSR.      Marte's use of Jiminez and Godoy as his agents to obtain\n\nthe heroin in New York and deliver it to his office in Lynn\n\nestablished that 300 grams of heroin were attributable to Marte.\n\nThe arrest of Marte by the police in Chelsea involved 252.9 grams\n\nof heroin for which Marte was responsible.                    Marte supplied his\n\nVermont connection, Veadejo, with 129.6 grams of heroin over time.\n\nMarte   had    stored   140     grams   of    heroin   at    the   Chatham     Street\n\napartment.       The    total    amount      of   heroin    that   the   PSR   found\n\nattributable to Marte was 1,422.5 grams, which translated into 1.4\n\nkilograms.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                In light of this evidence, we conclude that there was no\n\ndouble counting. No good reason has been advanced for doubting the\n\nProbation Department's statement that if there was a question that\n\nthe drugs had already been counted, it did not attribute the second\n\namount     to    Marte.       Moreover,    we   see    no    error     in   the    PSR’s\n\ndetermination of drug quantity.\n\n                Marte    contends    strenuously      that     there    are      \"direct\n\ninconsistencies\" between statements in the affidavits and the\n\ndeterminations in the PSR.           He points specifically to paragraph 13\n\nof the PSR, which states: \"Marte supplied Domingo Acevedo with 200\n\ngrams of heroin every 20 to 30 days.\"            The government's response is\n\nthat paragraph 111 of the PSR contained an error in transcription\n\nand that paragraph 13, which was the basis for the analysis, stated\n\ncorrectly that \"Moreno supplied Marte with 200 grams every 20 to 30\n\ndays.\"     It further points out that if paragraph 13 is accepted,\n\nthere    is     no    discrepancy    between    the    affidavits       and      the   PSR\n\nstatement.        The government also notes that the district court was\n\nadvised of the transcription error in paragraph 111.                           The only\n\nthing that is lacking is an indication by the district court that\n\nit   was      aware     of   the   transcription      error.      That      is    hardly\n\nsufficient, however, to find that there was clear error in the\n\ncourt's finding of the amount of heroin involved.\n\n                Finally, the PSR stated that Jiminez, Godoy, and Veadejo\n\nworked under the supervision and control of Marte.                            There was\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fadequate evidence for this finding and the district court did not\n\nerr in increasing Marte's sentence to reflect his role in the\n\noffense.\n\n            We affirm the sentence of the district court in all\n\nrespects.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Moreover,     a    district   court     judge    should   follow    a\n\n\"conservative approach\" when determining huge quantities.                  United\n\nStates v.

It also examined witness statements and three\n\naffidavits of co-conspirators submitted by the government.                       Our\n\ncareful examination of the evidence, as contained in the PSR and\n\naffidavits, convinces us that the district court did not clearly\n\nerr in finding that Marte conspired to distribute more than one\n\nkilogram of heroin.       Nor was it clearly erroneous for the district\n\ncourt to find that Marte's role in the conspiracy was that of a\n\nmanager or supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f             The evidence as to drug quantity is to the following\n\neffect.     Marte was involved in the heroin business with Moreno.1\n\nAt times Marte was a wholesale buyer for Moreno and at other times\n\nhe   and    Moreno,     working   together,       supplied     heroin    to   joint\n\ncustomers. Although the district court did not explicitly so find,\n\nwe think the evidence amply permitted it to have found that Marte\n\nand Moreno knowingly worked together as the principal wholesale\n\nsuppliers for the conspiracy.             Under well-established conspiracy\n\ndoctrine, either could be found responsible for the sales by the\n\nother.     See, e.g., United States v. O'Campo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1021\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             Sometime in 1998, Moreno introduced Marte to Moreno's New\n\nYork heroin source. From then on Marte bought heroin directly from\n\nthe source rather than from Moreno.            Moreno told another indicted\n\nconspirator,      Rafael     Acevedo,       that    he    (Moreno)        \"provided\n\napproximately     200    grams    every   25-30    days   to   Marte\"     from   the\n\nbeginning of 1998.\n\n             Acevedo, who usually purchased from Moreno, stated in an\n\naffidavit that he purchased heroin directly from Marte \"more than\n\nfive times.\"     These purchases amounted to at least forty to fifty\n\ngrams.     Marte and Moreno used agents to go to New York and purchase\n\nheroin for him.         Bolivar Jiminez went to New York on several\n\noccasions and picked up hundreds of grams of heroin.                    Rome Godoy,\n\n\n     1\n         Moreno fled before he could be arrested.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fa.k.a. Elizabeth Ruiz, also went to New York for Moreno and Marte\n\nseveral times; on one such occasion she picked up 100 grams of\n\nheroin.\n\n              On June 9, 1998, Marte was arrested by the police in\n\nChelsea, Massachusetts, after he had struck one of the arresting\n\nofficers with his automobile in an attempt to escape.                     Over 110\n\nbags of heroin with a net weight of 2.01 grams were found in his\n\ncar.    On August 10 and 11, 1998, wiretap conversation established\n\nthat Marte supplied Lopez with 58.6 grams of heroin, which Lopez\n\nsold to an undercover DEA agent for $7,000.                 On August 15, another\n\nwiretap conversation established that Marte told Moreno that he had\n\ngiven \"500\" to another person in the past week.\n\n              Additional findings as to drug quantity were set forth in\n\nthe PSR.      Marte's use of Jiminez and Godoy as his agents to obtain\n\nthe heroin in New York and deliver it to his office in Lynn\n\nestablished that 300 grams of heroin were attributable to Marte.\n\nThe arrest of Marte by the police in Chelsea involved 252.9 grams\n\nof heroin for which Marte was responsible.                    Marte supplied his\n\nVermont connection, Veadejo, with 129.6 grams of heroin over time.\n\nMarte   had    stored   140     grams   of    heroin   at    the   Chatham     Street\n\napartment.       The    total    amount      of   heroin    that   the   PSR   found\n\nattributable to Marte was 1,422.5 grams, which translated into 1.4\n\nkilograms.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                In light of this evidence, we conclude that there was no\n\ndouble counting. No good reason has been advanced for doubting the\n\nProbation Department's statement that if there was a question that\n\nthe drugs had already been counted, it did not attribute the second\n\namount     to    Marte.       Moreover,    we   see    no    error     in   the    PSR’s\n\ndetermination of drug quantity.\n\n                Marte    contends    strenuously      that     there    are      \"direct\n\ninconsistencies\" between statements in the affidavits and the\n\ndeterminations in the PSR.           He points specifically to paragraph 13\n\nof the PSR, which states: \"Marte supplied Domingo Acevedo with 200\n\ngrams of heroin every 20 to 30 days.\"            The government's response is\n\nthat paragraph 111 of the PSR contained an error in transcription\n\nand that paragraph 13, which was the basis for the analysis, stated\n\ncorrectly that \"Moreno supplied Marte with 200 grams every 20 to 30\n\ndays.\"     It further points out that if paragraph 13 is accepted,\n\nthere    is     no    discrepancy    between    the    affidavits       and      the   PSR\n\nstatement.        The government also notes that the district court was\n\nadvised of the transcription error in paragraph 111.                           The only\n\nthing that is lacking is an indication by the district court that\n\nit   was      aware     of   the   transcription      error.      That      is    hardly\n\nsufficient, however, to find that there was clear error in the\n\ncourt's finding of the amount of heroin involved.\n\n                Finally, the PSR stated that Jiminez, Godoy, and Veadejo\n\nworked under the supervision and control of Marte.                            There was\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fadequate evidence for this finding and the district court did not\n\nerr in increasing Marte's sentence to reflect his role in the\n\noffense.\n\n            We affirm the sentence of the district court in all\n\nrespects.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f</pre>",
