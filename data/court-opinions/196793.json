The\r\n\ngovernment  presented  evidence  only concerning  the  August\r\n\narrest and excluded  evidence on  the charge  of receiving  a\r\n\nstolen  vehicle.   When  the defense  attorney remarked  that\r\n\nthere was no evidence that Omisore had passed a stolen credit\r\n\ncard,  the court  responded,  \"Well,  I  think I  have  heard\r\n\nplenty.\"    When the  defense attorney was  making his  final\r\n\nargument  at the close of the hearing, the court directed him\r\n\nto \"[c]oncentrate on the credit card.\"\r\n\n          Within this  context,  the court's  stated  finding\r\n\nthat  Omisore  had violated  the  conditions  of his  release\r\n\ncontained  within it  an  implicit finding  that Omisore  had\r\n\nattempted  to  purchase  goods  with a  stolen  credit  card.\r\n\nAccordingly, although  it would  have been preferable  if the\r\n\ndistrict court had more  clearly articulated its findings and\r\n\nreasons  for  revoking  Omisore's  supervised   release,  its\r\n\nfailure to do so did not constitute plain error.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          B.

R.  Crim. P.  32.1(a)(2)(B).   The  probation\r                     \r\n\nrecords were  not used as evidence  against Omisore, however.\r\n\nThe  technical violations of failure  to timely report to the\r\n\nprobation  officer  were  continued  by  the  district  court\r\n\nwithout  a  finding.     Moreover,  the  court  directed  the\r\n\nprobation department  to supply  the dates of  contact, which\r\n\nwere  recited  in  court.     The  evidence  against  Omisore\r\n\nconsisted of testimony by witnesses at the revocation hearing\r\n\nregarding  Omisore's use  of  a  stolen  credit card.    That\r\n\nevidence was fully disclosed to Omisore.\r\n\n          Omisore   argues   that  the   testimony  regarding\r\n\nfrequent meetings  between Omisore and members  of the FOCTF,\r\n\ndespite denials that Omisore was being used  as an informant,\r\n\n\"should  have   alerted  the  court  to  the  fact  that  the\r\n\nchronological entries, which  logged the probation  officer's\r\n\nsupervision  of   Mr.  Omisore,   may  well   have  contained\r\n\ninformation which  corroborated Mr. Omisore's  contentions or\r\n\nimpeached the  witnesses or  both.\"  Omisore  never expressly\r\n\nargued the purposes for which he sought the records, however.\r\n\nUnder those circumstances, the district court did not  err in\r\n\ndenying Omisore's  motion.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          II.  Merits of Revocation Decision \r                                                        \r\n\n          \"[O]n  appeal [from a  decision revoking supervised\r\n\nrelease], [this court] consider[s]  the evidence in the light\r\n\nmost favorable to the government.\" United States v. Portalla,\r                                                                        \r\n\n985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir. 1993).  Viewed in this light, and\r\n\nrecognizing  \"the  district  court's  broad  legal  power  to\r\n\ndetermine  witness credibility,\"  id.,  the  record  contains\r                                                 \r\n\nsufficient evidence to  meet the \"preponderance of  evidence\"\r\n\nstandard.\r\n\n          Omisore   argues  that  \"[n]othing  in  the  record\r\n\nestablishes that  Mr. Omisore possessed or  actually used the\r\n\nstolen  credit  card.\"   The  record  contains the  following\r\n\nevidence that Omisore was the one who passed the stolen card.\r\n\nRuth Corliss, the cashier, identified Omisore in court as the\r\n\nman  who  gave  her  the  card.    Although she  subsequently\r\n\nindicated  some slight uncertainty,  she never  confirmed the\r\n\ndefense  attorney's  suggestion  that  another  man  was with\r\n\nOmisore and gave her  the card.   Reham Pasha Ahmad, a  store\r\n\ndetective, testified that Omisore  identified himself as  the\r\n\nowner  of  the card  and gave  a  social security  number and\r\n\nbirthdate in  an attempt  to prove  ownership.   The district\r\n\ncourt did  not clearly err in finding  that Omisore attempted\r\n\nto use a stolen  credit card, in violation of  the conditions\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nof his supervised release. There was  no abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          The  district  court  judgment  revoking  Omisore's\r\n\nsupervised release is summarily affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

The  evidence  against  Omisore\r\n\nconsisted of testimony by witnesses at the revocation hearing\r\n\nregarding  Omisore's use  of  a  stolen  credit card.    That\r\n\nevidence was fully disclosed to Omisore.\r\n\n          Omisore   argues   that  the   testimony  regarding\r\n\nfrequent meetings  between Omisore and members  of the FOCTF,\r\n\ndespite denials that Omisore was being used  as an informant,\r\n\n\"should  have   alerted  the  court  to  the  fact  that  the\r\n\nchronological entries, which  logged the probation  officer's\r\n\nsupervision  of   Mr.  Omisore,   may  well   have  contained\r\n\ninformation which  corroborated Mr. Omisore's  contentions or\r\n\nimpeached the  witnesses or  both.\"  Omisore  never expressly\r\n\nargued the purposes for which he sought the records, however.\r\n\nUnder those circumstances, the district court did not  err in\r\n\ndenying Omisore's  motion.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          II.  Merits of Revocation Decision \r                                                        \r\n\n          \"[O]n  appeal [from a  decision revoking supervised\r\n\nrelease], [this court] consider[s]  the evidence in the light\r\n\nmost favorable to the government.\" United States v. Portalla,\r                                                                        \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600258\"><a href=\"/opinion/600258/united-states-v-vincent-m-portalla-aka-vincent-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (1st Cir. 1993).  Viewed in this light, and\r\n\nrecognizing  \"the  district  court's  broad  legal  power  to\r\n\ndetermine  witness credibility,\"  id.,  the  record  contains\r                                                 \r\n\nsufficient evidence to  meet the \"preponderance of  evidence\"\r\n\nstandard.\r\n\n          Omisore   argues  that  \"[n]othing  in  the  record\r\n\nestablishes that  Mr. Omisore possessed or  actually used the\r\n\nstolen  credit  card.\"   The  record  contains the  following\r\n\nevidence that Omisore was the one who passed the stolen card.\r\n\nRuth Corliss, the cashier, identified Omisore in court as the\r\n\nman  who  gave  her  the  card.    Although she  subsequently\r\n\nindicated  some slight uncertainty,  she never  confirmed the\r\n\ndefense  attorney's  suggestion  that  another  man  was with\r\n\nOmisore and gave her  the card.   Reham Pasha Ahmad, a  store\r\n\ndetective, testified that Omisore  identified himself as  the\r\n\nowner  of  the card  and gave  a  social security  number and\r\n\nbirthdate in  an attempt  to prove  ownership.   The district\r\n\ncourt did  not clearly err in finding  that Omisore attempted\r\n\nto use a stolen  credit card, in violation of  the conditions\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nof his supervised release. There was  no abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          The  district  court  judgment  revoking  Omisore's\r\n\nsupervised release is summarily affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n</pre>",
