Claimant Jose Gonzalez  appeals a district\r                           \r\n\ncourt order that upheld a decision by the Commissioner of the\r\r\n\nSocial   Security   Administration  that   denied  claimant's\r\n\napplication for child's disability benefits.  See 42 U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n402(d)(1).   Claimant, who was  18 when he  filed his initial\r\n\napplication, alleged that  he suffered from  disabling mental\r\n\nretardation since  birth.1   We have thoroughly  reviewed the\r                                     1\r\n\nrecord and the parties'  briefs on appeal.  We  conclude that\r\n\nthe     district  court   was  correct  in   concluding  that\r\n\nCommissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence.\r\n\nWe add the following comments.\r\n\n     1.    Claimant's contention  that  the  record does  not\r\n\nsupport  the  ALJ's  conclusion  that  he  is  able  to  work\r\n\nindependently without close supervision is belied by the fact\r\n\nthat claimant adduced  no evidence to  show that he  required\r                                     \r\n\nspecial supervision to perform any of the part time jobs that\r\n\nhe had done  in the past.   To be  sure, claimant's  teachers\r\n\nreported that he required \"direct supervision\" to perform and\r\n\ncomplete tasks  in the vocational soldering  program in which\r\n\nclaimant was  enrolled.   But this  does  not establish  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1We  note  that  the  named  plaintiff  in  this  case  is\r               1\r\nclaimant's  mother,  Barbara Concepcion-Morales.   Claimant's\r\ndisability application was based  on her earnings record, and\r\nshe completed   the disability claim application forms on her\r\nson's  behalf.   As claimant  Gonzalez is  the real  party in\r\ninterest, we speak of him as the sole appellant.\r\r\n\nclaimant  requires  close   supervision  to  perform   simple\r\n\nunskilled work.2  \r                           2\r\n\n     2.  The  ALJ implicitly relied on the Grid  to find that\r\n\nclaimant  was  capable  of  the  full  range  of  skilled and\r\n\nunskilled  work  at all  exertional  levels.   See  Ortiz  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSecretary  of Health and Human Services, 890 F.2d 520, 524 n.\r                                                    \r\n\n4 (1st Cir. 1989).  This conclusion is supportable insofar as\r\n\nit pertains  to  unskilled work.    The evidence  shows  that\r\n\nclaimant had at most moderate limitations in his ability meet\r\n\nthe  basic demands of unskilled  work.3  While  it would have\r                                                  3\r\n\nbeen  preferable  for  the   ALJ  to  have  taken  vocational\r\n\ntestimony, the  record suggests  that claimant's mild  mental\r\n\nretardation  did  not  significantly  diminish  the  base  of\r\n\nunskilled  work  that  is otherwise  available  to  claimant,\r\n\nparticularly  given  the  fact  that  this  claimant  has  no\r                                                                         \r\n\nexertional limitations.  \r\n\n     3. Contrary  to claimant's  argument on appeal,  the ALJ\r\n\ndid not impermissibly find that claimant's impairment was not\r\n\nsevere  within the  meaning of  step two  in contrast  to the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2Similarly,  while  Dr.  Cabiya  reported  that claimant's\r               2\r\nability  to  learn  a  simple  repetitive  task  under  close\r                     to  learn\r\nsupervision appeared  appropriate, he did not  say that close\r\nsupervision was required for claimant to continuously perform\r\nsimple  unskilled jobs.  The record suggests that this is not\r\nthe case. \r\n\n   3See SSR  85-15 (basic  demands of unskilled  work include\r               3   \r\nability  to   carry  out  simply  instructions,   to  respond\r\nappropriately to supervision and  coworkers, and to deal with\r\nchanges in work setting).\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nopinions of the Commissioner's  consultants.  While the ALJ's\r\n\nPRTF contained  ratings  that correspond  with  a  non-severe\r\n\nimpairment,  the   remainder  of  the   ALJ's  opinion  holds\r\n\notherwise.  Under these circumstances, we disregard the ALJ's\r\n\ncontrary ratings. See Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 525 n. 6.\r                                       \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
