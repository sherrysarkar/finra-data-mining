The other named defendants\n\nwere not served and they were properly dismissed.\n\n     The district court found that RAC had failed to provide, in\n\nopposing summary judgment, \"a separate, short, and concise statement of\n\nthe material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a\n\ngenuine issue to be tried, properly supported by specific reference to\n\nthe record.\" D.P.R.

We remind counsel that\n\n     1    The district court also analyzed RAC's claims on their\nmerits as though there had been no failure to comply with the Local\nRules, and found them wanting on a number of grounds.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fcompliance with the directives of the district courts is necessary to\n\nthe orderly conduct of litigation, and that this Court is largely\n\nunsympathetic to noncompliant parties.

Accordingly, we also take the facts as set forth\n\nby NAMPAC.\n\n     The district court thoughtfully discussed the variety of reasons\n\nwhy RAC's claims failed.    We have nothing to add to the district\n\ncourt's explanation of why NAMPAC is not liable to RAC.   1st Cir. Loc.\n\nR. 27(c).
