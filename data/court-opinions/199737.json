Nikhil Pathak, a physician at\n\nthe Veterans Administration Medical and Regional Office Center\n\nlocated in Togus, Maine, was suspended from his position for\n\nseven days as discipline for his sexual harassment of a nurse,\n\nKathleen Lyons.      Lyons's sexual harassment claim was first\n\ninvestigated   when,   in   1994,   she    filed   an   administrative\n\ncomplaint, which prompted the Chief of Staff at the Center, Dr.\n\nE. Douglas Holyoke, to investigate the matter.           A few months\n\nlater, and as a result of this investigation, Dr. Holyoke served\n\nDr. Pathak with a notice of a proposed fourteen day suspension.\n\nThe notice cited fourteen \"separate incident[s] of sexual\n\nharassment\" that \"when taken together . . . show a pattern of\n\nsexual harassment.\"    After Dr. Pathak obtained counsel, and his\n\ncounsel filed a legal brief and orally argued his case, John\n\nSims, the Director of the Center, sustained the charges, but\n\nreduced the proposed fourteen day suspension to seven days.\n\n          Dr. Pathak refused to accept the discipline, filed a formal\n\ngrievance, and went to a hearing before an impartial grievance\n\nexaminer. Following a three day hearing, the grievance examiner issued\n\na written \"Report of Findings and Recommendations,\" finding that Dr.\n\nPathak had engaged in sexual harassment and recommending that the seven\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fday suspension be sustained.     T he Department's Regional Director\n\naccepted the grievance examiner's recommendation and sustained the\n\nsuspension.\n\n           In addition to her administrative complaint, Kathleen\n\nLyons brought a lawsuit against both the hospital and Dr. Pathak\n\nalleging sexual harassment and other claims. A Maine jury found\n\nthe hospital liable1 because of Dr. Pathak's harassment and\n\nawarded Nurse Lyons $375,000.2\n\n           Nonetheless, an unchastened Dr. Pathak filed a lawsuit\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Maine\n\nseeking to challenge his seven day suspension.3 He sought review\n\nof the administrative suspension, arguing that the decisions of\n\nCenter Director Sims, the grievance examiner, and the Regional\n\nDirector   were   all   arbitrary,      unsupported   by   substantial\n\nevidence, and not in accordance with law.        Pathak also alleged\n\n     1    Lyons's other lawsuit for         assault   against    Pathak\nresulted in a verdict for Pathak.\n     2     The jury award was reduced to $300,000 under the Civil Rights\nAct of 1991's damages cap, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3) (1994). The court\nawarded Lyons an additional $83,677.50 in attorney's fees. Lyons v.\nBrown, No. 95-0194-B, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11620, at *9 (D. Me. July\n26, 2000).\n     3    The parties consented to have any and all district court\nproceedings conducted before a magistrate judge. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n73(b); 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthat Center Director Sims exhibited bias against him when\n\nDirector Sims       sustained   the    sexual    harassment   charges   and\n\nimposed the seven day suspension and that this constituted a\n\nviolation of due process of law.4              The district court entered\n\nsummary judgment on all of Pathak's claims.            Pathak v. Dep't of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 130 F. Supp. 2d 140, 150 (D. Me. 2001).\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Our review of the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment is de novo.       Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38,\n\n47 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1161 (2000).\n\n            On Pathak's appeal, the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nfor   the   first   time   raises     a     jurisdictional   argument   that\n\nPathak's challenge to the seven day suspension is not subject to\n\njudicial review.5      Pathak responds to the Department's argument\n\nby claiming that jurisdiction does in fact exist, at least as to\n\nhis assertion of a violation of his constitutional rights. But,\n\n\n      4   Pathak abandoned his equal protection claim in the district\ncourt, Pathak v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 130 F. Supp. 2d 140, 147\n(D. Me. 2001), and he has not attempted to resurrect it here.\n      5    \"A challenge to federal subject matter jurisdiction may be\nraised at any time, including for the first time on appeal.\" Halleran\nv. Hoffman, 966 F.2d 45, 47 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(h)(3) (\"Whenever it appears . . . that the court lacks jurisdiction\nof the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\").\n\n                                      -4-\n\fat best, judicial review would only be available for colorable\n\nconstitutional claims, Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988),\n\nand we agree with the Department that Pathak's constitutional\n\nclaims are not even colorable.          Accordingly, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Pathak's complaint should be dismissed, but\n\nvacate the district court's grant of summary judgment and\n\ninstead remand for a dismissal for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Jurisdiction over Pathak's challenge to his seven day\n\nsuspension is governed by United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439\n\n(1988).     The Fausto Court reasoned that because the Civil\n\nService Reform Act of 1978 (\"CSRA\"), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92\n\nStat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5\n\nU.S.C.), \"established a comprehensive system for reviewing\n\npersonnel action taken against federal employees,\" the Act's\n\n\"deliberate      exclusion     of    [nonpreference      excepted        service\n\nmembers] . . . from the provisions establishing administrative\n\nand   judicial    review     for    personnel   action   .     .    .    prevents\n\nrespondent from seeking judicial review . . . under the Back Pay\n\nAct,\"     484   U.S.   at   455.      Fausto    stands   for       the    general\n\n                                      -5-\n\fproposition that judicial review is unavailable to a federal\n\nemployee who has suffered an adverse personnel action if CSRA\n\ndoes not provide judicial review.             Id. at 447-49, 455.\n\n             As    a   physician   appointed    to    the    Veterans   Health\n\nAdministration under 38 U.S.C. § 7401(1) (1994), Pathak is an\n\n\"excepted service\" employee.             This is because, as a Veterans\n\nHealth Administration physician, he is appointed \"without regard\n\nto civil-service requirements,\" id. § 7403(a), and so he is not\n\nin the       \"competitive service,\" 5 U.S.C. § 2102 (1994), which\n\nmeans he is part of the \"excepted service,\" id. § 2103(a).                 As\n\na nonpreference eligible member of the excepted service, Pathak\n\nis not entitled to CSRA's protections for competitive service\n\nemployees.        See id. §§ 7501-7504; C.D. Moore, Personnel Actions\n\nthat May Be Challenged, in Federal Civil Service Law and\n\nProcedures: A Basic Guide 3, 4-5 (E.M. Bussey, ed., 2d ed.\n\n1990).       Even if Pathak were covered by CSRA's provisions\n\ngoverning employees suspended for fourteen days or less, these\n\nprotections do not provide for judicial review.                 5 U.S.C. §§\n\n7501-7504; Fausto, 484 U.S. at 443 (\"No provision of the CSRA\n\ngives nonpreference members of the excepted service the right to\n\n.   .    .   judicial    review    of    suspension    for    misconduct.\").\n\n                                        -6-\n\fAccordingly, under Fausto, Pathak cannot obtain judicial review\n\nof his suspension.        See 484 U.S. at 447-48.\n\n            Because CSRA does not provide Pathak with a right to\n\njudicial review, the logic of Fausto dictates that he cannot go\n\naround CSRA and assert federal jurisdiction by relying upon the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act.             See Mann v. Haigh, 120 F.3d 34,\n\n37-38 (4th Cir. 1997) (extending Fausto's analysis to prohibit\n\nAPA review of an adverse employment decision).                    If the result\n\nwere   otherwise,    then       Pathak,    as    a    nonpreference     excepted\n\nemployee, would be entitled to judicial review unavailable to\n\ncompetitive service employees and preference eligibles.                        The\n\nresult would be the same perverse outcome, rejected in Fausto,\n\nin which excepted service employees received more protection\n\nthan competitive service employees who are supposed to be in a\n\n\"preferred position.\"       484 U.S. at 449.\n\n            Second, Pathak argues that the specific statutory\n\nprovisions    governing     Veterans       Health      Administration     health\n\nprofessionals,      not   CSRA,     govern      his    case.      Congress     has\n\nestablished an exclusive disciplinary scheme under 38 U.S.C. §§\n\n7461-7463     for     Veterans        Health          Administration      health\n\nprofessionals.       It    is    under    this       scheme    that   Pathak   was\n\n                                      -7-\n\fsuspended.    This scheme explicitly provides for judicial review\n\nof discipline when the discipline is based on the professional\n\nconduct or competence of the physician.                 38 U.S.C. § 7462\n\n(1994).      The    statute,      however,   defines    \"[a]   question    of\n\nprofessional conduct or competence [a]s a question involving .\n\n. . [d]irect patient care . . . [or c]linical competence.\"                Id.\n\n§ 7461(c)(3).      In this instance, it was Dr. Pathak's actions as\n\nan employee and as a supervisor that were at issue, not his\n\nclinical competence or direct patient care.             In contrast with §\n\n7462, which provides judicial review of discipline based on\n\nprofessional conduct or competence, Congress provided no right\n\nof review in § 7463, which governs discipline unrelated to\n\nprofessional       conduct   or    competence.         Congress's   express\n\nprovision of judicial review in § 7462, coupled with a complete\n\nomission of judicial review in § 7463 -- the provision governing\n\nPathak -- is \"persuasive evidence that Congress deliberately\n\nintended to foreclose further review of such claims.\"               United\n\nStates v. Erika, Inc., 456 U.S. 201, 208 (1982), quoted in\n\nFausto, 484 U.S. at 448.\n\n          Although judicial review is not specifically precluded\n\nby § 7463, the court notes that these statutory provisions\n\n                                      -8-\n\fgenerally offer the Secretary greater discretion in employment-\n\nrelated decisions (e.g., hiring) regarding § 7401(1) employees\n\nthan he would have over other civil servants.                          With that in\n\nmind, and reviewing these statutes as a whole, it makes sense\n\nthat       Congress    would      have     precluded      judicial         review     of\n\nsuspensions of less than fourteen days for § 7401(1) employees\n\nwhen employees who are otherwise afforded greater statutory\n\nprotection would not be entitled to such review.                              Because\n\nneither of the relevant statutory schemes provide for judicial\n\nreview, Pathak may not rely on the Administrative Procedure Act\n\nas an independent source of review here.6\n\n                                          III.\n\n              The final issue is whether Pathak's claim of violation\n\nof   due     process    even      rises    to    the    level     of   a    colorable\n\nconstitutional claim (or if it does, whether he can survive\n\nsummary      judgment),      in    which    case       this   court     might       have\n\njurisdiction notwithstanding the statutory bars discussed above,\n\nWebster,      486     U.S.   at    603.          We    conclude    that      Pathak's\n\nconstitutional claim is not even colorable, and so we find it\n\n       6  We do not address the issue of whether the APA itself would\nexclude this disciplinary action from APA review as a matter affecting\nPathak's \"tenure\" under 5 U.S.C. § 554 (1994).\n\n                                          -9-\n\funnecessary to reach Pathak's claim that we have jurisdiction\n\nover his      constitutional    claim    notwithstanding      our   lack   of\n\njurisdiction over his statutory claims.\n\n           The    claim   is   that    Center    Director    Sims   violated\n\nPathak's right to due process by performing both investigatory\n\nand adjudicatory functions.           As the district court recognized,\n\neven assuming that Director Sims performed both investigatory\n\nand adjudicatory functions, under Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S.\n\n35, 47 (1975), the combination of functions does not alone\n\nviolate due process.      See O'Brien v. DiGrazia, 544 F.2d 543, 547\n\n(1st   Cir.    1976)   (\"Any   per     se    rule   seems    foreclosed    by\n\nWithrow.\"); 2 K.C. Davis & R.J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law\n\nTreatise § 9.9, at 101 (3d ed. 1994) (\"The Supreme Court has\n\nnever held a system of combined functions to be a violation of\n\ndue process, and it has upheld several such systems.\"). Parties\n\nadvancing due process arguments based on a combination of\n\ninvestigative and adjudicative functions, and the decision\n\nmaker's    bias   allegedly     resulting       therefrom,   have   a   very\n\ndifficult burden of persuasion to carry.             Withrow, 421 U.S. at\n\n47; O'Brien, 544 F.2d at 547.          Pathak has not met this burden.\n\nSee Pangburn v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 311 F.2d 349, 356-58 (1st\n\n                                      -10-\n\fCir. 1962)   (rejecting   a   separation   of   functions   challenge\n\ndespite investigatory and adjudicatory overlap more significant\n\nthan any overlap here).\n\n         What makes Pathak's argument not even colorable is that\n\neven if Center Director Sims were biased, it matters not.          No\n\ndiscipline   was   imposed    until    there    was   an   independent\n\ndetermination by an impartial grievance examiner, which was then\n\naccepted by the Department's Regional Director, that Pathak did\n\nindeed engage in sexual harassment and that his suspension was\n\nwarranted.   The undisputed evidence is that Dr. Pathak engaged\n\nin at least these actions: on a business trip inviting Nurse\n\nLyons to his room \"to look at the view\" late at night (after she\n\nhad seen the view by daylight), telling her he loved her at\n\nleast twice, telling her that her husband would be flattered to\n\nknow that he had some competition, making a comment with the\n\nword \"sexual\" in it and then giving her a \"birthday\" hug, and\n\ntaking actions against her which could reasonably be viewed as\n\nretaliatory when she was not responsive.        That Dr. Pathak views\n\nthis as mere cultural differences and not sexual harassment is\n\nbeside the point. The independent reviewers had ample basis for\n\ntheir decision, regardless of the alleged bias of Director Sims.\n\n                                -11-\n\fThe same evidence means that Pathak would lose on the merits of\n\nthe summary judgment motion.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          Accordingly, we vacate the district court's judgment\n\nand   remand    for   a   dismissal   for   lack   of   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction.    Costs are awarded to the Department.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f",

Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988). The Fausto Court reasoned that because the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\"CSRA\"), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), \"established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal employees,\" the Act's \"deliberate exclusion of [nonpreference excepted service members] . . . from the provisions establishing administrative and judicial review for personnel action . . . prevents respondent from seeking judicial review . . . under the Back Pay Act,\" 484 U.S. at 455. Fausto stands for the general proposition that judicial review is unavailable to a federal employee who has suffered an adverse personnel action if CSRA does not provide judicial review. Id. at 447-49, 455.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a physician appointed to the Veterans Health Administration under 38 U.S.C. &#167; 7401(1) (1994), Pathak is an \"excepted service\" employee. This is because, as a Veterans Health Administration physician, he is appointed \"without regard to civil-service requirements,\" id. &#167; 7403(a), and so he is not in the \"competitive service,\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 2102 (1994), which means he is part of the \"excepted service,\" id. &#167; 2103(a). As a nonpreference eligible member of the excepted service, Pathak is not entitled to CSRA's protections for competitive service employees. See id. &#167;&#167; 7501-7504; C.D. Moore, Personnel Actions that May Be Challenged, in Federal Civil Service Law and Procedures: A Basic Guide 3, 4-5 (E.M. Bussey, ed., 2d ed. 1990). Even if Pathak were covered by CSRA's provisions governing employees suspended for fourteen days or less, these protections do not provide for judicial review. 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7501-7504; Fausto, 484 U.S. at 443 (\"No provision of the CSRA gives nonpreference members of the excepted service the right to . . . judicial review of suspension for misconduct.\"). Accordingly, under Fausto, Pathak cannot obtain judicial review of his suspension. See 484 U.S. at 447-48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because CSRA does not provide Pathak with a right to judicial review, the logic of Fausto dictates that he cannot go around CSRA and assert federal jurisdiction by relying upon the Administrative Procedure Act. See Mann v. Haigh, 120 F.3d 34, 37-38 (4th Cir. 1997) (extending Fausto's analysis to prohibit APA review of an adverse employment decision). If the result were otherwise, then Pathak, as a nonpreference excepted employee, would be entitled to judicial review unavailable to competitive service employees and preference eligibles. The result would be the same perverse outcome, rejected in Fausto, in which excepted service employees received more protection than competitive service employees who are supposed to be in a \"preferred position.\" 484 U.S. at 449.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Pathak argues that the specific statutory provisions governing Veterans Health Administration health professionals, not CSRA, govern his case. Congress has established an exclusive disciplinary scheme under 38 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7461-7463 for Veterans Health Administration health professionals. It is under this scheme that Pathak was suspended. This scheme explicitly provides for judicial review of discipline when the discipline is based on the professional conduct or competence of the physician. 38 U.S.C. &#167; 7462 (1994). The statute, however, defines \"[a] question of professional conduct or competence [a]s a question involving . . . [d]irect patient care . . . [or c]linical competence.\" Id. &#167; 7461(c)(3). In this instance, it was Dr. Pathak's actions as an employee and as a supervisor that were at issue, not his clinical competence or direct patient care. In contrast with &#167; 7462, which provides judicial review of discipline based on professional conduct or competence, Congress provided no right of review in &#167; 7463, which governs discipline unrelated to professional conduct or competence. Congress's express provision of judicial review in &#167; 7462, coupled with a complete omission of judicial review in &#167; 7463 -- the provision governing Pathak -- is \"persuasive evidence that Congress deliberately intended to foreclose further review of such claims.\" United States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U.S. 201, 208 (1982), quoted in Fausto, 484 U.S. at 448.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although judicial review is not specifically precluded by &#167; 7463, the court notes that these statutory provisions generally offer the Secretary greater discretion in employment-related decisions (e.g., hiring) regarding &#167; 7401(1) employees than he would have over other civil servants. With that in mind, and reviewing these statutes as a whole, it makes sense that Congress would have precluded judicial review of suspensions of less than fourteen days for &#167; 7401(1) employees when employees who are otherwise afforded greater statutory protection would not be entitled to such review. Because neither of the relevant statutory schemes provide for judicial review, Pathak may not rely on the Administrative Procedure Act as an independent source of review here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final issue is whether Pathak's claim of violation of due process even rises to the level of a colorable constitutional claim (or if it does, whether he can survive summary judgment), in which case this court might have jurisdiction notwithstanding the statutory bars discussed above, Webster, 486 U.S. at 603. We conclude that Pathak's constitutional claim is not even colorable, and so we find it unnecessary to reach Pathak's claim that we have jurisdiction over his constitutional claim notwithstanding our lack of jurisdiction over his statutory claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim is that Center Director Sims violated Pathak's right to due process by performing both investigatory and adjudicatory functions. As the district court recognized, even assuming that Director Sims performed both investigatory and adjudicatory functions, under Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975), the combination of functions does not alone violate due process. See O'Brien v. DiGrazia, 544 F.2d 543, 547 (1st Cir. 1976) (\"Any per se rule seems foreclosed by Withrow.\"); 2 K.C. Davis &amp; R.J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 9.9, at 101 (3d ed. 1994) (\"The Supreme Court has never held a system of combined functions to be a violation of due process, and it has upheld several such systems.\"). Parties advancing due process arguments based on a combination of investigative and adjudicative functions, and the decision maker's bias allegedly resulting therefrom, have a very difficult burden of persuasion to carry. Withrow, 421 U.S. at 47; O'Brien, 544 F.2d at 547. Pathak has not met this burden. See Pangburn v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 311 F.2d 349, 356-58 (1st Cir. 1962) (rejecting a separation of functions challenge despite investigatory and adjudicatory overlap more significant than any overlap here).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What makes Pathak's argument not even colorable is that even if Center Director Sims were biased, it matters not. No discipline was imposed until there was an independent determination by an impartial grievance examiner, which was then accepted by the Department's Regional Director, that Pathak did indeed engage in sexual harassment and that his suspension was warranted. The undisputed evidence is that Dr. Pathak engaged in at least these actions: on a business trip inviting Nurse Lyons to his room \"to look at the view\" late at night (after she had seen the view by daylight), telling her he loved her at least twice, telling her that her husband would be flattered to know that he had some competition, making a comment with the word \"sexual\" in it and then giving her a \"birthday\" hug, and taking actions against her which could reasonably be viewed as retaliatory when she was not responsive. That Dr. Pathak views this as mere cultural differences and not sexual harassment is beside the point. The independent reviewers had ample basis for their decision, regardless of the alleged bias of Director Sims. The same evidence means that Pathak would lose on the merits of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court's judgment and remand for a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Douglas Holyoke, to investigate the matter. A few months later, and as a result of this investigation, Dr. Holyoke served Dr. Pathak with a notice of a proposed fourteen day suspension. The notice cited fourteen \"separate incident[s] of sexual harassment\" that \"when taken together . . . show a pattern of sexual harassment.\" After Dr. Pathak obtained counsel, and his counsel filed a legal brief and orally argued his case, John Sims, the Director of the Center, sustained the charges, but reduced the proposed fourteen day suspension to seven days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Pathak refused to accept the discipline, filed a formal grievance, and went to a hearing before an impartial grievance examiner.

With that in mind, and reviewing these statutes as a whole, it makes sense that Congress would have precluded judicial review of suspensions of less than fourteen days for &#167; 7401(1) employees when employees who are otherwise afforded greater statutory protection would not be entitled to such review. Because neither of the relevant statutory schemes provide for judicial review, Pathak may not rely on the Administrative Procedure Act as an independent source of review here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final issue is whether Pathak's claim of violation of due process even rises to the level of a colorable constitutional claim (or if it does, whether he can survive summary judgment), in which case this court might have jurisdiction notwithstanding the statutory bars discussed above, Webster, 486 U.S. at 603. We conclude that Pathak's constitutional claim is not even colorable, and so we find it unnecessary to reach Pathak's claim that we have jurisdiction over his constitutional claim notwithstanding our lack of jurisdiction over his statutory claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim is that Center Director Sims violated Pathak's right to due process by performing both investigatory and adjudicatory functions. As the district court recognized, even assuming that Director Sims performed both investigatory and adjudicatory functions, under Withrow v. Larkin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109237\"><a href=\"/opinion/109237/withrow-v-larkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 47 (1975), the combination of functions does not alone violate due process. See O'Brien v. DiGrazia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340425\"><a href=\"/opinion/340425/william-l-obrien-v-robert-j-digrazia/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 547 (1st Cir. 1976) (\"Any per se rule seems foreclosed by Withrow.\"); 2 K.C. Davis &amp; R.J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 9.9, at 101 (3d ed. 1994) (\"The Supreme Court has never held a system of combined functions to be a violation of due process, and it has upheld several such systems.\"). Parties advancing due process arguments based on a combination of investigative and adjudicative functions, and the decision maker's bias allegedly resulting therefrom, have a very difficult burden of persuasion to carry. Withrow, 421 U.S. at 47; O'Brien, 544 F.2d at 547. Pathak has not met this burden. See Pangburn v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"259098\"><a href=\"/opinion/259098/sheldon-e-pangburn-v-civil-aeronautics-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 356-58 (1st Cir. 1962) (rejecting a separation of functions challenge despite investigatory and adjudicatory overlap more significant than any overlap here).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What makes Pathak's argument not even colorable is that even if Center Director Sims were biased, it matters not. No discipline was imposed until there was an independent determination by an impartial grievance examiner, which was then accepted by the Department's Regional Director, that Pathak did indeed engage in sexual harassment and that his suspension was warranted. The undisputed evidence is that Dr. Pathak engaged in at least these actions: on a business trip inviting Nurse Lyons to his room \"to look at the view\" late at night (after she had seen the view by daylight), telling her he loved her at least twice, telling her that her husband would be flattered to know that he had some competition, making a comment with the word \"sexual\" in it and then giving her a \"birthday\" hug, and taking actions against her which could reasonably be viewed as retaliatory when she was not responsive. That Dr. Pathak views this as mere cultural differences and not sexual harassment is beside the point. The independent reviewers had ample basis for their decision, regardless of the alleged bias of Director Sims. The same evidence means that Pathak would lose on the merits of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court's judgment and remand for a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
