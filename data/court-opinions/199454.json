Those defendants were arrested in\nthe live impact area of the base, and their protests, appellants\nsay, were therefore more disruptive. We do not find the uniform\ntreatment to be plainly unreasonable. The point is that the\ndistrict court's stated objective was to put an end to\nprotesters' taking the law into their own hands. There is\nnothing plainly unreasonable about that objective. And that\nobjective does not require distinguishing among defendants\naccording to the particular manner in which they took the law\ninto their own hands.\"\n\f",
