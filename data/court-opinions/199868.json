This case requires us to apply\n\nFirst Amendment law to the decision of a town to remove for cause\n\nappointed local officials unwilling to comply with the directive of\n\nthe Board of Selectmen that they rescind a vote.               Plaintiffs claim\n\nthat the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Fairhaven violated their\n\nFirst Amendment    rights      when   it    removed     them   from    the   Town's\n\nConservation Commission for the exercise of their votes to replace\n\nthe Chair and co-Chair of the Commission.                  Upon the close of\n\nplaintiffs' evidence at a bench trial, the district court found no\n\nFirst Amendment violation and entered judgment in favor of the Town\nof   Fairhaven   and     two    members      of   the    Board    of    Selectmen\n\n(collectively \"defendants\").          This appeal ensued.        We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\nA.   The Controversy\n\n           The    Town     of     Fairhaven       Conservation         Commission\n\n(\"Commission\") consists of seven members appointed by the Board of\n\nSelectmen (\"Board\") for an unpaid term of three years.                          The\n\nplaintiffs in this action -- William Mullin, Antone Lopes, David\nGammons, and William Markey (collectively \"plaintiffs\") -- were\n\nfour of the seven members serving on the Commission in 1997.\n\n           The Town bylaw establishing the Commission mandates that\n\"[t]he Commission shall elect by majority vote from among the\nmembers a Chair and Co-Chair, each for a term of one (1) year.\"\n\nThe Commission customarily holds its annual elections on the same\nday as the Town meeting. Accordingly, in June 1997, the Commission\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fconducted its annual elections following the Town meeting, naming\n\nMarinus Vander Pol as Chair and Winfred Eckenreiter as co-Chair.\n\nPrior to the June 1997 elections, Mullin had been serving as\nCommission Chair.\n\n           At a Commission meeting held on October 20, 1997, only\n\nfour months into the one-year term of the new Chair and co-Chair,\nMullin   moved   to   reorganize    the    Commission.         Markey   seconded\n\nMullin's   motion.      Vander   Pol,     who    understood      the   bylaws   to\n\nprescribe a one-year term, stated that the Commission would vote on\n\nMullin's motion, whether a reorganization would be \"lawful or not.\"\n\nAlthough   the   Commission's      annual       chairmanship     elections      are\n\ntypically included on the meeting agenda, the October 1997 mid-term\n\nreorganization was not on the agenda.\n           Co-Chair Eckenreiter was absent from the October 20\n\nmeeting.    The six other members were present.                  The motion to\n\nreorganize passed by a 3 to 2 margin, with one abstention by\nGammons,   who   abstained   from    voting       because   of    Eckenreiter's\n\nabsence.   Mullin and Markey nominated each other for the positions\n\nof Chair and Co-Chair respectively.1              The Commission then voted\n\nMullin as Chair and Markey as co-Chair.\n\n           The   mid-term    reorganization         prompted     the    Board    of\n\nSelectmen to consult the Town Counsel, who advised in an opinion\n\n\n\n     1\n        Vander Pol declined a nomination as Chair for the\nreorganization vote. We do not interpret this as an endorsement of\nthe mid-term reorganization, particularly in light of Vander Pol's\nexpressed doubts as to whether the move to reorganize mid-term was\n\"lawful or not.\"\n\n                                     -3-\n\fletter that the Commission did not have legal authority to remove\n\nthe Chair and co-Chair from their positions mid-term:\n\n          The   Town   by-laws  provide   that   \"[t]he\n          [Conservation] Commission shall elect by\n          majority vote from among the members a Chair\n          and Co-Chair, each for a term of one (1)\n          year.\" Town by-laws, c.8, ยง8-1. There is no\n          provision in the by-laws or in any other\n          applicable law authorizing the Commission to\n          remove either the chairman or the co-chairman\n          from that office prior to the expiration of\n          his one-year term. General law c.40 ยง8C which\n          provides for the appointment of Conservation\n          Commissions is silent on this issue.\n\n          Under similar provisions the Massachusetts\n          courts have held that an appointing authority\n          does not have the authority to remove an\n          appointee from office during his term unless\n          that authority is expressly stated in the\n          general laws. I am aware of no reason that\n          the same law of construction should not apply\n          to a town by-law.\n          Accordingly, it is my opinion that under these\n          circumstances the Conservation Commission did\n          not have legal authority to remove the\n          chairman and co-chairman from their respective\n          positions.\n          On November 5, 1997, the Board sent identical letters to\n\neach of the seven Commission members, notifying them that their\n\nOctober 20, 1997, reorganization violated the Town's bylaw, and\n\nenclosing a copy of Town Counsel's opinion letter and the relevant\n\nTown bylaw.   In the letters, the Board indicated that they had\n\nvoted two to one to require the Commission to rescind as illegal\n\nthis reorganization at its next meeting.2   The letter also advised\n\n     2\n       The plaintiffs highlight the fact that the letter directed\nthe Commission to \"rescind\" the reorganization rather than\n\"reconsider\" the reorganization, as was apparently voted by the\nSelectmen. The district court determined (and we agree) that it is\nimmaterial whether the word \"rescind\" or \"reconsider\" was used: \"We\n\n                               -4-\n\fthat failure to rescind would \"lead to additional action by the\n\nBoard of Selectmen.\"\n\n              Prior to the transmittal of these letters, a curious\nevent transpired at the Commission meeting held on November 3,\n\n1997, which commenced with Mullin and Markey sitting as Chair and\n\nco-Chair.      Deposed co-Chair Eckenreiter moved to reorganize the\nCommission again. Gammons and Lopes were absent from this meeting;\n\nall   other    Commission   members    were   present.   The   motion   to\n\nreorganize again was unanimously passed by all members present,\n\nincluding Mullin and Markey.      Eckenreiter nominated Vander Pol as\n\nChair, his nomination was seconded, and the Commission members\n\nunanimously elected Vander Pol as Chair.\n\n              After the meeting adjourned, Mullin decided that this\nlatest reorganization had no binding effect because he believed it\n\nhad been initiated by Eckenreiter only to prove the point that the\n\nCommission could \"do this back and forth\" every week if mid-term\nreorganizations were valid.       Thus, at the subsequent Commission\n\nmeeting on November 17, 1997, Mullin and Markey disregarded the\n\nNovember 3 reorganization and reassumed the positions of Chair and\n\nco-Chair.     At that meeting, in response to the November 5 letter by\n\nthe Selectmen, Mullin moved that the Commission reconsider the\n\nOctober 20 reorganization \"subject to a second legal opinion\" to be\n\nobtained at Town expense. Eckenreiter then moved to rescind the\n\nOctober 20 reorganization.     The motion to rescind failed by a vote\n\n\nget a motion for reconsideration all the time here but what people\nare really asking us to do is rescind what we have done and do\nsomething different, not just think about it again.\"\n\n                                      -5-\n\fof three in favor to four opposed.           Plaintiffs were the four\n\nmembers who refused to rescind the October 20 reorganization,3\n\ndespite   having   been    advised      of   its   illegality    of    the\nreorganization.4\n          In   response   to   plaintiffs'    refusal   to   rescind   the\n\nallegedly unlawful reorganization, the Board informed them in\nseparate letters dated December 1, 1997, that it would hold a\n\nhearing to determine whether to remove plaintiffs from their\n\npositions on the Commission, in accordance with the Town bylaws.\n\nUnder these bylaws, Commission members \"may be removed [for cause]\n\nby [the] Board pursuant to the provisions of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch.]\n\n40, ยง 8C.\" Section 8C provides that an individual appointed to the\n\nConservation Commission \"may, after a public hearing, be removed\nfor cause by the appointing authority.\"        Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40,\n\nยง 8C. The letters indicated the Board's intention to consider \"any\n\nor all of the following as possible grounds for removal\" of\nplaintiffs:\n\n          [Their] recent participation in the removal\n          of the chairman and co-chairman of the\n          Commission despite their election, pursuant\n          to Town By-Law c. 8, section 8-1, to a one\n\n     3\n       Although Gammons had originally abstained from the October\nreorganization, he voted against the motion to rescind the\nreorganization. Gammons contended at trial that he did not feel he\ncould rescind his prior vote because he had previously abstained.\nOn cross-examination, however, he acknowledged that he knew he\ncould abstain again on the motion to rescind the reorganization if\nthe prior abstention was his concern.\n     4\n       Selectman Haaland had telephoned Mullin prior to the\nNovember 17 meeting to request that Mullin simply wait six months\nuntil the annual Chairmanship elections in order to take over as\nChair of the Commission. Mullin refused Haaland's request.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f              year term to those positions on June 30,\n              1997.\n              [Their] improper denial of an order of\n              conditions for a project (30 Fisherman Road)\n              without supporting facts, and on grounds not\n              allowed under the Wetlands Protection Act.\n\nThe letters to Mullin and Markey also referenced their \"recent\n\nparticipation, and apparent organization, of an appeal for a\nsuperseding order from an order approved by the Commission for the\n\nAT&T project.\" In addition, Mullin was notified that his \"apparent\n\nfailure to comply with the Wetlands Protection Act\" at his home at\n\n27 Silvershell Beach could also be considered as a possible basis\n\nfor his removal.\n\n              On December 22, 1997, the Board conducted the removal\n\nhearing (at which plaintiffs were represented by counsel) and voted\nto remove plaintiffs from the Commission.           As cause therefor, the\n\nBoard stated that it had \"less than complete confidence in [their]\n\ncompetency and efficiency in [their] positions based upon the\nrecord in this matter.\"\n\nB.   The Trial\n\n              On January 6, 1998, plaintiffs brought an action in\nfederal district      court   pursuant    to   42   U.S.C.   ยง   1983   against\n\ndefendants Town of Fairhaven and John T. Haaland and Bryan Wood\n(individually and in their capacity as members of the Fairhaven\nBoard    of   Selectmen),5    alleging    violations    of   the   First    and\n\n\n     5\n       Plaintiffs sued only two of the three Selectmen on the\nBoard, apparently because those two voted to remove plaintiffs from\nthe Commission, although there was no direct evidence submitted as\nto how each Selectman voted.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fFourteenth Amendments.         Plaintiffs sought damages and equitable\n\nrelief for their alleged wrongful removal from the Commission.\n\nSpecifically,    plaintiffs     sought     (1)   a   preliminary   injunction\nenjoining defendants from appointing replacement members to the\n\nCommission     and   (2)   a   permanent     injunction    requiring    their\n\nreinstatement to the Commission.           The district court refused to\ngrant the preliminary injunction.            All parties then moved for\n\nsummary judgment, and all motions were denied.\n\n             A bench trial commenced on August 15, 2000. At the close\n\nof plaintiffs' evidence, the district court, upon defendants'\n\nmotion, entered judgment for defendants, stating inter alia, that:\n\n           [U]nder any circumstance I think the Board of\n           Selectmen had the authority to give fair\n           warning that they felt that the bylaws are\n           being violated.    They gave an opinion of\n           counsel to that effect. And the Commission\n           persisted in its position. And I think that\n           that justified a removal for cause which was\n           within the authority of the Board of\n           Selectmen. So I am going to allow the motion.\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             The trial court's decision, issued at the close of\nplaintiffs' case in a bench trial, was a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw on partial findings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c).6               See N.E.\n\n\n     6\n         Rule 52(c) provides in relevant part:\n\n     Judgment on Partial Findings. If during a trial without\n     a jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and the\n     court finds against the party on that issue, the court\n     may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party\n     with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the\n     controlling law be maintained or defeated without a\n\n                                    -8-\n\fDrilling, Inc. v. Inner Space Servs., Inc., 243 F.3d 25, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (characterizing defendant's motion for judgment at close\n\nof plaintiff's case at bench trial as motion for judgment on\npartial findings, rather than as a motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(c), which is applicable only in\n\njury trials); Palmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 785 & n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (same).       In our review of Rule 52(c) judgments, we\n\nevaluate the district court's conclusions of law de novo, see Rego\n\nv. ARC Water Treatment Co., 181 F.3d 396, 400 (3d Cir. 1999), and\n\ntypically examine the district court's underlying findings of fact\n\nfor \"clear error,\"      United States v. Davis, 261 F.3d 1, 57 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n           However, where First Amendment interests are implicated,\nour review must be more searching.            \"[I]n cases raising First\n\nAmendment issues . . . an appellate court has an obligation to\n\n'make an independent examination of the whole record' in order to\nmake sure that 'the judgment does not constitute a forbidden\n\nintrusion on the field of free expression.'\"            Bose v. Consumers\n\nUnion,   466   U.S.   485,   499   (1984)   (quoting   New   York   Times   v.\n\nSullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 284-86 (1964)).            See also O'Connor v.\n\nSteeves, 994 F.2d 905, 912-13 (1st Cir. 1993).               We conduct our\n\nreview accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n     favorable finding on that issue . . . .\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(c).\n\n                                     -9-\n\f                                        III.\n\n            We have extended First Amendment protection to votes on\n\n\"controversial public issue[s]\" cast by \"a member of a public\n\nagency or board.\" Miller v. Town of Hull, 878 F.2d 523, 532 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (\"There can be no more definite expression of opinion\n\nthan by voting on a controversial public issue.\"); see also Stella\n\nv. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 75-76 (1st Cir. 1995).              This protection is\n\nfar from absolute, however.           In their capacity as public officials\n\nvoting on matters of public concern, plaintiffs retain First\n\nAmendment protection \"so long as [their] speech does not unduly\nimpede the government's interest . . . in the efficient performance\n\nof the public service it delivers through\" its appointed officials.\nO'Connor,    994   F.2d    at   912    (citing   cases).     Accordingly,   to\ndetermine the scope of First Amendment free speech protections\n\napplicable to public officials, we have employed a three-part test\nextracted largely from two Supreme Court opinions, Mt. Healthy City\n\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), and\n\nPickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968).              See Tang v. R.I.\n\nDep't of Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1998) (setting\nforth three-part test); O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 912-13 (same).\n\n            First, we must determine whether the speech at issue\ninvolves \"matters of public concern.\"            Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S.\n\n138, 147-48 (1983).       If it does not, then its First Amendment value\n\nis low, and a \"federal court is not the appropriate forum in which\nto review the wisdom\" of internal decisions arising therefrom. Id.\n\nat 147.     Second, if the speech does pertain to matters of public\n\n                                        -10-\n\fconcern, the court must, under the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nPickering, balance the strength of plaintiffs' and the public's\n\nFirst     Amendment   interests   against    \"the     strength    of   the\ncountervailing    governmental    interest   in     promoting    efficient\n\nperformance of the public service the government agency or entity\n\nmust provide through\" its public officials.         O'Connor, 994 F.2d at\n\n912 (citing Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568).            Albeit not an exact\n\nscience, Pickering balancing \"is necessary in order to accommodate\n\nthe dual role of the public employer as a provider of public\n\nservices and as a government entity operating under the constraints\n\nof the First Amendment.\"7    Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 384\n\n(1987).    Because these first two prongs involve assessing whether\n\nplaintiffs' votes \"'are of a character which the principles of the\nFirst Amendment . . . protect,' these determinations are always\n\nsubject to de novo review.\" O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 912 (quoting\n\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 150 n.10) (internal citation omitted).\n            Third, and finally, if First Amendment interests outweigh\n\na legitimate government interest in curtailing the speech under the\nPickering balancing test, plaintiffs must then show that the\n\nprotected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\ndecision to remove them from their posts on the Commission.            See\n\nMt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.     If plaintiffs can make this showing,\n\n\n     7\n        We are aware that the Board, acting as an appointing body,\nis not a \"public employer\" in a literal sense. We see no reason,\nhowever, why First Amendment jurisprudence in the public-employer\ncontext should not apply with equal force to the Board's removal of\nappointed, unpaid public officials. See, e.g., Miller, 878 F.2d at\n531-33; Stella, 63 F.3d at 74-75.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe burden of persuasion shifts to defendants who must then prove\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiffs would have been\n\nremoved \"even in the absence of the protected conduct.\"                      Id.\n\n\"[C]learly erroneous\" review is appropriate on this third-step\n\ninquiry.      Duffy v. Sarault, 892 F.2d 139, 145-46 (1st Cir. 1989);\n\nsee also O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 913.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n              Invoking First Amendment protections, plaintiffs claim\n\nthat the Board removed them from the Commission on the basis of the\n\nmid-term reorganization, as well as other issues alluded to in the\nNovember 3 notice of the removal hearing as \"possible grounds\" for\n\ntheir removal. Notwithstanding the inclusion of these other issues\nin the November 3 notice, however, there was no evidence introduced\nat trial that the Selectmen actually considered these other grounds\n\nas bases for its removal decision.              The district court, as fact-\nfinder, found that the unlawful mid-term reorganization was the\nbasis   for      plaintiffs'    removal,        specifically    finding     that\n\nplaintiffs' insistence on the mid-term reorganization in violation\nof the Town bylaws \"justified a removal for cause which was within\nthe authority of the Board of Selectmen.\"              This conclusion about\n\nthe   basis    for   the   removal   of   the    plaintiffs    is   not   clearly\nerroneous.      See Duffy, 892 F.2d at 146-47 (reviewing district\n\ncourt's Mt. Healthy causation determinations for clear error).                We\n\ntherefore apply our First Amendment analysis to that ground for\nremoval.\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fA.     Matters of Public Concern\n\n             The Supreme Court has held that \"[w]hether an employee's\n\nspeech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by\n\nthe content, form and context of a given statement, as revealed by\n\nthe     whole   record.\"   Connick,       461   U.S.    at   147-48.       That\n\ndetermination may require an inquiry into the employee's motive for\n\nthe speech.     See, e.g., Alinovi v. Worcester Sch. Comm., 777 F.2d\n\n776, 787 (1st Cir. 1985) (concluding that speech found to be\n\nmotivated by a purely personal issue did not implicate matter of\n\npublic concern, notwithstanding attenuated connection of speech to\nincident raising Fourth Amendment concerns).            In that endeavor, we\n\nexamine the extent to which plaintiffs intended their speech to\ncontribute to any \"public discourse,\" or if it simply reflected\npersonal or internal Commission concerns.              O'Connor, 994 F.2d at\n\n914.\n             Here, the district court perceived the reorganization as\nprimarily a power-grab by plaintiffs, stating in the midst of\n\nplaintiffs' case, \"you've got people that want someone else in\npower . . . that's not First Amendment.\"               Some elements of the\nrecord    certainly   support   the    district   court's    view   that    the\n\nreorganization was simply a grab for power: the reorganization took\nplace without notice at the end of a meeting, and absent members\ncould not and were not polled as to their views.               However, the\n\ndistrict court's observation, and this evidence, speak to how\nplaintiffs conducted the reorganization vote and not to their\n\nmotives, at least not directly.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            Our independent examination of the record instead reveals\n\na mix of motives at play.        O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 912 (mandating de\n\nnovo review of public-concern determinations, given importance of\nFirst Amendment values involved).       The friction between plaintiffs\n\nand Vander Pol sprang in part from a clash of personal styles and\n\nfrom disagreements over the internal policies and workings of the\nCommission -- such as the maintenance of files and the manner in\n\nwhich a secretary was hired -- all matters of little concern to the\n\npublic.    See Connick, 461 U.S. at 149 (\"[T]he First Amendment does\n\nnot require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee\n\ncomplaints over internal office affairs.\"); Curtis v. Okla. City\n\nPub. Schs. Bd. of Educ., 147 F.3d 1200, 1212 (10th Cir. 1998)\n\n(\"Speech concerning      individual    personnel     disputes    or    internal\npolicies will typically not involve public concern.\"). At the same\n\ntime,     plaintiffs   claimed     dissatisfaction     with     Vander    Pol's\n\nleadership because of his views on controversial public issues\nbefore the Commission.\n\n            Moreover, beyond the question of motive, the speech at\n\nissue is a vote, not simply the expression of a point of view on a\n\ncontroversial issue.     That vote had tangible consequences for the\n\ncommunity in terms of the Commission's leadership.                    Given the\n\nresponsibility of the Commission \"for the promotion and development\n\nof the Town's natural resources and for the protection of watershed\n\nresources,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, ยง 8C, there is a significant\n\npublic dimension to the votes cast for its Chair and co-Chair.               As\n\nwith any local board, agency or commission, its leaders bear\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fprimary responsibility for the articulation of policy to the public\n\nand other    government       entities.     Accordingly,    in     view   of   the\n\nresponsibilities of the Commission, the important roles of its\nChair and co-Chair, and the public issues that contributed to the\n\ndissension on the Commission, we conclude that the vote at issue\n\nhere involves a matter of public concern.\n\nB.   Pickering Balancing Test\n\n            Under the Pickering test, we must balance the First\n\nAmendment   interests     at    stake     against   the   Town's    \"legitimate\n\ninterests in preventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies\nin   carrying    out   [the    Commission's]    public    service     mission.\"\n\nO'Connor, 994 F.2d at 915 (citing Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568-75).\n            1.   Plaintiffs' Interests\n\n            In evaluating the strength of plaintiffs' First Amendment\n\ninterests, we must again consider the motives behind plaintiffs'\nefforts to reorganize the Commission mid-term. See id. (\"[I]nsofar\n\nas self-interest is found to have motivated [plaintiffs'] speech,\n\n[their] expression is entitled to less weight in the Pickering\n\nbalancing than speech on matters of public concern intended to\nserve the public interest.\").           Although we have acknowledged the\n\npublic concern implicated by the vote to reorganize, we also find\nthe import of that concern diminished by plaintiffs' preoccupation\nwith personal disagreements and internal disputes over the workings\n\nof the Commission.      Also, so far as we can tell from the record,\nthere was little or no effort by plaintiffs to involve the public\n\nin a debate over the reorganization of the Commission.              The plan to\n\n                                     -15-\n\fconduct the reorganization vote was not even noted on the agenda\n\nfor the meeting.   Plaintiffs are hard pressed to elevate the First\n\nAmendment stakes by invoking the interests of the community in a\npublic discourse that they appear to have done so little to foster.\n\n          2.    Town's Interests\n\n          We have noted that the government has a \"greater interest\nin curtailing erroneous statements, than correct ones.\"          Brasslett\n\nv. Cota, 761 F.2d 827, 839 (1st Cir. 1985).            Here, the Town\n\nundoubtedly has a vital interest in enforcing compliance with its\n\nbylaws, which plaintiffs had sworn to uphold. Indeed, the district\n\ncourt recognized these interests in its bench ruling for the\n\ndefendants:\n\n     The evidence that we have had so far, my analysis of it\n     is that . . . the Commission had no authority to\n     \"reorganize.\" They had no authority to remove the\n     chairman and [co-Chair] midstream. They could have\n     made that move in July at the annual visit of that, to\n     that issue or they could have waited in eight months\n     and done it the next July. But there has been nothing\n     presented to me that indicates that there is any\n     authority for them to change the term once it has been\n     set. With respect to the Board of Selectmen, I think\n     that they were within their authority to advise the\n     committee that they were violating the law and to tell\n     them to rescind, whether you call it rescinding or\n     reconsideration. . . . And under any circumstance I\n     think the Board of Selectmen had the authority to give\n     fair warning that they felt that the bylaws were being\n     violated. They gave an opinion of counsel to that\n     effect. And the Commission persisted in its position.\n     And I think that that justified a removal for cause\n     which was within the authority of the Board of\n     Selectmen. So I am going to allow the motion.\n\n           We agree with the district court that the Board had a\n\nsound   legal   basis   for   its   determination   that   the    mid-term\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\freorganization was not authorized by law.8       The Town bylaws provide\n\nthat the Commission \"shall elect by majority vote from among the\n\nmembers a Chair and co-Chair, each for a term of one (1) year.\"\nTown Counsel, as noted in his opinion letter, found no legal\n\nauthority permitting the Commission to remove either the Chair or\n\nco-Chair prior to the expiration of such one-year term.           Nor could\nplaintiffs cite any such authority.        At trial, plaintiffs relied\n\nupon Robert's Rules of Order which, under Town bylaws, govern town\n\nbusiness   meetings   \"so   far   as    they   are   applicable   and   not\n\ninconsistent\" with the bylaws.         Plaintiffs specifically cited to\n\nSection 60 which states in part:\n\n           Remedies Against Misconduct or Dereliction of\n           Duty in Office\n           . . . .\n           [A]ny regularly elected officer of a permanent\n           society can be deposed from office for cause\n           -- that is, misconduct or neglect of duty in\n           office -- as follows:    . . . If . . . the\n           bylaws provide that officers shall serve only\n           a fixed term . . . an officer can be deposed\n           from office only by following the procedures\n           for dealing with offenses by members outside a\n           meeting; that is, an investigating committee\n           must be appointed, it must prefer charges, and\n           a formal trial must be held.\n\nGen. Henry M. Robert, Robert's Rules of Order ยง 60, at 656-57 (9th\n\ned. 1990).\n\n           As the district court noted, this reliance on ยง 60 is\n\nmisplaced for two reasons.    First, the record does not demonstrate\n\n     8\n        To be sure, we are not called upon here in our Pickering\nbalancing inquiry to decide definitively the merits of the Board's\nruling on the illegality of the mid-term reorganization. Rather,\nwe must decide the more limited issue of whether the Board had a\nsound legal basis for that ruling, thereby justifying its\ninsistence on compliance.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fthe \"misconduct or dereliction of duty\" necessary to trigger these\n\nremedies on the part of Vander Pol or Eckenreiter.              Further, even\n\nif such circumstances were present, plaintiffs did not follow the\nrequisite ยง 60 procedure.            In the absence of other supporting\n\nauthority for their actions, plaintiffs thus fail to raise any\n\ncolorable    dispute       about     the   illegality    of   the    mid-term\nreorganization challenged by the Board.9\n\n             In addition, the record reveals the inefficiencies\n\ncreated by the unlawful mid-term reorganization. At the Commission\n\nmeeting held on November 3, 1997, after the mid-term reorganization\n\ntook place, deposed co-Chair Eckenreiter moved again to reorganize.\n\nHis motion was passed unanimously, and Vander Pol was unanimously\n\nelected to reassume his position as Chair (though Mullin later\ndisregarded the reorganization).             This November 3 reorganization\n\nwas initiated by Eckenreiter only to prove the point that the\n\nCommission could \"do this back and forth every week\" if mid-term\nreorganizations     were    indeed    valid.     Reorganizing    outside   the\n\ndesignated   time      creates     significant     inefficiencies    in    the\n\n     9\n        Plaintiffs rely upon Stella for the proposition that the\nillegality of their mid-term reorganization cannot be a \"for cause\"\nbasis for their removal where First Amendment interests are\nimplicated.   We, however, do not read Stella to stand for that\nprinciple.   Stella involved the removal of members of a local\nzoning board because of their votes to grant several controversial\n(arguably illegal) variances. 63 F.3d at 72. That case, however,\ncame to us by way of interlocutory appeal from a denial of\ndefendants' summary judgment motion as to qualified immunity. Id.\nat 73.   As such, we merely made explicit our intention not to\nengage in \"fact-bound delving into illegality\" precluded by the\ninterlocutory nature of the appeal. Id. at 77 (citing Johnson v.\nJones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995)).     Our decision in Stella contains\nnothing that would prevent us from factoring the illegality of\nplaintiffs' mid-term reorganization into our analysis.\n\n                                      -18-\n\fCommission which would \"hamper the [Town's] performance of public\n\nfunctions.\" Rankin, 483 U.S. at 384. The district court recognized\n\nthe   costs    of    such   inefficiency,   characterizing   the   numerous\nreorganizations as \"a lot of activity with consequences to the\n\ntaxpayers of the town.\" See Connick, 461 U.S. at 151 (\"Government,\n\nas an employer, must have wide discretion and control over the\nmanagement of its personnel and internal affairs . . . [including]\n\nthe prerogative to remove employees whose conduct hinders efficient\n\noperation and to do so with dispatch.\"); see also Brasslett, 761\n\nF.2d at 839 (\"[T]he government also has a more legitimate concern\nfor speech which actually impairs its functions than for that which\n\ndoes not.\").\n              3.    Balancing Analysis\n\n              Balancing the First Amendment interests of the plaintiffs\n\nhere against the Town's countervailing interests in operational\nefficiency and enforcement of its bylaws, we conclude that the\nBoard's actions to correct the illegal mid-term reorganization, and\n\nto bring the Commission into compliance with the Town bylaws, did\nnot abridge any First Amendment protections.           The Board did not\nhave to tolerate the plaintiffs' unlawful mid-term reorganization,\n\nwith its disruptive effect on the work of the Commission.               The\nTown's interest in enforcing its bylaws, by directing plaintiffs to\nrescind the illegal reorganization or otherwise face removal from\n\noffice, outweighs any First Amendment protection that extends to\nplaintiffs' right to vote to reorganize mid-term.\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f            Having    reached    this    conclusion,      our   First   Amendment\n\ninquiry ends, and we need not reach the final step of the three-\n\npart test -- namely, the Mt. Healthy causation inquiry                   in which\nthe    court    examines    whether     the    protected    expression       was   a\n\nsubstantial      or   motivating   factor      in   the    decision     to   remove\n\nplaintiffs from office.         See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.\n\nC.    For Cause Removal\n\n            With the First Amendment issue thus resolved against\n\nplaintiffs, we have rejected the only substantive objection raised\n\nby plaintiffs to their removal for cause.                 We also reject their\nrelated procedural argument that the First Amendment implications\n\nof their removal from the Commission required the Board to forego\nthe for cause removal procedure provided by Massachusetts law in\nfavor of a court action to remove plaintiffs.                    Accepting that\n\nargument would needlessly weaken the executive authority of the\nBoard of Selectmen. If the exercise of that authority abuses First\nAmendment rights, the courts are available for redress, as this\n\ncase demonstrates.         Here, however, there was no abuse.\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f",

Vander Pol, who understood the bylaws to prescribe a one-year term, stated that the Commission would vote on Mullin's motion, whether a reorganization would be \"lawful or not.\" Although the Commission's annual chairmanship elections are typically included on the meeting agenda, the October 1997 mid-term reorganization was not on the agenda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-Chair Eckenreiter was absent from the October 20 meeting.

In the letters, the Board indicated that they had voted two to one to require the Commission to rescind as illegal this reorganization at its next meeting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The letter also advised that failure to rescind would \"lead to additional action by the Board of Selectmen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the transmittal of these letters, a curious event transpired at the Commission meeting held on November 3, 1997, which commenced with Mullin and Markey sitting as Chair and co-Chair. Deposed co-Chair Eckenreiter moved to reorganize the Commission again. Gammons and Lopes were absent from this meeting; all other Commission members were present. The motion to reorganize again was unanimously passed by all members present, including Mullin and Markey. Eckenreiter nominated Vander Pol as Chair, his nomination was seconded, and the Commission members unanimously elected Vander Pol as Chair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the meeting adjourned, Mullin decided that this latest reorganization had no binding effect because he believed it had been initiated by Eckenreiter only to prove the point that the Commission could \"do this back and forth\" every week if mid-term reorganizations were valid. Thus, at the subsequent Commission meeting on November 17, 1997, Mullin and Markey disregarded the November 3 reorganization and reassumed the positions of Chair and co-Chair. At that meeting, in response to the November 5 letter by the Selectmen, Mullin moved that the Commission reconsider the October 20 reorganization \"subject to a second legal opinion\" to be obtained at Town expense. Eckenreiter then moved to rescind the October 20 reorganization. The motion to rescind failed by a vote of three in favor to four opposed. Plaintiffs were the four members who refused to rescind the October 20 reorganization,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> despite having been advised of its illegality of the reorganization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to plaintiffs' refusal to rescind the allegedly unlawful reorganization, the Board informed them in separate letters dated December 1, 1997, that it would hold a hearing to determine whether to remove plaintiffs from their positions on the Commission, in accordance with the Town bylaws. Under these bylaws, Commission members \"may be removed [for cause] by [the] Board pursuant to the provisions of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch.] 40, &#167; 8C.\" Section 8C provides that an individual appointed to the Conservation Commission \"may, after a public hearing, be removed for cause by the appointing authority.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &#167; 8C. The letters indicated the Board's intention to consider \"any or all of the following as possible grounds for removal\" of plaintiffs:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Their] recent participation in the removal of the chairman and co-chairman of the Commission despite their election, pursuant to Town By-Law c. 8, section 8-1, to a one year term to those positions on June 30, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Their] improper denial of an order of conditions for a project (30 Fisherman Road) without supporting facts, and on grounds not allowed under the Wetlands Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letters to Mullin and Markey also referenced their \"recent participation, and apparent organization, of an appeal for a superseding order from an order approved by the Commission for the AT &amp; T project.\" In addition, Mullin was notified that his \"apparent failure to comply with the Wetlands Protection Act\" at his home at 27 Silvershell Beach could also be considered as a possible basis for his removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 1997, the Board conducted the removal hearing (at which plaintiffs were represented by counsel) and voted to remove plaintiffs from the Commission. As cause therefor, the Board stated that it had \"less than complete confidence in [their] competency and efficiency in [their] positions based upon the record in this matter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 6, 1998, plaintiffs brought an action in federal district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against defendants Town of Fairhaven and John T. Haaland and Bryan Wood (individually and in their capacity as members of the Fairhaven Board of Selectmen),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs sought damages and equitable relief for their alleged wrongful removal from the Commission. Specifically, plaintiffs sought (1) a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from appointing replacement members to the Commission and (2) a permanent injunction requiring their reinstatement to the Commission. The district court refused to grant the preliminary injunction. All parties then moved for summary judgment, and all motions were denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bench trial commenced on August 15, 2000. At the close of plaintiffs' evidence, the district court, upon defendants' motion, entered judgment for defendants, stating <i>inter alia,</i> that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[U]nder any circumstance I think the Board of Selectmen had the authority to give fair warning that they felt that the bylaws are being violated. They gave an opinion of counsel to that effect. And the Commission persisted in its position. And I think that that justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the Board of Selectmen. So I am going to allow the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's decision, issued at the close of plaintiffs' case in a bench trial, was a judgment as a matter of law on partial findings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Northeast Drilling, Inc. v. Inner Space Services, Inc.,</i> 243 F.3d 25, 37 (1st Cir.2001) (characterizing defendant's motion for judgment at close of plaintiff's case at bench trial as motion for judgment on partial findings, rather than as a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(c), which is applicable only injury trials); <i>Palmacci v. Umpierrez,</i> 121 F.3d 781, 785 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1997) (same). In our review of Rule 52(c) judgments, we evaluate the district court's conclusions of law <i>de novo, see Rego v. ARC Water Treatment Co.,</i> 181 F.3d 396, 400 (3d Cir.1999), and typically examine the district court's underlying findings of fact for \"clear error,\" <i>United States v.

Consumers Union,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (quoting <i>New York Times v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 284-86, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)). <i>See also O'Connor v. Steeves,</i> 994 F.2d 905, 912-13 (1st Cir.1993). We conduct our review accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have extended First Amendment protection to votes on \"controversial public issue[s]\" cast by \"a member of a public agency or board.\" <i>Miller v. Town of Hull,</i> 878 F.2d 523, 532 (1st Cir.1989) (\"There can be no more definite expression of opinion than by voting on a controversial public issue.\"); <i>see also Stella v. Kelley,</i> 63 F.3d 71, 75-76 (1st Cir.1995). This protection is far from absolute, however. In their capacity as public officials voting on matters of public concern, plaintiffs retain First Amendment protection \"so long as [their] speech does not unduly impede the government's interest ... in the efficient performance of the public service it delivers through\" its appointed officials. <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 912 (citing cases). Accordingly, to determine the scope of First Amendment free speech protections applicable to public officials, we have employed a three-part test extracted largely from two Supreme Court opinions, <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), and <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). <i>See Tang v. R.I. Dep't of Elderly Affairs,</i> 163 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1998) (setting forth three-part test); <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 912-13 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we must determine whether the speech at issue involves \"matters of public concern.\" <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). If it does not, then its First Amendment value is low, and a \"federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom\" of internal decisions arising therefrom. <i>Id.</i> at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684. Second, if the speech does pertain to matters of public concern, the court must, under the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Pickering,</i> balance the strength of plaintiffs' and the public's First Amendment interests against \"the strength of the countervailing governmental interest in promoting efficient performance of the public service the government agency or entity must provide through\" its public officials. <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 912 (citing <i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731). Albeit not an exact science, <i>Pickering</i> balancing \"is necessary in order to accommodate the dual role of the public employer as a provider of public services and as a government entity operating under the constraints of the First Amendment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Rankin v. McPherson,</i> 483 U.S. 378, 384, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987). Because these first two prongs involve assessing whether plaintiffs' votes \"`are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment ... protect,' these determinations are always subject to <i>de novo</i> review.\" <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 912 (quoting <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 150 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 1684) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and finally, if First Amendment interests outweigh a legitimate government interest in curtailing the speech under the <i>Pickering</i> balancing test, plaintiffs must then show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to remove them from their posts on the Commission. <i>See Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. If plaintiffs can make this showing, the burden of persuasion shifts to defendants who must then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiffs would have been removed \"even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> \"[C]learly erroneous\" review is appropriate on this third-step inquiry. <i>Duffy v. Sarault,</i> 892 F.2d 139, 145-46 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 913.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking First Amendment protections, plaintiffs claim that the Board removed them from the Commission on the basis of the mid-term reorganization, as well as other issues alluded to in the November 3 notice of the removal hearing as \"possible grounds\" for their removal. Notwithstanding the inclusion of these other issues in the November 3 notice, however, there was no evidence introduced at trial that the Selectmen actually considered these other grounds as bases for its removal decision. The district court, as fact-finder, found that the unlawful midterm reorganization was the basis for plaintiffs' removal, specifically finding that plaintiffs' insistence on the mid-term reorganization in violation of the Town bylaws \"justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the Board of Selectmen.\" This conclusion about the basis for the removal of the plaintiffs is not clearly erroneous. <i>See Duffy,</i> 892 F.2d at 146-47 (reviewing district court's <i>Mt. Healthy</i> causation determinations for clear error). We therefore apply our First Amendment analysis to that ground for removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Matters of Public Concern</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that \"[w]hether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\" <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684. That determination may require an inquiry into the employee's motive for the speech. <i>See, e.g., Alinovi v. Worcester Sch. Comm.,</i> 777 F.2d 776, 787 (1st Cir.1985) (concluding that speech found to be motivated by a purely personal issue did not implicate matter of public concern, notwithstanding attenuated connection of speech to incident raising Fourth Amendment concerns). In that endeavor, we examine the extent to which plaintiffs intended their speech to contribute to any \"public discourse,\" or if it simply reflected personal or internal Commission concerns. <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 914.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court perceived the reorganization as primarily a power-grab by plaintiffs, stating in the midst of plaintiffs' case, \"you've got people that want someone else in power ... that's not First Amendment.\" Some elements of the record certainly support the district court's view that the reorganization was simply a grab for power: the reorganization took place without notice at the end of a meeting, and absent members could not and were not polled as to their views. However, the district court's observation, and this evidence, speak to how plaintiffs conducted the reorganization vote and not to their motives, at least not directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our independent examination of the record instead reveals a mix of motives at play. <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 912 (mandating <i>de novo</i> review of public-concern determinations, given importance of First Amendment values involved). The friction between plaintiffs and Vander Pol sprang in part from a clash of personal styles and from disagreements over the internal policies and workings of the Commission &#8212; such as the maintenance of files and the manner in which a secretary was hired &#8212; all matters of little concern to the public. <i>See Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (\"[T]he First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.\"); <i>Curtis v. Okla. City Pub. Schs. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 147 F.3d 1200, 1212 (10th Cir.1998) (\"Speech concerning individual personnel disputes or internal policies will typically not involve public concern.\"). At the same time, plaintiffs claimed dissatisfaction with Vander Pol's leadership because of his views on controversial public issues before the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, beyond the question of motive, the speech at issue is a vote, not simply the expression of a point of view on a controversial issue. That vote had tangible consequences for the community in terms of the Commission's leadership. Given the responsibility of the Commission \"for the promotion and development of the Town's natural resources and for the protection of watershed resources,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &#167; 8C, there is a significant public dimension to the votes cast for its Chair and co-Chair. As with any local board, agency or commission, its leaders bear primary responsibility for the articulation of policy to the public and other government entities. Accordingly, in view of the responsibilities of the Commission, the important roles of its Chair and co-Chair, and the public issues that contributed to the dissension on the Commission, we conclude that the vote at issue here involves a matter of public concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Pickering</i> Balancing Test</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the <i>Pickering</i> test, we must balance the First Amendment interests at stake against the Town's \"legitimate interests in preventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying out [the Commission's] public service mission.\" <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 915 (citing <i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568-75, 88 S.Ct. 1731).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Plaintiffs' Interests</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the strength of plaintiffs' First Amendment interests, we must again consider the motives behind plaintiffs' efforts to reorganize the Commission mid-term. <i>See id.</i> (\"[I]nsofar as self-interest is found to have motivated [plaintiffs'] speech, [their] expression is entitled to less weight in the <i>Pickering</i> balancing than speech on matters of public concern intended to serve the public interest.\"). Although we have acknowledged the public concern implicated by the vote to reorganize, we also find the import of that concern diminished by plaintiffs' preoccupation with personal disagreements and internal disputes over the workings of the Commission. Also, so far as we can tell from the record, there was little or no effort by plaintiffs to involve the public in a debate over the reorganization of the Commission. The plan to conduct the reorganization vote was not even noted on the agenda for the meeting. Plaintiffs are hard pressed to elevate the First Amendment stakes by invoking the interests of the community in a public discourse that they appear to have done so little to foster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Town's Interests</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted that the government has a \"greater interest in curtailing erroneous statements, than correct ones.\" <i>Brasslett v. Cota,</i> 761 F.2d 827, 839 (1st Cir.1985). Here, the Town undoubtedly has a vital interest in enforcing compliance with its bylaws, which plaintiffs had sworn to uphold. Indeed, the district court recognized these interests in its bench ruling for the defendants:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence that we have had so far, my analysis of it is that ... the Commission had no authority to \"reorganize.\" They had no authority to remove the chairman and [co-Chair] midstream. They could have made that move in July at the annual visit of that, to that issue or they could have waited in eight months and done it the next July. But there has been nothing presented to me that indicates that there is any authority for them to change the term once it has been set. With respect to the Board of Selectmen, I think that they were within their authority to advise the committee that they were violating the law and to tell them to rescind, whether you call it rescinding or reconsideration.... And under any circumstance I think the Board of Selectmen had the authority to give fair warning that they felt that the bylaws were being violated. They gave an opinion of counsel to that effect. And the Commission persisted in its position. And I think that that justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the Board of Selectmen. So I am going to allow the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the Board had a sound legal basis for its determination that the mid-term reorganization was not authorized by law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The Town bylaws provide that the Commission \"shall elect by majority vote from among the members a Chair and co-Chair, each for a term of one (1) year.\" Town Counsel, as noted in his opinion letter, found no legal authority permitting the Commission to remove either the Chair or co-Chair prior to the expiration of such one-year term. Nor could plaintiffs cite any such authority. At trial, plaintiffs relied upon <i>Robert's Rules of Order</i> which, under Town bylaws, govern town business meetings \"so far as they are applicable and not inconsistent\" with the bylaws. Plaintiffs specifically cited to Section 60 which states in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remedies Against Misconduct or Dereliction of Duty in Office</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>. . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny regularly elected officer of a permanent society can be deposed from office for cause &#8212; that is, misconduct or neglect of duty in office &#8212; as follows: ... If ... the bylaws provide that officers shall serve only a fixed term ... an officer can be deposed from office only by following the procedures for dealing with offenses by members outside a meeting; that is, an investigating committee must be appointed, it must prefer charges, and a formal trial must be held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gen. Henry M. Robert, <i>Robert's Rules of Order</i> &#167; 60, at 656-57 (9th ed.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, this reliance on &#167; 60 is misplaced for two reasons. First, the record does not demonstrate the \"misconduct or dereliction of duty\" necessary to trigger these remedies on the part of Vander Pol or Eckenreiter. Further, even if such circumstances were present, plaintiffs did not follow the requisite &#167; 60 procedure. In the absence of other supporting authority for their actions, plaintiffs thus fail to raise any colorable dispute about the illegality of the mid-term reorganization challenged by the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the record reveals the inefficiencies created by the unlawful mid-term reorganization. At the Commission meeting held on November 3, 1997, after the mid-term reorganization took place, deposed co-Chair Eckenreiter moved again to reorganize. His motion was passed unanimously, and Vander Pol was unanimously elected to reassume his position as Chair (though Mullin later disregarded the reorganization). This November 3 reorganization was initiated by Eckenreiter only to prove the point that the Commission could \"do this back and forth every week\" if mid-term reorganizations were indeed valid. Reorganizing outside the designated time creates significant inefficiencies in the Commission which would \"hamper the [Town's] performance of public functions.\" <i>Rankin,</i> 483 U.S. at 384, 107 S.Ct. 2891. The district court recognized the costs of such inefficiency, characterizing the numerous reorganizations as \"a lot of activity with consequences to the taxpayers of the town.\" <i>See Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 151, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (\"Government, as an employer, must have wide discretion and control over the management of its personnel and internal affairs ... [including] the prerogative to remove employees whose conduct hinders efficient operation and to do so with dispatch.\"); <i>see also Brasslett,</i> 761 F.2d at 839 (\"[T]he government also has a more legitimate concern for speech which actually impairs its functions than for that which does not.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Balancing Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Balancing the First Amendment interests of the plaintiffs here against the Town's countervailing interests in operational efficiency and enforcement of its bylaws, we conclude that the Board's actions to correct the illegal mid-term reorganization, and to bring the Commission into compliance with the Town bylaws, did not abridge any First Amendment protections. The Board did not have to tolerate the plaintiffs' unlawful mid-term reorganization, with its disruptive effect on the work of the Commission. The Town's interest in enforcing its bylaws, by directing plaintiffs to rescind the illegal reorganization or otherwise face removal from office, outweighs any First Amendment protection that extends to plaintiffs' right to vote to reorganize mid-term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reached this conclusion, our First Amendment inquiry ends, and we need not reach the final step of the three-part test &#8212; namely, the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> causation inquiry in which the court examines whether the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to remove plaintiffs from office. <i>See Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. For Cause Removal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the First Amendment issue thus resolved against plaintiffs, we have rejected the only substantive objection raised by plaintiffs to their removal for cause. We also reject their related procedural argument that the First Amendment implications of their removal from the Commission required the Board to forego the for cause removal procedure provided by Massachusetts law in favor of a court action to remove plaintiffs. Accepting that argument would needlessly weaken the executive authority of the Board of Selectmen. If the exercise of that authority abuses First Amendment rights, the courts are available for redress, as this case demonstrates. Here, however, there was no abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Vander Pol declined a nomination as Chair for the reorganization vote.

Plaintiffs claim that the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Fairhaven violated their First Amendment rights when it removed them from the Town's Conservation Commission for the exercise of their votes to replace the Chair and co-Chair of the Commission. Upon the close of plaintiffs' evidence at a bench trial, the district court found no First Amendment violation and entered judgment in favor of the Town of Fairhaven and two members of the Board of Selectmen (collectively \"defendants\"). This appeal ensued. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Controversy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town of Fairhaven Conservation Commission (\"Commission\") consists of seven members appointed by the Board of Selectmen (\"Board\") for an unpaid term of three years. The plaintiffs in this action &#8212; William Mullin, Antonio Lopes, David Gammons, and William Markey (collectively \"plaintiffs\") &#8212; were four of the seven members serving on the Commission in 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town bylaw establishing the Commission mandates that \"[t]he Commission shall elect by majority vote from among the members a Chair and Co-Chair, each for a term of one (1) year.\" The Commission customarily holds its annual elections on the same day as the Town meeting. Accordingly, in June 1997, the Commission conducted its annual elections following the Town meeting, naming Marinus Vander Pol as Chair and Winfred Eckenreiter as co-Chair. Prior to the June 1997 elections, Mullin had been serving as Commission Chair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a Commission meeting held on October 20, 1997, only four months into the one-year term of the new Chair and co-Chair, Mullin moved to reorganize the Commission. Markey seconded Mullin's motion. Vander Pol, who understood the bylaws to prescribe a one-year term, stated that the Commission would vote on Mullin's motion, whether a reorganization would be \"lawful or not.\" Although the Commission's annual chairmanship elections are typically included on the meeting agenda, the October 1997 mid-term reorganization was not on the agenda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-Chair Eckenreiter was absent from the October 20 meeting. The six other members were present. The motion to reorganize passed by a 3 to 2 margin, with one abstention by Gammons, who abstained from voting because of Eckenreiter's absence. Mullin and Markey nominated each other for the positions of Chair and Co-Chair respectively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The Commission then voted Mullin as Chair and Markey as co-Chair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mid-term reorganization prompted the Board of Selectmen to consult the Town Counsel, who advised in an opinion letter that the Commission did not have legal authority to remove the Chair and co-Chair from their positions mid-term:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Town by-laws provide that \"[t]he [Conservation] Commission shall elect by majority vote from among the members a Chair and Co-Chair, each for a term of one (1) year.\" Town by-laws, c. 8, &#167; 8-1. There is no provision in the by-laws or in any other applicable law authorizing the Commission to remove either the chairman or the co-chairman from that office prior to the expiration of his one-year term. General law c. 40 &#167; 8C which provides for the appointment of Conservation Commissions is silent on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under similar provisions the Massachusetts courts have held that an appointing authority does not have the authority to remove an appointee from office during his term unless that authority is expressly stated in the general laws. I am aware of no reason that the same law of construction should not apply to a town by-law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, it is my opinion that under these circumstances the Conservation Commission did not have legal authority to remove the chairman and co-chairman from their respective positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 5, 1997, the Board sent identical letters to each of the seven Commission members, notifying them that their October 20, 1997, reorganization violated the Town's bylaw, and enclosing a copy of Town Counsel's opinion letter and the relevant Town bylaw. In the letters, the Board indicated that they had voted two to one to require the Commission to rescind as illegal this reorganization at its next meeting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The letter also advised that failure to rescind would \"lead to additional action by the Board of Selectmen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the transmittal of these letters, a curious event transpired at the Commission meeting held on November 3, 1997, which commenced with Mullin and Markey sitting as Chair and co-Chair. Deposed co-Chair Eckenreiter moved to reorganize the Commission again. Gammons and Lopes were absent from this meeting; all other Commission members were present. The motion to reorganize again was unanimously passed by all members present, including Mullin and Markey. Eckenreiter nominated Vander Pol as Chair, his nomination was seconded, and the Commission members unanimously elected Vander Pol as Chair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the meeting adjourned, Mullin decided that this latest reorganization had no binding effect because he believed it had been initiated by Eckenreiter only to prove the point that the Commission could \"do this back and forth\" every week if mid-term reorganizations were valid. Thus, at the subsequent Commission meeting on November 17, 1997, Mullin and Markey disregarded the November 3 reorganization and reassumed the positions of Chair and co-Chair. At that meeting, in response to the November 5 letter by the Selectmen, Mullin moved that the Commission reconsider the October 20 reorganization \"subject to a second legal opinion\" to be obtained at Town expense. Eckenreiter then moved to rescind the October 20 reorganization. The motion to rescind failed by a vote of three in favor to four opposed. Plaintiffs were the four members who refused to rescind the October 20 reorganization,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> despite having been advised of its illegality of the reorganization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to plaintiffs' refusal to rescind the allegedly unlawful reorganization, the Board informed them in separate letters dated December 1, 1997, that it would hold a hearing to determine whether to remove plaintiffs from their positions on the Commission, in accordance with the Town bylaws. Under these bylaws, Commission members \"may be removed [for cause] by [the] Board pursuant to the provisions of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch.] 40, &#167; 8C.\" Section 8C provides that an individual appointed to the Conservation Commission \"may, after a public hearing, be removed for cause by the appointing authority.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &#167; 8C. The letters indicated the Board's intention to consider \"any or all of the following as possible grounds for removal\" of plaintiffs:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Their] recent participation in the removal of the chairman and co-chairman of the Commission despite their election, pursuant to Town By-Law c. 8, section 8-1, to a one year term to those positions on June 30, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Their] improper denial of an order of conditions for a project (30 Fisherman Road) without supporting facts, and on grounds not allowed under the Wetlands Protection Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letters to Mullin and Markey also referenced their \"recent participation, and apparent organization, of an appeal for a superseding order from an order approved by the Commission for the AT &amp; T project.\" In addition, Mullin was notified that his \"apparent failure to comply with the Wetlands Protection Act\" at his home at 27 Silvershell Beach could also be considered as a possible basis for his removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 1997, the Board conducted the removal hearing (at which plaintiffs were represented by counsel) and voted to remove plaintiffs from the Commission. As cause therefor, the Board stated that it had \"less than complete confidence in [their] competency and efficiency in [their] positions based upon the record in this matter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 6, 1998, plaintiffs brought an action in federal district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against defendants Town of Fairhaven and John T. Haaland and Bryan Wood (individually and in their capacity as members of the Fairhaven Board of Selectmen),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs sought damages and equitable relief for their alleged wrongful removal from the Commission. Specifically, plaintiffs sought (1) a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from appointing replacement members to the Commission and (2) a permanent injunction requiring their reinstatement to the Commission. The district court refused to grant the preliminary injunction. All parties then moved for summary judgment, and all motions were denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bench trial commenced on August 15, 2000. At the close of plaintiffs' evidence, the district court, upon defendants' motion, entered judgment for defendants, stating <i>inter alia,</i> that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[U]nder any circumstance I think the Board of Selectmen had the authority to give fair warning that they felt that the bylaws are being violated. They gave an opinion of counsel to that effect. And the Commission persisted in its position. And I think that that justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the Board of Selectmen.

Notwithstanding the inclusion of these other issues in the November 3 notice, however, there was no evidence introduced at trial that the Selectmen actually considered these other grounds as bases for its removal decision. The district court, as fact-finder, found that the unlawful midterm reorganization was the basis for plaintiffs' removal, specifically finding that plaintiffs' insistence on the mid-term reorganization in violation of the Town bylaws \"justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the Board of Selectmen.\" This conclusion about the basis for the removal of the plaintiffs is not clearly erroneous. <i>See Duffy,</i> 892 F.2d at 146-47 (reviewing district court's <i>Mt.

In that endeavor, we examine the extent to which plaintiffs intended their speech to contribute to any \"public discourse,\" or if it simply reflected personal or internal Commission concerns. <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 914.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court perceived the reorganization as primarily a power-grab by plaintiffs, stating in the midst of plaintiffs' case, \"you've got people that want someone else in power ... that's not First Amendment.\" Some elements of the record certainly support the district court's view that the reorganization was simply a grab for power: the reorganization took place without notice at the end of a meeting, and absent members could not and were not polled as to their views. However, the district court's observation, and this evidence, speak to how plaintiffs conducted the reorganization vote and not to their motives, at least not directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our independent examination of the record instead reveals a mix of motives at play. <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 912 (mandating <i>de novo</i> review of public-concern determinations, given importance of First Amendment values involved). The friction between plaintiffs and Vander Pol sprang in part from a clash of personal styles and from disagreements over the internal policies and workings of the Commission &#8212; such as the maintenance of files and the manner in which a secretary was hired &#8212; all matters of little concern to the public. <i>See Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That vote had tangible consequences for the community in terms of the Commission's leadership. Given the responsibility of the Commission \"for the promotion and development of the Town's natural resources and for the protection of watershed resources,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &#167; 8C, there is a significant public dimension to the votes cast for its Chair and co-Chair. As with any local board, agency or commission, its leaders bear primary responsibility for the articulation of policy to the public and other government entities. Accordingly, in view of the responsibilities of the Commission, the important roles of its Chair and co-Chair, and the public issues that contributed to the dissension on the Commission, we conclude that the vote at issue here involves a matter of public concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Pickering</i> Balancing Test</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the <i>Pickering</i> test, we must balance the First Amendment interests at stake against the Town's \"legitimate interests in preventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying out [the Commission's] public service mission.\" <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 915 (citing <i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although we have acknowledged the public concern implicated by the vote to reorganize, we also find the import of that concern diminished by plaintiffs' preoccupation with personal disagreements and internal disputes over the workings of the Commission. Also, so far as we can tell from the record, there was little or no effort by plaintiffs to involve the public in a debate over the reorganization of the Commission. The plan to conduct the reorganization vote was not even noted on the agenda for the meeting. Plaintiffs are hard pressed to elevate the First Amendment stakes by invoking the interests of the community in a public discourse that they appear to have done so little to foster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Town's Interests</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted that the government has a \"greater interest in curtailing erroneous statements, than correct ones.\" <i>Brasslett v.

Here, the Town undoubtedly has a vital interest in enforcing compliance with its bylaws, which plaintiffs had sworn to uphold. Indeed, the district court recognized these interests in its bench ruling for the defendants:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence that we have had so far, my analysis of it is that ... the Commission had no authority to \"reorganize.\" They had no authority to remove the chairman and [co-Chair] midstream. They could have made that move in July at the annual visit of that, to that issue or they could have waited in eight months and done it the next July. But there has been nothing presented to me that indicates that there is any authority for them to change the term once it has been set. With respect to the Board of Selectmen, I think that they were within their authority to advise the committee that they were violating the law and to tell them to rescind, whether you call it rescinding or reconsideration.... And under any circumstance I think the Board of Selectmen had the authority to give fair warning that they felt that the bylaws were being violated. They gave an opinion of counsel to that effect. And the Commission persisted in its position. And I think that that justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the Board of Selectmen. So I am going to allow the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the Board had a sound legal basis for its determination that the mid-term reorganization was not authorized by law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The Town bylaws provide that the Commission \"shall elect by majority vote from among the members a Chair and co-Chair, each for a term of one (1) year.\" Town Counsel, as noted in his opinion letter, found no legal authority permitting the Commission to remove either the Chair or co-Chair prior to the expiration of such one-year term. Nor could plaintiffs cite any such authority. At trial, plaintiffs relied upon <i>Robert's Rules of Order</i> which, under Town bylaws, govern town business meetings \"so far as they are applicable and not inconsistent\" with the bylaws. Plaintiffs specifically cited to Section 60 which states in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remedies Against Misconduct or Dereliction of Duty in Office</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>. . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny regularly elected officer of a permanent society can be deposed from office for cause &#8212; that is, misconduct or neglect of duty in office &#8212; as follows: ... If ... the bylaws provide that officers shall serve only a fixed term ... an officer can be deposed from office only by following the procedures for dealing with offenses by members outside a meeting; that is, an investigating committee must be appointed, it must prefer charges, and a formal trial must be held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gen. Henry M. Robert, <i>Robert's Rules of Order</i> &#167; 60, at 656-57 (9th ed.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, this reliance on &#167; 60 is misplaced for two reasons. First, the record does not demonstrate the \"misconduct or dereliction of duty\" necessary to trigger these remedies on the part of Vander Pol or Eckenreiter. Further, even if such circumstances were present, plaintiffs did not follow the requisite &#167; 60 procedure. In the absence of other supporting authority for their actions, plaintiffs thus fail to raise any colorable dispute about the illegality of the mid-term reorganization challenged by the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the record reveals the inefficiencies created by the unlawful mid-term reorganization. At the Commission meeting held on November 3, 1997, after the mid-term reorganization took place, deposed co-Chair Eckenreiter moved again to reorganize. His motion was passed unanimously, and Vander Pol was unanimously elected to reassume his position as Chair (though Mullin later disregarded the reorganization). This November 3 reorganization was initiated by Eckenreiter only to prove the point that the Commission could \"do this back and forth every week\" if mid-term reorganizations were indeed valid. Reorganizing outside the designated time creates significant inefficiencies in the Commission which would \"hamper the [Town's] performance of public functions.\" <i>Rankin,</i> 483 U.S. at 384, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111946\"><a href=\"/opinion/111946/rankin-v-mcpherson/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Board did not have to tolerate the plaintiffs' unlawful mid-term reorganization, with its disruptive effect on the work of the Commission. The Town's interest in enforcing its bylaws, by directing plaintiffs to rescind the illegal reorganization or otherwise face removal from office, outweighs any First Amendment protection that extends to plaintiffs' right to vote to reorganize mid-term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reached this conclusion, our First Amendment inquiry ends, and we need not reach the final step of the three-part test &#8212; namely, the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> causation inquiry in which the court examines whether the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to remove plaintiffs from office. <i>See Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We also reject their related procedural argument that the First Amendment implications of their removal from the Commission required the Board to forego the for cause removal procedure provided by Massachusetts law in favor of a court action to remove plaintiffs. Accepting that argument would needlessly weaken the executive authority of the Board of Selectmen. If the exercise of that authority abuses First Amendment rights, the courts are available for redress, as this case demonstrates.
