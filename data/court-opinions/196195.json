Defendant John M.\r                                                    \r\n\nJewell  was tried and convicted by a jury in federal district\r\n\ncourt  on one  count  of being  a felon  in  possession of  a\r\n\nfirearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1), and one count\r\n\nof  receiving a stolen firearm,  in violation of  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n922(j).  On appeal he argues that the district court erred in\r\n\ndenying  his motion to suppress  all fruits of  the search at\r\n\nhis  apartment at 162 Linden  Street on the  grounds that the\r\n\naffidavit  supporting the application  for the search warrant\r\n\nfailed to establish probable  cause and failed to  provide an\r\n\nadequate  basis for  the issuance  of a  \"no-knock\" warrant.1\r\n\nHe  also argues  that he  was denied  procedural due  process\r\n\nunder  the Federal Magistrate Act  of 1979, 28  U.S.C.   636.\r\n\nWe affirm.\r\n\n          The evidence at trial,  the sufficiency of which is\r\n\nnot  disputed, showed that on  November 22, 1992, officers of\r\n\nthe Pittsfield Police Department executed a state  \"no-knock\"\r\n\nsearch warrant on the residence of Jewell and his girlfriend,\r\n\nBrandee Richards, at  the first floor  of 162 Linden  Street,\r\n\nPittsfield.   Found and  seized during the  search were crack\r\n\ncocaine, cocaine processing paraphernalia, marijuana, $473 in\r\n\ncash, and a  stolen Ruger .22  caliber revolver, S/N  191220.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Jewell also made a  motion to suppress certain statements\r\nmade by him at his apartment and later  at the police station\r\non the ground that he was not properly advised of  his rights\r\nunder  Miranda.  Jewell has  not appealed from  the denial of\r                          \r\nthat motion.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nJewell  and  Richards  were  arrested and  processed  at  the\r\n\nPittsfield Police Station.\r\n\n          Jewell  challenges the  district court's  denial of\r\n\nhis motion to suppress the physical evidence seized from  his\r\n\napartment  on the  grounds that  the search  warrant was  not\r\n\nsupported  by  probable cause,  as  required  by U.S.  Const.\r\n\namend.  IV.   In particular,  he asserts  that  the affidavit\r\n\nsupporting  the  application  for  the   search  warrant  was\r\n\ndeficient.   The search  warrant was issued  by Massachusetts\r\n\nClerk-Magistrate Leo  Evans upon the  affidavit of  Detective\r\n\nGranger.  The affidavit stated, in sum:  that police received\r\n\nan anonymous tip on October  6, 1992 that an African-American\r\n\nmale named \"Radar\" was  engaged in a drug transaction  in the\r\n\nvicinity of 168 Linden  Street; that information was received\r\n\nthe  following  week  from   a  \"concerned  citizen\"  in  the\r\n\nneighborhood that Radar was  distributing drugs from the pink\r\n\nhouse  with maroon  trim in  the 1st  floor apartment  on the\r\n\nright side; that subsequent surveillance by Pittsfield Police\r\n\nInvestigator Decker of Radar's residence confirmed that Radar\r\n\nwas  an individual known to  Decker as John  Jewell, and that\r\n\nJewell was living in  the first floor right apartment  of 162\r\n\nLinden Street with Brandee  Richards, and also confirmed that\r\n\nindividuals entered  the apartment for short  periods of time\r\n\nand left;  that a  reliable confidential informant  (CI-3), a\r\n\nlongtime  resident  of Pittsfield  who  had previously  given\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ninformation leading to drug arrests  and convictions, advised\r\n\nthat Jewell was living  at 162 Linden Street and  appeared to\r\n\nbe  dealing  cocaine out  of  that  location, and  that  CI-3\r\n\nobserved Jewell exchanging  money with individuals  in return\r\n\nfor  small, light-colored  objects, and  reported substantial\r\n\ntraffic in and  out of the apartment at all  hours of the day\r\n\nand  night, with  most  visitors entering  the apartment  for\r\n\nshort  periods of time  and leaving  (which behavior  was, in\r\n\nDetective   Granger's   view,   consistent   with   narcotics\r\n\ndistribution);  that a second reliable confidential informant\r\n\n(C1), who had previously  provided information leading to the\r\n\narrest and indictment of two individuals, advised that it had\r\n\npurchased crack  cocaine from  Jewell; and finally,  that one\r\n\nWilliam Shepard,  an informant of untested  veracity, visited\r\n\nthe Pittsfield  Police Department  on November 21,  1992, and\r\n\nprovided a sworn  statement to  the effect that  he had  seen\r\n\ncrack cocaine in Jewell's apartment at 162 Linden Street that\r\n\nafternoon,  and  that  Jewell  had stolen  various  items  of\r\n\nclothing and other  personal property from  him, and that  he\r\n\nhad  smoked  crack cocaine  obtained  from  Jewell some  time\r\n\nbefore coming to the police station. \r\n\n          The   district  court  determined  that  there  was\r\n\nsufficient  probable   cause  stated  on  the   face  of  the\r\n\naffidavit,  finding that  \"[t]he affidavit,  and particularly\r\n\nthe  information provided  by William  Shepard, is  more than\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nadequate to provide probable  cause for the search.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

In evaluating  the\r                   \r\n\nsufficiency of an affidavit, we  afford great deference to  a\r\n\nmagistrate's  determination of probable  cause.

The affidavit is to be interpreted in a common-\r\n\nsense rather than  a hypothetical  or hypertechnical  manner.\r\n\nSee id.;  United  States  v. Ventresca,  380  U.S.  102,  109\r                                                  \r\n\n(1965);  United States v.  Cochrane, 896  F.2d 635,  637 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 929 (1990).\r                               \r\n\n          Jewell  argues that  the fact  that no  warrant was\r\n\nobtained in mid-October shows that the police lacked probable\r\n\ncause at that time, and that Shepard's statement, he being an\r\n\nadmitted drug user and high at the time it was  made, was not\r\n\nenough to make up for  the deficiency.  There is no  merit to\r\n\nthis  contention.    Appellant  would  have  us  engage in  a\r\n\npiecemeal examination  of the affidavit, and  base our review\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nof  the clerk-magistrate's  action  on \"'bits  and pieces  of\r\n\ninformation  in isolation.'\"   See Cochrane, 896  F.2d at 637\r                                                       \r\n\n(quoting Massachusetts  v. Upton, 466 U.S.  727, 732 (1984)).\r                                            \r\n\nViewing the affidavit as a whole, as it should be,  there was\r\n\nmore  than  adequate  information  presented  to  the  clerk-\r\n\nmagistrate from which to find probable cause that  drugs were\r\n\npresent at Jewell's apartment.\r\n\n          Probable cause means  simply that  the totality  of\r\n\nthe circumstances gives rise  to a \"fair probability\" that  a\r\n\nsearch  of  the target  premises will  uncover evidence  of a\r\n\ncrime.   United States v. Jordan,  999 F.2d 11, 13  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993)  (citations  omitted).    In this  case,  such  a  fair\r\n\nprobability  was shown  by  the reports  of two  demonstrably\r\n\nreliable confidential informants that Jewell  was trafficking\r\n\nin drugs; Shepard's statement that he had observed cocaine in\r\n\nJewell's  apartment on the day  before the search warrant was\r\n\nissued; the statements of the concerned citizen; and finally,\r\n\nthe  trained  observations  of  Investigator  Decker.    Even\r\n\ndiscounting  Shepard's  reliability, the  information  in the\r\n\naffidavit still  provides probable  cause to believe  that an\r\n\nongoing  drug trafficking  operation  existed  at 162  Linden\r\n\nStreet.   See United States  v. Hershenow, 680  F.2d 847, 853\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1982) (citation omitted) (\"[W]here  the information\r\n\npoints  to  illegal  activity  of a  continuous  nature,  the\r\n\npassage  of several  months between  the observations  in the\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\naffidavit and the issuance of the warrant will not render the\r\n\ninformation stale.\").\r\n\n          Appellant  also  argues  that  the  district  court\r\n\nshould have excluded the physical evidence seized pursuant to\r\n\nthe search because the clerk-magistrate lacked probable cause\r\n\nto authorize  service of the  warrant without knocking.   The\r\n\ngovernment correctly responds  that the Federal  Constitution\r\n\ndoes not require state authorities, before they  issue a \"no-\r\n\nknock\" warrant,  to have probable cause to believe that entry\r\n\nwithout knocking is required.   All that is required  is that\r\n\nit  be  reasonable  under   the  circumstances  to  allow  an\r\n\nunannounced entry.   See Wilson v. Arkansas,  115 S.Ct. 1914,\r                                                       \r\n\n1918 (1995) (holding that  in some circumstances an officer's\r\n\nunannounced entry into a home might be unreasonable under the\r                                                               \r\n\nFourth Amendment) (emphasis added).  The Court in Wilson left\r                                                                    \r\n\nto   the  lower   courts   \"the  task   of  determining   the\r\n\ncircumstances under which an unannounced entry is  reasonable\r\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id. at 1919.\r                                             \r\n\n          The  affidavit here  stated that  Detective Granger\r\n\nhad personal knowledge of  Jewell's record of convictions for\r\n\nviolent  offenses, and  that he  had personal  knowledge that\r\n\nJewell possessed  a grey  pit bull  dog that  he kept  at the\r\n\napartment at  162 Linden  Street.   The district  court found\r\n\nthat  \"the affiant's  personal  knowledge of  the defendant's\r\n\npotentially  violent tendencies  and  of the  existence of  a\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\npitbull on the  premises was,  again, more  than adequate  to\r\n\njustify  a 'no-knock' warrant.\"  United States v. Jewell, Cr.\r                                                                    \r\n\nNo. 93-30036 (D. Mass. April  28, 1994) (memorandum and order\r\n\ndenying defendant's motions to suppress).\r\n\n          In  Wilson, the  Court made  clear that  not \"every\r                                \r\n\nentry must be preceded by an announcement,\" Wilson, 115 S.Ct.\r                                                              \r\n\nat 1918, and  noted the common-law rule that \"the presumption\r\n\nin  favor  of announcement  would  yield  under circumstances\r\n\npresenting a threat  of physical  violence.\"  Id.   at  1918-\r                                                             \r\n\n19.2    We must  therefore  determine  whether the  affidavit\r\n\npresented  in support  of  the application  for a  \"no-knock\"\r\n\nwarrant  reasonably  described  \"circumstances  presenting  a\r\n\nthreat of physical violence.\"\r\n\n          Like  the  district court,  we  hold  that it  did.\r\n\nDetective Granger  stated that  he had personal  knowledge of\r\n\nthe  existence of  a pit  bull  dog in  the  apartment to  be\r\n\nsearched.  The Fourth Amendment did not require the police to\r\n\nrisk  having to  fight  off a  forewarned  attack dog  before\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  In a footnote,  115 S.Ct. at 1918  n. 3, the  Court cited\r\nSabbath  v.  United States,  391  U.S.  585  (1968), for  the\r                                      \r\nproposition that both the common-law rule of announcement and\r\nentry and its exceptions were  codified in the federal \"knock\r                                    \r\nand announce\" statute, 18 U.S.C.   3109.   Appellant suggests\r\nthat  service of  the warrant in  this case did  not meet the\r\nrequirements of that statute. However, the threat of physical\r\nviolence is an established common-law exception to the \"knock\r\nand  announce\"  principle and,  as such,  is recognized  in  \r\n3109.   Section  3109,  moreover,  does not  apply  to  state\r\ninvestigations by  state officers.  United  States v. Andrus,\r                                                                        \r\n775 F.2d 825, 844 (7th Cir. 1985).\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nexecuting  their  warrant.    See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nBuckley, 4 F.3d  552, 557  (7th Cir. 1993)  (presence of  pit\r                   \r\n\nbull and  firearms sufficient to  justify \"no-knock\"  entry).\r\n\nThat, and the  fact of Jewell's  extensive history of  arrest\r\n\nand  conviction  for violent  crimes,  made  concern for  the\r\n\nphysical safety of the  officers executing the search warrant\r\n\nentirely reasonable.  The  \"no-knock\" provision was justified\r\n\nin this instance.\r\n\n          We affirm  the denial of the motion to suppress the\r\n\nevidence  seized pursuant  to the  state search  warrant from\r\n\nJewell's  apartment.   We have carefully  considered Jewell's\r\n\nother  arguments and  find them  to be  without merit.3   The\r\n\njudgment of the district court is therefore\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

While  the  Federal\r\nMagistrate  Act  provides  that  magistrate judges  \"may\"  be\r\ndesignated to  conduct hearings and submit \"proposed findings\r\nof  fact  and  recommendations\"  on  suppression motions,  28\r\nU.S.C.   636(b)(1)(A),(B), the  district court judge who made\r\nthe  assignment  to  the  magistrate  judge  retains  primary\r\njurisdiction  over the motion  to suppress.

Sec. 922(g)(1), and one count of receiving a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(j).  On appeal he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress all fruits of the search at his apartment at 162 Linden Street on the grounds that the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant failed to establish probable cause and failed to provide an adequate basis for the issuance of a \"no-knock\" warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  He also argues that he was denied procedural due process under the Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, 28 U.S.C.

Found and seized during the search were crack cocaine, cocaine processing paraphernalia, marijuana, $473 in cash, and a stolen Ruger .22 caliber revolver, S/N 191220.  Jewell and Richards were arrested and processed at the Pittsfield Police Station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jewell challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the physical evidence seized from his apartment on the grounds that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause, as required by U.S. Const. amend.  IV.  In particular, he asserts that the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant was deficient.  The search warrant was issued by Massachusetts Clerk-Magistrate Leo Evans upon the affidavit of Detective Granger.  The affidavit stated, in sum:  that police received an anonymous tip on October 6, 1992 that an African-American male named \"Radar\" was engaged in a drug transaction in the vicinity of 168 Linden Street;  that information was received the following week from a \"concerned citizen\" in the neighborhood that Radar was distributing drugs from the pink house with maroon trim in the 1st floor apartment on the right side;  that subsequent surveillance by Pittsfield Police Investigator Decker of Radar's residence confirmed that Radar was an individual known to Decker as John Jewell, and that Jewell was living in the first floor right apartment of 162 Linden Street with Brandee Richards, and also confirmed that individuals entered the apartment for short periods of time and left;  that a reliable confidential informant (CI-3), a longtime resident of Pittsfield who had previously given information leading to drug arrests and convictions, advised that Jewell was living at 162 Linden Street and appeared to be dealing cocaine out of that location, and that CI-3 observed Jewell exchanging money with individuals in return for small, light-colored objects, and reported substantial traffic in and out of the apartment at all hours of the day and night, with most visitors entering the apartment for short periods of time and leaving (which behavior was, in Detective Granger's view, consistent with narcotics distribution);  that a second reliable confidential informant (C1), who had previously provided information leading to the arrest and indictment of two individuals, advised that it had purchased crack cocaine from Jewell;  and finally, that one William Shepard, an informant of untested veracity, visited the Pittsfield Police Department on November 21, 1992, and provided a sworn statement to the effect that he had seen crack cocaine in Jewell's apartment at 162 Linden Street that afternoon, and that Jewell had stolen various items of clothing and other personal property from him, and that he had smoked crack cocaine obtained from Jewell some time before coming to the police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that there was sufficient probable cause stated on the face of the affidavit, finding that \"[t]he affidavit, and particularly the information provided by William Shepard, is more than adequate to provide probable cause for the search.\"  United States v.

In evaluating the sufficiency of an affidavit, we afford great deference to a magistrate's determination of probable cause.  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2331, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (citing Spinelli v.

Gates, 462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332.   The affidavit is to be interpreted in a common-sense rather than a hypothetical or hypertechnical manner.  See id.;  United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109, 85 S.Ct. 741, 746, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965);  United States v. Cochrane, 896 F.2d 635, 637 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 929, 110 S.Ct. 2627, 110 L.Ed.2d 647 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jewell argues that the fact that no warrant was obtained in mid-October shows that the police lacked probable cause at that time, and that Shepard's statement, he being an admitted drug user and high at the time it was made, was not enough to make up for the deficiency.  There is no merit to this contention.  Appellant would have us engage in a piecemeal examination of the affidavit, and base our review of the clerk-magistrate's action on \" 'bits and pieces of information in isolation.' \"   See Cochrane, 896 F.2d at 637 (quoting Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727, 732, 104 S.Ct. 2085, 2087-88, 80 L.Ed.2d 721 (1984)).  Viewing the affidavit as a whole, as it should be, there was more than adequate information presented to the clerk-magistrate from which to find probable cause that drugs were present at Jewell's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause means simply that the totality of the circumstances gives rise to a \"fair probability\" that a search of the target premises will uncover evidence of a crime.  United States v. Jordan, 999 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).  In this case, such a fair probability was shown by the reports of two demonstrably reliable confidential informants that Jewell was trafficking in drugs;  Shepard's statement that he had observed cocaine in Jewell's apartment on the day before the search warrant was issued;  the statements of the concerned citizen;  and finally, the trained observations of Investigator Decker.  Even discounting Shepard's reliability, the information in the affidavit still provides probable cause to believe that an ongoing drug trafficking operation existed at 162 Linden Street.  See United States v. Hershenow, 680 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir.1982) (citation omitted) (\"[W]here the information points to illegal activity of a continuous nature, the passage of several months between the observations in the affidavit and the issuance of the warrant will not render the information stale.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the district court should have excluded the physical evidence seized pursuant to the search because the clerk-magistrate lacked probable cause to authorize service of the warrant without knocking.  The government correctly responds that the Federal Constitution does not require state authorities, before they issue a \"no-knock\" warrant, to have probable cause to believe that entry without knocking is required.  All that is required is that it be reasonable under the circumstances to allow an unannounced entry.  See Wilson v. Arkansas, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995) (holding that in some circumstances an officer's unannounced entry into a home might be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment) (emphasis added).  The Court in Wilson left to the lower courts \"the task of determining the circumstances under which an unannounced entry is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1919.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit here stated that Detective Granger had personal knowledge of Jewell's record of convictions for violent offenses, and that he had personal knowledge that Jewell possessed a grey pit bull dog that he kept at the apartment at 162 Linden Street.  The district court found that \"the affiant's personal knowledge of the defendant's potentially violent tendencies and of the existence of a pitbull on the premises was, again, more than adequate to justify a 'no-knock' warrant.\"  United States v. Jewell, Cr. No. 93-30036 (D.Mass. April 28, 1994) (memorandum and order denying defendant's motions to suppress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Wilson, the Court made clear that not \"every entry must be preceded by an announcement,\" Wilson, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, and noted the common-law rule that \"the presumption in favor of announcement would yield under circumstances presenting a threat of physical violence.\"  Id. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1918-19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We must therefore determine whether the affidavit presented in support of the application for a \"no-knock\" warrant reasonably described \"circumstances presenting a threat of physical violence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we hold that it did.  Detective Granger stated that he had personal knowledge of the existence of a pit bull dog in the apartment to be searched.  The Fourth Amendment did not require the police to risk having to fight off a forewarned attack dog before executing their warrant.  See, e.g., United States v. Buckley, 4 F.3d 552, 557 (7th Cir.1993) (presence of pit bull and firearms sufficient to justify \"no-knock\" entry).  That, and the fact of Jewell's extensive history of arrest and conviction for violent crimes, made concern for the physical safety of the officers executing the search warrant entirely reasonable.  The \"no-knock\" provision was justified in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the denial of the motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the state search warrant from Jewell's apartment.  We have carefully considered Jewell's other arguments and find them to be without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Jewell also made a motion to suppress certain statements made by him at his apartment and later at the police station on the ground that he was not properly advised of his rights under Miranda.   Jewell has not appealed from the denial of that motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In a footnote, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1918 n. 3, the Court cited Sabbath v. United States, 391 U.S. 585 (1968), for the proposition that both the common-law rule of announcement and entry and its exceptions were codified in the federal \"knock and announce\" statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3109.  Appellant suggests that service of the warrant in this case did not meet the requirements of that statute.  However, the threat of physical violence is an established common-law exception to the \"knock and announce\" principle and, as such, is recognized in Sec. 3109.  Section 3109, moreover, does not apply to state investigations by state officers.  United States v. Andrus, 775 F.2d 825, 844 (7th Cir.1985)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In particular, we find no merit in Jewell's contention that he was denied procedural due process when District Judge Ponsor, who had presided over pre-trial proceedings concerning Jewell's motions to suppress as a United States magistrate judge, denied those motions shortly after his appointment to the district court.  While the Federal Magistrate Act provides that magistrate judges \"may\" be designated to conduct hearings and submit \"proposed findings of fact and recommendations\" on suppression motions, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(A), (B), the district court judge who made the assignment to the magistrate judge retains primary jurisdiction over the motion to suppress.  In re Worksite Inspection of Quality Products, 592 F.2d 611, 613 (1st Cir.1979).  Judge Freedman recalled the case from Magistrate Judge Ponsor on March 14, 1994, and reassigned it to Judge Ponsor on March 17, 1994.  Judge Freedman, in transferring the case, and Judge Ponsor, in denying the motion to suppress, were merely acting pursuant to their powers as district judges</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

There is no merit to this contention.  Appellant would have us engage in a piecemeal examination of the affidavit, and base our review of the clerk-magistrate's action on \" 'bits and pieces of information in isolation.' \"   See Cochrane, 896 F.2d at 637 (quoting Massachusetts v. Upton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111172\"><a href=\"/opinion/111172/massachusetts-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111172\"><a href=\"/opinion/111172/massachusetts-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span> (1984)).  Viewing the affidavit as a whole, as it should be, there was more than adequate information presented to the clerk-magistrate from which to find probable cause that drugs were present at Jewell's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause means simply that the totality of the circumstances gives rise to a \"fair probability\" that a search of the target premises will uncover evidence of a crime.  United States v. Jordan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611606\"><a href=\"/opinion/611606/united-states-v-sherwood-k-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).  In this case, such a fair probability was shown by the reports of two demonstrably reliable confidential informants that Jewell was trafficking in drugs;  Shepard's statement that he had observed cocaine in Jewell's apartment on the day before the search warrant was issued;  the statements of the concerned citizen;  and finally, the trained observations of Investigator Decker.  Even discounting Shepard's reliability, the information in the affidavit still provides probable cause to believe that an ongoing drug trafficking operation existed at 162 Linden Street.  See United States v. Hershenow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405158\"><a href=\"/opinion/405158/united-states-v-steven-v-hershenow-stuart-m-rosenthal-steven-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 853 (1st Cir.1982) (citation omitted) (\"[W]here the information points to illegal activity of a continuous nature, the passage of several months between the observations in the affidavit and the issuance of the warrant will not render the information stale.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the district court should have excluded the physical evidence seized pursuant to the search because the clerk-magistrate lacked probable cause to authorize service of the warrant without knocking.  The government correctly responds that the Federal Constitution does not require state authorities, before they issue a \"no-knock\" warrant, to have probable cause to believe that entry without knocking is required.  All that is required is that it be reasonable under the circumstances to allow an unannounced entry.  See Wilson v. Arkansas, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117936\"><a href=\"/opinion/117936/wilson-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1914</span></a></span>, 1918, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117936\"><a href=\"/opinion/117936/wilson-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span> (1995) (holding that in some circumstances an officer's unannounced entry into a home might be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment) (emphasis added).  The Court in Wilson left to the lower courts \"the task of determining the circumstances under which an unannounced entry is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1919.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit here stated that Detective Granger had personal knowledge of Jewell's record of convictions for violent offenses, and that he had personal knowledge that Jewell possessed a grey pit bull dog that he kept at the apartment at 162 Linden Street.  The district court found that \"the affiant's personal knowledge of the defendant's potentially violent tendencies and of the existence of a pitbull on the premises was, again, more than adequate to justify a 'no-knock' warrant.\"  United States v. Jewell, Cr. No. 93-30036 (D.Mass. April 28, 1994) (memorandum and order denying defendant's motions to suppress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Wilson, the Court made clear that not \"every entry must be preceded by an announcement,\" Wilson, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, and noted the common-law rule that \"the presumption in favor of announcement would yield under circumstances presenting a threat of physical violence.\"  Id. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1918-19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We must therefore determine whether the affidavit presented in support of the application for a \"no-knock\" warrant reasonably described \"circumstances presenting a threat of physical violence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we hold that it did.  Detective Granger stated that he had personal knowledge of the existence of a pit bull dog in the apartment to be searched.  The Fourth Amendment did not require the police to risk having to fight off a forewarned attack dog before executing their warrant.  See, e.g., United States v. Buckley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629183\"><a href=\"/opinion/629183/united-states-v-kim-m-buckley-and-mark-r-herman/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 557 (7th Cir.1993) (presence of pit bull and firearms sufficient to justify \"no-knock\" entry).  That, and the fact of Jewell's extensive history of arrest and conviction for violent crimes, made concern for the physical safety of the officers executing the search warrant entirely reasonable.  The \"no-knock\" provision was justified in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the denial of the motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the state search warrant from Jewell's apartment.  We have carefully considered Jewell's other arguments and find them to be without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Jewell also made a motion to suppress certain statements made by him at his apartment and later at the police station on the ground that he was not properly advised of his rights under Miranda.   Jewell has not appealed from the denial of that motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In a footnote, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1918 n. 3, the Court cited Sabbath v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107718\"><a href=\"/opinion/107718/sabbath-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span> (1968), for the proposition that both the common-law rule of announcement and entry and its exceptions were codified in the federal \"knock and announce\" statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3109.  Appellant suggests that service of the warrant in this case did not meet the requirements of that statute.  However, the threat of physical violence is an established common-law exception to the \"knock and announce\" principle and, as such, is recognized in Sec. 3109.  Section 3109, moreover, does not apply to state investigations by state officers.  United States v. Andrus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460092\"><a href=\"/opinion/460092/united-states-v-louis-c-andrus-george-e-collett-william-j-lutson/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span>, 844 (7th Cir.1985)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In particular, we find no merit in Jewell's contention that he was denied procedural due process when District Judge Ponsor, who had presided over pre-trial proceedings concerning Jewell's motions to suppress as a United States magistrate judge, denied those motions shortly after his appointment to the district court.  While the Federal Magistrate Act provides that magistrate judges \"may\" be designated to conduct hearings and submit \"proposed findings of fact and recommendations\" on suppression motions, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 636(b)(1)(A), (B), the district court judge who made the assignment to the magistrate judge retains primary jurisdiction over the motion to suppress.  In re Worksite Inspection of Quality Products, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"363589\"><a href=\"/opinion/363589/7-osh-casbna-1093-1979-oshd-cch-p-23328-in-re-worksite/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 613 (1st Cir.1979).  Judge Freedman recalled the case from Magistrate Judge Ponsor on March 14, 1994, and reassigned it to Judge Ponsor on March 17, 1994.  Judge Freedman, in transferring the case, and Judge Ponsor, in denying the motion to suppress, were merely acting pursuant to their powers as district judges</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
