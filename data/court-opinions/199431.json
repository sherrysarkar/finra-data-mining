Plaintiff-appellant John\n\nBrown was indicted by a federal grand jury on drug and firearm\n\ncharges based on evidence seized during a search of his apartment\n\nby the Rhode Island State Police.            Brown moved to suppress the\n\nevidence, arguing that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment\n\nrights by failing to knock and announce their presence when\n\nexecuting the warrant authorizing the search. Brown's motion was\n\ndenied, and he subsequently pled guilty to certain of the counts\n\nagainst   him.    He   now    appeals      the   denial   of   his   motion   to\n\nsuppress.    For the reasons discussed below, we vacate and remand.\n\n                                      I.\n\n             Early in March 1998, detectives with the Rhode Island\n\nState Police obtained information from a confidential source\n\nsuggesting that cocaine was being distributed from an apartment\n\nin Providence, Rhode Island.         The source identified Brown as one\n\nof the individuals residing at the apartment, and as the person\n\ninvolved in the drug dealing.           The source claimed to have been\n\ninside the apartment several times, including, most recently,\n\nfive days prior to his contact with the police, and to have seen\n\nsignificant quantities of cocaine and at least one firearm.                    A\n\nsubsequent    review   of    state   records      and   police   surveillance\n\nyielded information confirming Brown's presence at the apartment\n\nand indicating that Brown had previously been arrested for a drug\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\foffense in Connecticut.     On the basis of this information, the\n\nofficers sought a warrant to search Brown's apartment for, inter\n\nalia, drugs and weapons.\n\n           An application for the warrant was made by Officer\n\nPatrick Reilly in Rhode Island state court on March 17, 1998.\n\nThe application consisted of a completed complaint, signed by\n\nReilly, and Reilly's affidavit setting out the facts supporting\n\nissuance of the warrant.     In the affidavit, Reilly stated that\n\nthe police sought a “no-knock” search warrant, in order to\n\n“prevent narcotics/evidence from being destroyed and to ensure\n\nofficer safety.”      However, the complaint did not include any\n\nlanguage indicating that the police were seeking a no-knock\n\nwarrant.\n\n           What transpired when Reilly appeared before the judge\n\nis only sketchily recounted in the present record.    According to\n\nReilly's testimony at the suppression hearing, the no-knock\n\nrequest was specifically discussed with the judge, as was the\n\nabsence of language in the complaint form regarding the need for\n\na no-knock warrant.    Reilly testified that the judge asked him to\n\ncorrect the complaint form to make clear that a no-knock warrant\n\nwas being requested.     Reilly made and initialed a handwritten\n\nnotation to that effect on the complaint form and the judge then\n\nsigned the warrant.    While it appears that, at this point, Reilly\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fbelieved he had been granted the requested no-knock warrant, it\n\nis undisputed that the search warrant the judge actually signed\n\ncontained no language authorizing a no-knock entry.                Reilly's\n\ntestimony also revealed little about what led him to believe that\n\nthe judge had agreed with the request for a no-knock warrant.\n\n             The officers executed the warrant later the same day,\n\nentering Brown's apartment without knocking or announcing their\n\npresence.1    Once inside, they encountered Brown and advised him\n\nof his rights, and Brown admitted that there was cocaine in his\n\nbedroom.     The officers entered that room and found 22 plastic\n\nbags containing a total of 52.52 grams of cocaine; four firearms,\n\nincluding a sawed-off shotgun; and various other accouterments of\n\nthe drug trade.        On the basis of this evidence, a federal grand\n\njury    returned   a     six-count   indictment      charging   Brown    with\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A) (Count One); possession\n\nof firearms while a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(g)(1)    (Counts     Two   through     Five);   and   possession    of   an\n\nunregistered sawed-off shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§\n\n5841, 5861(d), and 5871 (Count Six).\n\n\n       1\n     Officer Reilly, who took part in executing the warrant,\ntestified that the police entered the house in which Brown's\napartment was located through an unlocked rear door. Finding\nthe door to Brown's unit locked, they “knocked the door in and\nproceeded into the apartment.”\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           Brown    subsequently      moved    to   suppress    the   evidence\n\nseized from his apartment on two grounds: first, that the warrant\n\nwas not supported by probable cause (an argument not pressed on\n\nappeal and therefore not further discussed); and, second, that\n\nthe officers had improperly failed to knock and announce their\n\npresence when executing the warrant.            The district court held a\n\nhearing on Brown's motion at which Officer Reilly was the only\n\nwitness to offer testimony on this issue.               Reilly gave brief\n\ntestimony concerning his application for the search warrant and\n\nthe   search   itself   and   was   cross-examined,      also    briefly,   by\n\nBrown’s attorney.\n\n           In the oral argument that followed, Brown's attorney\n\ncontended that the evidence was insufficient to establish that\n\nthe officers' no-knock entry was authorized by a warrant, or\n\njustified by any recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment\n\nknock-and-announce requirement.            The government countered that\n\nthe manner of the entry was in fact justified on both grounds:\n\nthe no-knock entry had been made in reliance on the state judge's\n\napproval, notwithstanding the lack of a notation on the warrant\n\nitself, and the unannounced entry was necessary to protect the\n\npolice from danger in executing the warrant.\n\n           Ruling    from     the   bench,    the   district    court   denied\n\nBrown's motion.     Bypassing the dispute over whether the judge had\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fauthorized a no-knock entry, or whether the police reasonably\n\nbelieved    that       he    had,   the     court     found       that       the     entry    was\n\njustified by a reasonable concern for the officers' safety.                                    In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the court relied on three pieces of\n\ninformation       obtained       by      the     police      from        the    confidential\n\ninformant       and    recited      by   Reilly      in     his    affidavit          and    oral\n\ntestimony:       Brown's        asserted         involvement            in     “storing       and\n\ndistributing cocaine” from his apartment; the alleged observation\n\nof “large amounts of cocaine” inside the apartment; and the\n\nobservation of “at least one firearm” inside the apartment.                                   The\n\ncourt concluded that this information created “a reasonable\n\nsuspicion       that    knocking      and      announcing         the    presence       of    the\n\nofficers might very well have caused the occupants to use the\n\nfirearm    in    a     manner    that     would      have    been       dangerous       to    the\n\nofficers.”\n\n             Following the denial of his motion, Brown pled guilty\n\nto Counts One, Two, and Six of the indictment pursuant to a plea\n\nagreement in which he reserved his right to appeal the denial of\n\nthe suppression motion.             On August 24, 1999, Brown was sentenced\n\nto   135   months       of   imprisonment,           followed       by       three    years    of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n                                               II.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f             Although        the   Fourth       Amendment's     requirement    of\n\nreasonableness        in     the   conduct      of   searches     and    seizures\n\nincorporates the common-law expectation that police will announce\n\ntheir presence and request admittance before entering a dwelling\n\nby force, Wilson v. Arkansas 514 U.S. 927, 933 (1995), it does\n\nnot   “mandate    a        rigid   rule    of    announcement     that    ignores\n\ncountervailing law enforcement interests,” id. at 934.                   Instead,\n\nthe Constitution creates a “presumption in favor of announcement”\n\nthat will yield in appropriate circumstances, including those\n\nwhere compliance would expose officers to the “threat of physical\n\nviolence” or “where police officers have reason to believe that\n\nevidence would be destroyed if advance notice were given.”                    Id.\n\nat 935-36.    The standard to be applied when determining whether\n\nsuch “exigent circumstances” excuses non-compliance with the\n\nknock-and-announce rule is one of “reasonable suspicion” -- based\n\non the “particular circumstances” of the case -- that knocking\n\nand announcing “would be dangerous or futile, or that it would .\n\n. . allow[] the destruction of evidence.”              Richards v. Wisconsin,\n\n520 U.S. 385, 394 (1997).          Establishing the applicability of the\n\nexception is not particularly difficult, id. at 934; however,\n\n“the police should be required to [demonstrate the existence of\n\nreasonable suspicion] whenever the reasonableness of a no-knock\n\nentry is challenged.”          Id. at 934-35.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f             On appeal, Brown does not contest the substance of the\n\nevidence    relied    upon       by   the     district       court.   Nor   does     he\n\nseriously dispute any of the factual evidence introduced by the\n\ngovernment.       Instead, Brown renews his argument that, under the\n\ncircumstances of this case, the evidence relied upon by the\n\ndistrict    court    is    inadequate         under    the    reasonable-suspicion\n\nstandard to establish the existence of circumstances justifying\n\na no-knock entry.          The determination of whether a given set of\n\nfacts constitute exigent circumstances justifying deviation from\n\nthe knock-and-announce principle is reviewed                      de novo. United\n\nStates v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 185 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\nvacated    and    remanded    on      other       grounds,    ---U.S.---,    2001    WL\n\n530830; see also United States v. Cooper, 168 F.3d 336, 339 (8th\n\nCir. 1999). In conducting our                 de novo review, we assess the\n\nentirety of the record below “in the light most favorable to the\n\ntrial court's ruling.”           United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\nA.           Brown's Challenges to the District Court's Ruling\n\n             In    questioning        the      sufficiency       of   the   evidence\n\nsupporting the district court's ruling, Brown makes two distinct\n\narguments.        First,    he    contends         that   the   evidence    that    the\n\ngovernment introduced, and the district court relied upon, failed\n\nto specifically establish the circumstances that existed at the\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\ftime the officers entered Brown's apartment.                      Brown notes that\n\nprecedent requires the reasonableness of a particular entry to\n\n“be   evaluated   as   of    the   time    [the    police]        entered    .   .    .”\n\nRichards, 520 U.S. at 395.            Yet, Brown argues, both Reilly's\n\naffidavit and testimony refer only to the circumstances as they\n\nwere thought to exist at the time of the warrant hearing.                            In\n\nBrown's   view,   such    evidence,       by   itself,       cannot    justify       the\n\nofficers' no-knock entry.\n\n            As a general principle of law, Brown is wrong in\n\nsuggesting that information contained in a warrant application or\n\ndiscussed at a warrant hearing cannot justify a later no-knock\n\nentry.    Established precedent allows state judicial officers to\n\nissue no-knock warrants “where sufficient cause to do so can be\n\ndemonstrated ahead of time,”          Richards, 520 U.S. at 396 n.7, and\n\nallows    the   police,      in    most    instances,        to    rely     on   such\n\nauthorization, once granted, see United States v. Hawkins, 139\n\nF.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying the rule of reasonable\n\nreliance announced in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984),\n\nto warrant provisions authorizing no-knock entry).                          At least\n\nwhere a warrant is issued, then, no-knock entries may be made on\n\nthe basis of information presented at a warrant hearing without\n\nrunning   afoul   of   the    requirements        of   the    Fourth      Amendment.\n\nFurthermore, we think it clear that, in most cases, there would\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fbe no reason to distinguish between what officers knew (or\n\nsuspected) at the time of the warrant hearing and what they knew\n\n(or     suspected)       when     executing       the   warrant.          Absent    some\n\nsuggestion that the earlier-presented evidence was no longer\n\nreliable by the time of the entry, we see no reason why officers\n\nshould be required to introduce affirmative evidence simply to\n\nestablish that they haven't changed their minds.2\n\n               There     is,    however,    a     narrower    reading      of   Brown's\n\nposition, articulated more clearly at oral argument, which merits\n\nexamination.           Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this\n\ncase, it remains unresolved whether the judge ever did, in fact,\n\napprove the officers' request for a no-knock warrant.                          While the\n\ngovernment argued in the district court that Reilly's version of\n\nevents supported an inference that the judge at least intended to\n\nissue       such   a   warrant,    Brown    argued      in   favor   of    a    contrary\n\ninference, and the district court specifically declined to decide\n\nthe issue.         In effect, then, the court found that the officers\n\nwere justified in making a no-knock entry even if their request\n\nfor permission to do so had been refused.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      If Brown genuinely believed that later evidence established\nthe absence of a need for no-knock entry, the obvious avenue for\ninvestigating this possibility would have been through cross-\nexamination of Reilly at the suppression hearing.         Brown's\ncounsel did not do so.\n\n                                           -11-\n\f              In this context, we agree with Brown that the district\n\ncourt's exclusive reliance on evidence presented at the warrant\n\nhearing is problematic.         Finding such evidence sufficient to\n\njustify the officers' actions would require us to conclude that\n\nthe officers were free to second-guess a judicial refusal of\n\ntheir request for a no-knock warrant, without having shown any\n\nnew information or other reason for doing so.               Such a conclusion\n\nstrikes us as troubling, especially in light of the critical role\n\nFourth Amendment precedent has historically ascribed to state\n\njudicial officers in preventing mistakes and misconduct.                   Cf.\n\nLeon,   468    U.S.   at   913-14    (noting   that   the    warrant   process\n\n“provides the detached scrutiny of a neutral magistrate, which is\n\na more reliable safeguard against improper searches than the\n\nhurried judgment of a law enforcement officer engaged in the\n\noften competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime”) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).           In our view, it should be a rare case\n\nin which an unannounced entry, made in the wake of an outright\n\nrefusal to give authorization for the same, could be justified on\n\nthe basis of the evidence already passed upon by the judicial\n\nofficer.\n\n              We are also not persuaded by the government's argument\n\nthat Richards supports the district court's conclusion.                 It is\n\ntrue that Richards upheld an unannounced entry following the\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fdenial of a no-knock warrant request.               See 520 U.S. at 395-96.\n\nIt is also true that Richards contains language discussing the\n\nrole of an officer's “independent judgment” in determining the\n\nreasonableness of an unannounced entry.             See id. at 396 n.7 (“[A]\n\nmagistrate's decision not to authorize a no-knock entry should\n\nnot be interpreted to remove the officers' authority to exercise\n\nindependent judgment concerning the wisdom of a no-knock entry at\n\nthe warrant is being executed.”).           However, the facts of Richards\n\nare   readily     distinguishable     from    those    of   this    case.   In\n\nRichards, the officers' decision to make an unannounced search\n\nwas   prompted    by    unforeseen   circumstances      encountered     during\n\nexecution    of   the    warrant.     See    id.3     The   Court    expressly\n\nacknowledged this in explaining why the officers' actions were\n\njustified:\n\n             At the time the officers obtained the\n             warrant, they did not have the evidence\n             sufficient,   in  the    judgment   of the\n             Magistrate, to justify a no-knock warrant.\n             Of course, the Magistrate could not have\n             anticipated   in   every    particular the\n\n\n      3\n     The officers' efforts to gain entry into Richards's\napartment were based in part on a ruse involving an officer\ndressed as a maintenance man.    See id. at 388.    This officer\nsucceeded in getting Richards to open the door, but Richards\nobserved the uniformed officers standing some distance away and\nslammed the door shut again. Id. At that point the officers,\napparently recognizing that they had been discovered and\nconcerned that Richards might try to escape or destroy evidence,\ncommenced breaking the door down without prior announcement.\nId.\n\n                                     -13-\n\f             circumstances   that  would   confront  the\n             officers when they arrived at Richard's\n             motel room. These actual circumstances . .\n             . justified the officers' ultimate decision\n             to enter without first announcing their\n             presence and authority.\n\nId. (emphasis added).      Richards thus does not establish that the\n\npolice may second-guess a judge's refusal to issue a no-knock\n\nwarrant on the basis of the same circumstances considered by the\n\njudge.\n\n             In any event, we need not decide whether or to what\n\nextent the police may face a heightened burden in justifying an\n\nunannounced    entry   made   after   an   application    for   a   no-knock\n\nwarrant has been denied.         On the present record, we vacate the\n\ndistrict court's ruling for the second reason Brown offers: the\n\nevidence introduced does not establish a danger to the officers\n\nsufficient to justify unannounced entry under the officer-safety\n\nexception.      Although   the    hurdle   imposed   by   the   reasonable\n\nsuspicion standard is “not high,” Richards, 520 U.S. at 394, it\n\nis nonetheless real, and the scant details set forth in Reilly's\n\naffidavit and elicited by the government at the suppression\n\nhearing are insufficient to clear it.\n\n             As the government largely concedes, the evidence of\n\ndangerousness contained in the present record falls well short of\n\nthe proof we previously have found to be sufficient to justify\n\nno-knock entry.        Without apparent exception, our cases have\n\n                                   -14-\n\finvolved not only evidence of the presence of weapons at the\n\ndwelling    to   be   searched,    but   also       evidence   supporting    an\n\ninference that the target of the search might actually use them.\n\nSee, e.g., Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 186 (upholding no-knock\n\nentry on officer-safety rationale where record contained “ample\n\nevidence that the officers knew [defendant] was a member of a\n\nwell-armed and extremely violent drug organization”); Hawkins,\n\n139 F.3d at 32 (upholding no-knock search on officer-safety\n\nrationale in light of defendant's “copious record of violent\n\nconvictions, coupled with the arresting police officer's personal\n\nknowledge of a recent armed action by him, and the officer's\n\nsuspicion that [the defendant] was aware of the police interest\n\nin him”); United States v. Jewell, 60 F.3d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (upholding no-knock search where officer had personal\n\nknowledge   of   a    pit   bull   dog   in   the    apartment   and   of   the\n\ndefendant's “extensive history of arrest and conviction for\n\nviolent crimes.”). Here, the information available to the police\n\nconveyed little beyond the bare fact that “at least one weapon”\n\nhad been observed, and nothing whatsoever concerning Brown's\n\npropensity to violence.4\n\n\n     4\n     In its brief, the government suggests that the district\ncourt inferred that Brown might be motivated to use a weapon by\nvirtue of its conclusion that “knocking and announcing the\npresence of the officers might very well have caused the\noccupants to use the firearm in a manner that would have been\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            In addition, the decisions of our sister circuits tend\n\nto undercut the district court's conclusion.        At least three\n\ncircuits have held that evidence tending to show no more than the\n\nprobable presence of a weapon in a dwelling, even a dwelling\n\nassociated with drug dealing, is categorically inadequate to\n\njustify no-knock entry on officer-safety grounds.         See United\n\nStates v.    Moore, 91 F.3d 96, 98 (10th Cir. 1996) (“The mere\n\nstatement   that   firearms   are   present,   standing   alone,   is\n\ninsufficient [to justify no-knock entry]. The government must go\n\nfurther and demonstrate that the presence of firearms raised a\n\nconcern for the officers' safety.”); United States v. Bates, 84\n\nF.3d 790, 795 (6th Cir. 1996) (“Evidence that firearms are within\n\na residence, by itself, is not sufficient to create an exigency\n\nto officers when executing a warrant.”); United States v. Marts,\n\n986 F.2d 1216, 1218 (8th Cir. 1993) (“The reasonable belief that\n\nfirearms may have been within the residence, standing alone, is\n\nclearly insufficient [to justify no-knock entry].”).       And while\n\nseveral courts have stated that they are more willing to infer\n\ndangerousness where both drugs and weapons are involved, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Stowe, 100 F.3d 494, 499 (7th Cir. 1996)\n\n\n\ndangerous to the officers.” However, this general statement is\nbased on nothing in the record beyond the three previously\nrecited allegations, and we decline to accord it significant\nweight.\n\n                                -16-\n\f(“While the presence of a gun alone is not necessarily enough [to\n\njustify no-knock entry], drug dealing is a crime infused with\n\nviolence . . . . Guns and drugs together distinguish the millions\n\nof homes where guns are present from those housing potentially\n\ndangerous drug dealers . . . .”) (emphasis in original) (internal\n\ncitations omitted), they have done so in factual circumstances\n\nthat are, albeit to varying degrees, perceptibly more threatening\n\nthan those described in the record before us.           See, e.g., id.\n\n(upholding search made pursuant to a no-knock warrant, where\n\ninformant had confirmed the presence of loaded weapons in the\n\napartment mere hours earlier, and apartment had a steel door that\n\ncould make entry difficult); United States v. Gambrell, 178 F.3d\n\n927, 929 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 920 (1999) (upholding\n\nsearch made pursuant to a no-knock warrant where informant had\n\nstated that residents carried loaded weapons on their persons\n\nwhile in the apartment and when answering the door);              United\n\nStates v. Kennedy, 32 F.3d 876, 882-83 (4th Cir. 1994) (upholding\n\nentry despite lack of pause between announcement and forcible\n\nentry   where   police   knew   defendant   was   participating   in   an\n\nextensive cocaine conspiracy involving dealers with prior weapons\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fconvictions and where at least one member of the conspiracy had\n\npreviously threatened an officer).5\n\n            Finally, we are concerned that finding adequate the\n\nslight, generalized evidence of dangerousness in this record\n\nwould come close to creating an impermissible blanket exception\n\nto the knock-and-announce principle in a large subgroup of cases.\n\nAs the Supreme Court acknowledged in Richards, the possibility or\n\neven probability that weapons will be present in a dwelling to be\n\nsearched    exists   in   many   investigations   involving   crimes   of\n\nviolence.    See 520 U.S. at 393-94.      Yet, even in those cases, the\n\ndecision to make a no-knock entry must be based upon a case-by-\n\ncase determination that the circumstances of the particular entry\n\npresent a “threat of physical violence.”          Id. at 391; see also\n\nid. at 393 (overturning decision of Wisconsin Supreme Court\n\nholding a no-knock entry to be justified in all cases where a\n\nwarrant authorizes the search of a dwelling involved in the drug\n\ntrade).\n\n\n\n     5\n     We acknowledge that the Fourth Circuit's decision in United\nStates v. Lalor, 996 F.2d 1578 (4th Cir. 1993), is a case with\nfacts somewhat like those here, see id. at 1584-85 (upholding\nno-knock search where weapon had been found during arrest of\nsame defendant which took place five days earlier and defendant\nhad made “derogatory remarks about the police”).       But that\ndecision appears to rest in part on the mistaken application of\nclear-error review to the district court's finding that exigent\ncircumstances had been demonstrated.    See id.   In any event,\nLalor does not shake our belief that vacatur is warranted here.\n\n                                   -18-\n\f               In view of the foregoing, we need not and do not decide\n\nwhether, under another set of circumstances or on a fuller\n\nrecord, the presence of one or more weapons at a dwelling where\n\ndrug dealing is suspected might be adequate to justify a no-knock\n\nentry.     We simply hold that, in light of the limited testimony\n\nand other evidence introduced by the government, the existence of\n\na     danger    to    officers   justifying       no-knock   entry   was   not\n\ndemonstrated here.\n\nB.             Alternative Grounds for Affirmance\n\n               In the parties' briefs and at oral argument, several\n\nalternative grounds for upholding the district court's ruling\n\nwere discussed.        See United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1167\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (noting that this court “will uphold [a district\n\ncourt's] denial of [a] motion to suppress if any reasonable view\n\nof the evidence supports it”).           Although none of them is wholly\n\nimplausible, we        conclude that none has adequate support in the\n\npresent record.\n\n               The first such argument is that the officers' no-knock\n\nentry, if not justified by the officer-safety rationale, was\n\nnonetheless permissible to prevent the destruction of evidence.\n\nThe government notes that the drug in question -- cocaine -- is\n\none    that    this    Court   has   found   to   be   “quickly   and   easily\n\ndestroyed,” Garcia, 983 F.2d at 1168, and contends that this\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\ffact, coupled with evidence suggesting that the drugs were in the\n\nresidence and thus accessible to Brown, was sufficient to give\n\nthe police “reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing\n\ntheir presence . . . would inhibit the effective investigation of\n\nthe   crime    by   .    .   .   allowing    the   destruction    of   evidence.”\n\nRichards, 520 U.S. at 394.\n\n              We    think     this   alternative     “exigent     circumstances”\n\nargument ultimately fails for the same reasons as the district\n\ncourt's rationale. Approving the officers' actions on this basis\n\nwould require a significant extension of this circuit's Fourth\n\nAmendment precedent.             Although we have previously acknowledged\n\nthe readily disposable nature of cocaine, we have thus far found\n\nthis fact only to mitigate the length of time officers must wait\n\nbetween announcement and entry, not to justify dispensing with\n\nannouncement altogether.             Garcia, 983 F.2d at 1168 (upholding\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that ten- to fifteen-second wait\n\nbetween announcement and entry complied with knock-and-announce\n\nrule in context of a drug raid involving cocaine); United States\n\nv. One Parcel of Real Property, 873 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(same).   Nor has the government identified any precedent from\n\nother courts justifying no-knock entry on similar facts.                   To the\n\ncontrary, at least one court has concluded that where, as here,\n\nlarge   amounts         of   cocaine   are    thought   to   be    present,   the\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fdestruction-of-evidence rationale is not persuasive.                    See Bates,\n\n84 F.3d at 796 (affirming district court ruling that destruction\n\nof evidence rationale was not plausible where police believed\n\nthat fifteen pounds of cocaine were present and agreeing that it\n\nwas “unreasonable to think that fifteen kilograms of powder\n\ncocaine could be quickly disposed of by flushing it down the\n\ntoilet or dumping it down the sink drain”).\n\n               The government also contends that the no-knock entry\n\ncan be justified on the Leon principle of reasonable reliance.\n\nSee   468     U.S.     at   922    (holding   suppression     not    required    for\n\n“evidence          obtained   in   objectively       reasonable     reliance    on   a\n\nsubsequently invalidated search warrant”); see also Hawkins, 139\n\nF.3d at 32 (applying Leon in no-knock context).                       Two distinct\n\nrationales are offered for how Leon should apply in this case.\n\nFirst,       the    government      argues    that   the   record    mandates    the\n\ninference that the state judge actually did authorize a no-knock\n\nsearch, notwithstanding the lack of a notation to that effect on\n\nthe face of the warrant, and that the officers acted in reliance\n\non    that    authorization        when   they   entered    Brown's     apartment.\n\nBecause of this, in the government's view, Leon requires that we\n\nuphold the search, even if doubtful, as long as we do not find\n\nthat the officers' reliance was unreasonable.                     See 468 U.S. at\n\n922-923.      In support of its position, the government cites United\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fStates v. Mattison, 153 F.3d 406, 410 (7th Cir. 1998), which\n\nupheld    a   no-knock    search   conducted     pursuant   to     a    facially\n\ndeficient warrant on essentially this theory.6\n\n              The   inference    the   government    asks   us    to    draw   is\n\nplausible, but we do not think it is inescapable.                 Although the\n\nrecord suggests that Reilly personally believed the search was\n\nauthorized, there is little indication of what the judge said or\n\ndid that led Reilly to believe this.             And, as previously noted,\n\nBrown has argued that the objective facts in the record could be\n\nread to yield the opposite inference.               Our caution is further\n\namplified in this case by the fact that the district court --\n\nwhich sat in a far better position than we to form an opinion as\n\nto the credibility and meaning of Reilly's testimony -- expressly\n\ndeclined to make this determination.             These circumstances stand\n\nin contrast to those in Mattison.             In that case, the government\n\nintroduced testimony from several witnesses establishing that, in\n\nthe   county    where    the   warrant   was   obtained,    it    was   “common\n\nprocedure” for judges to authorize no-knock entry without making\n\nan express notation on the face of the warrant.                  Mattison, 153\n\n\n\n      6\n     Also relevant, in our view, is Massachusetts v. Sheppard,\n468 U.S. 981 (1984), in which the Supreme Court held that a\nstate judge's “fail[ure] to make all the necessary clerical\ncorrections” to a warrant, thereby rendering it invalid, did not\nprevent officers from relying on the warrant in conducting a\nsearch. Id. at 990-91.\n\n                                       -22-\n\fF.3d at 409, 410.     On the basis of this evidence, the information\n\ncontained in the warrant application, and testimony from an\n\nofficer confirming that the police believed the authorization had\n\nbeen given, the district court expressly found that a no-knock\n\nwarrant was, in fact, issued.7       Id. at 410.    In the absence of a\n\nsimilarly clear record, or comparable on-point findings by the\n\ndistrict court, we are not convinced that the same result should\n\nobtain in this case.\n\n           Furthermore, we note that the absence of clear evidence\n\nor relevant findings regarding the state judge's actions prevents\n\nus from evaluating, as we must under Leon, whether the officers'\n\nreliance   on   the    purported    authorization     was   objectively\n\nreasonable.     See 468 U.S. at 919 n.20.           As Leon explains,\n\nobjective reasonableness does not “turn on the subjective good\n\nfaith of individual officers.”8           Id.   Instead, it requires a\n\nshowing of “objective good faith,” determined by considering\n\n\n\n     7The facts of this case also distinguish it from Sheppard,\nwhere the record included a detailed recitation of the\ninterchange between the judge and the police, and where the\ntrial court had found that the judge stated an intention to\nissue the warrant and expressly informed the police that he had\nmade the necessary “clerical corrections.” See 468 U.S. at 986-\n87 & n.3, 989-90.\n     8\n     For this reason, the government is incorrect that this\nquestion is resolved by the district court's conclusory\nstatement that it “appeared” that Officer Reilly's belief that\nhe had authorization was in good faith.\n\n                                   -23-\n\fwhether the officer acted “as a reasonable officer would and\n\nshould act in similar circumstances.”                Id. at 920 (quoting Stone\n\nv. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 539-540 (1976) (White, J., dissenting)).\n\nBecause the district court chose to bypass the government's Leon\n\nargument, it made no findings on this issue, and we decline to do\n\nso in the first instance.\n\n               The government's brief also suggests a second way in\n\nwhich       Leon   might     apply    to   this   case.     According     to   this\n\nalternative argument, the officers must be given the benefit of\n\nLeon,       even   if   we   cannot   find    that   the   search   was   actually\n\nauthorized, because the record demonstrates that the officers\n\nbelieved, in good faith, that authorization had been given.\n\nWhile we think it unclear whether Leon would apply under the\n\ncircumstances the government describes,9 we need not decide that\n\nissue here.        Even if good-faith belief could bring the officers'\n\nconduct within the scope of Leon, the present record provides an\n\ninadequate basis for evaluating the objective reasonableness of\n\nthe officers' reliance, precluding affirmance on this ground.\n\n                                           III.\n\n\n        9\n     By its terms, Leon provides the safe harbor of reasonable\nreliance only where authorization has been given but is later\ndetermined to have been given in error. See 468 U.S. at 919-\n920.   It would therefore plainly extend the law to provide\nsimilar protection to police actions undertaken in the mistaken,\nalthough reasonable, belief that a particular entry was\nauthorized.\n\n                                           -24-\n\f                Because     the   record      as   it     currently   stands     is\n\ninsufficient to sustain the district court's ruling, we vacate\n\nthe ruling and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.        On remand, we direct the district court to address\n\nthe   government's         argument    that    the      officers'   actions    were\n\njustified under Leon because the state judge authorized the no-\n\nknock        entry   and    the   officers     reasonably      relied   on     that\n\nauthorization.10           We note but do not rule on the government's\n\nrequest for permission to argue on remand that, even if a knock-\n\nand-announce violation occurred, the discovery of the seized\n\nevidence was inevitable under the rule of Nix v. Williams, 467\n\nU.S. 431, 440-448 (1984).             In the absence of any briefing from\n\nBrown on this question, we think it appropriate to leave to the\n\ndistrict court the determination of whether this issue may be\n\nraised for the first time following remand.\n\n                It is so ordered.\n\n\n        10\n      While we think it probable that the district court will be\nable to resolve this issue on the basis of the existing record,\nwe do not now decide whether the record may be reopened on\nremand.   We consider the question of whether to reopen the\nrecord to lie within the trial court's discretion, and are\nparticularly reluctant to resolve it without the benefit of\nbriefing from the parties. We note, however, that other courts\nto consider the issue have held that such reopenings should be\nallowed only sparingly, and upon an adequate justification by\nthe party so moving for its failure to introduce the new\nevidence at the initial hearing. See, e.g., United States v.\nKithcart, 218 F.3d 213, 219-20 (3d Cir. 2000); United States v.\nBlankenship, 775 F.2d 735, 740 (6th Cir. 1985).\n\n                                       -25-\n\f",
