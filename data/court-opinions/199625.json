On March 15, 1996, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Shannon Rogan suffered serious personal injuries when\n\na motor vehicle she was driving collided with a trolley car\n\noperated     under       the    auspices       of     the    Massachusetts     Bay\n\nTransportation Authority (MBTA).                 We canvassed the pertinent\n\nfacts on an earlier occasion, see Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75,\n\n76-77 (1st Cir. 1999) (Rogan II), and it would be pleonastic to\n\nrehearse them here.            For the purpose at hand, it suffices to\n\nnote that, immediately following the accident, officers from\n\nboth the MBTA and the City of Boston converged on the scene. 1\n\nPursuant to an unofficial departmental policy, the Boston police\n\nofficers,    John       McDonough   and    Robert       Colburn,   relinquished\n\ncontrol of the investigation to the MBTA.\n\n            In    due    course,    an   MBTA       police   officer   cited   the\n\nplaintiff for failure to yield.                Believing the citation to be\n\nunfounded,       the    plaintiff   sought      judicial     review.     A   state\n\ndistrict judge found her responsible for failing to yield.                     The\n\nplaintiff eschewed a further appeal, instead paying a $50 fine.\n\n\n\n\n    1 The MBTA has its own police and shares jurisdiction over\ncertain matters with the Boston police department. See Act of\nJuly 19, 1968, ch. 664, 1968 Mass. Acts 547 (creating a separate\npolice force to function with the MBTA's territorial authority\nand investing its officers with powers equivalent to those of\nmunicipal police officers).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f             That was not the end of the matter.              Invoking 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, the plaintiff sued a multitude of defendants — the two\n\nresponding officers (McDonough and Colburn), the City of Boston,\n\nthree municipal officials, the MBTA, and several MBTA employees\n\n— in the federal district court.              She claimed, inter alia, that\n\nMcDonough, Colburn, and the municipal officials had impaired her\n\naccess     to     the    courts      when    they     ceded    control    of    the\n\ninvestigation to the MBTA (which, she averred, had a financial\n\ninterest in the outcome of the investigation and shaped its\n\nfindings accordingly).\n\n             The plaintiff eventually settled her state-court tort\n\nsuit against the MBTA and, as part of the settlement, dismissed\n\nthe   MBTA      defendants    from    this    action.       The    district    court\n\ndisposed     of    the    plaintiff's        claims    against     the   remaining\n\ndefendants in stages.             First, the court, acting on a motion\n\nbrought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), dismissed all\n\nindividual-capacity          claims    against      the    mayor   (Menino),    the\n\npolice commissioner (Evans), and a third municipal official\n\n(DiMarzio).        Rogan v. Menino, 973 F. Supp. 72, 77 (D. Mass.\n\n1997) (Rogan I).          The plaintiff then dropped her official-\n\ncapacity claims against Mayor Menino.                     Finally, the district\n\ncourt, acting on its own initiative, entered summary judgment\n\nadverse to the plaintiff on the remainder of the claims.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            The plaintiff appealed both the Rule 12(b)(6) order and\n\nthe   sua   sponte     summary    judgment.       This   court   upheld    the\n\ndismissal of the individual-capacity claims, but vacated the\n\ngrant of summary judgment on procedural grounds.              Rogan II, 175\n\nF.3d at 81.        On remand, the remaining defendants — McDonough,\n\nColburn, and the City of Boston — formally moved for summary\n\njudgment, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), and the district court\n\ngranted the motion.         This appeal followed.\n\n            We     review   the   district    court's    entry   of    summary\n\njudgment de novo, construing the record and all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in favor of the nonmoving party (here, the\n\nplaintiff).      N. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Lapalme, 258 F.3d 35,\n\n37 (1st Cir. 2001).           We keep firmly in mind that summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with\n\nthe affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as\n\nto any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n            Summary judgment practice has its own rhythm.               Where,\n\nas here, the initiators are the defendants, they must begin the\n\nmovement by averring the absence of any evidence sufficient to\n\nsupport     some    necessary     element    of   the    plaintiff's     case.\n\nMaldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fCir. 1994).     To avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff then must\n\nsound a contrapuntal note, pointing to evidence in the record\n\nsufficient to establish the existence of a \"genuine\" issue of\n\n\"material\" fact anent the disputed element(s).                        Id.    A genuine\n\nissue exists if the record evidence is such that a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could resolve it either way.                  Id.   A fact is material\n\nif its existence vel non \"affects the outcome of the suit\" so\n\nthat it \"needs to be resolved before the related legal issues\n\ncan    be   decided.\"      Id.    (citation        and    internal          punctuation\n\nomitted).\n\n             Summary judgment motions are decided on the record as\n\nit stands, not on the pleadings or on the nonmovant's vision of\n\nwhat   facts   might    some     day   be    unearthed         by    the    litigation\n\nequivalent of an archeological dig.                Consequently, a plaintiff\n\nwho aspires to ward off a properly documented motion for summary\n\njudgment must produce enough proof to enable her case to get to\n\na jury.     Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 313 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).      This   obligation     cannot      be    satisfied         by    conclusory\n\nallegations,       empty   rhetoric,         unsupported            speculation,     or\n\nevidence which, in the aggregate, is less than significantly\n\nprobative.      Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581; Medina-Munoz v.\n\nR.J. Reynolds Tobacco Corp., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            Against this backdrop, we turn to the plaintiff's\n\nclaims.     The statute under which she sues, 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nprovides in pertinent part that \"every person who, under color\n\nof a statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . .,\n\nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United\n\nStates . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\n\nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable\n\nto the party injured.\"        In other words, section 1983 \"supplies\n\na private right of action against a person who, under color of\n\nstate     law,   deprives     another      of   rights   secured    by   the\n\nConstitution or by federal law.\"           Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033,\n\n1036 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            To maintain such a cause of action, the plaintiff — who\n\nhas the burden of proof — first must show official conduct, that\n\nis, an act or omission undertaken under color of state law.\n\nRoche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 253 (1st\n\nCir.    1996).    That   is    not   a     problem   here;   the   municipal\n\ndefendants plainly were acting under color of Massachusetts law.\n\nBut the plaintiff also must show that the defendants' acts or\n\nomissions caused a constitutional injury.            Rogan's case founders\n\non this shoal.     We explain briefly.\n\n            To satisfy the \"constitutional injury\" requirement, the\n\nplaintiff must make a showing of a deprivation of a federally-\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fsecured right.             Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 142 (1979);\n\nNieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2001).                           It is the\n\nlaw    of     the    case   that      the    policy   of    transferring        accidents\n\ninvolving MBTA vehicles to the MBTA police is not, in and of\n\nitself, unconstitutional.                   Rogan II, 175 F.3d at 78 (declaring\n\nthat        \"there     is        no   constitutional           prohibition         against\n\norganizational         schemes        that    lodge    self-investigative          powers\n\nwithin a government agency\").                 This leaves the plaintiff, on her\n\npleadings, with two possible avenues of attack.\n\n               The     most      obvious      avenue       would     be    to   show    an\n\nunconstitutional implementation of the transfer policy.                                See\n\nCity     of       Canton    v.    Harris,       489    U.S.    378,       386-87    (1989)\n\n(concluding that, under certain circumstances, a policy that is\n\nconstitutional on its face may be applied in an unconstitutional\n\nmanner, thus implicating section 1983).                            Here, however, the\n\nplaintiff makes only a token effort to travel this road.                               She\n\noffers       no     significantly       probative       evidence      that      the    MBTA\n\nofficers deliberately skewed their investigation, let alone that\n\nthe municipal defendants knew (or had reason to believe) that\n\nsuch a charade would occur.\n\n               The plaintiff pursues the second avenue with more\n\nvigor:         she    endeavors        to     make    the     requisite      showing    of\n\nconstitutional injury based on a denial of meaningful access to\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\fthe courts.       Theoretically, she is on solid ground.                     There is a\n\nconstitutional right of access to the courts.                             See Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 579 (1974); Inmates of Suffolk County\n\nJail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 660 (1st Cir. 1997).                           It follows,\n\ntherefore, that \"[i]t can be a deprivation of life, liberty, or\n\nproperty,    without       due    process      of    law,    in    violation       of   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, for state officials to deny a person\n\nadequate,    effective,          and   meaningful         access   to     the     courts.\"\n\nGermany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).                   But theory is one thing and\n\nreality     is     quite   another.            As    a    practical       matter,       the\n\nplaintiff's effort to limn a denial of access to the courts\n\nfalls short.\n\n            The plaintiff's thesis is not easily extracted from the\n\nharsh rhetoric and tangled ratiocination that permeates her\n\nbrief.    As best we can tell, her argument seems to be that the\n\ndefendants are liable because they shifted responsibility for\n\nthe   accident         investigation      to        the   MBTA     police       who,    she\n\ntheorizes, had a conflict of interest which led them to conduct\n\na biased investigation and cover up the real cause of the\n\naccident (the trolley driver's negligence).                        This conflict of\n\ninterest,        the   plaintiff       says,        arises   out     of     the    mutual\n\nemployment of the MBTA police and the trolley car operator,\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fpresumably on the basis that, if the trolley driver were held\n\nresponsible for the accident, the MBTA would be exposed to\n\nfinancial    risk   (i.e.,      money    damages).       In    this    way,    the\n\nmunicipal defendants allegedly deprived the plaintiff of an\n\nimpartial investigation, and, thus, of meaningful access to the\n\njudicial    process     (including      an    opportunity      to   obtain    more\n\ngenerous recompense in her tort action).\n\n            This thesis has several flaws.               The perceived link\n\nbetween the investigation and the plaintiff's tort suit seems\n\ntenuous at best, especially since under Massachusetts law, the\n\nplaintiff's conviction on the failure-to-yield charge would not\n\nhave been admissible in evidence in a trial of that suit.                      See\n\nLePage v. Bumila, 407 Mass. 163, 164-65 (Mass. 1990) (holding\n\nthat the payment of a fine pursuant to a traffic citation does\n\nnot   constitute      an    evidentiary       admission).       Moreover,      the\n\nplaintiff, in fact, was able to pursue her personal injury\n\nclaim, and she received a substantial settlement ($710,000).                    We\n\nneed not belabor these points, however, because the summary\n\njudgment record contains no evidence whatsoever that the MBTA\n\ninvestigation was partial or that the municipal defendants had\n\nany reason to suspect that it would be.               To cinch matters, the\n\nrecord   reveals    a      similar   dearth    of   evidence    that   any    MBTA\n\ninvestigations      were      marked    by     partiality,      or     that    the\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fdefendants, based on their experience, were on notice that the\n\nMBTA had played fast and loose on prior occasions (or would do\n\nso on this occasion).\n\n            To bridge these chasmal gaps, the plaintiff baldly\n\nasserts that the MBTA's financial interest in the outcome of the\n\ninvestigation somehow creates a presumption of partiality.                 She\n\nis wrong.      Accusations of bias are not self-elucidating.            Thus,\n\na plaintiff who alleges a pattern and practice of partiality\n\nmust, when faced with a motion for summary judgment, offer some\n\nsignificantly      probative    evidence        to   support   that   charge.\n\nIndeed,   in    situations     in   which   a    presumption    exists,    the\n\npresumption is that government officials are impartial in the\n\nadministration of responsibilities arising within the scope of\n\ntheir employment.2      See Withrow v.          Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47\n\n(1975); United States        v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 421 (1941);\n\nBrasslett v. Cota, 761 F.2d 827, 837 (1st Cir. 1985).                 Were the\n\nlaw otherwise, federal agencies would be hamstrung whenever they\n\n\n\n    2In support of her contention that partiality may be\npresumed without proof, the plaintiff cites Ward v. Vill. of\nMonroeville, 409 U.S. 57 (1972).       That case bears on the\nneutrality of officials performing judicial or quasi-judicial\nfunctions.    See id. at 59-60.      The plaintiff's claim of\ninstitutional bias on the part of the MBTA investigators\npresents a significantly different problem. Ward is, therefore,\ninapposite. See Doolin Sec. Sav. Bank v. FDIC, 53 F.3d 1395,\n1405-07 (4th Cir. 1995); Hammond v. Baldwin, 866 F.2d 172, 177\n(6th Cir. 1989).\n\n                                     -11-\n\fhad reason to investigate crimes against the United States or\n\ntort claims involving federal employees.\n\n              The plaintiff's cause is not aided by her denunciatory\n\ncharge that the citation issued by the MBTA for failure to yield\n\nwas \"intended to provide leverage to diminish her claim for\n\ndamages.\"       Appellant's Br. at 15.                 That is rank conjecture.               As\n\nthe    plaintiff         provides     us    with       no   evidence         to    support   the\n\naccusation,         it     can    play     no    role       in   the    summary        judgment\n\ncalculus.3          See Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581; Medina-Munoz,\n\n896 F.2d at 8.\n\n              The short of it is that the plaintiff has mustered no\n\nproof that the MBTA's investigation was anything less than\n\npristine on this (or any other comparable) occasion.                                    By the\n\nsame       token,    she    has    adduced       no    evidence        to    show     that   the\n\nmunicipal       defendants         knew,    or        had   reason      to    know,     of   any\n\nirregularity         in    the     MBTA's       discharge        of    its        investigatory\n\nfunctions.

We canvassed the pertinent facts on an earlier occasion, see Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 76-77 (1st Cir. 1999) (Rogan II), and it would be pleonastic to rehearse them here. For the purpose at hand, it suffices to note that, immediately following the accident, officers from both the MBTA and the City of Boston converged on the scene.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Pursuant to an unofficial departmental policy, the Boston police officers, John McDonough and Robert Colburn, relinquished control of the investigation to the MBTA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, an MBTA police officer cited the plaintiff for failure to yield. Believing the citation to be unfounded, the plaintiff sought judicial review. A state district judge found her responsible for failing to yield. The plaintiff eschewed a further appeal, instead paying a $50 fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That was not the end of the matter. Invoking 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, the plaintiff sued a multitude of defendants -- the two responding officers (McDonough and Colburn), the City of Boston, three municipal officials, the MBTA, and several MBTA employees -- in the federal district court. She claimed, inter alia, that McDonough, Colburn, and the municipal officials had impaired her access to the courts when they ceded control of the investigation to the MBTA (which, she averred, had a financial interest in the outcome of the investigation and shaped its findings accordingly).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff eventually settled her state-court tort suit against the MBTA and, as part of the settlement, dismissed the MBTA defendants from this action. The district court disposed of the plaintiff's claims against the remaining defendants in stages. First, the court, acting on a motion brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), dismissed all individual-capacity claims against the mayor (Menino), the police commissioner (Evans), and a third municipal official (DiMarzio). Rogan v. Menino, 973 F. Supp. 72, 77 (D. Mass. 1997) (Rogan I). The plaintiff then dropped her official-capacity claims against Mayor Menino. Finally, the district court, acting on its own initiative, entered summary judgment adverse to the plaintiff on the remainder of the claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff appealed both the Rule 12(b)(6) order and the sua sponte summary judgment. This court upheld the dismissal of the individual-capacity claims, but vacated the grant of summary judgment on procedural grounds. Rogan II, 175 F.3d at 81. On remand, the remaining defendants -- McDonough, Colburn, and the City of Boston -- formally moved for summary judgment, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), and the district court granted the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo, construing the record and all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the nonmoving party (here, the plaintiff). N. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Lapalme, 258 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 2001). We keep firmly in mind that summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment practice has its own rhythm. Where, as here, the initiators are the defendants, they must begin the movement by averring the absence of any evidence sufficient to support some necessary element of the plaintiff's case. Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994). To avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff then must sound a contrapuntal note, pointing to evidence in the record sufficient to establish the existence of a \"genuine\" issue of \"material\" fact anent the disputed element(s). Id. A genuine issue exists if the record evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could resolve it either way. Id. A fact is material if its existence vel non \"affects the outcome of the suit\" so that it \"needs to be resolved before the related legal issues can be decided.\" Id. (citation and internal punctuation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment motions are decided on the record as it stands, not on the pleadings or on the nonmovant's vision of what facts might some day be unearthed by the litigation equivalent of an archeological dig. Consequently, a plaintiff who aspires to ward off a properly documented motion for summary judgment must produce enough proof to enable her case to get to a jury. Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 313 (1st Cir. 2001). This obligation cannot be satisfied by conclusory allegations, empty rhetoric, unsupported speculation, or evidence which, in the aggregate, is less than significantly probative. Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581; Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Corp., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the plaintiff's claims. The statute under which she sues, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, provides in pertinent part that \"every person who, under color of a statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . ., subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured.\" In other words, section 1983 \"supplies a private right of action against a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.\" Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1036 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To maintain such a cause of action, the plaintiff -- who has the burden of proof -- first must show official conduct, that is, an act or omission undertaken under color of state law. Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 253 (1st Cir. 1996). That is not a problem here; the municipal defendants plainly were acting under color of Massachusetts law. But the plaintiff also must show that the defendants' acts or omissions caused a constitutional injury. Rogan's case founders on this shoal. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the \"constitutional injury\" requirement, the plaintiff must make a showing of a deprivation of a federally-secured right. Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 142 (1979); Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2001). It is the law of the case that the policy of transferring accidents involving MBTA vehicles to the MBTA police is not, in and of itself, unconstitutional. Rogan II, 175 F.3d at 78 (declaring that \"there is no constitutional prohibition against organizational schemes that lodge self-investigative powers within a government agency\"). This leaves the plaintiff, on her pleadings, with two possible avenues of attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most obvious avenue would be to show an unconstitutional implementation of the transfer policy. See City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 386-87 (1989) (concluding that, under certain circumstances, a policy that is constitutional on its face may be applied in an unconstitutional manner, thus implicating section 1983). Here, however, the plaintiff makes only a token effort to travel this road. She offers no significantly probative evidence that the MBTA officers deliberately skewed their investigation, let alone that the municipal defendants knew (or had reason to believe) that such a charade would occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff pursues the second avenue with more vigor: she endeavors to make the requisite showing of constitutional injury based on a denial of meaningful access to the courts. Theoretically, she is on solid ground. There is a constitutional right of access to the courts. See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 579 (1974); Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 660 (1st Cir. 1997). It follows, therefore, that \"[i]t can be a deprivation of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, for state officials to deny a person adequate, effective, and meaningful access to the courts.\" Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). But theory is one thing and reality is quite another. As a practical matter, the plaintiff's effort to limn a denial of access to the courts falls short.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's thesis is not easily extracted from the harsh rhetoric and tangled ratiocination that permeates her brief. As best we can tell, her argument seems to be that the defendants are liable because they shifted responsibility for the accident investigation to the MBTA police who, she theorizes, had a conflict of interest which led them to conduct a biased investigation and cover up the real cause of the accident (the trolley driver's negligence). This conflict of interest, the plaintiff says, arises out of the mutual employment of the MBTA police and the trolley car operator, presumably on the basis that, if the trolley driver were held responsible for the accident, the MBTA would be exposed to financial risk (i.e., money damages). In this way, the municipal defendants allegedly deprived the plaintiff of an impartial investigation, and, thus, of meaningful access to the judicial process (including an opportunity to obtain more generous recompense in her tort action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This thesis has several flaws. The perceived link between the investigation and the plaintiff's tort suit seems tenuous at best, especially since under Massachusetts law, the plaintiff's conviction on the failure-to-yield charge would not have been admissible in evidence in a trial of that suit. See LePage v. Bumila, 407 Mass. 163, 164-65 (Mass. 1990) (holding that the payment of a fine pursuant to a traffic citation does not constitute an evidentiary admission). Moreover, the plaintiff, in fact, was able to pursue her personal injury claim, and she received a substantial settlement ($710,000). We need not belabor these points, however, because the summary judgment record contains no evidence whatsoever that the MBTA investigation was partial or that the municipal defendants had any reason to suspect that it would be. To cinch matters, the record reveals a similar dearth of evidence that any MBTA investigations were marked by partiality, or that the defendants, based on their experience, were on notice that the MBTA had played fast and loose on prior occasions (or would do so on this occasion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bridge these chasmal gaps, the plaintiff baldly asserts that the MBTA's financial interest in the outcome of the investigation somehow creates a presumption of partiality. She is wrong. Accusations of bias are not self-elucidating. Thus, a plaintiff who alleges a pattern and practice of partiality must, when faced with a motion for summary judgment, offer some significantly probative evidence to support that charge. Indeed, in situations in which a presumption exists, the presumption is that government officials are impartial in the administration of responsibilities arising within the scope of their employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975); United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 421 (1941); Brasslett v. Cota, 761 F.2d 827, 837 (1st Cir. 1985). Were the law otherwise, federal agencies would be hamstrung whenever they had reason to investigate crimes against the United States or tort claims involving federal employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's cause is not aided by her denunciatory charge that the citation issued by the MBTA for failure to yield was \"intended to provide leverage to diminish her claim for damages.\" Appellant's Br. at 15. That is rank conjecture. As the plaintiff provides us with no evidence to support the accusation, it can play no role in the summary judgment calculus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581; Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the plaintiff has mustered no proof that the MBTA's investigation was anything less than pristine on this (or any other comparable) occasion. By the same token, she has adduced no evidence to show that the municipal defendants knew, or had reason to know, of any irregularity in the MBTA's discharge of its investigatory functions. These deficits are fatal. See, e.g., Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 248 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2001) (warning that a plaintiff who opposes summary judgment but fails to marshal evidence in support of her position has little prospect of success); Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 358-59 (1st Cir. 1991) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Here, as in Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 586, \"[a]lthough the rhetoric of [constitutional injury] reverberates from the pages of [the plaintiff's] brief[s], the record contains no evidence of [a violation] sufficient to relate the rhetoric to the reality of events.\" Since the plaintiff failed to present any proof of a constitutional injury, the district court did not err in granting the defendants' motion for brevis disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The MBTA has its own police and shares jurisdiction over certain matters with the Boston police department.

The plaintiff's claim of institutional bias on the part of the MBTA investigators presents a significantly different problem. Ward is, therefore, inapposite. See Doolin Sec. Sav. Bank v.

Castillo-Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 581 (1st Cir. 1994). To avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff then must sound a contrapuntal note, pointing to evidence in the record sufficient to establish the existence of a \"genuine\" issue of \"material\" fact anent the disputed element(s). Id. A genuine issue exists if the record evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could resolve it either way. Id. A fact is material if its existence vel non \"affects the outcome of the suit\" so that it \"needs to be resolved before the related legal issues can be decided.\" Id. (citation and internal punctuation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment motions are decided on the record as it stands, not on the pleadings or on the nonmovant's vision of what facts might some day be unearthed by the litigation equivalent of an archeological dig. Consequently, a plaintiff who aspires to ward off a properly documented motion for summary judgment must produce enough proof to enable her case to get to a jury. Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199393\"><a href=\"/opinion/199393/perez-de-munoz-v-volvo-car-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir. 2001). This obligation cannot be satisfied by conclusory allegations, empty rhetoric, unsupported speculation, or evidence which, in the aggregate, is less than significantly probative. Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581; Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536516\"><a href=\"/opinion/536516/52-fair-emplpraccas-253-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39659-jose-medina-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the plaintiff's claims. The statute under which she sues, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, provides in pertinent part that \"every person who, under color of a statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . ., subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured.\" In other words, section 1983 \"supplies a private right of action against a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.\" Evans v. Avery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197095\"><a href=\"/opinion/197095/evans-v-avery/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></a></span>, 1036 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To maintain such a cause of action, the plaintiff -- who has the burden of proof -- first must show official conduct, that is, an act or omission undertaken under color of state law. Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716599\"><a href=\"/opinion/716599/daniel-j-roche-et-ux-valerie-roche-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 253 (1st Cir. 1996). That is not a problem here; the municipal defendants plainly were acting under color of Massachusetts law. But the plaintiff also must show that the defendants' acts or omissions caused a constitutional injury. Rogan's case founders on this shoal. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the \"constitutional injury\" requirement, the plaintiff must make a showing of a deprivation of a federally-secured right. Baker v. McCollan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110132\"><a href=\"/opinion/110132/baker-v-mccollan/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 142 (1979); Nieves v. McSweeney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199286\"><a href=\"/opinion/199286/nieves-v-mcsweeney/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir. 2001). It is the law of the case that the policy of transferring accidents involving MBTA vehicles to the MBTA police is not, in and of itself, unconstitutional. Rogan II, 175 F.3d at 78 (declaring that \"there is no constitutional prohibition against organizational schemes that lodge self-investigative powers within a government agency\"). This leaves the plaintiff, on her pleadings, with two possible avenues of attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most obvious avenue would be to show an unconstitutional implementation of the transfer policy. See City of Canton v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112209\"><a href=\"/opinion/112209/canton-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, 386-87 (1989) (concluding that, under certain circumstances, a policy that is constitutional on its face may be applied in an unconstitutional manner, thus implicating section 1983). Here, however, the plaintiff makes only a token effort to travel this road. She offers no significantly probative evidence that the MBTA officers deliberately skewed their investigation, let alone that the municipal defendants knew (or had reason to believe) that such a charade would occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff pursues the second avenue with more vigor: she endeavors to make the requisite showing of constitutional injury based on a denial of meaningful access to the courts. Theoretically, she is on solid ground. There is a constitutional right of access to the courts. See Wolff v. McDonnell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>, 579 (1974); Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197630\"><a href=\"/opinion/197630/inmates-of-suffolk-v-rouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span>, 660 (1st Cir. 1997). It follows, therefore, that \"[i]t can be a deprivation of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, for state officials to deny a person adequate, effective, and meaningful access to the courts.\" Germany v. Vance, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518738\"><a href=\"/opinion/518738/suzanne-germany-v-carol-vance-suzanne-germany-v-carol-vance/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). But theory is one thing and reality is quite another. As a practical matter, the plaintiff's effort to limn a denial of access to the courts falls short.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's thesis is not easily extracted from the harsh rhetoric and tangled ratiocination that permeates her brief. As best we can tell, her argument seems to be that the defendants are liable because they shifted responsibility for the accident investigation to the MBTA police who, she theorizes, had a conflict of interest which led them to conduct a biased investigation and cover up the real cause of the accident (the trolley driver's negligence). This conflict of interest, the plaintiff says, arises out of the mutual employment of the MBTA police and the trolley car operator, presumably on the basis that, if the trolley driver were held responsible for the accident, the MBTA would be exposed to financial risk (i.e., money damages). In this way, the municipal defendants allegedly deprived the plaintiff of an impartial investigation, and, thus, of meaningful access to the judicial process (including an opportunity to obtain more generous recompense in her tort action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This thesis has several flaws. The perceived link between the investigation and the plaintiff's tort suit seems tenuous at best, especially since under Massachusetts law, the plaintiff's conviction on the failure-to-yield charge would not have been admissible in evidence in a trial of that suit. See LePage v. Bumila, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></span>, 164-65 (Mass. 1990) (holding that the payment of a fine pursuant to a traffic citation does not constitute an evidentiary admission). Moreover, the plaintiff, in fact, was able to pursue her personal injury claim, and she received a substantial settlement ($710,000). We need not belabor these points, however, because the summary judgment record contains no evidence whatsoever that the MBTA investigation was partial or that the municipal defendants had any reason to suspect that it would be. To cinch matters, the record reveals a similar dearth of evidence that any MBTA investigations were marked by partiality, or that the defendants, based on their experience, were on notice that the MBTA had played fast and loose on prior occasions (or would do so on this occasion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bridge these chasmal gaps, the plaintiff baldly asserts that the MBTA's financial interest in the outcome of the investigation somehow creates a presumption of partiality. She is wrong. Accusations of bias are not self-elucidating. Thus, a plaintiff who alleges a pattern and practice of partiality must, when faced with a motion for summary judgment, offer some significantly probative evidence to support that charge. Indeed, in situations in which a presumption exists, the presumption is that government officials are impartial in the administration of responsibilities arising within the scope of their employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See Withrow v. Larkin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109237\"><a href=\"/opinion/109237/withrow-v-larkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 47 (1975); United States v. Morgan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103537\"><a href=\"/opinion/103537/united-states-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 421 (1941); Brasslett v. Cota, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451881\"><a href=\"/opinion/451881/duane-p-brasslett-v-raymond-j-cota-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 837 (1st Cir. 1985). Were the law otherwise, federal agencies would be hamstrung whenever they had reason to investigate crimes against the United States or tort claims involving federal employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's cause is not aided by her denunciatory charge that the citation issued by the MBTA for failure to yield was \"intended to provide leverage to diminish her claim for damages.\" Appellant's Br. at 15. That is rank conjecture. As the plaintiff provides us with no evidence to support the accusation, it can play no role in the summary judgment calculus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581; Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the plaintiff has mustered no proof that the MBTA's investigation was anything less than pristine on this (or any other comparable) occasion. By the same token, she has adduced no evidence to show that the municipal defendants knew, or had reason to know, of any irregularity in the MBTA's discharge of its investigatory functions. These deficits are fatal. See, e.g., Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199395\"><a href=\"/opinion/199395/corrada-betances-v-sea-land-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 2001) (warning that a plaintiff who opposes summary judgment but fails to marshal evidence in support of her position has little prospect of success); Kelly v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555046\"><a href=\"/opinion/555046/john-l-kelly-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 358-59 (1st Cir. 1991) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Here, as in Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 586, \"[a]lthough the rhetoric of [constitutional injury] reverberates from the pages of [the plaintiff's] brief[s], the record contains no evidence of [a violation] sufficient to relate the rhetoric to the reality of events.\" Since the plaintiff failed to present any proof of a constitutional injury, the district court did not err in granting the defendants' motion for brevis disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The MBTA has its own police and shares jurisdiction over certain matters with the Boston police department.

That case bears on the neutrality of officials performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions. See id. at 59-60. The plaintiff's claim of institutional bias on the part of the MBTA investigators presents a significantly different problem. Ward is, therefore, inapposite. See Doolin Sec. Sav. Bank v.
