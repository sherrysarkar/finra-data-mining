On October 14, 1992, a federal grand\r\n\njury sitting in  Puerto Rico returned an  indictment charging the\r\n\nappellant  with  attempting  to  use  an  altered  United  States\r\n\npassport  while applying for admission to the United States.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n18 U.S.C.     1543.    After some  preliminary  skirmishing,  not\r\n\nrelevant  here, the appellant pled guilty.  On December 18, 1992,\r\n\nthe  court sentenced the appellant  to 36 months  probation.  The\r\n\nconditions  of  his  probation   included  the  following:    the\r\n\nappellant, while on probation, would neither commit another crime\r\n\nnor illegally possess a controlled substance, and, if deported or\r\n\ngranted voluntary  departure, he would remain  outside the United\r\n\nStates unless  he obtained  prior written authorization  from the\r\n\npertinent authorities and met other benchmarks.\r\n\n          On August 24, 1995,  the appellant's probation  officer\r\n\nnotified the district court that the appellant had violated these\r\n\nconditions.   The probation  officer reported that,  in 1994, the\r\n\nappellant had been arrested and convicted in New York for selling\r\n\ncocaine;  and that, on March 1, 1995, Customs agents had arrested\r\n\nand charged him with unlawful entry, false use of a passport, and\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nmisuse of a visa.\r\n\n          On September 21, 1995, the  district court held a show-\r\n\ncause hearing  at  which  the  court found  that  probable  cause\r\n\nexisted to believe that the appellant had violated the conditions\r\n\nof his probation.  On  October 5, 1995, the court held  a further\r\n\nhearing.   At the conclusion  of this hearing,  the court revoked\r\n\nthe  term of  probation  which  had  been  imposed  in  1992  and\r\n\nsentenced the appellant  to 18 months imprisonment.   This appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\n          Revocation  of  probation is  governed generally  by 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    3565(b)  and the  policy statements  contained in  USSG\r\n\n 7B1.3.  Policy statements are advisory in nature, see USSG Ch.7,\r                                                                \r\n\nPt.A,  intro. comment.; United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 301\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1993),  but when  correctly applied  they carry  great\r\n\nweight.   See Stinson v.  United States, 508  U.S. 36, 42 (1993);\r                                                 \r\n\nUnited States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir.  1994).  Under\r                                \r\n\nthem,  revocation  of probation  is  mandatory  if the  defendant\r\n\ncommits a Grade  A violation,  see USSG  7B1.3(a)(1),  such as  a\r                                            \r\n\ncontrolled substance offense.   See 18  U.S.C.   3565(b)(1);  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso 18 U.S.C.   3563(a)(3); USSG  7B1.1(a)(1)(ii).  Distributing\r              \r\n\na controlled substance constitutes a controlled substance offense\r\n\nfor this purpose.  See USSG  4B1.2(2).\r                                \r\n\n          Viewed  against this  backdrop,  the  appeal is  easily\r\n\nresolved.     The  New   York  conviction  for   selling  cocaine\r\n\nconstituted  all  that  was  needed  to  revoke  the  appellant's\r\n\nprobation.   See 18  U.S.C.   3565(b)(1);  USSG  7B1.3(a)(1); see\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nalso USSG  4B1.2(2).   The appellant's  glossover of the  cocaine\r              \r\n\nsale and  his concomitant  attempt to  portray himself  as having\r\n\ncommitted only a Grade B violation is disingenuous.  The short of\r\n\nthe  matter  is  that the  cocaine  sale  constituted  a Grade  A\r\n\nviolation, carrying with it a suggested  range of 12 to 18 months\r\n\nof   imprisonment   in   the    ensuing   revocation-of-probation\r\n\nproceeding.   See USSG  7B1.4(a).  The sentence that the district\r                           \r\n\ncourt  meted out is within this range and is, therefore, entirely\r\n\nappropriate.1\r\n\n          We  need  go no  further.   For  the  reasons discussed\r\n\nherein, the appellant's sentence is  summarily affirmed.  See 1st\r                                                                       \r\n\nCir. R.27.1.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In his  reply brief, the appellant takes  a different tack.\r\nHe contends that he should have been sentenced based on a Grade B\r\nviolation  because the drug offense that led to the revocation of\r\nprobation   occurred  before  the   district  court  imposed  the\r\nprobationary sentence.  This contention confuses the facts.   The\r\ncourt sentenced the  appellant to  serve a term  of probation  in\r\n1992.  The drug offense transpired almost two years later.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n",

See 18  U.S.C.   3565(b)(1);  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso 18 U.S.C.   3563(a)(3); USSG  7B1.1(a)(1)(ii).  Distributing\r              \r\n\na controlled substance constitutes a controlled substance offense\r\n\nfor this purpose.  See USSG  4B1.2(2).\r                                \r\n\n          Viewed  against this  backdrop,  the  appeal is  easily\r\n\nresolved.     The  New   York  conviction  for   selling  cocaine\r\n\nconstituted  all  that  was  needed  to  revoke  the  appellant's\r\n\nprobation.   See 18  U.S.C.   3565(b)(1);  USSG  7B1.3(a)(1); see\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nalso USSG  4B1.2(2).   The appellant's  glossover of the  cocaine\r              \r\n\nsale and  his concomitant  attempt to  portray himself  as having\r\n\ncommitted only a Grade B violation is disingenuous.  The short of\r\n\nthe  matter  is  that the  cocaine  sale  constituted  a Grade  A\r\n\nviolation, carrying with it a suggested  range of 12 to 18 months\r\n\nof   imprisonment   in   the    ensuing   revocation-of-probation\r\n\nproceeding.   See USSG  7B1.4(a).  The sentence that the district\r                           \r\n\ncourt  meted out is within this range and is, therefore, entirely\r\n\nappropriate.1\r\n\n          We  need  go no  further.   For  the  reasons discussed\r\n\nherein, the appellant's sentence is  summarily affirmed.  See 1st\r                                                                       \r\n\nCir. R.27.1.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In his  reply brief, the appellant takes  a different tack.\r\nHe contends that he should have been sentenced based on a Grade B\r\nviolation  because the drug offense that led to the revocation of\r\nprobation   occurred  before  the   district  court  imposed  the\r\nprobationary sentence.  This contention confuses the facts.   The\r\ncourt sentenced the  appellant to  serve a term  of probation  in\r\n1992.  The drug offense transpired almost two years later.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n</pre>",
