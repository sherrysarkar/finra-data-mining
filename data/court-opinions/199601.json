Plaintiff appeals from a dismissal\n\nof her complaint for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nReviewing the dismissal de novo we agree that plaintiff did\n\nnot allege any basis for federal question jurisdiction, but\n\nappears   to   be   attempting   to   appeal    from    a   state     court\n\njudgment, which she cannot do in federal district court.\n\nHer response to the court's order to show cause also failed\n\nto   offer   any    facts   indicating   that   it     is   not   a   legal\n\ncertainty that her claim involves less than the amount\n\nneeded to sustain jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of\n\ncitizenship.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\f",
