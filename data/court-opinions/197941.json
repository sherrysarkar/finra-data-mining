Holmes, Jr., Russell Turbeville, and\r\nRobert Vernier.\r\nJoseph L. Tehan, Jr., Katharine I. Goree and Kopelman and Paige,\r\nP.C., Town Counsel, on brief for appellees Chief Thomas Neilen and\r\nSgt. Michael Ladrigan.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                         May 7, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Arthur J. Roberts, Jr., a resident of Scituate,\r\nMassachusetts, is under indictment in Harris County, Texas for violation\r\nof the Texas Securities Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581-29.  He\r\nhas been arrested several times on fugitive from justice charges\r\nstemming from the Texas case.  On April 10, 1997, Roberts filed a pro secivil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in the District of\r\nMassachusetts.  The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the\r\nprosecution of the state criminal proceedings.  Upon motion of\r\ndefendants' counsel (at least one of whom had traveled from Texas), the\r\ndistrict court dismissed the case based on Roberts' failure to appear at\r\nthe initial scheduling conference.  This appeal followed.\r\nAlthough dismissal is a harsh sanction, we do not think that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in imposing that sanction here. \r\nSee Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1996) (setting forth\r\nstandard of review).  In a motion for stay filed in the district court,\r\nRoberts explained his failure to appear.  He stated that he was unaware\r\nthat any motions would be heard at the scheduling conference.  This\r\nexcuse is not legitimate.  The only motion heard at the conference was\r\na motion to dismiss, and Roberts was forewarned that a failure to attend\r\ncould result in dismissal.  Moreover, no motion was necessary.  Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 16(f), which incorporates by reference portions of Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 37(b)(2), explicitly permits a district court to impose a sanction of\r\ndismissal on its own initiative.\r\n A dismissal without qualification is presumed to be with prejudice,\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), and the clerk's notes confirm this intention.  If\r\nplaintiff's complaint showed some real substance, we might well direct\r\nthat the dismissal be modified to be a dismissal without prejudice,\r\ntaking into consideration the fact that this was a first violation of a\r\ncourt order, prejudice appears to have been minimal, and Roberts was\r\nacting pro se.  However, we are persuaded that in this case such an\r\nadjustment would be a waste of time.\r\n In particular, we think that his complaint suffers from glaring\r\nweaknesses.  Although none of the parties has raised the issue, a\r\nfederal district court is barred from enjoining an ongoing state\r\ncriminal proceeding, except in extraordinary circumstances.  See Youngerv. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  Roberts' various claims for damages also\r\nsuffer from infirmities.  Without attempting an exhaustive list, we\r\nthink that his allegations are either conclusory, fail to rise to the\r\nlevel of a constitutional violation, fail to state a claim under  1983,\r\nor are likely barred by an immunity defense.\r\n Affirmed.\n",
