Defendant-appellant  Richard\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nCzubinski  (\"Czubinski\")  appeals  his jury  conviction  on  nine\r\n\ncounts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C.    1343, 1346, and four counts of\r\n\ncomputer  fraud,  18 U.S.C.    1030(a)(4).    The wire  fraud and\r\n\ncomputer fraud  prosecution that  led to the  conviction survived\r\n\nserious challenges put forward  by Czubinski in various pre-trial\r\n\nmotions.   Given the broad  scope of the  federal fraud statutes,\r\n\nmotions charging insufficient pleadings or  selective prosecution\r\n\ngenerally deserve careful consideration.   We need not scrutinize\r\n\nthe lower court's rejection of the defendant's arguments in favor\r\n\nof  dismissing the  indictment, however,  because we  reverse the\r\n\nconviction on the clearer ground that the trial evidence mustered\r\n\nby  the government was insufficient  to support a guilty verdict,\r\n\nand  hold that the  defendant's motion for  judgment of acquittal\r\n\nshould have been granted on all counts.  Unauthorized browsing of\r\n\ntaxpayer files, although certainly inappropriate conduct, cannot,\r\n\nwithout more, sustain this federal felony conviction.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\nI.  Pertinent Facts\r          I.  Pertinent Facts\r\n\n          On  an appeal  from a  jury conviction,  we review  the\r\n\nrelevant facts  in the light  most favorable  to the  government.\r\n\nUnited States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 384 (1st Cir. 1985).  The\r                                  \r\n\nevidence  in this case,  so presented,  is inadequate  to support\r\n\nconvictions on either the wire fraud or computer fraud charges.\r\n\n          For all periods relevant to the acts giving rise to his\r\n\nconviction,  the defendant  Czubinski was  employed as  a Contact\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nRepresentative  in the  Boston  office of  the Taxpayer  Services\r\n\nDivision of the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\").  To perform his\r\n\nofficial duties, which  mainly involved answering questions  from\r\n\ntaxpayers regarding their  returns, Czubinski routinely  accessed\r\n\ninformation from one of  the IRS's computer systems known  as the\r\n\nIntegrated  Data  Retrieval  System  (\"IDRS\").    Using  a  valid\r\n\npassword given  to Contact Representatives, certain search codes,\r\n\nand  taxpayer  social security  numbers,  Czubinski  was able  to\r\n\nretrieve, to  his terminal  screen in  Boston, income  tax return\r\n\ninformation regarding virtually any taxpayer  -- information that\r\n\nis  permanently  stored in  the  IDRS  \"master file\"  located  in\r\n\nMartinsburg, West Virginia.  In the period of Czubinski's employ,\r\n\nIRS rules plainly stated that employees with passwords and access\r\n\ncodes were not permitted to  access files on IDRS outside of  the\r\n\ncourse of their official duties.1 \r\n\n          In  1992, Czubinski  carried out  numerous unauthorized\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  In 1987 Czubinski  signed an acknowledgment of receipt  of the\r\nIRS Rules of Conduct, which contained the following rule:\r\n\n            Employees  must  make  every   effort  to\r\n            assure security  and prevent unauthorized\r\n            disclosure of  protected information data\r\n            in the  use of Government owned or leased\r\n            computers.    In addition,  employees may\r\n            not use any  Service computer system  for\r\n            other than official purposes.\r\n\nSee  Government's Exhibit  1.   In  addition, Czubinski  received\r             \r\nseparate rules regarding use of the IDRS, one of which states: \r\n\n            Access  only  those accounts  required to\r\n            accomplish your official duties.\r\n\nSee Government's Exhibit 3.\r             \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nsearches  of IDRS files.   He knowingly disregarded  IRS rules by\r\n\nlooking  at  confidential  information  obtained   by  performing\r\n\ncomputer searches that were outside of the scope of his duties as\r\n\na  Contact Representative,  including,  but not  limited to,  the\r\n\nsearches  listed in the  indictment.2  Audit  trails performed by\r\n\ninternal  IRS auditors  establish that Czubinski  frequently made\r\n\nunauthorized accesses on  IDRS in 1992.   For example,  Czubinski\r\n\naccessed  information   regarding:    the  tax   returns  of  two\r\n\nindividuals involved in the David Duke presidential campaign; the\r\n\njoint  tax return of an assistant district attorney (who had been\r\n\nprosecuting  Czubinski's father on  an unrelated  felony offense)\r\n\nand his  wife;   the  tax  return of  Boston  City Counselor  Jim\r\n\nKelly's Campaign  Committee (Kelly had defeated  Czubinski in the\r\n\nprevious election for the Counselor seat for District 2); the tax\r\n\nreturn  of one of his brothers' instructors; the joint tax return\r\n\nof a Boston Housing Authority police officer, who was involved in\r\n\na community  organization with  one of Czubinski's  brothers, and\r\n\nthe officer's wife; and the  tax return of a woman  Czubinski had\r\n\ndated a few times.  Czubinski  also accessed the files of various\r\n\nother social acquaintances by performing unauthorized searches.  \r\n\n          Nothing  in  the  record indicates  that  Czubinski did\r\n\nanything more than knowingly disregard IRS rules by observing the\r\n\nconfidential information he accessed.   No evidence suggests, nor\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The indictment charged ten  counts of wire fraud for accessing\r\nthe  return  information  of  ten different  entities;  the  four\r\ncomputer fraud counts (counts eleven through fourteen) identified\r\nunauthorized searches  that also  underlay four of  the ten  wire\r\nfraud counts (counts one, two, eight and nine).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndoes  the  government  contend,   that  Czubinski  disclosed  the\r\n\nconfidential information he  accessed to any third  parties.  The\r\n\ngovernment's only  evidence demonstrating  any intent to  use the\r\n\nconfidential  information  for  nefarious  ends  was   the  trial\r\n\ntestimony of William A. Murray, an acquaintance  of Czubinski who\r\n\nbriefly  participated in  Czubinski's local Invisible  Knights of\r\n\nthe Ku Klux Klan (\"KKK\") chapter and worked with him on the David\r\n\nDuke campaign.   Murray testified that Czubinski had  once stated\r\n\nat a social  gathering in \"early  1992\" that \"he intended  to use\r\n\nsome of that information to build dossiers on people\" involved in\r\n\n\"the white  supremacist movement.\"   Trial Transcript, Vol.  2 at\r\n\n170,  188.  There is, however, no evidence that Czubinski created\r\n\ndossiers, took steps  toward making dossiers (such as by printing\r\n\nout  or recording the information  he browsed), or  shared any of\r\n\nthe  information he  accessed in  the years following  the single\r\n\ncomment  to Murray.   No  other witness  testified to  having any\r\n\nknowledge of  Czubinski's alleged intent to  create \"dossiers\" on\r\n\nKKK members.\r\n\n          The  record shows  that Czubinski  did not  perform any\r\n\nunauthorized searches after 1992.  He continued to be employed as\r\n\na  Contact Representative  until  June 1995,  when  a grand  jury\r\n\nreturned  an indictment against him on ten counts of federal wire\r\n\nfraud under 18  U.S.C.    1343, 1346, and  four counts of federal\r\n\ninterest computer fraud under 18 U.S.C.   1030(a)(4).\r\n\n          The  portion  of  the  indictment  alleging wire  fraud\r\n\nstates that Czubinski defrauded  the IRS of confidential property\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nand defrauded the IRS  and the public  of his honest services  by\r\n\nusing  his  valid  password   to  acquire  confidential  taxpayer\r\n\ninformation  as part  of  a scheme  to:  1) build  \"dossiers\"  on\r\n\nassociates in the KKK; 2) seek information regarding an assistant\r\n\ndistrict attorney who was  then prosecuting Czubinski's father on\r\n\nan unrelated criminal charge;  and 3) perform opposition research\r\n\nby inspecting the records of a political opponent in the race for\r\n\na Boston  City  Councilor  seat.    The  wire  fraud  indictment,\r\n\ntherefore,  articulated particular  personal  ends  to which  the\r\n\nunauthorized   access   to   confidential   information   through\r\n\ninterstate wires was allegedly a means.\r\n\n          The  portion  of  the  indictment  setting  forth   the\r\n\ncomputer fraud charges  stated that Czubinski  obtained something\r\n\nof  value, beyond the mere unauthorized use of a federal interest\r\n\ncomputer, by performing certain searches -- searches representing\r\n\na subset of those making up the mail fraud counts.\r\n\nII.  Proceedings Below\r          II.  Proceedings Below\r\n\n          After   indictment  and   arraignment  in   June  1995,\r\n\nCzubinski filed a motion  to dismiss the indictment, a  motion to\r\n\nstrike surplusage from the indictment, and a motion for discovery\r\n\nfrom the government relating to a claim of selective prosecution.\r\n\nIn separate  orders, a  magistrate judge  and the district  court\r\n\nrejected all of these motions.  Specifically,  the district court\r\n\nrejected  Czubinski's argument  that counts  1 through 10  of the\r\n\nindictment must be dismissed  because \"browsing\" does not deprive\r\n\nthe  IRS of any property and because section 1346, the intangible\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nright to honest  services amendment  to the mail  and wire  fraud\r\n\nstatutes, was  unconstitutionally vague  as applied  to him.   In\r\n\nDecember   1995,   Czubinski  filed   motions  in   limine  which\r                                                                    \r\n\nessentially  sought  to  prevent  references  to   certain  white\r\n\nsupremacist activities, such as his membership in  a KKK chapter,\r\n\nduring  trial.  This motion  was also denied,  although the trial\r\n\ncourt  gave a  limiting  instruction regarding  the relevance  of\r\n\nCzubinski's KKK  membership  to  a  finding  of  wire  fraud  and\r\n\ncomputer fraud.\r\n\n          On  December  15,  1995,  the   district  court  denied\r\n\nCzubinski's motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts except\r\n\nfor count 3,3 and on that day the jury returned a verdict finding\r\n\nCzubinski guilty on  all thirteen remaining  counts.  On  appeal,\r\n\nCzubinski challenges  the  denial of  his motion  to dismiss  the\r\n\nindictment, including  the rejection  of a  selective prosecution\r\n\nclaim,   the finding that he had not  made out a prima facie case\r\n\nof  selective prosecution,  the admission  at trial  of allegedly\r\n\ninflammatory   evidence   of   Czubinski's    white   supremacist\r\n\nactivities, the  denial of  his  motion for  acquittal, the  jury\r\n\ninstructions, and the sentencing determination.\r\n\n          We reverse on the ground that the district  court erred\r\n\nin denying Czubinski's motion for acquittal, and therefore bypass\r\n\nCzubinski's other claims.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3    On  count  3,  the  district  court  ruled  that  there  was\r\ninsufficient proof showing that the search alleged in count 3 was\r\nnot requested by the taxpayer whose files were browsed.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          A motion  for judgment of acquittal  under Federal Rule\r\n\nof Criminal Procedure 29 is the proper vehicle for a defendant to\r\n\nmake  a sufficiency challenge.  See 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice\r                                             \r\n\nand Procedure:  Crim. 2d   467 (1982). The denial of a motion for\r\n\njudgment  of acquittal presents a question of law, and our review\r\n\nis de  novo. See United States  v. Staula, 80 F.3d  596, 604 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.   1996).    We  determine  anew  whether  \"the  evidence  is\r\n\nsufficient to sustain a conviction.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\r\n\n          In determining the evidentiary sufficiency  of a guilty\r\n\nverdict,  \"the relevant  question is  whether, after  viewing the\r\n\nevidence  in the  light  most favorable  to the  prosecution, any\r                                                                           \r\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\r\n\nthe crime beyond a  reasonable doubt.\"  Jackson v.  Virginia, 443\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  307, 319 (1979); see  also United States  v. Valle, 72 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n210, 216  (1st Cir.  1995).   The  scope of  review  is over  the\r\n\ntotality of  the evidence,  both direct and  circumstantial:   we\r\n\n\"take  a hard look at  the record\" and  \"reject those evidentiary\r\n\ninterpretations    and    illations   that    are   unreasonable,\r\n\ninsupportable, or overly speculative.\"  United States v. Spinney,\r                                                                          \r\n\n65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\nI.  The Wire Fraud Counts\r          I.  The Wire Fraud Counts\r\n\n          We  turn first  to Czubinski's  conviction on  the nine\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nwire fraud counts.4  To support a conviction for wire fraud,  the\r\n\ngovernment  must prove  two elements  beyond a  reasonable doubt:\r\n\n(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme\r\n\nor artifice to defraud  with the specific intent to  defraud, and\r\n\n(2) the use of interstate  wire communications in furtherance  of\r\n\nthe scheme.  United States v.  Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1996) (citing United States  v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006,  1011 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir.  1993)).    Although  defendant's  motion  for  judgment  of\r\n\nacquittal places emphasis on shortcomings in proof with regard to\r\n\nthe  second element,  by arguing that  the wire  transmissions at\r\n\nissue were not proved to be interstate, we find the first element\r\n\ndispositive and hold that the government failed to prove beyond a\r\n\nreasonable doubt  that the defendant willfully  participated in a\r\n\nscheme  to defraud within the meaning of the wire fraud statute.5\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   The federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C.   1343, provides in\r\npertinent part:\r\n\n            Whoever, having devised  or intending  to\r\n            devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,\r\n            or  for obtaining  money  or property  by\r\n            means of false  or fraudulent  pretenses,\r\n            representations,  or  promises, transmits\r\n            or causes  to be transmitted by  means of\r\n            wire . . . communication in interstate or\r\n            foreign  commerce,  any writings,  signs,\r\n            signals,  pictures,  or  sounds  for  the\r\n            purpose  of  executing  such   scheme  or\r\n            artifice, shall be fined under this title\r\n            or imprisoned  not more than  five years,\r\n            or both. \r\n\n5  We  do not find that it was irrational  for a trier of fact to\r\nconclude  beyond  a  reasonable doubt  that  Czubinski's searches\r\ncaused information from the IDRS master file in Martinsburg, West\r\nVirginia, to  be sent to his terminal  in Boston.  The interstate\r\nelement   could  reasonably   be  inferred   from  circumstantial\r\nevidence.    See,  e.g.,  Testimony of  Edward  Makaskill,  Trial\r                                 \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nThat  is, assuming  the counts  accurately describe  unauthorized\r\n\nsearches   of   taxpayer   returns   through    interstate   wire\r\n\ntransmissions, there is insufficiant  record evidence to permit a\r\n\nrational  jury to conclude that  the wire transmissions were part\r\n\nof a criminal scheme to defraud under sections 1343 and 1346.\r\n\n          The government  pursued two  theories of wire  fraud in\r\n\nthis prosecution:  first, that Czubinski defrauded the IRS of its\r\n\nproperty,  under   section   1343,  by   acquiring   confidential\r\n\ninformation for  certain intended personal uses;  second, that he\r\n\ndefrauded the IRS and the public of their intangible right to his\r\n\nhonest  services, under sections 1343 and 1346.6  We consider the\r\n\nevidence with regard to each theory, in turn.\r\n\nA.  Scheme to Defraud IRS of Property\r          A.  Scheme to Defraud IRS of Property\r\n\n          The  government  correctly   notes  that   confidential\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nTranscript, Vol. 3  at 82 (explaining that  certain command codes\r\nused by Czubinski generally  access information from out-of-state\r\ncomputer).\r\n\n6    The district  court's jury  instructions  on the  wire fraud\r\ncounts repeat both of the scheme to defraud theories:\r\n\n            In  this case, the government has charged\r\n            Mr. Czubinski  with devising a  scheme or\r\n            artifice,  that  is, a  plan,  to do  two\r\n            things:\r\n            (1) to defraud the IRS, the United States\r\n            Government,   and    the   citizens   and\r\n            taxpayers   of   the  United   States  by\r\n            depriving them of their  intangible right\r\n            to   his  honest   services  as   an  IRS\r\n            employee; and\r\n            (2) to defraud the  IRS and to obtain its\r\n            property, that  is, confidential taxpayer\r\n            information,    by    false    pretenses,\r\n            representations and promises.\r\n\nTrial Transcript, Vol. 4 at 76-77.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ninformation  may constitute  intangible \"property\"  and that  its\r\n\nunauthorized dissemination or other use  may deprive the owner of\r\n\nits  property rights.  See  Carpenter v. United  States, 484 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n19, 26  (1987) (\"Confidential business information  has long been\r\n\nrecognized as property. . . .  [A newspaper] had a property right\r\n\nin  keeping  confidential  and  making exclusive  use,  prior  to\r\n\npublication,  of  the  schedule  and contents\"  of  a  particular\r\n\ncolumn.).   Where such deprivation is  effected through dishonest\r\n\nor  deceitful means, a \"scheme to defraud,\" within the meaning of\r\n\nthe  wire fraud  statute, is  shown.   See id.  at  27.   Thus, a\r                                                       \r\n\nnecessary step toward satisfying  the \"scheme to defraud\" element\r\n\nin  this  context  is  showing  that  the  defendant intended  to\r\n\n\"deprive\" another of their protected right.\r\n\n          The government, however, provides no case in support of\r\n\nits   contention   here   that  merely   accessing   confidential\r\n\ninformation, without doing, or clearly intending  to do, more, is\r\n\ntantamount  to a deprivation of IRS property under the wire fraud\r\n\nstatute.  In Carpenter, for example, the confidential information\r                                \r\n\nregarding the contents of a newspaper column was converted to the\r\n\ndefendants's use to  their substantial  benefit.  See  id. at  27\r                                                                   \r\n\n(defendants participated in \"ongoing  scheme to share profit from\r\n\ntrading in anticipation\" of  newspaper column).  We do  not think\r\n\nthat  Czubinski's unauthorized  browsing, even  if done  with the\r\n\nintent  to deceive the IRS  into thinking he  was performing only\r\n\nauthorized  searches,  constitutes  a  \"deprivation\"  within  the\r\n\nmeaning of the federal fraud statutes.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          Binding  precedents,  and   good  sense,  support   the\r\n\nconclusion  that  to  \"deprive\"  a  person  of  their  intangible\r\n\nproperty interest in confidential information under section 1343,\r\n\neither some  articulable  harm  must befall  the  holder  of  the\r\n\ninformation  as a result  of the defendant's  activities, or some\r\n\ngainful  use  must  be  intended  by  the  person  accessing  the\r\n\ninformation,  whether  or  not  this  use is  profitable  in  the\r\n\neconomic sense.7    Here, neither the taking of the IRS' right to\r\n\n\"exclusive use\" of the  confidential information, nor Czubinski's\r\n\ngain from access to the information, can be shown absent evidence\r\n\nof his \"use\"  of the information.   Accordingly, without evidence\r\n\nthat  Czubinski used or intended to  use the taxpayer information\r\n\n(beyond mere browsing),  an intent to  deprive cannot be  proven,\r\n\nand, a fortiori, a scheme to defraud is not shown.\r                         \r\n\n          All  of the cases cited by the government in support of\r\n\ntheir contention that the confidentiality breached by Czubinski's\r\n\nsearch  in itself constitutes  a deprivation of  property in fact\r\n\nsupport our  holding today, for they all involve, at a minimum, a\r\n\nfinding of a further intended use of the confidential information\r\n\naccessed by the defendants.   The government's best support comes\r\n\nfrom  United  States v.  Seidlitz, 589  F.2d  152, 160  (4th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1978),  in which  a former  employee of  a computer  systems firm\r\n\nsecretly accessed its files, but never was shown to have sold  or\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  For  example, had  the government  established that  Czubinski\r\ndisclosed or intended to  disclose taxpayer information, then the\r\ndeprivation or intended deprivation of property rights would have\r\nbeen shown.  \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nused the data he accessed, and was nevertheless convicted of wire\r\n\nfraud.  The affirming  Fourth Circuit held, however, that  a jury\r\n\ncould  have reasonably  found  that, at  the  time the  defendant\r\n\nraided a  competitor's computer  system, he intended  to retrieve\r\n\ninformation that would be helpful for his own start-up, competing\r\n\ncomputer  firm.  In the instant case, Czubinski did indeed access\r\n\nconfidential  information  through  fraudulent  pretenses  --  he\r\n\nappeared to  be performing his  duties when  in fact he  used IRS\r\n\npasswords to perform unauthorized searches.  Nevertheless, it was\r\n\nnot proven that  he intended to deprive the IRS of their property\r\n\ninterest through either disclosure or use of that information.\r\n\n          The resolution  of the instant case  is complex because\r\n\nit  is  well-established that  to be  convicted  of mail  or wire\r\n\nfraud, the defendant need not successfully carry  out an intended\r\n\nscheme to defraud.  See, e.g., United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 1989) (defendant need only participate in a scheme\r\n\nto  defraud with the  intent to achieve  its illicit objectives);\r\n\nSeidlitz, 589 F.2d at 160 (where circumstantial evidence suffices\r                  \r\n\nto  prove intent to accomplish  scheme to defraud,  actual use of\r\n\nconfidential information need not be shown).  The government does\r\n\nnot contend  either that  Czubinski actually created  dossiers or\r\n\nthat   he  accomplished  some  other   end  through  use  of  the\r\n\ninformation.   It need  not do so.   All that  the government was\r\n\nrequired  to  prove  was the  intent  to  follow  through with  a\r                                              \r\n\ndeprivation  of the IRS's property and the use or foreseeable use\r\n\nof interstate  wire transmissions pursuant  to the accomplishment\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nof the scheme  to defraud.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Silvano,\r                                                                          \r\n\n812 F.2d  754, 760  (1st Cir.  1987).  In  the case  at bar,  the\r\n\ngovernment failed to make even this showing.\r\n\n          The  fatal flaw in the government's case is that it has\r\n\nnot  shown beyond a  reasonable doubt that  Czubinski intended to\r\n\ncarry out a scheme to deprive the IRS of its property interest in\r\n\nconfidential information.   Had there been  sufficient proof that\r\n\nCzubinski  intended either  to create  dossiers  for the  sake of\r\n\nadvancing   personal  causes   or  to   disseminate  confidential\r\n\ninformation to third parties, then his actions in searching files\r\n\ncould arguably be said to be a step in furtherance of a scheme to\r\n\ndeprive  the  IRS  of   its  property  interest  in  confidential\r\n\ninformation.   The government's case regarding Czubinski's intent\r\n\nto make  any  use of  the  information he  browsed rests  on  the\r\n\ntestimony  of one witness at trial who stated that Czubinski once\r\n\nremarked at a social gathering that he intended to build dossiers\r\n\non  potential KKK informants.8   We must assume,  on this appeal,\r\n\nthat Czubinski did indeed make such a comment.  Nevertheless, the\r\n\nfact that during  the months  following this remark  -- that  is,\r\n\nduring  the  period  in  which Czubinski  made  his  unauthorized\r\n\nsearches -- he  did not  create dossiers (there  was no  evidence\r\n\nthat he created dossiers either during or after the period of his\r\n\nunauthorized  searches); given the fact that he did not even take\r\n\nsteps toward creating dossiers, such as recording or printing out\r\n\nthe information; given the  fact that no other  person testifying\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  Testimony of William J. Murray. See Background, supra.\r                                                                  \r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nas to Czubinski's involvement  in white supremacist organizations\r\n\nhad  any  knowledge  of  Czubinski's  alleged  intent  to  create\r\n\ndossiers or use confidential information; and given the fact that\r\n\nnot  a  single piece  of  evidence suggests  that  Czubinski ever\r\n\nshared taxpayer  information with others, no  rational jury could\r\n\nhave  found beyond  a reasonable  doubt that, when  Czubinski was\r\n\nbrowsing  taxpayer files,  he was  doing so  in furtherance  of a\r\n\nscheme to use the information he browsed for private purposes, be\r\n\nthey  nefarious or otherwise.  In addition, there was no evidence\r\n\nthat  Czubinski   disclosed,  or  used  to   his  advantage,  any\r\n\ninformation regarding political opponents or regarding the person\r\n\nprosecuting his father.\r\n\n          Mere  browsing of the records  of people about whom one\r\n\nmight have a particular  interest, although reprehensible, is not\r\n\nenough  to sustain a wire  fraud conviction on  a \"deprivation of\r\n\nintangible property\" theory.   Curiosity  on the part  of an  IRS\r\n\nofficer may  lead  to dismissal,  but  curiosity alone  will  not\r\n\nsustain a finding of participation in a felonious criminal scheme\r\n\nto deprive the IRS of its property.\r\n\nB.

First, this  case falls\r\n\noutside  of  the  core   of  honest  services  fraud  precedents.\r\n\nCzubinski  was not bribed  or otherwise influenced  in any public\r\n\ndecision-making capacity.  Nor did he embezzle funds.  He did not\r\n\nreceive, nor  can it  be found that  he intended to  receive, any\r\n\ntangible  benefit.     His  official  duty  was   to  respond  to\r\n\ninformational requests from taxpayers regarding their returns,  a\r\n\nrelatively straightforward  task that  simply does not  raise the\r\n\nspecter  of   secretive,  self-interested   action,  as  does   a\r\n\ndiscretionary,  decision-making  role.    Cf.  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nMcNieve, 536 F.2d  1245, 1251  (8th Cir. 1976)  (finding no  mail\r                 \r\n\nfraud  violation  where  city  employee  accepted  gratuities  in\r\n\nconnection with non-discretionary duty).\r\n\n          Second,  we believe  that  the cautionary  language  of\r\n\nSawyer is  particularly  appropriate  here,  given  the  evidence\r                \r\n\namassed by the defendant at trial indicating that during his span\r\n\nof employment at IRS, he received no indication from his employer\r\n\nthat this workplace violation  -- the performance of unauthorized\r\n\nsearches   --  would   be  punishable   by  anything   more  than\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ndismissal.13  \"To allow every transgression of state governmental\r\n\nobligations to amount to mail  fraud would effectively turn every\r\n\nsuch   violation  into   a   federal  felony;   this  cannot   be\r\n\ncountenanced.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 728.  Here, the  threat is one\r                                \r\n\nof transforming governmental workplace violations  into felonies.\r\n\nWe find no evidence that Congress intended to create what amounts\r\n\nto a draconian personnel  regulation.  We hesitate to  imply such\r\n\nan  unusual result  in the  absence  of the  clearest legislative\r\n\nmandate.\r\n\n          These general considerations, although serious, are not\r\n\nconclusive:  they  raise  doubts  as to  the  propriety  of  this\r\n\nconviction that  can be outweighed  by sufficient  evidence of  a\r\n\nscheme to  defraud.   The third  principle identified in  Sawyer,\r                                                                          \r\n\ninstructing  us as  to  the basic  requirements  of a  scheme  to\r\n\ndefraud  in this  context,  settles any  remaining  doubts.   The\r\n\nconclusive consideration  is that  the government simply  did not\r\n\nprove that Czubinski deprived, or intended to deprive, the public\r\n\nor his  employer of their right to his honest services.  Although\r\n\nhe  clearly  committed   wrongdoing  in  searching   confidential\r\n\ninformation, there is no  suggestion that he failed to  carry out\r\n\nhis official tasks adequately, or intended to do so.\r\n\n          The government alleges that,  in addition to defrauding\r\n\nthe  public of his  honest services, Czubinski  has defrauded the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13  See  Appendices to Czubinski's  Motion to Dismiss  (including\r                 \r\nFebruary 8, 1994 IRS memorandum to employees indicating  that the\r\nprobable   penalty  for  \"unauthorized   accessing\"  of  taxpayer\r\ninformation ranges from \"Reprimand\" to \"Removal\").\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nIRS  as  well.   The  IRS  is  a public  entity,  rendering  this\r\n\ncontention  sufficiently  answered  by  our  holding  above  that\r\n\nCzubinski  did not  defraud  the public  of his  honest services.\r\n\nEven if the IRS were a private employer, however, the pre-McNally\r                                                                           \r\n\nhonest  services  convictions  involving  private  fraud  victims\r\n\nindicate that  there must be a  breach of a fiduciary  duty to an\r\n\nemployer  that involves  self-dealing of  an  order significantly\r\n\nmore  serious  than the  misconduct at  issue  here.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited  States v. Lemire, 720 F.2d 1327, 1332-34 (D.C. Cir. 1983)\r                                  \r\n\n(employee took bribes  and did not  disclose that contractor  was\r\n\novercharging); United States v.  Seigel, 717 F.2d 9, 14  (2d Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1983)   (employees  used   corporate   funds  for   non-corporate\r\n\npurposes);  United States  v.

Once again, the  government has failed  to prove that\r\n\nCzubinski  intended to  use  the IRS  files  he browsed  for  any\r\n\nprivate purposes, and  hence his actions, however  reprehensible,\r\n\ndo not  rise to the level of a  scheme to defraud his employer of\r\n\nhis honest services.\r\n\nII.  The Computer Fraud Counts\r          II.  The Computer Fraud Counts\r\n\n          Czubinski  was convicted  on all  four of  the computer\r\n\nfraud counts on which he was indicted;  these counts arise out of\r\n\nunauthorized searches that also  formed the basis of four  of the\r\n\nten  wire fraud counts in  the indictment.   Specifically, he was\r\n\nconvicted  of  violating  18  U.S.C.    1030(a)(4),  a  provision\r\n\nenacted in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.  Section\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n1030(a)(4) applies to:\r\n\n            whoever .  . . knowingly and  with intent\r\n            to defraud, accesses  a Federal  interest\r\n            computer   without    authorization,   or\r\n            exceeds authorized access,  and by  means\r\n            of  such  conduct  furthers the  intended\r\n            fraud  and  obtains  anything  of  value,\r\n            unless the  object of the  fraud and  the\r\n            thing obtained consists  only of the  use\r\n            of the computer. \r\n\nWe  have never  before addressed  section 1030(a)(4).   Czubinski\r\n\nunquestionably exceeded  authorized access to a  Federal interest\r\n\ncomputer.14  On appeal he argues that he did not obtain \"anything\r\n\nof  value.\"   We  agree, finding  that  his searches  of taxpayer\r\n\nreturn information did not satisfy the statutory requirement that\r\n\nhe  obtain  \"anything of  value.\"   The  value of  information is\r\n\nrelative to one's  needs and objectives; here, the government had\r\n\nto show that the  information was valuable to Czubinski  in light\r\n\nof a fraudulent scheme.  The government failed, however, to prove\r\n\nthat  Czubinski  intended  anything  more than  to  satisfy  idle\r\n\ncuriosity.  \r\n\n          The  plain language  of  section 1030(a)(4)  emphasizes\r\n\nthat more  than mere  unauthorized  use is  required: the  \"thing\r\n\nobtained\"  may not  merely be the  unauthorized use.   It  is the\r\n\nshowing  of some  additional  end --  to  which the  unauthorized\r\n\naccess is a means -- that is  lacking here.  The evidence did not\r\n\nshow that Czubinski's end  was anything more than to  satisfy his\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n14  \"[T]he  term 'exceeds  authorized access' means  to access  a\r\ncomputer with authorization and  to use such access to  obtain or\r\nalter  information  in the  computer  that  the  accesser is  not\r\nentitled so to obtain or alter.\"  18 U.S.C.   1030(e)(6). \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\ncuriosity  by viewing  information about  friends, acquaintances,\r\n\nand  political rivals.  No evidence suggests that he printed out,\r\n\nrecorded, or used the  information he browsed.  No  rational jury\r\n\ncould conclude beyond a  reasonable doubt that Czubinski intended\r\n\nto  use   or  disclose  that  information,   and  merely  viewing\r\n\ninformation cannot be deemed  the same as obtaining something  of\r\n\nvalue for the purposes of this statute.15\r\n\n          The legislative history further supports our reading of\r\n\nthe  term \"anything  of  value.\"    \"In  the  game  of  statutory\r\n\ninterpretation, statutory language  is the ultimate trump  card,\"\r\n\nand the remarks of sponsors of legislation are authoritative only\r\n\nto the extent that they are compatible with the plain language of\r\n\nsection 1030(a)(4).   Rhode Island v.  Narragansett Indian Tribe,\r                                                                          \r\n\n19  F.3d 685, 699  (1st Cir. 1994) (citing  Grove City College v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBell, 465  U.S. 555,  567 (1984)).  Here,  a Senate  co-sponsor's\r              \r\n\ncomments  suggest that  Congress intended  section 1030(a)(4)  to\r\n\npunish  attempts  to steal  valuable data,  and  did not  wish to\r\n\npunish mere unauthorized access: \r\n\n          The  acts  of  fraud  we  are  addressing  in\r\n          proposed  section 1030(a)(4)  are essentially\r\n          thefts  in  which  someone  uses   a  federal\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n15   The  district  court, in  denying a  motion  to dismiss  the\r\ncomputer  fraud   counts  in  the  indictment,   found  that  the\r\nindictment  sufficiently alleged  that the  confidential taxpayer\r\ninformation was itself a \"thing of value\" to Czubinski, given his\r\nends.  The indictment,  of course, alleged specific uses  for the\r\ninformation, such  as creating dossiers on KKK members, that were\r\nnot proven at trial.  In light of the trial evidence -- which, as\r\nwe have said, indicates  that there was no  recording, disclosure\r\nor  further use of the  confidential information --  we find that\r\nCzubinski  did  not  obtain   \"anything  of  value\"  through  his\r\nunauthorized searches.\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          interest computer to wrongly obtain something\r\n          of value from another. . . . Proposed section\r\n          1030(a)(4)   is   intended  to   reflect  the\r\n          distinction between the theft of information,\r\n          a  felony, and  mere  unauthorized access,  a\r\n          misdemeanor.  \r\n\n132 Cong.  Rec. 7128,  7129, 99th Cong.,  2d. Sess. (1986).   The\r\n\nSenate Committee  Report further  underscores the fact  that this\r\n\nsection  should  apply to  those  who  steal information  through\r\n\nunauthorized access as part of an illegal scheme:\r\n\n          The  Committee  remains convinced  that there\r\n          must be a  clear distinction between computer\r\n          theft, punishable as a felony  [under section\r\n          1030(a)(4)],    and    computer     trespass,\r\n          punishable  in   the  first  instance   as  a\r\n          misdemeanor  [under  a different  provision].\r\n          The  element in  the  new  paragraph  (a)(4),\r\n          requiring a showing of an intent to  defraud,\r\n          is meant to preserve  that distinction, as is\r\n          the requirement that the  property wrongfully\r\n          obtained via computer  furthers the  intended\r\n          fraud.\r\n\nS.

For the  same reasons  we deemed  the trial\r\n\nevidence  could not support a finding that Czubinski deprived the\r\n\nIRS of its property,  see discussion of wire fraud  under section\r                                   \r\n\n1343 supra,  we find  that  Czubinski has  not obtained  valuable\r                    \r\n\ninformation  in  furtherance  of  a  fraudulent  scheme  for  the\r\n\npurposes of section 1030(a)(4).\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  add a cautionary note.   The broad  language of the\r\n\nmail  and wire fraud statutes  are both their  blessing and their\r\n\ncurse.  They can address new forms of serious crime  that fail to\r\n\nfall  within more  specific legislation.    See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nMaze,  414 U.S. 395, 405-06 (1974) (observing that the mail fraud\r              \r\n\nstatute serves \"as a  first line of defense\" or  \"stopgap device\"\r\n\nto tackle  new types of frauds  before particularized legislation\r\n\nis developed)  (Burger, C.J.,  dissenting).   On the other  hand,\r\n\nthey  might be used to  prosecute kinds of  behavior that, albeit\r\n\noffensive  to the  morals or  aesthetics of  federal prosecutors,\r\n\ncannot  reasonably  be expected  by the  instigators to  form the\r\n\nbasis of  a federal felony.   The  case at bar  falls within  the\r\n\nlatter  category.    Also   discomforting  is  the  prosecution's\r\n\ninsistence,  before  trial,  on  the  admission  of  inflammatory\r\n\nevidence   regarding   the   defendant's   membership   in  white\r\n\nsupremacist  groups purportedly as a  means to prove  a scheme to\r\n\ndefraud,  when, on appeal, it  argues that unauthorized access in\r\n\nitself is  a  sufficient ground  for  conviction on  all  counts.\r\n\nFinally, we caution that the wire fraud statute must not serve as\r\n\na vehicle for  prosecuting only  those citizens  whose views  run\r\n\nagainst the  tide, no  matter how incorrect  or uncivilized  such\r\n\nviews are.\r\n\n          For  the reasons  stated in this  opinion, we  hold the\r\n\ndistrict  court's denial  of defendant's  motion for  judgment of\r\n\nacquittal on counts 1, 2,  and 4 through 14, to be in error.  The\r\n\ndefendant's conviction is thus reversed on all counts.\r                                         reversed\r                                                 \r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n",

The wire fraud and computer fraud prosecution that led to the conviction survived serious challenges put forward by Czubinski in various pre-trial motions.  Given the broad scope of the federal fraud statutes, motions charging insufficient pleadings or selective prosecution generally deserve careful consideration.  We need not scrutinize the lower court's rejection of the defendant's arguments in favor of dismissing the indictment, however, because we reverse the conviction on the clearer ground that the trial evidence mustered by the government was insufficient to support a guilty verdict, and hold that the defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted on all counts.

To perform his official duties, which mainly involved answering questions from taxpayers regarding their returns, Czubinski routinely accessed information from one of the IRS's computer systems known as the Integrated Data Retrieval System (\"IDRS\").  Using a valid password given to Contact Representatives, certain search codes, and taxpayer social security numbers, Czubinski was able to retrieve, to his terminal screen in Boston, income tax return information regarding virtually any taxpayer--information that is permanently stored in the IDRS \"master file\" located in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  In the period of Czubinski's employ, IRS rules plainly stated that employees with passwords and access codes were not permitted to access files on IDRS outside of the course of their official duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Czubinski carried out numerous unauthorized searches of IDRS files.  He knowingly disregarded IRS rules by looking at confidential information obtained by performing computer searches that were outside of the scope of his duties as a Contact Representative, including, but not limited to, the searches listed in the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Audit trails performed by internal IRS auditors establish that Czubinski frequently made unauthorized accesses on IDRS in 1992.  For example, Czubinski accessed information regarding:  the tax returns of two individuals involved in the David Duke presidential campaign;  the joint tax return of an assistant district attorney (who had been prosecuting Czubinski's father on an unrelated felony offense) and his wife;  the tax return of Boston City Counselor Jim Kelly's Campaign Committee (Kelly had defeated Czubinski in the previous election for the Counselor seat for District 2);  the tax return of one of his brothers' instructors;  the joint tax return of a Boston Housing Authority police officer, who was involved in a community organization with one of Czubinski's brothers, and the officer's wife;  and the tax return of a woman Czubinski had dated a few times.  Czubinski also accessed the files of various other social acquaintances by performing unauthorized searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record indicates that Czubinski did anything more than knowingly disregard IRS rules by observing the confidential information he accessed.  No evidence suggests, nor does the government contend, that Czubinski disclosed the confidential information he accessed to any third parties.  The government's only evidence demonstrating any intent to use the confidential information for nefarious ends was the trial testimony of William A. Murray, an acquaintance of Czubinski who briefly participated in Czubinski's local Invisible Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (\"KKK\") chapter and worked with him on the David Duke campaign.  Murray testified that Czubinski had once stated at a social gathering in \"early 1992\" that \"he intended to use some of that information to build dossiers on people\" involved in \"the white supremacist movement.\"   Trial Transcript, Vol. 2 at 170, 188.  There is, however, no evidence that Czubinski created dossiers, took steps toward making dossiers (such as by printing out or recording the information he browsed), or shared any of the information he accessed in the years following the single comment to Murray.  No other witness testified to having any knowledge of Czubinski's alleged intent to create \"dossiers\" on KKK members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that Czubinski did not perform any unauthorized searches after 1992.  He continued to be employed as a Contact Representative until June 1995, when a grand jury returned an indictment against him on ten counts of federal wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1343, 1346, and four counts of federal interest computer fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The portion of the indictment alleging wire fraud states that Czubinski defrauded the IRS of confidential property and defrauded the IRS and the public of his honest services by using his valid password to acquire confidential taxpayer information as part of a scheme to:  1) build \"dossiers\" on associates in the KKK;  2) seek information regarding an assistant district attorney who was then prosecuting Czubinski's father on an unrelated criminal charge;  and 3) perform opposition research by inspecting the records of a political opponent in the race for a Boston City Councilor seat.  The wire fraud indictment, therefore, articulated particular personal ends to which the unauthorized access to confidential information through interstate wires was allegedly a means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The portion of the indictment setting forth the computer fraud charges stated that Czubinski obtained something of value, beyond the mere unauthorized use of a federal interest computer, by performing certain searches--searches representing a subset of those making up the mail fraud counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After indictment and arraignment in June 1995, Czubinski filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, a motion to strike surplusage from the indictment, and a motion for discovery from the government relating to a claim of selective prosecution.  In separate orders, a magistrate judge and the district court rejected all of these motions.  Specifically, the district court rejected Czubinski's argument that counts 1 through 10 of the indictment must be dismissed because \"browsing\" does not deprive the IRS of any property and because section 1346, the intangible right to honest services amendment to the mail and wire fraud statutes, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.  In December 1995, Czubinski filed motions in limine which essentially sought to prevent references to certain white supremacist activities, such as his membership in a KKK chapter, during trial.  This motion was also denied, although the trial court gave a limiting instruction regarding the relevance of Czubinski's KKK membership to a finding of wire fraud and computer fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 1995, the district court denied Czubinski's motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts except for count 3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and on that day the jury returned a verdict finding Czubinski guilty on all thirteen remaining counts.  On appeal, Czubinski challenges the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, including the rejection of a selective prosecution claim, the finding that he had not made out a prima facie case of selective prosecution, the admission at trial of allegedly inflammatory evidence of Czubinski's white supremacist activities, the denial of his motion for acquittal, the jury instructions, and the sentencing determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse on the ground that the district court erred in denying Czubinski's motion for acquittal, and therefore bypass Czubinski's other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 is the proper vehicle for a defendant to make a sufficiency challenge.  See 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Crim.2d &#167; 467 (1982).  The denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal presents a question of law, and our review is de novo.  See United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 604 (1st Cir.1996).  We determine anew whether \"the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty verdict, \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979);  see also United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.1995).  The scope of review is over the totality of the evidence, both direct and circumstantial:  we \"take a hard look at the record\" and \"reject those evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable, insupportable, or overly speculative.\"  United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. The Wire Fraud Counts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to Czubinski's conviction on the nine wire fraud counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  To support a conviction for wire fraud, the government must prove two elements beyond a reasonable doubt:  (1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.  United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1011 (1st Cir.1993)).  Although defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal places emphasis on shortcomings in proof with regard to the second element, by arguing that the wire transmissions at issue were not proved to be interstate, we find the first element dispositive and hold that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant willfully participated in a scheme to defraud within the meaning of the wire fraud statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  That is, assuming the counts accurately describe unauthorized searches of taxpayer returns through interstate wire transmissions, there is insufficient record evidence to permit a rational jury to conclude that the wire transmissions were part of a criminal scheme to defraud under sections 1343 and 1346.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government pursued two theories of wire fraud in this prosecution:  first, that Czubinski defrauded the IRS of its property, under section 1343, by acquiring confidential information for certain intended personal uses;  second, that he defrauded the IRS and the public of their intangible right to his honest services, under sections 1343 and 1346.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We consider the evidence with regard to each theory, in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Scheme to Defraud IRS of Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government correctly notes that confidential information may constitute intangible \"property\" and that its unauthorized dissemination or other use may deprive the owner of its property rights.  See Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 26, 108 S.Ct. 316, 320, 98 L.Ed.2d 275 (1987) (\"Confidential business information has long been recognized as property....  [A newspaper] had a property right in keeping confidential and making exclusive use, prior to publication, of the schedule and contents\" of a particular column.).  Where such deprivation is effected through dishonest or deceitful means, a \"scheme to defraud,\" within the meaning of the wire fraud statute, is shown.  See id. at 27, 108 S.Ct. at 321.   Thus, a necessary step toward satisfying the \"scheme to defraud\" element in this context is showing that the defendant intended to \"deprive\" another of their protected right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, provides no case in support of its contention here that merely accessing confidential information, without doing, or clearly intending to do, more, is tantamount to a deprivation of IRS property under the wire fraud statute.  In Carpenter, for example, the confidential information regarding the contents of a newspaper column was converted to the defendants's use to their substantial benefit.  See id. at 27, 108 S.Ct. at 321 (defendants participated in \"ongoing scheme to share profit from trading in anticipation\" of newspaper column).  We do not think that Czubinski's unauthorized browsing, even if done with the intent to deceive the IRS into thinking he was performing only authorized searches, constitutes a \"deprivation\" within the meaning of the federal fraud statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Binding precedents, and good sense, support the conclusion that to \"deprive\" a person of their intangible property interest in confidential information under section 1343, either some articulable harm must befall the holder of the information as a result of the defendant's activities, or some gainful use must be intended by the person accessing the information, whether or not this use is profitable in the economic sense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Here, neither the taking of the IRS' right to \"exclusive use\" of the confidential information, nor Czubinski's gain from access to the information, can be shown absent evidence of his \"use\" of the information.  Accordingly, without evidence that Czubinski used or intended to use the taxpayer information (beyond mere browsing), an intent to deprive cannot be proven, and, a fortiori, a scheme to defraud is not shown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the cases cited by the government in support of their contention that the confidentiality breached by Czubinski's search in itself constitutes a deprivation of property in fact support our holding today, for they all involve, at a minimum, a finding of a further intended use of the confidential information accessed by the defendants.  The government's best support comes from United States v. Seidlitz, 589 F.2d 152, 160 (4th Cir.1978), in which a former employee of a computer systems firm secretly accessed its files, but never was shown to have sold or used the data he accessed, and was nevertheless convicted of wire fraud.  The affirming Fourth Circuit held, however, that a jury could have reasonably found that, at the time the defendant raided a competitor's computer system, he intended to retrieve information that would be helpful for his own start-up, competing computer firm.  In the instant case, Czubinski did indeed access confidential information through fraudulent pretenses--he appeared to be performing his duties when in fact he used IRS passwords to perform unauthorized searches.  Nevertheless, it was not proven that he intended to deprive the IRS of their property interest through either disclosure or use of that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resolution of the instant case is complex because it is well-established that to be convicted of mail or wire fraud, the defendant need not successfully carry out an intended scheme to defraud.  See, e.g., United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1989) (defendant need only participate in a scheme to defraud with the intent to achieve its illicit objectives);  Seidlitz, 589 F.2d at 160 (where circumstantial evidence suffices to prove intent to accomplish scheme to defraud, actual use of confidential information need not be shown).  The government does not contend either that Czubinski actually created dossiers or that he accomplished some other end through use of the information.  It need not do so.  All that the government was required to prove was the intent to follow through with a deprivation of the IRS's property and the use or foreseeable use of interstate wire transmissions pursuant to the accomplishment of the scheme to defraud.  See, e.g., United States v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 760 (1st Cir.1987).  In the case at bar, the government failed to make even this showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal flaw in the government's case is that it has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that Czubinski intended to carry out a scheme to deprive the IRS of its property interest in confidential information.  Had there been sufficient proof that Czubinski intended either to create dossiers for the sake of advancing personal causes or to disseminate confidential information to third parties, then his actions in searching files could arguably be said to be a step in furtherance of a scheme to deprive the IRS of its property interest in confidential information.  The government's case regarding Czubinski's intent to make any use of the information he browsed rests on the testimony of one witness at trial who stated that Czubinski once remarked at a social gathering that he intended to build dossiers on potential KKK informants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We must assume, on this appeal, that Czubinski did indeed make such a comment.  Nevertheless, the fact that during the months following this remark--that is, during the period in which Czubinski made his unauthorized searches--he did not create dossiers (there was no evidence that he created dossiers either during or after the period of his unauthorized searches);  given the fact that he did not even take steps toward creating dossiers, such as recording or printing out the information;  given the fact that no other person testifying as to Czubinski's involvement in white supremacist organizations had any knowledge of Czubinski's alleged intent to create dossiers or use confidential information;  and given the fact that not a single piece of evidence suggests that Czubinski ever shared taxpayer information with others, no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that, when Czubinski was browsing taxpayer files, he was doing so in furtherance of a scheme to use the information he browsed for private purposes, be they nefarious or otherwise.  In addition, there was no evidence that Czubinski disclosed, or used to his advantage, any information regarding political opponents or regarding the person prosecuting his father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mere browsing of the records of people about whom one might have a particular interest, although reprehensible, is not enough to sustain a wire fraud conviction on a \"deprivation of intangible property\" theory.  Curiosity on the part of an IRS officer may lead to dismissal, but curiosity alone will not sustain a finding of participation in a felonious criminal scheme to deprive the IRS of its property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Honest Services Fraud (Section 1346)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), the Supreme Court held that the mail and wire fraud statutes do not prohibit schemes to defraud individuals of their intangible, nonproperty right to honest government services.  Id. at 359-60, 107 S.Ct. at 2881-82.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Congress responded to McNally in 1988 by enacting section 1346, the honest services amendment, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346 (effective Nov. 11, 1988).  We have held, after considering the relevant legislative history, that section 1346 effectively restores to the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> their pre-McNally applications to government officials' schemes to defraud individuals of their intangible right to honest services.  See Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 566 (collecting cases).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently had the opportunity to discuss, at some length, the proper application of the section 1346 honest services amendment to the wrongful acts of public officials.  See Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 722-26.   The discussion and holding in Sawyer directly guide our disposition of the instant appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  First, as a general matter, we noted in Sawyer that although the right to honest services \"eludes easy definition,\" honest services convictions of public officials typically involve serious corruption, such as embezzlement of public funds, bribery of public officials, or the failure of public decision-makers to disclose certain conflicts of interest.  Id. at 724.   Second, we cautioned that \"[t]he broad scope of the mail fraud statute, however, does not encompass every instance of official misconduct that results in the official's personal gain.\"  Id. at 725.   Third, and most importantly, Sawyer holds that the government must not merely indicate wrongdoing by a public official, but must also demonstrate that the wrongdoing at issue is intended to prevent or call into question the proper or impartial performance of that public servant's official duties.  Id. at 725 (citing pre-McNally precedent to demonstrate that even where public officials violated state laws, their actions were not found to defraud citizens of their right to honest services, because the officials did not actually fail to perform their official duties properly).  In other words, \"although a public official might engage in reprehensible misconduct related to an official position, the conviction of that official cannot stand where the conduct does not actually deprive the public of its right to her honest services, and it is not shown to intend that result.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles to Czubinski's acts, it is clear that his conviction cannot stand.  First, this case falls outside of the core of honest services fraud precedents.  Czubinski was not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity.  Nor did he embezzle funds.  He did not receive, nor can it be found that he intended to receive, any tangible benefit.  His official duty was to respond to informational requests from taxpayers regarding their returns, a relatively straightforward task that simply does not raise the specter of secretive, self-interested action, as does a discretionary, decision-making role.  Cf. United States v. McNeive, 536 F.2d 1245, 1251 (8th Cir.1976) (finding no mail fraud violation where city employee accepted gratuities in connection with non-discretionary duty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we believe that the cautionary language of Sawyer is particularly appropriate here, given the evidence amassed by the defendant at trial indicating that during his span of employment at IRS, he received no indication from his employer that this workplace violation--the performance of unauthorized searches--would be punishable by anything more than dismissal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  \"To allow every transgression of state governmental obligations to amount to mail fraud would effectively turn every such violation into a federal felony;  this cannot be countenanced.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 728.   Here, the threat is one of transforming governmental workplace violations into felonies.  We find no evidence that Congress intended to create what amounts to a draconian personnel regulation.  We hesitate to imply such an unusual result in the absence of the clearest legislative mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These general considerations, although serious, are not conclusive:  they raise doubts as to the propriety of this conviction that can be outweighed by sufficient evidence of a scheme to defraud.  The third principle identified in Sawyer, instructing us as to the basic requirements of a scheme to defraud in this context, settles any remaining doubts.  The conclusive consideration is that the government simply did not prove that Czubinski deprived, or intended to deprive, the public or his employer of their right to his honest services.  Although he clearly committed wrongdoing in searching confidential information, there is no suggestion that he failed to carry out his official tasks adequately, or intended to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government alleges that, in addition to defrauding the public of his honest services, Czubinski has defrauded the IRS as well.  The IRS is a public entity, rendering this contention sufficiently answered by our holding above that Czubinski did not defraud the public of his honest services.  Even if the IRS were a private employer, however, the pre-McNally honest services convictions involving private fraud victims indicate that there must be a breach of a fiduciary duty to an employer that involves self-dealing of an order significantly more serious than the misconduct at issue here.  See, e.g., United States v. Lemire, 720 F.2d 1327, 1332-34 (D.C.Cir.1983) (employee took bribes and did not disclose that contractor was overcharging);  United States v. Siegel, 717 F.2d 9, 14 (2d Cir.1983) (employees used corporate funds for non-corporate purposes);  United States v. Boffa, 688 F.2d 919, 931 (3d Cir.1982) (union official bribed into accepting lower wages for union members).  Once again, the government has failed to prove that Czubinski intended to use the IRS files he browsed for any private purposes, and hence his actions, however reprehensible, do not rise to the level of a scheme to defraud his employer of his honest services.II. The Computer Fraud Counts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Czubinski was convicted on all four of the computer fraud counts on which he was indicted;  these counts arise out of unauthorized searches that also formed the basis of four of the ten wire fraud counts in the indictment.  Specifically, he was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(4), a provision enacted in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.  Section 1030(a)(4) applies to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>whoever ... knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a Federal interest computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have never before addressed section 1030(a)(4).  Czubinski unquestionably exceeded authorized access to a Federal interest computer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  On appeal he argues that he did not obtain \"anything of value.\"   We agree, finding that his searches of taxpayer return information did not satisfy the statutory requirement that he obtain \"anything of value.\"   The value of information is relative to one's needs and objectives;  here, the government had to show that the information was valuable to Czubinski in light of a fraudulent scheme.  The government failed, however, to prove that Czubinski intended anything more than to satisfy idle curiosity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of section 1030(a)(4) emphasizes that more than mere unauthorized use is required:  the \"thing obtained\" may not merely be the unauthorized use.  It is the showing of some additional end--to which the unauthorized access is a means--that is lacking here.  The evidence did not show that Czubinski's end was anything more than to satisfy his curiosity by viewing information about friends, acquaintances, and political rivals.  No evidence suggests that he printed out, recorded, or used the information he browsed.  No rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Czubinski intended to use or disclose that information, and merely viewing information cannot be deemed the same as obtaining something of value for the purposes of this statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history further supports our reading of the term \"anything of value.\"  \"In the game of statutory interpretation, statutory language is the ultimate trump card,\" and the remarks of sponsors of legislation are authoritative only to the extent that they are compatible with the plain language of section 1030(a)(4).

The broad language of the mail and wire fraud statutes are both their blessing and their curse.  They can address new forms of serious crime that fail to fall within more specific legislation.  See United States v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395, 405-06, 94 S.Ct. 645, 651, 38 L.Ed.2d 603 (1974) (observing that the mail fraud statute serves \"as a first line of defense\" or \"stopgap device\" to tackle new types of frauds before particularized legislation is developed) (Burger, C.J., dissenting).  On the other hand, they might be used to prosecute kinds of behavior that, albeit offensive to the morals or aesthetics of federal prosecutors, cannot reasonably be expected by the instigators to form the basis of a federal felony.  The case at bar falls within the latter category.  Also discomforting is the prosecution's insistence, before trial, on the admission of inflammatory evidence regarding the defendant's membership in white supremacist groups purportedly as a means to prove a scheme to defraud, when, on appeal, it argues that unauthorized access in itself is a sufficient ground for conviction on all counts.  Finally, we caution that the wire fraud statute must not serve as a vehicle for prosecuting only those citizens whose views run against the tide, no matter how incorrect or uncivilized such views are.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold the district court's denial of defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 1, 2, and 4 through 14, to be in error.

The wire fraud and computer fraud prosecution that led to the conviction survived serious challenges put forward by Czubinski in various pre-trial motions.  Given the broad scope of the federal fraud statutes, motions charging insufficient pleadings or selective prosecution generally deserve careful consideration.  We need not scrutinize the lower court's rejection of the defendant's arguments in favor of dismissing the indictment, however, because we reverse the conviction on the clearer ground that the trial evidence mustered by the government was insufficient to support a guilty verdict, and hold that the defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted on all counts.  Unauthorized browsing of taxpayer files, although certainly inappropriate conduct, cannot, without more, sustain this federal felony conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p>I. Pertinent Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal from a jury conviction, we review the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the government.  United States v. Tierney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451517\"><a href=\"/opinion/451517/united-states-v-robert-f-tierney/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 384 (1st Cir.1985).  The evidence in this case, so presented, is inadequate to support convictions on either the wire fraud or computer fraud charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all periods relevant to the acts giving rise to his conviction, the defendant Czubinski was employed as a Contact Representative in the Boston office of the Taxpayer Services Division of the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\").  To perform his official duties, which mainly involved answering questions from taxpayers regarding their returns, Czubinski routinely accessed information from one of the IRS's computer systems known as the Integrated Data Retrieval System (\"IDRS\").  Using a valid password given to Contact Representatives, certain search codes, and taxpayer social security numbers, Czubinski was able to retrieve, to his terminal screen in Boston, income tax return information regarding virtually any taxpayer--information that is permanently stored in the IDRS \"master file\" located in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  In the period of Czubinski's employ, IRS rules plainly stated that employees with passwords and access codes were not permitted to access files on IDRS outside of the course of their official duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Czubinski carried out numerous unauthorized searches of IDRS files.  He knowingly disregarded IRS rules by looking at confidential information obtained by performing computer searches that were outside of the scope of his duties as a Contact Representative, including, but not limited to, the searches listed in the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Audit trails performed by internal IRS auditors establish that Czubinski frequently made unauthorized accesses on IDRS in 1992.  For example, Czubinski accessed information regarding:  the tax returns of two individuals involved in the David Duke presidential campaign;  the joint tax return of an assistant district attorney (who had been prosecuting Czubinski's father on an unrelated felony offense) and his wife;  the tax return of Boston City Counselor Jim Kelly's Campaign Committee (Kelly had defeated Czubinski in the previous election for the Counselor seat for District 2);  the tax return of one of his brothers' instructors;  the joint tax return of a Boston Housing Authority police officer, who was involved in a community organization with one of Czubinski's brothers, and the officer's wife;  and the tax return of a woman Czubinski had dated a few times.  Czubinski also accessed the files of various other social acquaintances by performing unauthorized searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record indicates that Czubinski did anything more than knowingly disregard IRS rules by observing the confidential information he accessed.  No evidence suggests, nor does the government contend, that Czubinski disclosed the confidential information he accessed to any third parties.  The government's only evidence demonstrating any intent to use the confidential information for nefarious ends was the trial testimony of William A. Murray, an acquaintance of Czubinski who briefly participated in Czubinski's local Invisible Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (\"KKK\") chapter and worked with him on the David Duke campaign.  Murray testified that Czubinski had once stated at a social gathering in \"early 1992\" that \"he intended to use some of that information to build dossiers on people\" involved in \"the white supremacist movement.\"   Trial Transcript, Vol. 2 at 170, 188.  There is, however, no evidence that Czubinski created dossiers, took steps toward making dossiers (such as by printing out or recording the information he browsed), or shared any of the information he accessed in the years following the single comment to Murray.  No other witness testified to having any knowledge of Czubinski's alleged intent to create \"dossiers\" on KKK members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that Czubinski did not perform any unauthorized searches after 1992.  He continued to be employed as a Contact Representative until June 1995, when a grand jury returned an indictment against him on ten counts of federal wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1343, 1346, and four counts of federal interest computer fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The portion of the indictment alleging wire fraud states that Czubinski defrauded the IRS of confidential property and defrauded the IRS and the public of his honest services by using his valid password to acquire confidential taxpayer information as part of a scheme to:  1) build \"dossiers\" on associates in the KKK;  2) seek information regarding an assistant district attorney who was then prosecuting Czubinski's father on an unrelated criminal charge;  and 3) perform opposition research by inspecting the records of a political opponent in the race for a Boston City Councilor seat.  The wire fraud indictment, therefore, articulated particular personal ends to which the unauthorized access to confidential information through interstate wires was allegedly a means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The portion of the indictment setting forth the computer fraud charges stated that Czubinski obtained something of value, beyond the mere unauthorized use of a federal interest computer, by performing certain searches--searches representing a subset of those making up the mail fraud counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After indictment and arraignment in June 1995, Czubinski filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, a motion to strike surplusage from the indictment, and a motion for discovery from the government relating to a claim of selective prosecution.  In separate orders, a magistrate judge and the district court rejected all of these motions.  Specifically, the district court rejected Czubinski's argument that counts 1 through 10 of the indictment must be dismissed because \"browsing\" does not deprive the IRS of any property and because section 1346, the intangible right to honest services amendment to the mail and wire fraud statutes, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.  In December 1995, Czubinski filed motions in limine which essentially sought to prevent references to certain white supremacist activities, such as his membership in a KKK chapter, during trial.  This motion was also denied, although the trial court gave a limiting instruction regarding the relevance of Czubinski's KKK membership to a finding of wire fraud and computer fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 1995, the district court denied Czubinski's motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts except for count 3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and on that day the jury returned a verdict finding Czubinski guilty on all thirteen remaining counts.  On appeal, Czubinski challenges the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, including the rejection of a selective prosecution claim, the finding that he had not made out a prima facie case of selective prosecution, the admission at trial of allegedly inflammatory evidence of Czubinski's white supremacist activities, the denial of his motion for acquittal, the jury instructions, and the sentencing determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse on the ground that the district court erred in denying Czubinski's motion for acquittal, and therefore bypass Czubinski's other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 is the proper vehicle for a defendant to make a sufficiency challenge.

Sawyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196785\"><a href=\"/opinion/196785/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 723 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. Cassiere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194928\"><a href=\"/opinion/194928/united-states-v-cassiere/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1011 (1st Cir.1993)).  Although defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal places emphasis on shortcomings in proof with regard to the second element, by arguing that the wire transmissions at issue were not proved to be interstate, we find the first element dispositive and hold that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant willfully participated in a scheme to defraud within the meaning of the wire fraud statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  That is, assuming the counts accurately describe unauthorized searches of taxpayer returns through interstate wire transmissions, there is insufficient record evidence to permit a rational jury to conclude that the wire transmissions were part of a criminal scheme to defraud under sections 1343 and 1346.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government pursued two theories of wire fraud in this prosecution:  first, that Czubinski defrauded the IRS of its property, under section 1343, by acquiring confidential information for certain intended personal uses;  second, that he defrauded the IRS and the public of their intangible right to his honest services, under sections 1343 and 1346.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We consider the evidence with regard to each theory, in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Scheme to Defraud IRS of Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government correctly notes that confidential information may constitute intangible \"property\" and that its unauthorized dissemination or other use may deprive the owner of its property rights.  See Carpenter v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111964\"><a href=\"/opinion/111964/carpenter-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111964\"><a href=\"/opinion/111964/carpenter-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span> (1987) (\"Confidential business information has long been recognized as property....  [A newspaper] had a property right in keeping confidential and making exclusive use, prior to publication, of the schedule and contents\" of a particular column.).  Where such deprivation is effected through dishonest or deceitful means, a \"scheme to defraud,\" within the meaning of the wire fraud statute, is shown.  See id. at 27, 108 S.Ct. at 321.   Thus, a necessary step toward satisfying the \"scheme to defraud\" element in this context is showing that the defendant intended to \"deprive\" another of their protected right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, provides no case in support of its contention here that merely accessing confidential information, without doing, or clearly intending to do, more, is tantamount to a deprivation of IRS property under the wire fraud statute.  In Carpenter, for example, the confidential information regarding the contents of a newspaper column was converted to the defendants's use to their substantial benefit.  See id. at 27, 108 S.Ct. at 321 (defendants participated in \"ongoing scheme to share profit from trading in anticipation\" of newspaper column).  We do not think that Czubinski's unauthorized browsing, even if done with the intent to deceive the IRS into thinking he was performing only authorized searches, constitutes a \"deprivation\" within the meaning of the federal fraud statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Binding precedents, and good sense, support the conclusion that to \"deprive\" a person of their intangible property interest in confidential information under section 1343, either some articulable harm must befall the holder of the information as a result of the defendant's activities, or some gainful use must be intended by the person accessing the information, whether or not this use is profitable in the economic sense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Here, neither the taking of the IRS' right to \"exclusive use\" of the confidential information, nor Czubinski's gain from access to the information, can be shown absent evidence of his \"use\" of the information.  Accordingly, without evidence that Czubinski used or intended to use the taxpayer information (beyond mere browsing), an intent to deprive cannot be proven, and, a fortiori, a scheme to defraud is not shown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the cases cited by the government in support of their contention that the confidentiality breached by Czubinski's search in itself constitutes a deprivation of property in fact support our holding today, for they all involve, at a minimum, a finding of a further intended use of the confidential information accessed by the defendants.  The government's best support comes from United States v. Seidlitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362217\"><a href=\"/opinion/362217/united-states-v-bertram-e-seidlitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 160 (4th Cir.1978), in which a former employee of a computer systems firm secretly accessed its files, but never was shown to have sold or used the data he accessed, and was nevertheless convicted of wire fraud.  The affirming Fourth Circuit held, however, that a jury could have reasonably found that, at the time the defendant raided a competitor's computer system, he intended to retrieve information that would be helpful for his own start-up, competing computer firm.  In the instant case, Czubinski did indeed access confidential information through fraudulent pretenses--he appeared to be performing his duties when in fact he used IRS passwords to perform unauthorized searches.  Nevertheless, it was not proven that he intended to deprive the IRS of their property interest through either disclosure or use of that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resolution of the instant case is complex because it is well-established that to be convicted of mail or wire fraud, the defendant need not successfully carry out an intended scheme to defraud.  See, e.g., United States v. Serrano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519968\"><a href=\"/opinion/519968/united-states-v-miguel-a-serrano-dba-ponce-developers-inc-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1989) (defendant need only participate in a scheme to defraud with the intent to achieve its illicit objectives);  Seidlitz, 589 F.2d at 160 (where circumstantial evidence suffices to prove intent to accomplish scheme to defraud, actual use of confidential information need not be shown).  The government does not contend either that Czubinski actually created dossiers or that he accomplished some other end through use of the information.  It need not do so.  All that the government was required to prove was the intent to follow through with a deprivation of the IRS's property and the use or foreseeable use of interstate wire transmissions pursuant to the accomplishment of the scheme to defraud.  See, e.g., United States v. Silvano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483811\"><a href=\"/opinion/483811/united-states-v-joseph-silvano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 760 (1st Cir.1987).  In the case at bar, the government failed to make even this showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal flaw in the government's case is that it has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that Czubinski intended to carry out a scheme to deprive the IRS of its property interest in confidential information.  Had there been sufficient proof that Czubinski intended either to create dossiers for the sake of advancing personal causes or to disseminate confidential information to third parties, then his actions in searching files could arguably be said to be a step in furtherance of a scheme to deprive the IRS of its property interest in confidential information.  The government's case regarding Czubinski's intent to make any use of the information he browsed rests on the testimony of one witness at trial who stated that Czubinski once remarked at a social gathering that he intended to build dossiers on potential KKK informants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We must assume, on this appeal, that Czubinski did indeed make such a comment.  Nevertheless, the fact that during the months following this remark--that is, during the period in which Czubinski made his unauthorized searches--he did not create dossiers (there was no evidence that he created dossiers either during or after the period of his unauthorized searches);  given the fact that he did not even take steps toward creating dossiers, such as recording or printing out the information;  given the fact that no other person testifying as to Czubinski's involvement in white supremacist organizations had any knowledge of Czubinski's alleged intent to create dossiers or use confidential information;  and given the fact that not a single piece of evidence suggests that Czubinski ever shared taxpayer information with others, no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that, when Czubinski was browsing taxpayer files, he was doing so in furtherance of a scheme to use the information he browsed for private purposes, be they nefarious or otherwise.  In addition, there was no evidence that Czubinski disclosed, or used to his advantage, any information regarding political opponents or regarding the person prosecuting his father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mere browsing of the records of people about whom one might have a particular interest, although reprehensible, is not enough to sustain a wire fraud conviction on a \"deprivation of intangible property\" theory.  Curiosity on the part of an IRS officer may lead to dismissal, but curiosity alone will not sustain a finding of participation in a felonious criminal scheme to deprive the IRS of its property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Honest Services Fraud (Section 1346)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In McNally v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111945\"><a href=\"/opinion/111945/mcnally-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111945\"><a href=\"/opinion/111945/mcnally-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span> (1987), the Supreme Court held that the mail and wire fraud statutes do not prohibit schemes to defraud individuals of their intangible, nonproperty right to honest government services.  Id. at 359-60, 107 S.Ct. at 2881-82.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Congress responded to McNally in 1988 by enacting section 1346, the honest services amendment, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346 (effective Nov. 11, 1988).  We have held, after considering the relevant legislative history, that section 1346 effectively restores to the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> their pre-McNally applications to government officials' schemes to defraud individuals of their intangible right to honest services.  See Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 566 (collecting cases).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently had the opportunity to discuss, at some length, the proper application of the section 1346 honest services amendment to the wrongful acts of public officials.  See Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 722-26.   The discussion and holding in Sawyer directly guide our disposition of the instant appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  First, as a general matter, we noted in Sawyer that although the right to honest services \"eludes easy definition,\" honest services convictions of public officials typically involve serious corruption, such as embezzlement of public funds, bribery of public officials, or the failure of public decision-makers to disclose certain conflicts of interest.  Id. at 724.   Second, we cautioned that \"[t]he broad scope of the mail fraud statute, however, does not encompass every instance of official misconduct that results in the official's personal gain.\"  Id. at 725.   Third, and most importantly, Sawyer holds that the government must not merely indicate wrongdoing by a public official, but must also demonstrate that the wrongdoing at issue is intended to prevent or call into question the proper or impartial performance of that public servant's official duties.  Id. at 725 (citing pre-McNally precedent to demonstrate that even where public officials violated state laws, their actions were not found to defraud citizens of their right to honest services, because the officials did not actually fail to perform their official duties properly).  In other words, \"although a public official might engage in reprehensible misconduct related to an official position, the conviction of that official cannot stand where the conduct does not actually deprive the public of its right to her honest services, and it is not shown to intend that result.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles to Czubinski's acts, it is clear that his conviction cannot stand.  First, this case falls outside of the core of honest services fraud precedents.  Czubinski was not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity.  Nor did he embezzle funds.  He did not receive, nor can it be found that he intended to receive, any tangible benefit.  His official duty was to respond to informational requests from taxpayers regarding their returns, a relatively straightforward task that simply does not raise the specter of secretive, self-interested action, as does a discretionary, decision-making role.  Cf. United States v. McNeive, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336251\"><a href=\"/opinion/336251/united-states-v-james-t-mcneive/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span>, 1251 (8th Cir.1976) (finding no mail fraud violation where city employee accepted gratuities in connection with non-discretionary duty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we believe that the cautionary language of Sawyer is particularly appropriate here, given the evidence amassed by the defendant at trial indicating that during his span of employment at IRS, he received no indication from his employer that this workplace violation--the performance of unauthorized searches--would be punishable by anything more than dismissal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  \"To allow every transgression of state governmental obligations to amount to mail fraud would effectively turn every such violation into a federal felony;  this cannot be countenanced.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 728.   Here, the threat is one of transforming governmental workplace violations into felonies.  We find no evidence that Congress intended to create what amounts to a draconian personnel regulation.  We hesitate to imply such an unusual result in the absence of the clearest legislative mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These general considerations, although serious, are not conclusive:  they raise doubts as to the propriety of this conviction that can be outweighed by sufficient evidence of a scheme to defraud.  The third principle identified in Sawyer, instructing us as to the basic requirements of a scheme to defraud in this context, settles any remaining doubts.  The conclusive consideration is that the government simply did not prove that Czubinski deprived, or intended to deprive, the public or his employer of their right to his honest services.  Although he clearly committed wrongdoing in searching confidential information, there is no suggestion that he failed to carry out his official tasks adequately, or intended to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government alleges that, in addition to defrauding the public of his honest services, Czubinski has defrauded the IRS as well.  The IRS is a public entity, rendering this contention sufficiently answered by our holding above that Czubinski did not defraud the public of his honest services.  Even if the IRS were a private employer, however, the pre-McNally honest services convictions involving private fraud victims indicate that there must be a breach of a fiduciary duty to an employer that involves self-dealing of an order significantly more serious than the misconduct at issue here.  See, e.g., United States v. Lemire, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427194\"><a href=\"/opinion/427194/united-states-v-joseph-c-lemire-united-states-of-america-v-jon-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1327</span></a></span>, 1332-34 (D.C.Cir.1983) (employee took bribes and did not disclose that contractor was overcharging);  United States v. Siegel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424769\"><a href=\"/opinion/424769/united-states-v-leonard-s-siegel-and-martin-b-abrams/\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (2d Cir.1983) (employees used corporate funds for non-corporate purposes);  United States v.

Once again, the government has failed to prove that Czubinski intended to use the IRS files he browsed for any private purposes, and hence his actions, however reprehensible, do not rise to the level of a scheme to defraud his employer of his honest services.II. The Computer Fraud Counts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Czubinski was convicted on all four of the computer fraud counts on which he was indicted;  these counts arise out of unauthorized searches that also formed the basis of four of the ten wire fraud counts in the indictment.  Specifically, he was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(4), a provision enacted in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.  Section 1030(a)(4) applies to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>whoever ... knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a Federal interest computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have never before addressed section 1030(a)(4).  Czubinski unquestionably exceeded authorized access to a Federal interest computer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  On appeal he argues that he did not obtain \"anything of value.\"   We agree, finding that his searches of taxpayer return information did not satisfy the statutory requirement that he obtain \"anything of value.\"   The value of information is relative to one's needs and objectives;  here, the government had to show that the information was valuable to Czubinski in light of a fraudulent scheme.  The government failed, however, to prove that Czubinski intended anything more than to satisfy idle curiosity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of section 1030(a)(4) emphasizes that more than mere unauthorized use is required:  the \"thing obtained\" may not merely be the unauthorized use.  It is the showing of some additional end--to which the unauthorized access is a means--that is lacking here.  The evidence did not show that Czubinski's end was anything more than to satisfy his curiosity by viewing information about friends, acquaintances, and political rivals.  No evidence suggests that he printed out, recorded, or used the information he browsed.  No rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Czubinski intended to use or disclose that information, and merely viewing information cannot be deemed the same as obtaining something of value for the purposes of this statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history further supports our reading of the term \"anything of value.\"  \"In the game of statutory interpretation, statutory language is the ultimate trump card,\" and the remarks of sponsors of legislation are authoritative only to the extent that they are compatible with the plain language of section 1030(a)(4).

For the same reasons we deemed the trial evidence could not support a finding that Czubinski deprived the IRS of its property, see discussion of wire fraud under section 1343 supra, we find that Czubinski has not obtained valuable information in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme for the purposes of section 1030(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a cautionary note.

On the other hand, they might be used to prosecute kinds of behavior that, albeit offensive to the morals or aesthetics of federal prosecutors, cannot reasonably be expected by the instigators to form the basis of a federal felony.  The case at bar falls within the latter category.  Also discomforting is the prosecution's insistence, before trial, on the admission of inflammatory evidence regarding the defendant's membership in white supremacist groups purportedly as a means to prove a scheme to defraud, when, on appeal, it argues that unauthorized access in itself is a sufficient ground for conviction on all counts.  Finally, we caution that the wire fraud statute must not serve as a vehicle for prosecuting only those citizens whose views run against the tide, no matter how incorrect or uncivilized such views are.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold the district court's denial of defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 1, 2, and 4 through 14, to be in error.  The defendant's conviction is thus reversed on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 1987 Czubinski signed an acknowledgment of receipt of the IRS Rules of Conduct, which contained the following rule:</p>\n        <p>Employees must make every effort to assure security and prevent unauthorized disclosure of protected information data in the use of Government owned or leased computers.  In addition, employees may not use any Service computer system for other than official purposes.</p>\n        <p>See Government's Exhibit 1.
