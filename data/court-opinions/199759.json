Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    This case concerns the remedies\n\ndue for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461.        The parties have\n\nstipulated     that   Borden,   Inc.   improperly   terminated   the\n\nplaintiffs from Borden's Total Family Protection Plan (hereafter\n\n\"the Plan\") of life, health, dental, and disability insurance.\n\nThey only dispute the remedy due under the law.      Borden contends\n\nthat the plaintiffs are only due reinstatement in the Plan, and\n\nreimbursement for expenses incurred that would have been covered\n\nby the Plan.     For the most part, the district court agreed with\n\nthis position.    On appeal, plaintiffs assert that this remedy is\n\ninadequate and that they are entitled to additional equitable\n\nrelief.   On cross-appeal, Borden challenges the one element of\n\nthe district court's award which could not be characterized as\n\nbenefits due under the terms of the Plan--an equitable award of\n\nmedical costs to an estate, in trust for the hospital-creditor,\n\neven though the estate was no longer legally obliged to pay\n\nthose costs.    We deny the plaintiffs' appeal and rule for Borden\n\non the cross-appeal.\n\n                                  I.\n\n    Antonietta LaRocca is the named plaintiff in a group of\n\nsixty retired workers (and some of their relatives) who alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fviolations of ERISA by their former employer, Borden, Inc.1        The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that Borden illegally terminated health,\n\nlife, disability, and dental insurance due to them under the\n\nterms of the Plan.2   Borden and Plan beneficiaries fund the Plan\n\nwith contributions.       Borden administers the Plan and acts as\n\nfiduciary.   Borden also determines eligibility for benefits.3\n\nIn addition to covering the plaintiffs when they were employed\n\nat Borden, the Plan also provided for benefits to be paid to\n\nthem upon their retirement.\n\n    The plaintiffs are former Borden employees eligible for\n\nretiree benefits who worked in Borden's Deran Confectionary\n\nDivision   (and   their   covered   relatives).   Borden   sold   this\n\ndivision to Great American Brands (GAB) on April 8, 1993.          The\n\nsales contract stipulated that GAB was to continue benefits\n\n\n    1Antonietta LaRocca is the executrix of the estate of\nGuiseppe Paone, which is the successor-in-interest of Mr. Paone,\na former Borden employee.\n    2The plaintiffs also sued Northern Trust Co. and the\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Co.    In March 1996, all parties\nstipulated to the dismissal of the claims against Metropolitan\nLife. In September 1999, the District Court granted Northern\nTrust's motion for summary judgment on all counts because\nNorthern acted as a directed trustee, merely holding Plan\nassets.   Northern had no responsibility for the eligibility\ndeterminations of which plaintiffs complain.\n    3According to the Plan, Borden \"shall, with the consent of\nthe Benefits Committee, designate the group or groups of\nEmployees who shall be eligible for inclusion in this Plan.\"\nPlan, § 2.1.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fequivalent to those provided under the Plan.         On June 27, 1994,\n\nGAB declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11.           Concerned that GAB\n\nwould be unable to honor its commitment, the plaintiffs sought\n\nbenefits from Borden unsuccessfully.\n\n    As a result of this denial, several of the plaintiffs did\n\nnot have insurance when they were ill.        One of the plaintiffs,\n\nGuiseppe Paone, received a liver transplant before dying on June\n\n16, 1994.     His medical bills at the New England Medical Center\n\n(NEMC)   totaled   $258,571.42.     NEMC   sought   payment     from   his\n\nestate, but did not sue for the debt.          A statute of repose\n\nsubsequently rendered the Paone estate immune from liability for\n\nthe debt.\n\n    The New England Confectionery Company (NECCO) purchased the\n\nrelevant GAB assets on September 1, 1994, and offered health\n\ninsurance to the thirty-one plaintiffs who accepted employment\n\nwith the firm.     Twenty-one of them decided to participate.\n\n    On October 11, 1994, many of the plaintiffs filed with\n\nBorden an appeal of the denial of benefits.         After unsuccessful\n\nsettlement efforts, the plaintiffs filed a complaint on November\n\n17, 1995 in the federal court for the District of Massachusetts.\n\nDuring discovery, the parties stipulated that Borden improperly\n\nterminated the plaintiffs from the Plan.       Unable to agree on a\n\nsettlement,     however,   they   requested   the    district    court's\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fassistance in determining the remedies available under ERISA by\n\nfiling cross-motions for partial summary judgment.                       The central\n\nquestion was whether the plaintiffs were eligible for equitable\n\nrelief    beyond     the    relief    offered    by    Borden       in    settlement\n\nnegotiations.        After holding a hearing on the motions, the\n\ndistrict court issued a Memorandum and Order on March 20, 1998\n\nessentially       siding     with    Borden's    position       on       the    proper\n\nremedies.    The district court ordered one remedy not offered by\n\nBorden:    that    the     company   \"reimburse       the   bills        incurred    by\n\nplaintiff Guiseppe Paone, such sums to be paid to his estate in\n\ntrust for the benefit of New England Medical Center.\"\n\n    Over a year after this ruling, the plaintiffs moved to amend\n\ntheir    complaint    to    allege    violations      of    state    law       and   the\n\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1961 et seq.         The district court denied the motion.                   On\n\nSeptember 25, 2000, it entered an Order and Final Judgment\n\nincorporating its earlier ruling.\n\n    On appeal, the plaintiffs demand further equitable relief\n\npursuant to ERISA § 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3), including\n\nthe cash value of the premium payments that Borden avoided by\n\nfailing to pay them.         They also appeal the denial of their third\n\nmotion to amend their complaint.             On cross-appeal, Borden claims\n\nthat the court cannot award full medical expenses to Guiseppe\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fPaone's   estate      because   the     estate       no    longer    has   a    legal\n\nobligation to pay these bills.                 We address the demand for\n\nfurther equitable relief in Part II, Borden's cross-appeal in\n\nPart III, and the denial of the motion to amend in Part IV.\n\n                                      II.\n\n      The parties have stipulated to a joint statement of material\n\nfacts.    The issue that we review here--the proper scope of\n\nremedies due to the plaintiffs--is a legal issue that we review\n\nde    novo.   We     first    compare    the    remedies       demanded        by   the\n\nplaintiffs with the relief ultimately awarded by the district\n\ncourt.    We then turn to the statutory language in order to\n\nassess the legal basis for this relief.                   Applying this language\n\nand   judicial      interpretations      of    it,    we     conclude      that     the\n\nplaintiffs    are    only    entitled    to    the    relief    ordered        by   the\n\ndistrict court.\n\nA. Plaintiffs' Demands for Relief\n\n      On February 4, 1997, Borden filed an Offer of Judgment\n\noffering the plaintiffs several forms of relief.                    Prospectively,\n\nBorden offered reinstatement of each plaintiff to the Plan.\n\nRetrospectively, Borden offered to pay medical bills paid or\n\nstill due and to pay the excess of any copayments or premiums\n\nfor replacement insurance over the amounts the plaintiffs would\n\nhave paid under the Plan.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f    The plaintiffs demanded significantly more.            They proposed\n\nretrospective   relief   designed   not    only    to   compensate   those\n\nterminated from the Plan for replacement insurance coverage and\n\nto reimburse them for out-of-pocket medical expenses, but also\n\nto force Borden to disgorge the amount by which the company was\n\n\"unjustly enriched\" by failing to pay for insurance coverage\n\nafter   the   improper   terminations. 4     The    plaintiffs'      expert\n\nassessed the gross value of the coverage wrongfully withheld at\n\n$5,565,723 as of October 19, 1998.         Given that the plaintiffs\n\nwould have paid $2,762,352 in employee contributions due the\n\nPlan, the plaintiffs' expert estimated that the net value of the\n\nemployer's contribution left unpaid by Borden was $2,803,371.\n\n    Plaintiffs further argued that Borden's proposed prospective\n\nrelief was inadequate because many of them distrust Borden,\n\nInc., and the Plan it sponsors.     These plaintiffs have developed\n\nclose relationships with other insurance plans and the health\n\n\n    4 The plaintiffs do not ask for the sum of these remedies,\nbut rather for medical expenses for those plaintiffs whose\nexpenses are greater than their share of the disgorgement\nremedy, and the disgorgement remedy less amounts paid for\nmedical expenses for those for whom the opposite is the case.\nAs they put it on appeal, they request that Borden \"be ordered\nto pay to each of the named Plaintiffs [their medical\nexpenses]...[and] [t]hat Borden be ordered to pay to each of the\nnamed Plaintiffs [their share of the disgorgement remedy.] To\nthe extent that monies are due any plaintiff [for medical\nexpenses], Borden shall receive that amount as a credit toward\nthe amount that Plaintiff is entitled to receive [as his portion\nof the disgorgement remedy].\"\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcare providers covered by them.            For them, plaintiffs argued,\n\n\"monetary relief\" should be made \"available to the retirees and\n\ntheir spouses as an alternative remedy\" because many of the\n\nplaintiffs   \"do   not   wish   to    leave    their   current   insurer\"\n\n(emphasis in the original). Therefore, the plaintiffs requested\n\nthat the court order, \"at the option of each plaintiff,\" either\n\nreinstatement to the Plan or payment of the future value of Plan\n\ncoverage.\n\n    With one exception, the district court agreed with Borden's\n\nposition on the scope of the available remedies.             To redress\n\npast harms, the district court ordered Borden 1) to reimburse\n\nthe plaintiffs for medical expenses that they incurred which\n\nwould have been covered by the Plan; 2) to pay the difference\n\nbetween plaintiffs' payments for substitute insurance and the\n\namount they would have paid had they continued membership in the\n\nPlan, and 3) to pay the medical expenses of Guiseppe Paone (the\n\none exception).     The district court ordered Borden to treat\n\n\"[e]ach of the plaintiffs...as if he or she had retired on April\n\n8, 1993, with an effective retirement date of May 1, 1993.\"           The\n\ndistrict court chose the April 8, 1993 date because Borden sold\n\nthe Deran division to GAB on this date and ostensibly arranged\n\nfor GAB to continue benefits equivalent to those provided under\n\nthe Plan.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f    To provide prospective relief, the district court ordered\n\nBorden to give the plaintiffs the opportunity for reinstatement\n\nto the Plan.     It did not give the plaintiffs the option of\n\nchoosing   the   cash    value   of    insurance   coverage   instead   of\n\nreinstatement.\n\n    Any plaintiff who did not waive retiree coverage under\n    the Borden, Inc. Total Family Protection Plan (\"The\n    Plan\"), who was not terminated from the Plan for\n    nonpayment of premiums or other failure to comply with\n    Plan requirements (such failure not to include working\n    for a successor employer), and who has requested\n    reinstatement to the Plan in accordance with the\n    Court's orders, will be deemed eligible for retiree\n    medical insurance and retiree life insurance under the\n    terms of the Plan as if he or she had retired\n    effective May 1, 1993.    Plaintiffs who have elected\n    reinstatement will be responsible for health insurance\n    premiums and other contributions at levels they would\n    be paying today if they had retired on April 8, 1993,\n    and those plaintiffs will receive medical and life\n    insurance benefits in accordance with the terms of the\n    Plan.\n\nThis prospective reinstatement is real. That is, it permits\n\nplaintiffs to renew insurance coverage under the Borden Plan for\n\nfuture     protection.     The    retrospective      reinstatement      is\n\nconstructive.5    That is, it is a remedial device which permits\n\nthe court to award benefits due under the terms of the Plan for\n\nthe period of wrongful termination.\n\nB. Remedies Available Under ERISA\n\n\n    5As noted, the period of constructive reinstatement starts\non April 8, 1993. The record does not clearly indicate the end\ndate. It appears to be October, 1998.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f       Two civil enforcement provisions of ERISA are relevant to\n\nthis    appeal.     29   U.S.C.   §    1132(a).        The    first        permits    a\n\nbeneficiary \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of\n\nhis Plan . . . .\"        Id. § 1132(a)(1)(B) (\"a(1)\").                    The second\n\nprovides that \"a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\" may sue\n\n\"(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision\n\nof this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain\n\nother     appropriate    equitable         relief     (i)     to     redress       such\n\nviolations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter\n\nor the terms of the Plan.\"         Id. § 1132(a)(3) (\"a(3)\").\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that their requests for disgorgement\n\nand     for   the   opportunity       to    receive     the        cash    value     of\n\nreinstatement are \"appropriate equitable relief\" under Section\n\na(3).     The statutory language invites a two-step inquiry to\n\nevaluate this claim: 1) is the proposed relief equitable, and 2)\n\nif so, is it appropriate?         We address each question in turn.\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that, in the context of ERISA,\n\n\"equitable relief\" includes \"those categories of relief that\n\nwere    typically    available     in      equity     (such        as     injunction,\n\nmandamus,     and   restitution,      but    not    compensatory           damages).\"\n\nMertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 256 (1993) (emphasis in\n\noriginal).     Although both damages and restitution may remedy the\n\nsame injury, \"[d]amages differs from restitution in that damages\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fis measured by the plaintiff's loss; restitution is measured by\n\nthe defendant's unjust gain.\"          Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §\n\n3.1, at 208 (2d ed. 1993).       Restitution is an equitable remedy\n\n\"providing a tool for courts to use when one party 'has been\n\nunjustly enriched at the expense of another.'\" Kwatcher v. Mass.\n\nServ. Employees' Pension Fund, 879 F.2d 957, 967 (1st Cir.\n\n1989), quoting Restatement of the Law of Restitution § 1 (1937).\n\nThe plaintiffs have characterized the bulk of the relief they\n\nseek on appeal--approximately $2.8 million in premiums which\n\nBorden would have had to pay had it covered the plaintiffs over\n\nthe   time    period   in    question--as       unjust   enrichment,   the\n\ndisgorgement of which is restitution.            They also justify their\n\nproposed     prospective    remedy    (giving    plaintiffs   the   choice\n\nbetween reinstatement to the Plan or its cash value) as a way of\n\navoiding unjust enrichment by Borden.           By measuring relief with\n\nreference to the amount Borden has gained (and would gain) by\n\nterminating coverage, the plaintiffs propose equitable relief in\n\nthe form of restitution to prevent unjust enrichment.6\n\n\n      6\n      In arguing for restitution to avoid Borden's unjust\nenrichment, the plaintiffs allege that the wrongful termination\nof their insurance coverage exacerbated some of the plaintiffs'\nhealth problems and led others to avoid getting medical care\nbecause of their uncertain insurance status. The plaintiffs use\nthese allegations of harm to justify their demand for\nrestitution. They do not seek compensation for these harms in\nthe form of damages that are measured by the losses inflicted by\nthe harm. Plaintiffs understand that Massachusetts Mut. Life\n\n                                     -11-\n\f       Nevertheless, such relief is not \"appropriate equitable\n\nrelief\" within the meaning of ERISA.                29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)\n\n(emphasis     added).        Clarifying     the   holding   in    Mertens,   the\n\nSupreme      Court   has     ruled   that    Section     a(3)'s     \"'catchall'\n\nprovisions act as a safety net, offering appropriate equitable\n\nrelief for injuries caused by violations that § [1132] does not\n\nelsewhere adequately remedy.\"             Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S.\n\n489, 512 (1996).            Varity circumscribes the applicability of\n\nSection a(3); \"[W]here Congress elsewhere provided adequate\n\nrelief for a beneficiary's injury, there will likely be no need\n\nfor further equitable relief . . . .\"               Id. at 515.\n\n       Following     this    guidance,    federal    courts      have   uniformly\n\nconcluded that, if a plaintiff can pursue benefits under the\n\nplan pursuant to Section a(1), there is an adequate remedy under\n\nthe plan which bars a further remedy under Section a(3).                     See,\n\ne.g., Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, Inc., 127 F.3d\n\n196,   200    (1st   Cir.    1997)   (holding     that   beneficiary      denied\n\nbenefits could not sue under Section a(3) since the claim was\n\n\n\nIns.

As the Eighth Circuit has stated, when the\n\nplaintiff can \"bring a claim for benefits under [Section a(1)],\n\n. . . equitable relief would not be appropriate . . .

They point to Jackson v. Truck\n\nDrivers Union Local 42 Health and Welfare Fund, 933 F. Supp.\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f1124 (D.Mass. 1996), United Steelworkers of America v. Newman-\n\nCrosby Steel, Inc., 822 F. Supp 862 (D.R.I. 1993), and Ream v.\n\nFrey, 107 F.3d 147 (3d Cir. 1997).                The plaintiffs here, like\n\nthose    in    Jackson,       United   Steelworkers,     and    Ream,     were   not\n\nmembers of a          plan (and therefore were not eligible for relief\n\nunder    Section       a(1))    when    they    filed   suit.      However,      the\n\nplaintiffs in Jackson, United Steel Workers, and Ream were\n\npermanently ineligible for a remedy pursuant to Section a(1)\n\nbecause none of these cases involved a functioning plan.                         The\n\nplaintiffs here were only ineligible for a remedy pursuant to\n\nSection a(1) because they were not members of the Plan when they\n\nfiled suit.           Although some of the plaintiffs may not want\n\nprospective reinstatement in the Plan because they distrust\n\nBorden,       Inc.,    none    have    disclaimed   their      interest    in    the\n\nopportunity for reinstatement.             Moreover, they have presented no\n\nevidence to demonstrate that the Borden Plan is not a viable\n\nplan that can pay them the benefits they are due under its\n\nterms.\n\n      Here, the district court faced a situation similar to that\n\npresented in Varity and adopted a comparable remedy.                    In Varity,\n\nthe Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's reinstatement of\n\nplaintiffs who had been improperly terminated from their Plan.\n\n516   U.S.     at     515.     The    Supreme   Court   observed    that    \"[t]he\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fplaintiffs in this case could not proceed under [Section a(1)]\n\nbecause   they   were   no   longer   members   of   [their]   plan   and,\n\ntherefore, had no benefits due [them] under the terms of [the]\n\nplan [pursuant to Section a(1)],\" and that \"[t]hey must rely on\n\n[Section a(3)] or they have no remedy at all.\"            Id. (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).7 Here, once the district\n\ncourt mandated the plaintiffs' constructive reinstatement (and\n\nopportunity for actual reinstatement) to the Plan pursuant to\n\nSection a(3), the plaintiffs' claims were governed by the terms\n\nof the Plan, as Section a(1) provides.8\n\nC. Inapplicability of the Collateral Source Rule\n\n    Recognizing the primacy of the Plan in awarding benefits to\n\nplaintiffs after their reinstatement, the district court refused\n\nto order Borden to pay for medical expenses already covered by\n\n\n    7Although the district court said that Section a(1)\nauthorized the reinstatement order, that section only governs\nremedies for those who are members of a plan. Reinstatement is\nan equitable remedy based on Section a(3).\n    8Recognizing that they might only be eligible for relief\npursuant to Section a(1), the plaintiffs have tried to\nrecharacterize the disgorgement remedy they seek as a benefit\ndue under the Plan.     They argue that they still deserve to\nrecover the employer's contributions which Borden failed to make\nbecause \"the Plan coverage itself is the 'benefit due' to the\nretirees and spouses.\"    This argument reflects a fundamental\nmisunderstanding: the benefit due from an insurance plan is the\nbenefit paid in case a covered event occurs, not the coverage\nitself. Plaintiffs' expansive theory of the benefits due under\nthe Plan is untenable.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\falternative    insurance        coverage      because    of    Plan     provisions\n\ncoordinating       coverage     with   other    insurance      to     avoid   double\n\npayments.      Plaintiffs invoke the collateral source rule to\n\nchallenge this ruling.\n\n      The collateral source rule has traditionally provided \"'that\n\nbenefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to\n\nthe   defendant     may   not    be    used    to   reduce     that    defendant's\n\nliability for damages.'\"          Lussier v. Runyon, 50 F.3d 1103, 1107\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (quoting 1 Dan B. Dobbs,                     Law of Remedies §\n\n3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993)).              The plaintiffs argue that the\n\ncollateral source rule makes Borden liable for                        all of their\n\nmedical bills, even if alternative sources of insurance have\n\nalready     paid    for   them.         However,       ERISA    preempts      state\n\nlegislation        designed      to    limit        plans'     subrogation       and\n\ncoordination of benefits provisions.                See FMC Corp. v. Holliday,\n\n498 U.S. 52 (1990); Travitz v. Northeast Dept. ILGWU Health and\n\nWelfare Fund, 13 F.3d 704 (3d Cir. 1994).                       Such preemption\n\napplies   a fortiori to state common law doctrines (like the\n\ncollateral source rule) which purportedly alter the benefit\n\nlimitation provisions of a plan.                See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nDedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 52-57 (1987) (precluding both state claims\n\nto recover benefits under an ERISA plan and state claims to\n\nrecover compensation for harms suffered because of improper\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fdenial of such benefits).\n\n      We recognize that the insurance benefits which are the\n\ncollateral source subject to the Borden Plan were available only\n\nbecause some of the plaintiffs obtained new insurance coverage\n\nin light of the improper termination of their insurance coverage\n\nby Borden.       The fact remains, however, that this insurance falls\n\nunder the purview of the coordination of benefits provisions of\n\nthe   Borden     Plan.    The   plaintiffs     who    obtained   alternative\n\nsources of insurance were, in effect, mitigating their damages.\n\nThe law often obliges the victim of a breach of contract to\n\nmitigate damages.        See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\n§   350   cmt.    b   (1981).   The   Borden   Plan    expressly   precludes\n\nreimbursement under its coordination of benefits provisions when\n\na claimant's bills are paid by a collateral source.                Therefore,\n\nthe district court ruled properly that a claimant whose medical\n\nbills have been paid collaterally cannot demand that the Plan\n\nreimburse the claimant for these bills.\n\nD. The Congressional Balance\n\n      Despite its rulings against the plaintiffs, the district\n\ncourt recognized that the relief it ordered did not address\n\nfully plaintiffs' grievances: \"Were it not for the limits on\n\nremedies imposed by ERISA and by its judicial interpretation,\n\n[plaintiffs'] arguments would likely merit the remedy [they]\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fseek.\"   This apt observation reflects the balance struck by\n\nCongress in its passage of ERISA.           Congress wanted to protect\n\ncontractually defined benefits.        See Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 148\n\nand n.16 (1985) (citing 120 Cong. Rec. 29196 (1974), reprinted\n\nin 3 Subcommittee on Labor and Public Welfare of the Senate\n\nCommittee on Labor and Public Welfare, 94th Cong., 2d Sess.,\n\nLegislative History of the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct of 1974, p. 4665 (Comm. Print 1976) (\"Leg. Hist.\"); 119\n\nCong.Rec. 30041 (1973), 2 Leg. Hist. 1633).            But \"Congress was\n\n[also] concerned lest the cost of federal standards discourage\n\nthe growth of private pension plans.\"               Id. at 148 and n.17\n\n(citing H.R.Rep. No. 93-533, at 1, 9 (1973), 2 Leg. Hist. 2348,\n\n2356; 120 Cong. Rec. 29949 (1974), 3 Leg. Hist. 4791; 120 Cong.\n\nRec.   29210-29211   (1974),   3     Leg.   Hist.    4706-4707).      Given\n\nCongress's careful attention to this balance, the Supreme Court\n\nhas limited the remedies available pursuant to the \"appropriate\n\nequitable relief\" provisions of ERISA.               Here, ERISA's civil\n\nenforcement    provisions      and        their     subsequent     judicial\n\ninterpretation required the district court to craft a remedy\n\nlimited to the benefits due to the plaintiffs under the Plan.\n\nNo matter how the plaintiffs choose to label their demands on\n\nappeal, they are not \"appropriate equitable relief\" authorized\n\nby ERISA.\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f                               III.\n\n    The district court ordered Borden to pay past benefits due\n\nunder the terms of the Plan for all of the plaintiffs but one,\n\nthe estate of Guiseppe Paone.     Mr. Paone died in 1994 after\n\nincurring approximately $258,000 of medical expenses at the New\n\nEngland Medical Center (NEMC).    The Plan administrator denied\n\ncoverage, and NEMC unsuccessfully attempted to obtain payment\n\nfrom both Great American Brands and the Paone estate.    Although\n\nNEMC could have sued Paone's estate to try to recover the money,\n\nit did not, and any potential claim for these funds from Mr.\n\nPaone's estate is now time-barred.    See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 197,\n\n§ 9 (establishing one-year statute of repose for claims against\n\nestates).\n\n    The district court awarded Paone's medical expenses to his\n\nestate, to be held in trust for NEMC, stating that \"[t]his is a\n\ncase where 'equity will treat that as done which ought to have\n\nbeen done'\" (citation omitted).       The court noted that \"the\n\nexecutrix of Paone's estate, Antonietta LaRocca, attests that\n\nhis unpaid debt desecrates her father's memory and that she\n\nwishes to receive reimbursement from Borden in trust for NEMC,\n\nas her father would never have considered not paying a debt that\n\nhe owed.\"   Although the district court did not specifically cite\n\nSection a(3) as the basis for its award to the estate, the\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fcourt's reference to equity suggests that this provision was the\n\nbasis.\n\n    In its order and final judgment, the district court ruled\n\nthat \"Each of the plaintiffs will be treated as if he or she had\n\nretired on April 8, 1993, with an effective retirement date of\n\nMay 1, 1993.\"    As a complement to this order of constructive\n\nreinstatement, the court ordered that \"Borden, Inc. will pay or\n\ncause to be paid by the Plan to designated plaintiffs the amount\n\nspecified   in   Exhibit   A   hereto.\"     One   of   the   designated\n\nplaintiffs is Guiseppe Paone.      Once a plaintiff like Mr. Paone\n\nwas constructively reinstated pursuant to Section a(3), the\n\nterms of the Plan governed the relief he (or his estate) was due\n\npursuant to Section a(1).      The Plan expressly prohibits benefit\n\npayments for \"services for which there is no charge or legal\n\nobligation to pay.\"    Plan §§ 6.14(s) and 15.11(e).         Since the\n\nPlan does not cover the bills of        someone who does not have to\n\npay them, it bars the relief ordered by the district court for\n\nthe Paone estate in trust for NEMC.        Therefore, we must vacate\n\nthe district court's award.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n    Plaintiffs also argue that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying them the opportunity to add RICO and state\n\nlaw claims to their complaint.          The district court concluded\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fthat       such an amendment would be futile.       Plaintiffs argue that\n\na recently decided Supreme Court case, Humana Inc. v. Forsyth,\n\n525 U.S. 299 (1999), made their RICO and state law claims\n\nviable.       We do not address this issue, choosing to affirm the\n\ndistrict court's ruling on the basis of timeliness.9\n\n       Like the plaintiff in Acosta-Mestre v.             Hilton Int'l of\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc., 156 F.3d 49 (1st Cir. 1998), the plaintiffs\n\nhere assert that \"mere delay is not reason enough to deny a\n\nmotion for leave to amend.\"            Id. at 52.      Such an argument is\n\n\"contrary      to   Supreme   Court   and    circuit   precedent    [holding\n\nthat]...'undue       delay'   in   seeking    the   amendment      may   be   a\n\nsufficient basis for denying leave to amend.\"                Id. (quoting\n\nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962)).           The plaintiffs filed the\n\nmotion to amend after discovery had been completed and after the\n\ncourt had issued an all-but-dispositive ruling on cross-motions\n\nfor summary judgment.         They were given leave twice earlier to\n\namend their complaint.        The decision whether to grant leave to\n\namend lies within the District Court's discretion.              See Judge v.\n\n\n\n       9\n     \"We review a denial of leave to amend under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15\nfor an abuse of discretion and defer to the district court if\nany adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.\"\nGrant v. News Group Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995),\nciting Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st\nCir. 1994).\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fCity of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 79 (1st Cir. 1998).            Given the\n\nplaintiffs'   delay,   the   district   court   did   not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to amend the complaint.\n\n                                  V.\n\n    ERISA has generated a complex body of law governing the\n\nscope of remedies available to those wrongly terminated from\n\nplans covered by ERISA.      For the most part, the district court\n\napplied the law to this case correctly by limiting relief to the\n\nbenefits due under the Plan.     However, the district court could\n\nnot, as a matter of law, grant further equitable relief to the\n\nPaone estate because it is not eligible for benefits under the\n\nterms of the Plan.     We therefore deny the relief sought by the\n\nplaintiffs in their appeal and grant the relief sought by Borden\n\nin its cross-appeal, vacating the award to Guiseppe Paone's\n\nestate.\n\n    So Ordered.   Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f",

The parties have stipulated that Borden, Inc. improperly terminated the plaintiffs from Borden's Total Family Protection Plan (hereafter \"the Plan\") of life, health, dental, and disability insurance. They only dispute the remedy due under the law. Borden contends that the plaintiffs are only due reinstatement in the Plan, and reimbursement for expenses incurred that would have been covered by the Plan. For the most part, the district court agreed with this position. On appeal, plaintiffs assert that this remedy is inadequate and that they are entitled to additional equitable relief. On cross-appeal, Borden challenges the one element of the district court's award which could not be characterized as benefits due under the terms of the Plan--an equitable award of medical costs to an estate, in trust for the hospital-creditor, even though the estate was no longer legally obliged to pay those costs. We deny the plaintiffs' appeal and rule for Borden on the cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antonietta LaRocca is the named plaintiff in a group of sixty retired workers (and some of their relatives) who alleged violations of ERISA by their former employer, Borden, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The plaintiffs alleged that Borden illegally terminated health, life, disability, and dental insurance due to them under the terms of the Plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Borden and Plan beneficiaries fund the Plan with contributions. Borden administers the Plan and acts as fiduciary. Borden also determines eligibility for benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In addition to covering the plaintiffs when they were employed at Borden, the Plan also provided for benefits to be paid to them upon their retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are former Borden employees eligible for retiree benefits who worked in Borden's Deran Confectionary Division (and their covered relatives). Borden sold this division to Great American Brands (GAB) on April 8, 1993. The sales contract stipulated that GAB was to continue benefits equivalent to those provided under the Plan. On June 27, 1994, GAB declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11. Concerned that GAB would be unable to honor its commitment, the plaintiffs sought benefits from Borden unsuccessfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of this denial, several of the plaintiffs did not have insurance when they were ill. One of the plaintiffs, Guiseppe Paone, received a liver transplant before dying on June 16, 1994. His medical bills at the New England Medical Center (NEMC) totaled $258,571.42. NEMC sought payment from his estate, but did not sue for the debt. A statute of repose subsequently rendered the Paone estate immune from liability for the debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New England Confectionery Company (NECCO) purchased the relevant GAB assets on September 1, 1994, and offered health insurance to the thirty-one plaintiffs who accepted employment with the firm. Twenty-one of them decided to participate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 11, 1994, many of the plaintiffs filed with Borden an appeal of the denial of benefits. After unsuccessful settlement efforts, the plaintiffs filed a complaint on November 17, 1995 in the federal court for the District of Massachusetts. During discovery, the parties stipulated that Borden improperly terminated the plaintiffs from the Plan. Unable to agree on a settlement, however, they requested the district court's assistance in determining the remedies available under ERISA by filing cross-motions for partial summary judgment. The central question was whether the plaintiffs were eligible for equitable relief beyond the relief offered by Borden in settlement negotiations. After holding a hearing on the motions, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order on March 20, 1998 essentially siding with Borden's position on the proper remedies. The district court ordered one remedy not offered by Borden: that the company \"reimburse the bills incurred by plaintiff Guiseppe Paone, such sums to be paid to his estate in trust for the benefit of New England Medical Center.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a year after this ruling, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to allege violations of state law and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961 et seq. The district court denied the motion. On September 25, 2000, it entered an Order and Final Judgment incorporating its earlier ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the plaintiffs demand further equitable relief pursuant to ERISA &#167; 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3), including the cash value of the premium payments that Borden avoided by failing to pay them. They also appeal the denial of their third motion to amend their complaint. On cross-appeal, Borden claims that the court cannot award full medical expenses to Guiseppe Paone's estate because the estate no longer has a legal obligation to pay these bills. We address the demand for further equitable relief in Part II, Borden's cross-appeal in Part III, and the denial of the motion to amend in Part IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have stipulated to a joint statement of material facts. The issue that we review here--the proper scope of remedies due to the plaintiffs--is a legal issue that we review de novo. We first compare the remedies demanded by the plaintiffs with the relief ultimately awarded by the district court. We then turn to the statutory language in order to assess the legal basis for this relief. Applying this language and judicial interpretations of it, we conclude that the plaintiffs are only entitled to the relief ordered by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Plaintiffs' Demands for Relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1997, Borden filed an Offer of Judgment offering the plaintiffs several forms of relief. Prospectively, Borden offered reinstatement of each plaintiff to the Plan. Retrospectively, Borden offered to pay medical bills paid or still due and to pay the excess of any copayments or premiums for replacement insurance over the amounts the plaintiffs would have paid under the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs demanded significantly more. They proposed retrospective relief designed not only to compensate those terminated from the Plan for replacement insurance coverage and to reimburse them for out-of-pocket medical expenses, but also to force Borden to disgorge the amount by which the company was \"unjustly enriched\" by failing to pay for insurance coverage after the improper terminations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The plaintiffs' expert assessed the gross value of the coverage wrongfully withheld at $5,565,723 as of October 19, 1998. Given that the plaintiffs would have paid $2,762,352 in employee contributions due the Plan, the plaintiffs' expert estimated that the net value of the employer's contribution left unpaid by Borden was $2,803,371.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs further argued that Borden's proposed prospective relief was inadequate because many of them distrust Borden, Inc., and the Plan it sponsors. These plaintiffs have developed close relationships with other insurance plans and the health care providers covered by them. For them, plaintiffs argued, \"monetary relief\" should be made \"available to the retirees and their spouses as an alternative remedy\" because many of the plaintiffs \"do not wish to leave their current insurer\" (emphasis in the original). Therefore, the plaintiffs requested that the court order, \"at the option of each plaintiff,\" either reinstatement to the Plan or payment of the future value of Plan coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With one exception, the district court agreed with Borden's position on the scope of the available remedies. To redress past harms, the district court ordered Borden 1) to reimburse the plaintiffs for medical expenses that they incurred which would have been covered by the Plan; 2) to pay the difference between plaintiffs' payments for substitute insurance and the amount they would have paid had they continued membership in the Plan, and 3) to pay the medical expenses of Guiseppe Paone (the one exception). The district court ordered Borden to treat \"[e]ach of the plaintiffs...as if he or she had retired on April 8, 1993, with an effective retirement date of May 1, 1993.\" The district court chose the April 8, 1993 date because Borden sold the Deran division to GAB on this date and ostensibly arranged for GAB to continue benefits equivalent to those provided under the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To provide prospective relief, the district court ordered Borden to give the plaintiffs the opportunity for reinstatement to the Plan. It did not give the plaintiffs the option of choosing the cash value of insurance coverage instead of reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any plaintiff who did not waive retiree coverage under the Borden, Inc. Total Family Protection Plan (\"The Plan\"), who was not terminated from the Plan for nonpayment of premiums or other failure to comply with Plan requirements (such failure not to include working for a successor employer), and who has requested reinstatement to the Plan in accordance with the Court's orders, will be deemed eligible for retiree medical insurance and retiree life insurance under the terms of the Plan as if he or she had retired effective May 1, 1993. Plaintiffs who have elected reinstatement will be responsible for health insurance premiums and other contributions at levels they would be paying today if they had retired on April 8, 1993, and those plaintiffs will receive medical and life insurance benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This prospective reinstatement is real. That is, it permits plaintiffs to renew insurance coverage under the Borden Plan for future protection. The retrospective reinstatement is constructive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> That is, it is a remedial device which permits the court to award benefits due under the terms of the Plan for the period of wrongful termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Remedies Available Under ERISA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two civil enforcement provisions of ERISA are relevant to this appeal. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a). The first permits a beneficiary \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his Plan . . . .\" Id. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B) (\"a(1)\"). The second provides that \"a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\" may sue \"(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the Plan.\" Id. &#167; 1132(a)(3) (\"a(3)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that their requests for disgorgement and for the opportunity to receive the cash value of reinstatement are \"appropriate equitable relief\" under Section a(3). The statutory language invites a two-step inquiry to evaluate this claim: 1) is the proposed relief equitable, and 2) if so, is it appropriate? We address each question in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that, in the context of ERISA, \"equitable relief\" includes \"those categories of relief that were typically available in equity (such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution, but not compensatory damages).\" Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 256 (1993) (emphasis in original). Although both damages and restitution may remedy the same injury, \"[d]amages differs from restitution in that damages is measured by the plaintiff's loss; restitution is measured by the defendant's unjust gain.\"  Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#167; 3.1, at 208 (2d ed. 1993). Restitution is an equitable remedy \"providing a tool for courts to use when one party 'has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another.'\" Kwatcher v. Mass. Serv. Employees' Pension Fund, 879 F.2d 957, 967 (1st Cir. 1989), quoting Restatement of the Law of Restitution &#167; 1 (1937). The plaintiffs have characterized the bulk of the relief they seek on appeal--approximately $2.8 million in premiums which Borden would have had to pay had it covered the plaintiffs over the time period in question--as unjust enrichment, the disgorgement of which is restitution. They also justify their proposed prospective remedy (giving plaintiffs the choice between reinstatement to the Plan or its cash value) as a way of avoiding unjust enrichment by Borden. By measuring relief with reference to the amount Borden has gained (and would gain) by terminating coverage, the plaintiffs propose equitable relief in the form of restitution to prevent unjust enrichment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, such relief is not \"appropriate equitable relief\" within the meaning of ERISA. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). Clarifying the holding in Mertens, the Supreme Court has ruled that Section a(3)'s \"'catchall' provisions act as a safety net, offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that &#167; [1132] does not elsewhere adequately remedy.\" Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 512 (1996). Varity circumscribes the applicability of Section a(3); \"[W]here Congress elsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary's injury, there will likely be no need for further equitable relief . . . .\" Id. at 515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this guidance, federal courts have uniformly concluded that, if a plaintiff can pursue benefits under the plan pursuant to Section a(1), there is an adequate remedy under the plan which bars a further remedy under Section a(3). See, e.g., Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, Inc., 127 F.3d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that beneficiary denied benefits could not sue under Section a(3) since the claim was \"specifically addressed by [Section a(1)]\"); Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., 114 F.3d 1467, 1475 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that \"[e]quitable relief under section 1132(a)(3) is not 'appropriate' because section 1132(a)(1) provides an adequate remedy in this case.\"); Wald v. Southwestern Bell Corp. Customcare Med. Plan, 83 F.3d 1002, 1006 (8th Cir. 1996); Katz v. Comprehensive Plan of Group Ins., 197 F.3d 1084, 1088-89 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that even the unrealized prospect of relief under Section a(1) renders relief under Section a(3) unavailable); Tolson v. Avondale Indus. Inc., 141 F.3d 604, 610 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"Because [plaintiff] has adequate relief available for the alleged improper denial of benefits through his right to sue the Plans directly under section 1132(a)(1), relief through the application of [s]ection 1132(a)(3) would be inappropriate.\"). As the Eighth Circuit has stated, when the plaintiff can \"bring a claim for benefits under [Section a(1)], . . . equitable relief would not be appropriate . . . [and] she does not have a cause of action under [Section a(3)].\" Wald, 83 F.3d at 1006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Challenging the import of these cases, the plaintiffs argue that equitable relief has been awarded pursuant to Section a(3) in a number of other cases. They point to Jackson v. Truck Drivers Union Local 42 Health and Welfare Fund, 933 F. Supp. 1124 (D.Mass. 1996), United Steelworkers of America v. Newman-Crosby Steel, Inc., 822 F. Supp 862 (D.R.I. 1993), and Ream v. Frey, 107 F.3d 147 (3d Cir. 1997). The plaintiffs here, like those in Jackson, United Steelworkers, and Ream, were not members of a plan (and therefore were not eligible for relief under Section a(1)) when they filed suit. However, the plaintiffs in Jackson, United Steel Workers, and Ream were permanently ineligible for a remedy pursuant to Section a(1) because none of these cases involved a functioning plan. The plaintiffs here were only ineligible for a remedy pursuant to Section a(1) because they were not members of the Plan when they filed suit. Although some of the plaintiffs may not want prospective reinstatement in the Plan because they distrust Borden, Inc., none have disclaimed their interest in the opportunity for reinstatement. Moreover, they have presented no evidence to demonstrate that the Borden Plan is not a viable plan that can pay them the benefits they are due under its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court faced a situation similar to that presented in Varity and adopted a comparable remedy. In Varity, the Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's reinstatement of plaintiffs who had been improperly terminated from their Plan. 516 U.S. at 515. The Supreme Court observed that \"[t]he plaintiffs in this case could not proceed under [Section a(1)] because they were no longer members of [their] plan and, therefore, had no benefits due [them] under the terms of [the] plan [pursuant to Section a(1)],\" and that \"[t]hey must rely on [Section a(3)] or they have no remedy at all.\" Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Here, once the district court mandated the plaintiffs' constructive reinstatement (and opportunity for actual reinstatement) to the Plan pursuant to Section a(3), the plaintiffs' claims were governed by the terms of the Plan, as Section a(1) provides.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Inapplicability of the Collateral Source Rule</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing the primacy of the Plan in awarding benefits to plaintiffs after their reinstatement, the district court refused to order Borden to pay for medical expenses already covered by alternative insurance coverage because of Plan provisions coordinating coverage with other insurance to avoid double payments. Plaintiffs invoke the collateral source rule to challenge this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The collateral source rule has traditionally provided \"'that benefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that defendant's liability for damages.'\" Lussier v. Runyon, 50 F.3d 1103, 1107 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#167; 3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993)). The plaintiffs argue that the collateral source rule makes Borden liable for all of their medical bills, even if alternative sources of insurance have already paid for them. However, ERISA preempts state legislation designed to limit plans' subrogation and coordination of benefits provisions. See FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52 (1990); Travitz v. Northeast Dept. ILGWU Health and Welfare Fund, 13 F.3d 704 (3d Cir. 1994). Such preemption applies a fortiori to state common law doctrines (like the collateral source rule) which purportedly alter the benefit limitation provisions of a plan. See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 52-57 (1987) (precluding both state claims to recover benefits under an ERISA plan and state claims to recover compensation for harms suffered because of improper denial of such benefits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the insurance benefits which are the collateral source subject to the Borden Plan were available only because some of the plaintiffs obtained new insurance coverage in light of the improper termination of their insurance coverage by Borden. The fact remains, however, that this insurance falls under the purview of the coordination of benefits provisions of the Borden Plan. The plaintiffs who obtained alternative sources of insurance were, in effect, mitigating their damages. The law often obliges the victim of a breach of contract to mitigate damages. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 350 cmt. b (1981). The Borden Plan expressly precludes reimbursement under its coordination of benefits provisions when a claimant's bills are paid by a collateral source. Therefore, the district court ruled properly that a claimant whose medical bills have been paid collaterally cannot demand that the Plan reimburse the claimant for these bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Congressional Balance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its rulings against the plaintiffs, the district court recognized that the relief it ordered did not address fully plaintiffs' grievances: \"Were it not for the limits on remedies imposed by ERISA and by its judicial interpretation, [plaintiffs'] arguments would likely merit the remedy [they] seek.\" This apt observation reflects the balance struck by Congress in its passage of ERISA. Congress wanted to protect contractually defined benefits. See Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 148 and n.16 (1985) (citing 120 Cong. Rec. 29196 (1974), reprinted in 3 Subcommittee on Labor and Public Welfare of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, p. 4665 (Comm. Print 1976) (\"Leg. Hist.\"); 119 Cong.Rec. 30041 (1973), 2 Leg. Hist. 1633). But \"Congress was [also] concerned lest the cost of federal standards discourage the growth of private pension plans.\" Id. at 148 and n.17 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 93-533, at 1, 9 (1973), 2 Leg. Hist. 2348, 2356; 120 Cong. Rec. 29949 (1974), 3 Leg. Hist. 4791; 120 Cong. Rec. 29210-29211 (1974), 3 Leg. Hist. 4706-4707). Given Congress's careful attention to this balance, the Supreme Court has limited the remedies available pursuant to the \"appropriate equitable relief\" provisions of ERISA. Here, ERISA's civil enforcement provisions and their subsequent judicial interpretation required the district court to craft a remedy limited to the benefits due to the plaintiffs under the Plan. No matter how the plaintiffs choose to label their demands on appeal, they are not \"appropriate equitable relief\" authorized by ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered Borden to pay past benefits due under the terms of the Plan for all of the plaintiffs but one, the estate of Guiseppe Paone. Mr. Paone died in 1994 after incurring approximately $258,000 of medical expenses at the New England Medical Center (NEMC). The Plan administrator denied coverage, and NEMC unsuccessfully attempted to obtain payment from both Great American Brands and the Paone estate. Although NEMC could have sued Paone's estate to try to recover the money, it did not, and any potential claim for these funds from Mr. Paone's estate is now time-barred. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 197, &#167; 9 (establishing one-year statute of repose for claims against estates).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded Paone's medical expenses to his estate, to be held in trust for NEMC, stating that \"[t]his is a case where 'equity will treat that as done which ought to have been done'\" (citation omitted). The court noted that \"the executrix of Paone's estate, Antonietta LaRocca, attests that his unpaid debt desecrates her father's memory and that she wishes to receive reimbursement from Borden in trust for NEMC, as her father would never have considered not paying a debt that he owed.\" Although the district court did not specifically cite Section a(3) as the basis for its award to the estate, the court's reference to equity suggests that this provision was the basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order and final judgment, the district court ruled that \"Each of the plaintiffs will be treated as if he or she had retired on April 8, 1993, with an effective retirement date of May 1, 1993.\" As a complement to this order of constructive reinstatement, the court ordered that \"Borden, Inc. will pay or cause to be paid by the Plan to designated plaintiffs the amount specified in Exhibit A hereto.\" One of the designated plaintiffs is Guiseppe Paone. Once a plaintiff like Mr. Paone was constructively reinstated pursuant to Section a(3), the terms of the Plan governed the relief he (or his estate) was due pursuant to Section a(1). The Plan expressly prohibits benefit payments for \"services for which there is no charge or legal obligation to pay.\" Plan &#167;&#167; 6.14(s) and 15.11(e). Since the Plan does not cover the bills of someone who does not have to pay them, it bars the relief ordered by the district court for the Paone estate in trust for NEMC. Therefore, we must vacate the district court's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the district court abused its discretion by denying them the opportunity to add RICO and state law claims to their complaint. The district court concluded that such an amendment would be futile. Plaintiffs argue that a recently decided Supreme Court case, Humana Inc. v. Forsyth, 525 U.S. 299 (1999), made their RICO and state law claims viable. We do not address this issue, choosing to affirm the district court's ruling on the basis of timeliness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the plaintiff in Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of Puerto Rico, Inc., 156 F.3d 49 (1st Cir. 1998), the plaintiffs here assert that \"mere delay is not reason enough to deny a motion for leave to amend.\" Id. at 52. Such an argument is \"contrary to Supreme Court and circuit precedent [holding that]...'undue delay' in seeking the amendment may be a sufficient basis for denying leave to amend.\" Id. (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962)). The plaintiffs filed the motion to amend after discovery had been completed and after the court had issued an all-but-dispositive ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment. They were given leave twice earlier to amend their complaint. The decision whether to grant leave to amend lies within the District Court's discretion. See Judge v. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 79 (1st Cir. 1998). Given the plaintiffs' delay, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to amend the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA has generated a complex body of law governing the scope of remedies available to those wrongly terminated from plans covered by ERISA. For the most part, the district court applied the law to this case correctly by limiting relief to the benefits due under the Plan. However, the district court could not, as a matter of law, grant further equitable relief to the Paone estate because it is not eligible for benefits under the terms of the Plan. We therefore deny the relief sought by the plaintiffs in their appeal and grant the relief sought by Borden in its cross-appeal, vacating the award to Guiseppe Paone's estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So Ordered.

The parties have stipulated that Borden, Inc. improperly terminated the plaintiffs from Borden's Total Family Protection Plan (hereafter \"the Plan\") of life, health, dental, and disability insurance. They only dispute the remedy due under the law. Borden contends that the plaintiffs are only due reinstatement in the Plan, and reimbursement for expenses incurred that would have been covered by the Plan. For the most part, the district court agreed with this position. On appeal, plaintiffs assert that this remedy is inadequate and that they are entitled to additional equitable relief. On cross-appeal, Borden challenges the one element of the district court's award which could not be characterized as benefits due under the terms of the Plan--an equitable award of medical costs to an estate, in trust for the hospital-creditor, even though the estate was no longer legally obliged to pay those costs. We deny the plaintiffs' appeal and rule for Borden on the cross-appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antonietta LaRocca is the named plaintiff in a group of sixty retired workers (and some of their relatives) who alleged violations of ERISA by their former employer, Borden, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The plaintiffs alleged that Borden illegally terminated health, life, disability, and dental insurance due to them under the terms of the Plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Borden and Plan beneficiaries fund the Plan with contributions. Borden administers the Plan and acts as fiduciary. Borden also determines eligibility for benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In addition to covering the plaintiffs when they were employed at Borden, the Plan also provided for benefits to be paid to them upon their retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are former Borden employees eligible for retiree benefits who worked in Borden's Deran Confectionary Division (and their covered relatives). Borden sold this division to Great American Brands (GAB) on April 8, 1993. The sales contract stipulated that GAB was to continue benefits equivalent to those provided under the Plan. On June 27, 1994, GAB declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11. Concerned that GAB would be unable to honor its commitment, the plaintiffs sought benefits from Borden unsuccessfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of this denial, several of the plaintiffs did not have insurance when they were ill. One of the plaintiffs, Guiseppe Paone, received a liver transplant before dying on June 16, 1994. His medical bills at the New England Medical Center (NEMC) totaled $258,571.42. NEMC sought payment from his estate, but did not sue for the debt. A statute of repose subsequently rendered the Paone estate immune from liability for the debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New England Confectionery Company (NECCO) purchased the relevant GAB assets on September 1, 1994, and offered health insurance to the thirty-one plaintiffs who accepted employment with the firm. Twenty-one of them decided to participate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 11, 1994, many of the plaintiffs filed with Borden an appeal of the denial of benefits. After unsuccessful settlement efforts, the plaintiffs filed a complaint on November 17, 1995 in the federal court for the District of Massachusetts. During discovery, the parties stipulated that Borden improperly terminated the plaintiffs from the Plan. Unable to agree on a settlement, however, they requested the district court's assistance in determining the remedies available under ERISA by filing cross-motions for partial summary judgment. The central question was whether the plaintiffs were eligible for equitable relief beyond the relief offered by Borden in settlement negotiations. After holding a hearing on the motions, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order on March 20, 1998 essentially siding with Borden's position on the proper remedies. The district court ordered one remedy not offered by Borden: that the company \"reimburse the bills incurred by plaintiff Guiseppe Paone, such sums to be paid to his estate in trust for the benefit of New England Medical Center.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a year after this ruling, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to allege violations of state law and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961 et seq. The district court denied the motion. On September 25, 2000, it entered an Order and Final Judgment incorporating its earlier ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the plaintiffs demand further equitable relief pursuant to ERISA &#167; 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3), including the cash value of the premium payments that Borden avoided by failing to pay them. They also appeal the denial of their third motion to amend their complaint. On cross-appeal, Borden claims that the court cannot award full medical expenses to Guiseppe Paone's estate because the estate no longer has a legal obligation to pay these bills. We address the demand for further equitable relief in Part II, Borden's cross-appeal in Part III, and the denial of the motion to amend in Part IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have stipulated to a joint statement of material facts. The issue that we review here--the proper scope of remedies due to the plaintiffs--is a legal issue that we review de novo. We first compare the remedies demanded by the plaintiffs with the relief ultimately awarded by the district court. We then turn to the statutory language in order to assess the legal basis for this relief. Applying this language and judicial interpretations of it, we conclude that the plaintiffs are only entitled to the relief ordered by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Plaintiffs' Demands for Relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1997, Borden filed an Offer of Judgment offering the plaintiffs several forms of relief. Prospectively, Borden offered reinstatement of each plaintiff to the Plan. Retrospectively, Borden offered to pay medical bills paid or still due and to pay the excess of any copayments or premiums for replacement insurance over the amounts the plaintiffs would have paid under the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs demanded significantly more. They proposed retrospective relief designed not only to compensate those terminated from the Plan for replacement insurance coverage and to reimburse them for out-of-pocket medical expenses, but also to force Borden to disgorge the amount by which the company was \"unjustly enriched\" by failing to pay for insurance coverage after the improper terminations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The plaintiffs' expert assessed the gross value of the coverage wrongfully withheld at $5,565,723 as of October 19, 1998. Given that the plaintiffs would have paid $2,762,352 in employee contributions due the Plan, the plaintiffs' expert estimated that the net value of the employer's contribution left unpaid by Borden was $2,803,371.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs further argued that Borden's proposed prospective relief was inadequate because many of them distrust Borden, Inc., and the Plan it sponsors. These plaintiffs have developed close relationships with other insurance plans and the health care providers covered by them. For them, plaintiffs argued, \"monetary relief\" should be made \"available to the retirees and their spouses as an alternative remedy\" because many of the plaintiffs \"do not wish to leave their current insurer\" (emphasis in the original). Therefore, the plaintiffs requested that the court order, \"at the option of each plaintiff,\" either reinstatement to the Plan or payment of the future value of Plan coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With one exception, the district court agreed with Borden's position on the scope of the available remedies. To redress past harms, the district court ordered Borden 1) to reimburse the plaintiffs for medical expenses that they incurred which would have been covered by the Plan; 2) to pay the difference between plaintiffs' payments for substitute insurance and the amount they would have paid had they continued membership in the Plan, and 3) to pay the medical expenses of Guiseppe Paone (the one exception). The district court ordered Borden to treat \"[e]ach of the plaintiffs...as if he or she had retired on April 8, 1993, with an effective retirement date of May 1, 1993.\" The district court chose the April 8, 1993 date because Borden sold the Deran division to GAB on this date and ostensibly arranged for GAB to continue benefits equivalent to those provided under the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To provide prospective relief, the district court ordered Borden to give the plaintiffs the opportunity for reinstatement to the Plan. It did not give the plaintiffs the option of choosing the cash value of insurance coverage instead of reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any plaintiff who did not waive retiree coverage under the Borden, Inc. Total Family Protection Plan (\"The Plan\"), who was not terminated from the Plan for nonpayment of premiums or other failure to comply with Plan requirements (such failure not to include working for a successor employer), and who has requested reinstatement to the Plan in accordance with the Court's orders, will be deemed eligible for retiree medical insurance and retiree life insurance under the terms of the Plan as if he or she had retired effective May 1, 1993. Plaintiffs who have elected reinstatement will be responsible for health insurance premiums and other contributions at levels they would be paying today if they had retired on April 8, 1993, and those plaintiffs will receive medical and life insurance benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This prospective reinstatement is real. That is, it permits plaintiffs to renew insurance coverage under the Borden Plan for future protection. The retrospective reinstatement is constructive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> That is, it is a remedial device which permits the court to award benefits due under the terms of the Plan for the period of wrongful termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Remedies Available Under ERISA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two civil enforcement provisions of ERISA are relevant to this appeal. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a). The first permits a beneficiary \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his Plan . . . .\" Id. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B) (\"a(1)\"). The second provides that \"a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\" may sue \"(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the Plan.\" Id. &#167; 1132(a)(3) (\"a(3)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that their requests for disgorgement and for the opportunity to receive the cash value of reinstatement are \"appropriate equitable relief\" under Section a(3). The statutory language invites a two-step inquiry to evaluate this claim: 1) is the proposed relief equitable, and 2) if so, is it appropriate? We address each question in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that, in the context of ERISA, \"equitable relief\" includes \"those categories of relief that were typically available in equity (such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution, but not compensatory damages).\" Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112867\"><a href=\"/opinion/112867/mertens-v-hewitt-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 256 (1993) (emphasis in original). Although both damages and restitution may remedy the same injury, \"[d]amages differs from restitution in that damages is measured by the plaintiff's loss; restitution is measured by the defendant's unjust gain.\"  Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#167; 3.1, at 208 (2d ed. 1993). Restitution is an equitable remedy \"providing a tool for courts to use when one party 'has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another.'\" Kwatcher v. Mass. Serv. Employees' Pension Fund, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526436\"><a href=\"/opinion/526436/george-kwatcher-v-massachusetts-service-employees-pension-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span>, 967 (1st Cir. 1989), quoting Restatement of the Law of Restitution &#167; 1 (1937). The plaintiffs have characterized the bulk of the relief they seek on appeal--approximately $2.8 million in premiums which Borden would have had to pay had it covered the plaintiffs over the time period in question--as unjust enrichment, the disgorgement of which is restitution. They also justify their proposed prospective remedy (giving plaintiffs the choice between reinstatement to the Plan or its cash value) as a way of avoiding unjust enrichment by Borden. By measuring relief with reference to the amount Borden has gained (and would gain) by terminating coverage, the plaintiffs propose equitable relief in the form of restitution to prevent unjust enrichment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, such relief is not \"appropriate equitable relief\" within the meaning of ERISA. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). Clarifying the holding in Mertens, the Supreme Court has ruled that Section a(3)'s \"'catchall' provisions act as a safety net, offering appropriate equitable relief for injuries caused by violations that &#167; [1132] does not elsewhere adequately remedy.\" Varity Corp. v. Howe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118008\"><a href=\"/opinion/118008/varity-corp-v-howe/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 512 (1996). Varity circumscribes the applicability of Section a(3); \"[W]here Congress elsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary's injury, there will likely be no need for further equitable relief . . . .\" Id. at 515.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this guidance, federal courts have uniformly concluded that, if a plaintiff can pursue benefits under the plan pursuant to Section a(1), there is an adequate remedy under the plan which bars a further remedy under Section a(3). See, e.g., Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197611\"><a href=\"/opinion/197611/turner-v-fallon/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that beneficiary denied benefits could not sue under Section a(3) since the claim was \"specifically addressed by [Section a(1)]\"); Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741728\"><a href=\"/opinion/741728/1997-1-trade-cases-p-71818-97-cal-daily-op-serv-3865-97-daily-journal/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1467</span></a></span>, 1475 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that \"[e]quitable relief under section 1132(a)(3) is not 'appropriate' because section 1132(a)(1) provides an adequate remedy in this case.\"); Wald v.

As the Eighth Circuit has stated, when the plaintiff can \"bring a claim for benefits under [Section a(1)], . . . equitable relief would not be appropriate . . . [and] she does not have a cause of action under [Section a(3)].\" Wald, 83 F.3d at 1006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Challenging the import of these cases, the plaintiffs argue that equitable relief has been awarded pursuant to Section a(3) in a number of other cases. They point to Jackson v. Truck Drivers Union Local 42 Health and Welfare Fund, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741962\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741962/jackson-v-truck-driversunion-local-42/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span> (D.Mass. 1996), United Steelworkers of America v. Newman-Crosby Steel, Inc., 822 F. Supp 862 (D.R.I. 1993), and Ream v. Frey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736208\"><a href=\"/opinion/736208/jeffrey-ream-v-jeffrey-e-frey-fulton-bank-laurie-l-frey-fulton-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1997). The plaintiffs here, like those in Jackson, United Steelworkers, and Ream, were not members of a plan (and therefore were not eligible for relief under Section a(1)) when they filed suit. However, the plaintiffs in Jackson, United Steel Workers, and Ream were permanently ineligible for a remedy pursuant to Section a(1) because none of these cases involved a functioning plan. The plaintiffs here were only ineligible for a remedy pursuant to Section a(1) because they were not members of the Plan when they filed suit. Although some of the plaintiffs may not want prospective reinstatement in the Plan because they distrust Borden, Inc., none have disclaimed their interest in the opportunity for reinstatement. Moreover, they have presented no evidence to demonstrate that the Borden Plan is not a viable plan that can pay them the benefits they are due under its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court faced a situation similar to that presented in Varity and adopted a comparable remedy. In Varity, the Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's reinstatement of plaintiffs who had been improperly terminated from their Plan. 516 U.S. at 515. The Supreme Court observed that \"[t]he plaintiffs in this case could not proceed under [Section a(1)] because they were no longer members of [their] plan and, therefore, had no benefits due [them] under the terms of [the] plan [pursuant to Section a(1)],\" and that \"[t]hey must rely on [Section a(3)] or they have no remedy at all.\" Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Here, once the district court mandated the plaintiffs' constructive reinstatement (and opportunity for actual reinstatement) to the Plan pursuant to Section a(3), the plaintiffs' claims were governed by the terms of the Plan, as Section a(1) provides.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Plaintiffs invoke the collateral source rule to challenge this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The collateral source rule has traditionally provided \"'that benefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that defendant's liability for damages.'\" Lussier v. Runyon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692275\"><a href=\"/opinion/692275/thomas-r-lussier-v-marvin-runyon-united-states-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span>, 1107 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#167; 3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993)). The plaintiffs argue that the collateral source rule makes Borden liable for all of their medical bills, even if alternative sources of insurance have already paid for them. However, ERISA preempts state legislation designed to limit plans' subrogation and coordination of benefits provisions. See FMC Corp. v. Holliday, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112508\"><a href=\"/opinion/112508/fmc-corp-v-holliday/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (1990); Travitz v.

Such preemption applies a fortiori to state common law doctrines (like the collateral source rule) which purportedly alter the benefit limitation provisions of a plan. See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111858\"><a href=\"/opinion/111858/pilot-life-ins-co-v-dedeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 52-57 (1987) (precluding both state claims to recover benefits under an ERISA plan and state claims to recover compensation for harms suffered because of improper denial of such benefits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the insurance benefits which are the collateral source subject to the Borden Plan were available only because some of the plaintiffs obtained new insurance coverage in light of the improper termination of their insurance coverage by Borden. The fact remains, however, that this insurance falls under the purview of the coordination of benefits provisions of the Borden Plan. The plaintiffs who obtained alternative sources of insurance were, in effect, mitigating their damages. The law often obliges the victim of a breach of contract to mitigate damages. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 350 cmt. b (1981). The Borden Plan expressly precludes reimbursement under its coordination of benefits provisions when a claimant's bills are paid by a collateral source. Therefore, the district court ruled properly that a claimant whose medical bills have been paid collaterally cannot demand that the Plan reimburse the claimant for these bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Congressional Balance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its rulings against the plaintiffs, the district court recognized that the relief it ordered did not address fully plaintiffs' grievances: \"Were it not for the limits on remedies imposed by ERISA and by its judicial interpretation, [plaintiffs'] arguments would likely merit the remedy [they] seek.\" This apt observation reflects the balance struck by Congress in its passage of ERISA. Congress wanted to protect contractually defined benefits. See Russell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111499\"><a href=\"/opinion/111499/massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 148 and n.16 (1985) (citing 120 Cong. Rec. 29196 (1974), reprinted in 3 Subcommittee on Labor and Public Welfare of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, p. 4665 (Comm. Print 1976) (\"Leg. Hist.\"); 119 Cong.Rec. 30041 (1973), 2 Leg. Hist. 1633). But \"Congress was [also] concerned lest the cost of federal standards discourage the growth of private pension plans.\" Id. at 148 and n.17 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 93-533, at 1, 9 (1973), 2 Leg. Hist. 2348, 2356; 120 Cong. Rec. 29949 (1974), 3 Leg. Hist. 4791; 120 Cong. Rec. 29210-29211 (1974), 3 Leg. Hist. 4706-4707). Given Congress's careful attention to this balance, the Supreme Court has limited the remedies available pursuant to the \"appropriate equitable relief\" provisions of ERISA. Here, ERISA's civil enforcement provisions and their subsequent judicial interpretation required the district court to craft a remedy limited to the benefits due to the plaintiffs under the Plan. No matter how the plaintiffs choose to label their demands on appeal, they are not \"appropriate equitable relief\" authorized by ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered Borden to pay past benefits due under the terms of the Plan for all of the plaintiffs but one, the estate of Guiseppe Paone. Mr. Paone died in 1994 after incurring approximately $258,000 of medical expenses at the New England Medical Center (NEMC). The Plan administrator denied coverage, and NEMC unsuccessfully attempted to obtain payment from both Great American Brands and the Paone estate. Although NEMC could have sued Paone's estate to try to recover the money, it did not, and any potential claim for these funds from Mr. Paone's estate is now time-barred. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 197, &#167; 9 (establishing one-year statute of repose for claims against estates).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded Paone's medical expenses to his estate, to be held in trust for NEMC, stating that \"[t]his is a case where 'equity will treat that as done which ought to have been done'\" (citation omitted). The court noted that \"the executrix of Paone's estate, Antonietta LaRocca, attests that his unpaid debt desecrates her father's memory and that she wishes to receive reimbursement from Borden in trust for NEMC, as her father would never have considered not paying a debt that he owed.\" Although the district court did not specifically cite Section a(3) as the basis for its award to the estate, the court's reference to equity suggests that this provision was the basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order and final judgment, the district court ruled that \"Each of the plaintiffs will be treated as if he or she had retired on April 8, 1993, with an effective retirement date of May 1, 1993.\" As a complement to this order of constructive reinstatement, the court ordered that \"Borden, Inc. will pay or cause to be paid by the Plan to designated plaintiffs the amount specified in Exhibit A hereto.\" One of the designated plaintiffs is Guiseppe Paone. Once a plaintiff like Mr. Paone was constructively reinstated pursuant to Section a(3), the terms of the Plan governed the relief he (or his estate) was due pursuant to Section a(1). The Plan expressly prohibits benefit payments for \"services for which there is no charge or legal obligation to pay.\" Plan &#167;&#167; 6.14(s) and 15.11(e). Since the Plan does not cover the bills of someone who does not have to pay them, it bars the relief ordered by the district court for the Paone estate in trust for NEMC. Therefore, we must vacate the district court's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the district court abused its discretion by denying them the opportunity to add RICO and state law claims to their complaint. The district court concluded that such an amendment would be futile. Plaintiffs argue that a recently decided Supreme Court case, Humana Inc. v. Forsyth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118258\"><a href=\"/opinion/118258/humana-inc-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span> (1999), made their RICO and state law claims viable. We do not address this issue, choosing to affirm the district court's ruling on the basis of timeliness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the plaintiff in Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of Puerto Rico, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198100\"><a href=\"/opinion/198100/acosta-mestre-v-hilton-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1998), the plaintiffs here assert that \"mere delay is not reason enough to deny a motion for leave to amend.\" Id. at 52. Such an argument is \"contrary to Supreme Court and circuit precedent [holding that]...'undue delay' in seeking the amendment may be a sufficient basis for denying leave to amend.\" Id. (quoting Foman v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span> (1962)). The plaintiffs filed the motion to amend after discovery had been completed and after the court had issued an all-but-dispositive ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment. They were given leave twice earlier to amend their complaint. The decision whether to grant leave to amend lies within the District Court's discretion. See Judge v. City of Lowell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759120\"><a href=\"/opinion/759120/rebecca-judge-v-city-of-lowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir. 1998). Given the plaintiffs' delay, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to amend the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA has generated a complex body of law governing the scope of remedies available to those wrongly terminated from plans covered by ERISA. For the most part, the district court applied the law to this case correctly by limiting relief to the benefits due under the Plan. However, the district court could not, as a matter of law, grant further equitable relief to the Paone estate because it is not eligible for benefits under the terms of the Plan. We therefore deny the relief sought by the plaintiffs in their appeal and grant the relief sought by Borden in its cross-appeal, vacating the award to Guiseppe Paone's estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So Ordered.

In March 1996, all parties stipulated to the dismissal of the claims against Metropolitan Life. In September 1999, the District Court granted Northern Trust's motion for summary judgment on all counts because Northern acted as a directed trustee, merely holding Plan assets.

The plaintiffs use these allegations of harm to justify their demand for restitution. They do not seek compensation for these harms in the form of damages that are measured by the losses inflicted by the harm. Plaintiffs understand that Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell precludes such claims for extracontractual damages under ERISA. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.

They argue that they still deserve to recover the employer's contributions which Borden failed to make because \"the Plan coverage itself is the 'benefit due' to the retirees and spouses.\" This argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding: the benefit due from an insurance plan is the benefit paid in case a covered event occurs, not the coverage itself.
