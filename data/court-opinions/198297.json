As a preliminary matter, we conclude that to the\r\nextent that the appellant here is an individual, and not the\r\ncorporate entity of which he is an officer, we have no jurisdiction\r\nto hear these appeals.  See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 123 F.3d\r\n695, 696-99 (1st Cir. 1997); Jones v. Board of Governors, 79 F.3d\r\n1168, 1170 (D.C. Cir. 1997); In re Dein Host, Inc., 835 F.2d 402,\r\n404-06 (1st Cir. 1987).  To that extent, these appeals must be\r\ndismissed.  \r\nWe further conclude that, to the extent that the appellant\r\nhere is the corporate entity, we have jurisdiction.  See Grand Jury\r\nSubpoenas, 123 F.3d at 696-99.  To that extent, we have carefully\r\nreviewed the sealed briefs and record, and we affirm the October 5\r\nand 28, 1998 orders denying the motions to quash, essentially for\r\nthe reasons stated by the district court in those orders.\r\nAppeals dismissed in part, and orders affirmed.  See 1st Cir.\r\nLoc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                          -2-\n",
