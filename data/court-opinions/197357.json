Appellant James  Benjamin, Jr.,  M.D.\r                                \r\n\nappeals  from the  decision  of the  district court  granting\r\n\nsummary judgment  to appellees, The  Aroostook Medical Center\r\n\n(\"TAMC\") and various physicians  associated with TAMC.  After\r\n\ncarefully reviewing  the record  and the parties'  briefs, we\r\n\naffirm  the district  court's  judgment  for essentially  the\r\n\nreasons stated in its  published opinion reported at Benjamin\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Aroostook Med. Ctr., 937 F.Supp. 957 (D.Me. 1996).  We add\r                                  \r\n\nthe following comments.\r\n\n          1.  Appellant's claim that the individual appellees\r\n\nconspired to restrain trade in violation  of 15 U.S.C.   1 is\r\n\nanalyzed under the \"rule of reason.\"  See Flegel v. Christian\r                                                                         \r\n\nHosp., Northeast-Northwest,  4 F.3d 682, 686  (8th Cir. 1993)\r                                      \r\n\n(the  courts   of  appeals  usually  review   the  denial  or\r\n\nrevocation  of  hospital   privileges,  especially  in  cases\r\n\ninvolving  individual  determinations of  incompetence, under\r\n\nthe  rule of  reason)  (citing cases).    We agree  that  the\r\n\nappellant did  not make any  showing of harm  to competition,\r\n\neither directly  or by  reasonable inference.   Thus, summary\r\n\njudgment  was appropriate.   See  Rebel  Oil Co.  v. Atlantic\r                                                                         \r\n\nRichfield Co., 51  F.3d 1421, 1435 (9th  Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n116 S.Ct. 515 (1995).\r\n\n          2. Because the facts upon which appellant bases his\r\n\nclaim  of discrimination  concerning  his contract  with TAMC\r\n\noccurred after 1991,  the claim is cognizable under 42 U.S.C.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n   1981.   See    1981(b).   After  reviewing the  record and\r                          \r\n\nappellant's  arguments  on  appeal,  however,  we  find  that\r\n\nappellant  has   failed  to  show   that  TAMC  intentionally\r\n\ndiscriminated against  him based  on  his race.   See  Ayala-\r                                                                         \r\n\nGerena  v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1996). \r\n\n          3.  Appellant's claim of malicious abuse of process\r\n\nis barred by the  doctrine of res judicata.  Under Maine law,\r\n\nres judicata  bars the relitigation  of issues that  were, or\r\n\ncould  have been, decided in a prior  case if:  \"(1) the same\r\n\nparties  or their privies are involved in both actions; (2) a\r\n\nvalid final judgment was entered in the prior action; and (3)\r\n\nthe matters  present for  decision  now were,  or might  have\r\n\nbeen,  litigated in the prior  action.\"  Currier  v. Cyr, 570\r                                                                    \r\n\nA.2d 1205, 1208 (Me. 1990).\r\n\n          In  1996,  the  Maine  Supreme  Judicial Court,  on\r\n\nappeal from  a lower  court's decision adverse  to appellant,\r\n\nheld  that TAMC  was immune  from appellant's state  law tort\r\n\nclaims  concerning  the peer  review  process.   Benjamin  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nAroostook  Medical  Ctr.,  Law  Docket  No.  Aro-95-569  (Me.\r                                    \r\n\nNovember 14, 1996).   In so holding, the court  relied on the\r\n\nfederal  Health Care  Quality Improvement  Act, 42  U.S.C.   \r\n\n11101-11152, and  the state Health Security  Act, 24 M.R.S.A.\r\n\n    2501-2511.    Appellant's  claim  in  the  case at  hand,\r\n\nalthough not precisely articulated,  also centers on the peer\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nreview process -- i.e., the filing by TAMC of allegedly false\r\n\nreports  with the  National  Practitioner Data  Bank and  the\r\n\nMaine State Medical Board.\r\n\n          Res judicata  applies to  the case at  hand because\r\n\nthe parties to  both the  state and federal  actions are  the\r\n\nsame and  the Supreme Judicial  Court's decision  is a  valid\r\n\nfinal judgment.   Further, there is  no reason why  appellant\r\n\ncould not have litigated in the state action the claim he now\r\n\npresents.  The  fact that  the state action  was premised  on\r\n\nstate  tort law  while  the federal  case  was based  on  the\r\n\nConstitution does not matter.  Currier, 570 A.2d at 1205.\r                                                  \r\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons, the  judgment  of the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
