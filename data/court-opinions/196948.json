BACKGROUND\r                                    I. BACKGROUND\r                                                 \r\n\n          On February 3, 1994,  Blais was arrested in Providence,\r\n\nRhode Island, after Providence police discovered a firearm in his\r\n\napartment.  On May 27, 1994, a federal grand jury returned a one-\r\n\ncount indictment charging Blais with being a felon in  possession\r\n\nof a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  On June 29,\r\n\n1994,  Blais  filed a  motion to  suppress,  which was  denied on\r\n\nOctober 12, 1994.\r\n\n          Viewed  in the  light  most favorable  to the  verdict,\r\n\nUnited  States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 438 (1st Cir. 1995), the\r                                    \r\n\nfollowing facts could have been found by a reasonable jury.  O  n\r\n\nFebruary  3,  1994, Providence  Police  Reserve  Officers Timothy\r\n\nDupuis  (\"Officer Dupuis\") and  David Paolino (\"Officer Paolino\")\r\n\nwent to 160 Benedict Street, a Providence Housing Authority high-\r\n\nrise  apartment   building,  in  response   to  a  report   of  a\r\n\ndisturbance.    The  complainant,  Geraldine  McGill  (\"McGill\"),\r\n\nalleged that  Blais had  threatened her verbally  and physically,\r\n\nand  that he possessed a  firearm.  In  response, Officer Dupuis,\r\n\nOfficer  Paolino and  a security  guard, Alan  Rivera (\"Rivera\"),\r\n\nheaded for Blais's  apartment.   Officer Dupuis  walked down  the\r\n\nhallway  first, and he spotted  a man, whom  he later learned was\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nBlais,  carrying  a  handgun.   After  seeing  the  man enter  an\r\n\napartment, Officers  Dupuis and Paolino  knocked on the  door and\r\n\nannounced that they were  police officers.  Failing to  receive a\r\n\nresponse, they  again  knocked and  announced  their  identities,\r\n\nafter  which  the  apartment's  occupant  asked  who  was  there.\r\n\nOfficer  Dupuis again stated that it  was the police.  Failing to\r\n\nobtain any  further response, the officers  knocked and announced\r\n\nthemselves a third time.  In response to another inquiry, Officer\r\n\nDupuis stated that it was the police and that the occupant should\r\n\nopen the door.  At this point, Blais opened the  door and invited\r\n\nthem in, saying, \"Come on in, I'll talk to you in my apartment.\"\r\n\n          Officers  Dupuis and  Paolino,  and then  later Rivera,\r\n\nentered the apartment, which consisted of a single open room that\r\n\nfunctioned  as a  bedroom,  living room  and  dining room.    The\r\n\nofficers proceeded  to question Blais, who  appeared intoxicated,\r\n\nabout  the incident  with  McGill.   At  some point  during  this\r\n\nquestioning, Blais sat down on the corner of the bed, and Officer\r\n\nDupuis spotted a firearm lying on the bed behind Blais.\r\n\n          At trial,  the parties  stipulated as to  Blais's prior\r\n\nconviction of  a crime punishable by a term of more than one year\r\n\nin prison prior to February 3, 1994, and on November 8, 1994, the\r\n\njury returned a verdict of guilty on the indictment's lone count.\r\n\nOn January 11, 1995, Judge Lisi sentenced Blais to 235 months  in\r\n\nprison, as well as  a 5-year term of  supervised release and  the\r\n\nstatutory assessments.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                          II. DISCUSSION\r                                    II. DISCUSSION\r                                                  \r\n\n          Blais  makes four  types of  argument.   The first  set\r\n\nhinges  on  his contention  that, in  light  of United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nL pez,       U.S.     , 115  S.  Ct.  1624,  1626-27 (1995),  his\r               \r\n\nindictment,  his   jury  instructions  and   his  conviction  are\r\n\nunconstitutional, or, failing that, the government failed to meet\r\n\nits  burden  under L pez  with respect  to  showing an  effect on\r                                  \r\n\ninterstate commerce.  Second, Blais contests the district court's\r\n\ndenial  of  his motion  to suppress.    Third, he  challenges the\r\n\ndistrict court's  denial of his motion  for exculpatory evidence.\r\n\nFourth, and finally, he  argues that the district court  erred by\r\n\nrefusing to limit or identify which of Blais's  prior convictions\r\n\nit would allow  the government  to introduce if  he were to  deny\r\n\ncommitting the present offense.\r\n\n         A.  The Constitutionality of Section 922(g)(1),\r                   A.  The Constitutionality of Section 922(g)(1),\r\n             Interstate Commerce and Related Arguments\r                       Interstate Commerce and Related Arguments\r\n\n          Blais  makes four  related arguments  regarding section\r\n\n922(g)(1)  and the issue of whether his conviction is pursuant to\r\n\na proper exercise of the power of the federal government.  Citing\r\n\nL pez,     U.S.    , 115 S. Ct. 1624, Blais argues that:  (1) the\r               \r\n\nstatute   under   which  he   was   charged   and  convicted   is\r\n\nunconstitutional; (2)  his indictment  was defective for  lack of\r\n\nany allegation of effect on interstate commerce; (3) the jury was\r\n\nimproperly  instructed in  a manner that  omitted any  element of\r\n\nsubstantial effect  on interstate commerce; and  (4) the district\r\n\ncourt erred in  denying his  motion for a  judgment of  acquittal\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nbased on the  Government's failure to meet its  burden to show an\r\n\neffect on interstate commerce.\r\n\n          In L pez,  the Supreme  Court struck down  the Gun-Free\r                            \r\n\nSchool Zones Act, 18  U.S.C.   922(q), which prohibited  a person\r\n\nfrom possessing  a gun while in a \"school zone.\"  L pez,     U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat    , 115  S. Ct. at 1631; see United  States v. McAllister, 77\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 387,  389 (1st Cir. 1996).   The Court held  that in passing\r\n\nsection 922(q),  Congress exceeded  its power under  the Commerce\r\n\nClause because that statute was\r\n\n            not  an  essential   part  of  a   larger\r\n            regulation of economic activity, in which\r\n            the regulatory scheme  could be  undercut\r\n            unless   the  intrastate   activity  were\r\n            regulated.    It  cannot,  therefore,  be\r\n            sustained   under  our   cases  upholding\r\n            regulations of activities that  arise out\r\n            of  or are  connected  with a  commercial\r\n            transaction,   which    viewed   in   the\r\n            aggregate,      substantially     affects\r\n            interstate commerce.\r\n\nL pez,     U.S.  at    , 115  S. Ct. at  1631.  Blais's  argument\r               \r\n\nwith respect to section  922(g)(1) is essentially that:   (1) the\r\n\nstatute provides that it is unlawful for a felon\r\n\n            to  ship  or transport  in  interstate or\r\n            foreign  commerce,  or   possess  in   or\r                                                               \r\n            affecting   commerce,   any  firearm   or\r                                          \r\n            ammunition; or to receive any firearms or\r\n            ammunition  which  has  been  shipped  or\r\n            transported in interstate commerce,\r\n\n18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1)  (emphasis added); and (2)  this court should\r\n\nnot assume  that Congress  must have meant  \"affecting interstate\r                                                                           \r\n\ncommerce\"  when  it said  \"affecting  commerce\"  with respect  to\r\n\nfirearm possession by a felon.  As a result, claims Blais, he was\r\n\ncharged pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          However,   Blais's   challenge    to   the    statute's\r\n\nconstitutionality  is foreclosed  by previous  decisions of  this\r\n\ncourt.   Since L pez,  this court has  twice ruled  that a facial\r                              \r\n\nchallenge to the  constitutionality of the  statute at issue,  18\r\n\nU.S.C. 922(g)(1), is \"hopeless on . . . the law.\"\r\n\nUnited States v.

We also\r\n\nnote in  passing that, confronting a  L pez-based challenge, this\r                                                     \r\n\ncourt also has upheld charges for possession of a firearm with an\r\n\nobliterated   serial  number   under  18   U.S.C.      922(k)  as\r\n\nconstitutional,  and that statute's  language, like  the language\r\n\nBlais  challenges, also makes it unlawful for a felon to \"possess\r\n\nin or  affecting commerce,  any firearm  or ammunition.\"   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. D az-Mart nez, 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                 \r\n\n          Given the constitutionality of  the statute, we believe\r\n\nthat  the  indictment and  the  jury  instructions are  similarly\r\n\nvalid,  since  both  tracked  the  language  of  the  statute  in\r\n\nquestion.   Furthermore, the district court read to the jury both\r\n\nthe statute  and the  indictment and specifically  instructed the\r\n\njury that  as one of the  elements of the crime  in question, the\r\n\nprosecution  had to  prove  beyond a  reasonable  doubt that  the\r\n\nfirearm had  been  in  or affecting  interstate  commerce.    The\r                                                         \r\n\ndistrict court stated that \"[t]he Government may  meet its burden\r\n\nwith  respect to  this element  by proving  a connection  or link\r\n\nbetween interstate  commerce and the possession  of the firearm.\"\r\n\nThe court  went on  to state  that  \"[i]t is  sufficient for  the\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nGovernment  to satisfy  this element to  prove that  the firearm,\r\n\nallegedly  possessed  by  the  Defendant,  had[,]  at  some  time\r\n\npreviously,  travelled  across a  state  line\"  -- a  proposition\r\n\nsupported by the Supreme Court's holding in Scarborough, 431 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  575 (holding, under  the predecessor statute  to   922(g)(1),\r\n\nthat  proof that  the possessed  firearm previously  travelled in\r\n\ninterstate  commerce was  sufficient  to  establish  an  adequate\r\n\ninterstate nexus).\r\n\n          Blais also  argues that the district  court should have\r\n\nallowed his motion  for a  judgment of acquittal  on the  grounds\r\n\nthat the government's sole evidence  on the element of \"affecting\r\n\ninterstate  commerce\" was  the  out-of-state manufacture  of  the\r\n\nhandgun.   Having  already rejected  his arguments  about L pez's\r                                                                         \r\n\nalteration  of  the Scarborough  standard  of  minimal nexus,  we\r                                         \r\n\nconclude  that  the  evidence  proffered by  the  government  was\r\n\nsufficient to meet  its required  showing of  minimal nexus  with\r\n\ninterstate  commerce.  See  McAllister, 77 F.3d  at 390 (evidence\r                                                \r\n\nthat a gun had previously travelled in interstate commerce before\r\n\nfelon's possession  held sufficient to meet  required showing for\r\n\nminimal  nexus).   As a  result, we  uphold the  district court's\r\n\ndenial of Blais's motion for a judgment of acquittal.\r\n\n                    B.  The Motion to Suppress\r                              B.

Zapata, 18 F.3d 971,\r                                                             \r\n\n975 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Prior to  trial, Blais  moved to suppress  the evidence\r\n\nobtained during the officers' February 3 visit  to his apartment.\r\n\nBased on  the facts  presented at  the  evidentiary hearing,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  denied Blais's suppression motion.   The district\r\n\ncourt  rested its conclusion on the findings that the totality of\r\n\nthe   circumstances  established   that  Blais   voluntarily  and\r\n\nknowingly  invited the  police officers  into his  apartment, and\r\n\nthat the officers saw the gun lying on the bed in plain view.  \r\n\n          We agree  with the  district court's denial  of Blais's\r\n\nmotion  to suppress.  Based  on the testimony  of Officer Dupuis,\r\n\nOfficer  Paolino  and Rivera,  the  evidence  at the  suppression\r\n\nhearing reasonably  supported the  district court's  finding that\r\n\nBlais  gave his  consent  to entry,  and  that that  consent  was\r\n\nvoluntary.  Blais argues  that the officers failed to  advise him\r\n\nof his right to deny entry.  However, while the failure to inform\r\n\nan individual that he has a right to withhold consent is a factor\r\n\nto be weighed in  determining the issue of voluntariness,  such a\r\n\nfailure does  not   preclude a  finding of  valid  consent.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSchneckloth  v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S.  218, 245 (1973); Zapata, 18\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 977.  The district court also properly rejected any claim\r\n\nof coercion.   While  Blais claims  that  the circumstances  were\r\n\ninherently coercive  because he was a  69-year-old man confronted\r\n\nby  two officers and a  security guard, the  evidence showed that\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthe three  men did not enter  until Blais invited them  in on his\r\n\nown initiative.  As a result, we conclude that the district court\r\n\ndid  not commit error in finding that Blais admitted the officers\r\n\nand the security guard into his apartment voluntarily.\r\n\n          The  district   court  found  that   testimony  at  the\r\n\nsuppression hearing  also showed that the  firearm discovered was\r\n\nlying on the bed in plain view of the officers as they questioned\r\n\nBlais.   Defendant's argument  that the district  court erred  in\r\n\nmaking this finding is based on a challenge to the credibility of\r\n\nthe  officers  and  the  security guard.    However,  credibility\r\n\ndeterminations are for the district court, not  us, to make.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States v.

And even if  the testimony in\r                      \r\n\nquestion  is,  as  Blais  argues, subject  to  another  plausible\r\n\nreading, the  district court's  choice of  one  of two  competing\r\n\ninterpretations  of the  evidence  cannot  be clearly  erroneous.\r\n\nUnited States v. Cruz-Jim nez, 894 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                       \r\n\n          Because we conclude that the district  court's findings\r\n\nof invited entry and plain view were not erroneous, we affirm its\r\n\ndenial of Blais's motion to suppress. \r\n\n             C.  The Motion for Exculpatory Evidence\r                       C.  The Motion for Exculpatory Evidence\r\n\n          Blais  contends  that  the   district  court  erred  in\r\n\nquashing certain  subpoenas issued  for the  suppression hearing.\r\n\nOn appeal, Blais points  to quashed subpoenas for arrest  records\r\n\nand reports  of the  Providence Police Department,  including the\r\n\nreport of the officers' interview with McGill.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          First,  Blais argues  that  the Jencks  Act, 18  U.S.C.\r\n\n  3500,  entitles  him to  these  documents.   However,  the  Act\r\n\n\"establishes procedures whereby a criminal defendant may exercise\r\n\nhis  limited   right  to  obtain  previous   statements  made  by\r\n\ngovernment  witnesses that are  in the  possession of  the United\r\n\nStates  to be used for  impeachment purposes.\"   United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nNeal,  36 F.3d  1190, 1197  (1st Cir.  1994).   McGill was  not a\r              \r\n\ngovernment  witness and did not  testify.  The  statements of all\r\n\nthe witnesses  who did  testify at  the suppression  hearing were\r\n\nturned over.  \r\n\n          Second,   Blais   contends   that    the   sought-after\r\n\ninformation constituted  material he was entitled  to under Brady\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Maryland,  373  U.S.  83 (1963),  for  impeachment  purposes.\r                      \r\n\nHowever,  Brady  error  occurs  when  the  government  suppresses\r                         \r\n\n\"material\"  information that  is favorable  to the defense.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGilday  v.  Callahan, 59  F.3d 257,  267  (1st Cir.  1995), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied,  116 S. Ct. 1269  (1996).  Information  is \"material\" \"if\r                \r\n\nthere is  a reasonable  probability that,  had the  evidence been\r\n\ndisclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have\r\n\nbeen  different.\"   United States  v. Bagley,  473 U.S.  667, 682\r                                                      \r\n\n(1985).  Blais has failed to articulate any  theory demonstrating\r\n\nsuch a reasonable probability.\r\n\n          In  fact,  Blais has  failed to  show  that any  of the\r\n\nadditional arrest  records or police  reports that he  seeks even\r\n\nexist.     Indeed,  McGill's   statement  could  not   have  been\r\n\nexculpatory.   While  her  complaint  was  the  impetus  for  the\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nofficers'  and the  security guard's  visit, her  statement could\r\n\nhave had no relevance  to the issues at the  suppression hearing:\r\n\nwhether Blais admitted the  officers to his apartment voluntarily\r\n\nand  whether the  firearm was  in plain  view.   As a  result, we\r\n\nuphold  the district court's  decision to quash  the subpoenas at\r\n\nissue.\r\n\n                  D.  Blais's Prior Convictions\r                            D.  Blais's Prior Convictions\r\n\n          Blais also  contends that  the district court  erred by\r\n\nfailing  to  explain more  fully its  ruling  with regard  to the\r\n\nadmissibility of  his prior convictions.  The  ruling in question\r\n\nwas rendered in response  to Blais's motion in limine  to exclude\r\n\ncriminal convictions greater than ten years old.   The government\r\n\nobjected,  filing  a  memorandum  in support,  arguing  that  the\r\n\nconvictions  should   be  admissible  for  impeachment  of  Blais\r\n\npursuant to  Federal Rule of  Evidence 609.   In the course  of a\r\n\nhearing on the motion,  the government withdrew its  objection to\r\n\nthe  exclusion of all  previous convictions save  four which fell\r\n\nwithin the  ten-year limit because  Blais had been  released from\r\n\nhis  prison  term  for  those  convictions  less  than  ten years\r\n\npreviously.  By doing so, the government cleared the way  for the\r\n\nexclusion  of  a  number  of Blais's  previous  convictions  that\r\n\ninvolved the use or  possession of firearms.  The  district court\r\n\nruled that  three convictions (for armed  robbery, kidnapping and\r\n\ndriving away in an automobile) could come in.  The district court\r\n\nexplained its ruling to defense counsel as follows:\r\n\n              So  we're  left, [counsel],  with three\r\n            previous convictions, none  of which  are\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n            greater than  ten years  old.   The armed\r\n            robbery,  kidnapping  and the  unlawfully\r\n            driving off  an  auto, which  I'm  ruling\r\n            will   be   admissible  to   impeach  the\r\n            credibility of Mr. Blais should he decide\r\n            to testify  under  609.   Depending  upon\r\n            what Mr.  Blais  says on  the stand,  the\r\n            Government  may  seek  permission of  the\r\n            Court  to  introduce  any  of  the  other\r\n            convictions under another rule.\r\n\nDefense counsel sought further elaboration  as to the last point,\r\n\nasking  whether testimony denying  the firearm  possession charge\r\n\nwould be viewed  by the court  as opening the  door to the  other\r\n\nconvictions.  The court  responded:  \"read the Norton  case.  I'm\r                                                               \r\n\nnot going to do your homework for you.\"\r\n\n          Blais  argues that  the  court's  cryptic reference  to\r\n\nUnited  States v. Norton, 26  F.3d 240 (1st  Cir. 1994), provided\r                                  \r\n\nlittle  guidance,  since Norton  recognizes that  \"[t]he district\r                                         \r\n\ncourt  is vested  with  broad  discretionary  power to  admit  or\r\n\nexclude evidence.\"  Id. at 243.  Reading Norton, we do not agree.\r                                                         \r\n\nThe defendant in  Norton, like  Blais, was charged  with being  a\r                                               \r\n\nfelon-in-possession,  had  a  prior firearm  conviction,  and had\r\n\nsucceeded   in  persuading   the  trial   court  to   exclude  as\r\n\ninadmissible  all his  prior convictions  greater than  ten years\r\n\nold, including his  prior firearm  conviction.   However, in  the\r\n\ncourse  of his testimony, the defendant in Norton denied not only\r                                                           \r\n\npossessing  the gun  identified in  the indictment,  but in  fact\r\n\ndenied having ever possessed a  gun in his life.   The prosecutor\r\n\nsought and was granted permission  to introduce the prior firearm\r\n\nconviction  to  contradict  the defendant's  false  and  material\r\n\ntestimony.  In  upholding the district court's ruling, this court\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nexplained that \"[o]nce Norton denied that he had ever possessed a\r\n\ngun, he  opened the door  to the  issue of his  prior or  present\r\n\nfirearm possession.\"  Id. at 244.   As a result, Norton could not\r                                   \r\n\ncomplain  that he was unfairly  prejudiced by the introduction of\r\n\nthe conviction to show that he lied.  Id. at 244-45.\r                                                   \r\n\n          We conclude that  the district court's  explanation was\r\n\nhardly  cryptic.  While it may have required that Blais's counsel\r\n\ndo some reading, that is certainly not reversible error.\r\n\n                         III. CONCLUSION\r                                   III.
