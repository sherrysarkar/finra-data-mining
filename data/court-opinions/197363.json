She seeks additional damages,\r\n\narguing that several of the district court's factual findings\r\n\nare clearly erroneous.  She  takes particular issue with  the\r\n\ncourt's  finding that prompt  hospitalization would  not have\r\n\nsaved her husband's  life.   She also argues  that the  court\r\n\nerred  in concluding that  her late husband's  estate was not\r\n\nentitled  to any recovery because it was not properly a party\r\n\nto the suit.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n          We recite the facts as found by the  district court\r\n\nafter the three-day bench trial. In May 1989, Vance Robinson,\r\n\na 64-year-old veteran, visited  Dr. Luis Marrero, who ordered\r\n\nlaboratory  tests.   The  tests suggested  that Robinson  had\r\n\nliver cancer.\r\n\n          On  Friday, July 7,  1989, Robinson went  to the VA\r\n\nHospital  in San  Juan  complaining of  a  host of  symptoms,\r\n\nincluding  a  grossly enlarged  abdomen  (ascites)  and acute\r\n\nstomach  pains.   The intake  physician, Dr.  Sylvia Fuertes,\r\n\ndiagnosed Robinson as having  ascites and an occult neoplasm,\r\n\nbut did not note the ascites on his medical record.   She did\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nnot believe that  Robinson's case was  an emergency, but  she\r\n\nrecommended that  he be  admitted immediately as  an elective\r\n\nadmission.  There were no available beds, however, and so she\r\n\ntold Robinson to return on Monday.\r\n\n          Robinson  went to  the  admissions  office  of  the\r\n\nhospital on Monday at 9:00 a.m.   He was not re-examined.  He\r\n\nwaited  there  all  day, but  was  told  there  were no  beds\r\n\navailable.  The same thing happened on Tuesday. That evening,\r\n\nRobinson  was taken  to  the  emergency  room  at  San  Pablo\r\n\nHospital,  where he was admitted as a patient.  The diagnosis\r\n\nwas  ascites, suspected liver cancer, anemia and hepato-renal\r\n\nsyndrome.   A  CT  scan revealed  an  enlarged liver  due  to\r\n\nlesions suggestive of metastatic cancer.\r\n\n          On July  18, Robinson  discharged himself  from the\r\n\nhospital.   He  died  the  next  day.   No  biopsy  was  ever\r\n\nperformed to confirm the diagnosis of suspected liver cancer,\r\n\nand no autopsy  was performed at  the time  of death.   Liver\r\n\ncancer  was listed  as  the  cause  of  death  on  the  death\r\n\ncertificate.\r\n\n          Robinson's  widow,  the  plaintiff  here,  filed an\r\n\nadministrative claim  in her  name against the  United States\r\n\nwith  the  Department of  Veterans  Affairs.   The  claim was\r\n\ndenied, and she filed a complaint in federal court within six\r\n\nmonths.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Over  two years  after Robinson's  death, plaintiff\r\n\nhad the body exhumed so that Dr. Yocasta Brugel could prepare\r\n\na  forensic report.  Dr.  Brugel indicated that  she found no\r\n\nevidence  of liver  cancer  and  that  Robinson had  died  of\r\n\nmyocarditis,  a  rare heart  ailment  which  seldom leads  to\r\n\ndeath.    The  autopsy  was admitted  into  evidence  without\r\n\nobjection.   However, Dr. Brugel  did not appear  at trial to\r\n\ntestify.   The district  court found that  either the autopsy\r\n\nreport was  totally unreliable, or, in  the alternative, that\r\n\nthe  autopsy  had  been   performed  on  someone  other  than\r\n\nRobinson.  The court also found  that the slides of the liver\r\n\non  which the report was  based were not  those of Robinson's\r\n\nliver.\r\n\n          The  district court  concluded that  the hospital's\r\n\nfailure  to admit Robinson on Friday  evening did not violate\r\n\nacceptable  medical  standards.    However,  it   found  that\r\n\nRobinson should have been re-examined when he returned to the\r\n\nhospital on  Monday, to  ensure that  his  condition had  not\r\n\ndeteriorated  to emergency  status, and  concluded  that this\r\n\nomission did violate acceptable  medical standards and caused\r\n\npain  and suffering to Robinson and his wife.  The court also\r\n\nfound  that admitting  Robinson  to the  hospital on  Friday,\r\n\nMonday or Tuesday  would not  have saved his  life but  would\r\n\nhave  permitted palliative  treatment  to ease  his pain  and\r\n\nsuffering.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The court awarded  plaintiff $50  thousand for  her\r\n\npain  and suffering  as she  watched her  husband's condition\r\n\ndeteriorate  during  the three  days  before  he was  finally\r\n\nadmitted to a  hospital.  The  district court also  indicated\r\n\nthat it  would have  awarded an  additional $50  thousand for\r\n\nRobinson's pain and suffering if his estate had been named as\r\n\na plaintiff.\r\n\n          Plaintiff appeals on  several grounds.  She  argues\r\n\nthat  the district  court's  finding that  the VA  Hospital's\r\n\nfailure  to  admit Robinson  was not  the  cause of  death is\r\n\nclearly erroneous,  as was the district  court's finding that\r\n\nthe autopsy report  was totally unreliable.   She also argues\r\n\nthat  the court erred in refusing to award pain and suffering\r\n\ndamages  to the  decedent's estate:  she contends  that under\r\n\nPuerto  Rico law, when a man dies intestate (as did Robinson)\r\n\nhis widow and children are his heirs.  She concludes that she\r\n\nand  her  sons  should  have received  the  $50  thousand the\r\n\ndistrict court indicated it would have awarded for Robinson's\r\n\npain and suffering.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\nFactual Findings\r                            \r\n\n          We review the district court's findings of fact for\r\n\nclear error.  Irving v. United States, 49 F.3d  830, 835 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1995);  see also Fed. R.  Civ. P. 52(a).   In this case,\r                                 \r\n\nthere  is a significant amount  of support in  the record for\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe  district court's factual determinations, which therefore\r\n\nare not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          The  district court's  finding that  the hospital's\r\n\nfailure to  admit Robinson was not the  cause of his death is\r\n\nsupported by  the testimony  of Dr. Figueroa,  the government\r\n\nexpert  in cardiology.  He testified that, in his opinion, at\r\n\nthe time Robinson went  to the VA  Hospital on July 7,  there\r\n\nwas nothing that could have  been done to prevent  Robinson's\r\n\ndeath on the 18th; at that point the hospital could have done\r\n\nnothing more than to have made him comfortable.\r\n\n          There is  also evidence in support  of the district\r\n\ncourt's conclusion that  the autopsy report was  not based on\r\n\nan examination of Robinson's liver.  The liver from which the\r\n\nslides were taken was of  normal size, while Robinson's liver\r\n\nhad  been  enlarged.   The  slides  of  the  liver showed  no\r\n\nevidence of  severe liver disease such  as metastatic cancer.\r\n\nInstead,  they indicated a  fatty liver, a  much less serious\r\n\ncondition.   However, all of the clinical data indicated that\r\n\nRobinson was suffering from severe liver  disease at the time\r\n\nhe died.    The  testimony  of  Dr.  Marrero  indicates  that\r\n\nRobinson  likely had  severe liver  disease as  early as  May\r\n\n1989.    Dr. Ramirez,  the  government  expert in  pathology,\r\n\ntestified that  there  was ample  clinical, radiological  and\r\n\nlaboratory evidence that Robinson suffered from severe  liver\r\n\ndisease,  but that  there was  no indication  of this  in the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nautopsy  slides.   Furthermore,  Dr.  Ramirez  testified that\r\n\ndescriptions in the  autopsy report of other organs  were not\r\n\nwhat  one  would  have  expected  given  Robinson's   medical\r\n\nhistory.   For example,  Robinson  had dilated  veins in  his\r\n\nesophagus butthere wasno mention ofthis in theautopsy report.\r\n\nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies\r                                                 \r\n\n          The  district court  held that  it could  not award\r\n\ndamages for Robinson's pain  and suffering because his estate\r\n\ndid not present a  claim to the proper administrative  agency\r\n\nand therefore  did not exhaust  its administrative  remedies.\r\n\nReview of this  legal conclusion is de novo.   Roche v. Royal\r                                                                         \r\n\nBank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820, 827 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                          \r\n\n          The  Federal  Tort  Claims Act  provides  that  \"no\r\n\naction shall  be instituted upon  a claim against  the United\r\n\nStates . . .  unless the claimant shall  have first presented\r\n\nthe claim  to the  appropriate Federal  agency and his  claim\r\n\nshall have been finally denied . . . .\"  28 U.S.C.   2675(a).\r\n\nIn this case the  appropriate agency is the Veterans  Affairs\r\n\nDepartment.\r\n\n          The  determination  of  when   a  claim  is  deemed\r\n\npresented  is made  pursuant  to  federal regulations,  which\r\n\nrequire  the  submission  of  written   notification  of  the\r\n\nincident and a claim for money damages in a  specific sum. 28\r\n\nC.F.R.    14.2(a).  The  purpose is to  encourage settlement:\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nif the agency knows exactly what the claimant seeks, there is\r\n\nmore likely to be a settlement.\r\n\n          Plaintiff  filed an  administrative claim  with the\r\n\nDepartment  of  Veterans  Affairs  in  which  she  identified\r\n\nherself  but not her late husband's estate as claimant.1  She\r\n\nnow  argues that  this satisfied  the exhaustion  requirement\r\n\nwith  respect to both her claims and  those of the estate.  A\r\n\nsimilar argument was rejected in  Estate of Santos v.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 525 F. Supp. 982, 986 (D.P.R. 1981).  The court there\r                  \r\n\nheld that each person seeking personal damages under the FTCA\r\n\nmust file an individual claim, and  that a claim must put the\r\n\nagency on notice of  who was actually pursuing the  claim and\r\n\nthe amount  of the  claim.   Id.; see also  Adames Mendez  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited States,  652 F.

Allowing one claimant's   exhaustion of\r\n\nher  administrative   remedies  to  satisfy   the  exhaustion\r\n\nrequirement  for  other  possible  claimants  would  make  it\r\n\nextremely difficult for the  agency to know the value  of the\r\n\nsuit, thus making settlement less  likely.

Plaintiff, a widow,  appeals from the\r                      Per Curiam.   \r                                \r\n\ndistrict court's award of $50 thousand under the Federal Tort\r\n\nClaims Act (FTCA),  28 U.S.C.    2671  et seq., to compensate\r\n\nher for pain and suffering due to the failure of the Veterans\r\n\nAdministration Hospital in San Juan  to admit her ill husband\r\n\na few days prior to his death.  She seeks additional damages,\r\n\narguing that several of the district court's factual findings\r\n\nare clearly erroneous.  She  takes particular issue with  the\r\n\ncourt's  finding that prompt  hospitalization would  not have\r\n\nsaved her husband's  life.   She also argues  that the  court\r\n\nerred  in concluding that  her late husband's  estate was not\r\n\nentitled  to any recovery because it was not properly a party\r\n\nto the suit.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n          We recite the facts as found by the  district court\r\n\nafter the three-day bench trial. In May 1989, Vance Robinson,\r\n\na 64-year-old veteran, visited  Dr. Luis Marrero, who ordered\r\n\nlaboratory  tests.   The  tests suggested  that Robinson  had\r\n\nliver cancer.\r\n\n          On  Friday, July 7,  1989, Robinson went  to the VA\r\n\nHospital  in San  Juan  complaining of  a  host of  symptoms,\r\n\nincluding  a  grossly enlarged  abdomen  (ascites)  and acute\r\n\nstomach  pains.   The intake  physician, Dr.  Sylvia Fuertes,\r\n\ndiagnosed Robinson as having  ascites and an occult neoplasm,\r\n\nbut did not note the ascites on his medical record.   She did\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nnot believe that  Robinson's case was  an emergency, but  she\r\n\nrecommended that  he be  admitted immediately as  an elective\r\n\nadmission.  There were no available beds, however, and so she\r\n\ntold Robinson to return on Monday.\r\n\n          Robinson  went to  the  admissions  office  of  the\r\n\nhospital on Monday at 9:00 a.m.   He was not re-examined.  He\r\n\nwaited  there  all  day, but  was  told  there  were no  beds\r\n\navailable.  The same thing happened on Tuesday. That evening,\r\n\nRobinson  was taken  to  the  emergency  room  at  San  Pablo\r\n\nHospital,  where he was admitted as a patient.  The diagnosis\r\n\nwas  ascites, suspected liver cancer, anemia and hepato-renal\r\n\nsyndrome.   A  CT  scan revealed  an  enlarged liver  due  to\r\n\nlesions suggestive of metastatic cancer.\r\n\n          On July  18, Robinson  discharged himself  from the\r\n\nhospital.   He  died  the  next  day.   No  biopsy  was  ever\r\n\nperformed to confirm the diagnosis of suspected liver cancer,\r\n\nand no autopsy  was performed at  the time  of death.   Liver\r\n\ncancer  was listed  as  the  cause  of  death  on  the  death\r\n\ncertificate.\r\n\n          Robinson's  widow,  the  plaintiff  here,  filed an\r\n\nadministrative claim  in her  name against the  United States\r\n\nwith  the  Department of  Veterans  Affairs.   The  claim was\r\n\ndenied, and she filed a complaint in federal court within six\r\n\nmonths.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Over  two years  after Robinson's  death, plaintiff\r\n\nhad the body exhumed so that Dr. Yocasta Brugel could prepare\r\n\na  forensic report.  Dr.  Brugel indicated that  she found no\r\n\nevidence  of liver  cancer  and  that  Robinson had  died  of\r\n\nmyocarditis,  a  rare heart  ailment  which  seldom leads  to\r\n\ndeath.    The  autopsy  was admitted  into  evidence  without\r\n\nobjection.   However, Dr. Brugel  did not appear  at trial to\r\n\ntestify.   The district  court found that  either the autopsy\r\n\nreport was  totally unreliable, or, in  the alternative, that\r\n\nthe  autopsy  had  been   performed  on  someone  other  than\r\n\nRobinson.  The court also found  that the slides of the liver\r\n\non  which the report was  based were not  those of Robinson's\r\n\nliver.\r\n\n          The  district court  concluded that  the hospital's\r\n\nfailure  to admit Robinson on Friday  evening did not violate\r\n\nacceptable  medical  standards.    However,  it   found  that\r\n\nRobinson should have been re-examined when he returned to the\r\n\nhospital on  Monday, to  ensure that  his  condition had  not\r\n\ndeteriorated  to emergency  status, and  concluded  that this\r\n\nomission did violate acceptable  medical standards and caused\r\n\npain  and suffering to Robinson and his wife.  The court also\r\n\nfound  that admitting  Robinson  to the  hospital on  Friday,\r\n\nMonday or Tuesday  would not  have saved his  life but  would\r\n\nhave  permitted palliative  treatment  to ease  his pain  and\r\n\nsuffering.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The court awarded  plaintiff $50  thousand for  her\r\n\npain  and suffering  as she  watched her  husband's condition\r\n\ndeteriorate  during  the three  days  before  he was  finally\r\n\nadmitted to a  hospital.  The  district court also  indicated\r\n\nthat it  would have  awarded an  additional $50  thousand for\r\n\nRobinson's pain and suffering if his estate had been named as\r\n\na plaintiff.\r\n\n          Plaintiff appeals on  several grounds.  She  argues\r\n\nthat  the district  court's  finding that  the VA  Hospital's\r\n\nfailure  to  admit Robinson  was not  the  cause of  death is\r\n\nclearly erroneous,  as was the district  court's finding that\r\n\nthe autopsy report  was totally unreliable.   She also argues\r\n\nthat  the court erred in refusing to award pain and suffering\r\n\ndamages  to the  decedent's estate:  she contends  that under\r\n\nPuerto  Rico law, when a man dies intestate (as did Robinson)\r\n\nhis widow and children are his heirs.  She concludes that she\r\n\nand  her  sons  should  have received  the  $50  thousand the\r\n\ndistrict court indicated it would have awarded for Robinson's\r\n\npain and suffering.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\nFactual Findings\r                            \r\n\n          We review the district court's findings of fact for\r\n\nclear error.

R.  Civ. P. 52(a).   In this case,\r                                 \r\n\nthere  is a significant amount  of support in  the record for\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe  district court's factual determinations, which therefore\r\n\nare not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          The  district court's  finding that  the hospital's\r\n\nfailure to  admit Robinson was not the  cause of his death is\r\n\nsupported by  the testimony  of Dr. Figueroa,  the government\r\n\nexpert  in cardiology.  He testified that, in his opinion, at\r\n\nthe time Robinson went  to the VA  Hospital on July 7,  there\r\n\nwas nothing that could have  been done to prevent  Robinson's\r\n\ndeath on the 18th; at that point the hospital could have done\r\n\nnothing more than to have made him comfortable.\r\n\n          There is  also evidence in support  of the district\r\n\ncourt's conclusion that  the autopsy report was  not based on\r\n\nan examination of Robinson's liver.  The liver from which the\r\n\nslides were taken was of  normal size, while Robinson's liver\r\n\nhad  been  enlarged.   The  slides  of  the  liver showed  no\r\n\nevidence of  severe liver disease such  as metastatic cancer.\r\n\nInstead,  they indicated a  fatty liver, a  much less serious\r\n\ncondition.   However, all of the clinical data indicated that\r\n\nRobinson was suffering from severe liver  disease at the time\r\n\nhe died.    The  testimony  of  Dr.  Marrero  indicates  that\r\n\nRobinson  likely had  severe liver  disease as  early as  May\r\n\n1989.    Dr. Ramirez,  the  government  expert in  pathology,\r\n\ntestified that  there  was ample  clinical, radiological  and\r\n\nlaboratory evidence that Robinson suffered from severe  liver\r\n\ndisease,  but that  there was  no indication  of this  in the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nautopsy  slides.   Furthermore,  Dr.  Ramirez  testified that\r\n\ndescriptions in the  autopsy report of other organs  were not\r\n\nwhat  one  would  have  expected  given  Robinson's   medical\r\n\nhistory.   For example,  Robinson  had dilated  veins in  his\r\n\nesophagus butthere wasno mention ofthis in theautopsy report.\r\n\nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies\r                                                 \r\n\n          The  district court  held that  it could  not award\r\n\ndamages for Robinson's pain  and suffering because his estate\r\n\ndid not present a  claim to the proper administrative  agency\r\n\nand therefore  did not exhaust  its administrative  remedies.\r\n\nReview of this  legal conclusion is de novo.
