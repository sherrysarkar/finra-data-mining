Mass. Electric Construction Co.\n\n(\"Mass.    Electric\")      petitions     for   review   of   an   administrative\n\ndecision finding that the company violated a federal electrical\n\nsafety standard, resulting in an employee injury.                    The company\n\nasserts that it should not be cited or fined because the episode\n\nresulted from unforeseeable employee misconduct, and it contends\n\nthat   the     administrative     law    judge’s   (ALJ)     conclusion   to    the\n\ncontrary fails to accurately reflect the record.                  After carefully\n\nreviewing       the   pertinent     materials,     including      audiotapes    of\n\ninterviews with company employees, we have concluded that the ALJ’s\ndecision was adequately supported.\n\n       We briefly summarize the factual background, which is fully\ndetailed in the ALJ’s thorough opinion. The incident underlying\nthis    case    occurred    while    employees     of   Mass.      Electric    were\n\ninstalling a neon sign at a parking garage in Rhode Island.                     The\njob foreman, Michael McCormick, suffered serious burns from an\nelectrical explosion that occurred as he worked on an energized\n\ncircuit.       It is undisputed that neither McCormick nor an employee\nassisting him was using proper insulation or other appropriate\nprotective equipment for working on a live circuit, in violation of\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1926.416(a)(1).             The company responded to a citation\nfrom the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with\nthe affirmative defense of \"unpreventable employee misconduct,\"\n\nasserting that McCormick acted against company policy and his\nsupervisor’s instructions by failing to consult with the supervisor\n\nand obtain proper safety gear before working on the live circuit.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fThe ALJ rejected the defense, finding that the company did not\n\nadequately enforce its safety program by \"insisting upon safe\n\nmethods and practices at all times\" and that it \"could have\nprevented the violation with the exercise of reasonable diligence.\"\n\nOpinion at 8.      The ALJ relied, inter alia, on interviews with\n\nMcCormick and his supervisor, Stephen Smith, that were conducted\nshortly after the accident happened, and he discounted and termed\n\n\"contradictory\" testimony more favorable to the company that was\n\ngiven by the two men at a later hearing.      The Occupational Safety\n\nand Health Review Commission denied discretionary review, and Mass.\n\nElectric then sought judicial review.\n\n     The company assails the ALJ’s judgment on three fronts.          It\n\ncontends that the judge (1) clearly erred in finding that the Mass.\nElectric witnesses’ testimony at the hearing was \"starkly at odds\"\n\nwith their prior statements; (2) lacked record support for his\n\nconclusion that the company could have taken steps to prevent the\naccident;1   and   (3)   abused   his   discretion   and   tainted   the\n\nproceedings by allowing the Secretary of Labor’s main witness to\n\nremain in the courtroom during presentation of Mass. Electric’s\n\ndefense, and thereafter permitting the witness to use \"unverified\n\nhearsay\" to testify in rebuttal.\n\n     We review a Commission decision \"to determine whether its\n\nfactual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the\n\n     1\n       This contention essentially embraces the first one; Mass.\nElectric contends that the ALJ’s rejection of the employee\nmisconduct defense is not supported by record evidence at least in\npart because he wrongly characterized McCormick and Smith’s various\nstatements as inconsistent.\n\n                                  -3-\n\frecord, 29 U.S.C. § 660(a), and whether its legal conclusions are\n\n`arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n\naccordance with the law[.]’ 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\"                     Reich v.\nSimpson, Gumpertz & Heger, Inc., 3 F.3d 1, 2 (lst Cir. 1993).\n\n     We first address the challenge to the ALJ’s factual findings.\n\nThe chief point of contention is whether McCormick was given the\ndiscretion in a phone conversation the day before the accident to\n\nwork on the energized circuit without first calling Smith to obtain\n\nproper protective equipment. Mass. Electric contends that the\n\nstatements made by McCormick and Smith in taped interviews with an\n\nOSHA compliance officer and their later testimony at the Commission\n\nhearing   prove      that   the   two    men     anticipated   another    phone\n\nconversation after McCormick examined the electrical panel to\ndetermine if he could work on it live.                   As we shall explain,\n\nhowever, the taped interviews suggest that McCormick acted in a\n\nforeseeable way when he did the work without first contacting\nSmith.    See P. Gioioso & Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC, 115 F.3d 100, 109\n\n(lst Cir. 1997) (to establish employee misconduct, \"`an employer\n\nmust do   all   it    feasibly    can    to    prevent   foreseeable   hazards,\n\nincluding dangerous conduct by its employees’\") (quoting General\n\nDynamics Corp. v. OSHRC, 599 F.2d 453, 458 (lst Cir. 1979)).\n\n     There is no doubt that the hearing testimony depicts a much\n\nmore explicit conversation between McCormick and Smith than do the\n\nstatements taken from the two men a year earlier in interviews with\n\nthe compliance officer.           At the hearing, Smith testified that\n\nMcCormick was \"[a]bsolutely not\" authorized to work on the panel\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fwithout getting back to Smith for the dual purpose of letting Smith\n\nknow how McCormick wanted to proceed and – if he determined he\n\ncould work on the circuit live – to request appropriate safety\nequipment. McCormick, too, testified that Smith told him, \"just go\n\nback and take a look at it and see what you think and then give me\n\na call.\"\n     The statements given by both men to the compliance officer\n\njust after the accident, however, suggest that more was left to\n\nMcCormick’s discretion than simply the preliminary decision about\n\nwhether to work with the power on or off.     A few responses are\n\ntelling:\n\n     Compliance officer: \"Did he say to call me and let me\n     know before you do anything or was it basically left up\n     to your . . . ?\"\n     McCormick: \"I think it was left up to my judgment.\"\n\n                         —\n\n     Smith: \"I said if you’re not comfortable with it get back\n     to me and let me know, let me know what you need to do it\n     if you’re comfortable, and you want to do it like that.\n     . . .\"\n\n     Compliance officer: \"Okay. So if he felt comfortable\n     doing it like that and he wasn’t . . . he didn’t need to\n     get back to you he could just go . . .\"\n\n     Smith: \"Use your own judgment.\"\n\n\n     The impression that it was left to McCormick’s discretion not\n\nonly whether to work on the panel live but also what safety\n\nmeasures to take was given by other portions of the interview\n\nstatements as well.   Smith, for example, stated that the company\n\nprovided safety equipment for working on an energized circuit,\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fnoting that \"it’s all available to them if they ask for it.\"          He\n\nalso observed, \"I guess he felt the way he was doing it he was\n\ncomfortable   with.\"    McCormick’s    responses   also   reflected   an\nassumption that he had discretion in choosing how to proceed.         He\n\nnoted that workers frequently use the \"material at hand,\" and, in\n\nthis case, he felt the cardboard that was available to insulate the\nparts of the panel would do the job.      He had seen that done, he\n\nsaid, \"many times.\"    He also stated that he sometimes wears gloves\n\nwhen doing a job like this, and sometimes does not, even though\n\ngloves are required by company policy.2\n\n     In addition, although McCormick stated that his decision to go\n\nahead and do the job was made on the \"spur of the moment,\" the\n\nevidence shows that he did not act hastily.        He took the time to\nsharpen his knife, insulate his tools, and place the cardboard\n\nbetween sections of the distribution panel.          In so doing, he\n\nexercised his judgment and took deliberate steps that could be\nunderstood as intended to satisfy the instructions given to him by\n\nSmith, which even Mass. Electric acknowledges were (1) to ascertain\n\nif you can do this job without shutting off the power, and (2) if\n\nyou can, to let me know what safety equipment you need. Neither\n\nMcCormick nor Smith reported during their interviews a direct\n\ninstruction not to proceed until McCormick obtained the specific\n\nprotective gear required by company and OSHA policy.3            It is\n\n     2\n       He explained that he chose not to wear gloves this time\nbecause the work was delicate.\n     3\n       We note Mass. Electric’s claim that the ALJ credited an\nerroneous statement by the compliance officer that McCormick had\n\n                                 -6-\n\ftherefore reasonable to conclude from a reading of McCormick’s and\n\nSmith’s interview accounts that the steps McCormick took were all\n\nhe felt he \"needed\" to ensure safety, thereby satisfying Smith’s\ninstructions,        notwithstanding       company   policy.      In    sum,    both\n\nMcCormick’s and Smith’s interviews reasonably can be taken as\n\nevidence that the company permitted McCormick to forge ahead if he\nthought he could do the work safely without using the protective\n\nequipment that is conceded to be mandatory.4\n          We recognize that the interview statements also could be\n\nconstrued to support an understanding on the part of Smith that\n\nMcCormick,     in    accordance     with    official   company    policy,      would\n\nrequest the proper safety equipment before working on a live panel.\n\nIt is for that reason that we disagree with the ALJ’s depiction of\nthe   interviews          and   later   testimony    as     \"starkly    at    odds.\"\n\nNonetheless,        the    ALJ’s   determination     that   McCormick    at    least\n\nimpliedly was given authority to proceed without the specific\n\n\n\ntold the officer that he (McCormick) had been given an explicit\nokay to \"go ahead and install\" the circuit breakers while the panel\nwas charged. We agree that the interview statements were not this\nexplicit, but there is no indication that the ALJ relied on the\ncompliance officer’s testimony rather than on the actual taped\ninterviews, which he quoted later in his opinion. Presumably, the\nALJ understood that the compliance officer’s testimony contained\ninferences based on what he had heard.\n      4\n       In its reply brief, Mass. Electric emphasizes that none of\nSmith’s references to \"use your own judgment\" constituted\npermission to McCormick to work on the panel without safety\nequipment. This contention does not necessarily take the company\nto the result it desires. McCormick did take safety measures, but\nthey did not comply with federal regulations. The ALJ concluded\nthat Smith left up to McCormick the nature of the precautions he\nwould take, and Smith’s and McCormick’s interviews permit an\ninference that this approach was not unique to this job.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fequipment is supported by the interviews.             And we cannot fault the\n\njudge’s discrediting of testimony at the hearing that minimized the\n\nscope of McCormick’s discretion; that testimony was given a year\nafter the accident, when all concerned presumably were more aware\n\nof the legal significance of the McCormick-Smith conversation.\n\n       If the record had established unequivocally that McCormick had\nno authority to proceed until after he called Smith, either to plan\n\na power shutdown or to obtain the required protective equipment,\n\nthe company’s employee misconduct defense would be more powerful.\n\nWhile the company’s reliance, as found by the ALJ, on the usually\n\ngood    judgment   of    an    experienced    electrician     may   have     been\n\nreasonable, it was not in compliance with federal regulations.                 We\n\ntherefore must credit the ALJ’s conclusion that McCormick’s failure\nto take proper safety measures could have been avoided with more\n\ndiligent supervision and enforcement of company policies, negating\n\nMass. Electric’s employee misconduct defense.                See Gioioso, 115\n\nF.3d at 109-10 (\"Even if an employer establishes work rules and\n\ncommunicates them to its employees, the defense of unpreventable\nemployee misconduct cannot be sustained unless the employer also\n\nproves that it insists upon compliance with the rules and regularly\n\nenforces them.\").\n\n       We touch only briefly on Mass. Electric’s other claim, that\n\nthe    ALJ   improperly       allowed   rebuttal   testimony     from      OSHA’s\n\ncompliance officer.        The ALJ rejected this claim as moot on the\n\nground   that   the     disputed    testimony   was    not   material   to    the\n\ndisposition of the case.           Our review gives us no reason to think\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthe testimony played any role in the judge’s decision. Because any\n\nerror therefore would be harmless, we decline to consider the\n\nmatter further.\n     The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

So if he felt comfortable\n     doing it like that and he wasn’t . . . he didn’t need to\n     get back to you he could just go . . .\"\n\n     Smith: \"Use your own judgment.\"\n\n\n     The impression that it was left to McCormick’s discretion not\n\nonly whether to work on the panel live but also what safety\n\nmeasures to take was given by other portions of the interview\n\nstatements as well.   Smith, for example, stated that the company\n\nprovided safety equipment for working on an energized circuit,\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fnoting that \"it’s all available to them if they ask for it.\"          He\n\nalso observed, \"I guess he felt the way he was doing it he was\n\ncomfortable   with.\"    McCormick’s    responses   also   reflected   an\nassumption that he had discretion in choosing how to proceed.         He\n\nnoted that workers frequently use the \"material at hand,\" and, in\n\nthis case, he felt the cardboard that was available to insulate the\nparts of the panel would do the job.      He had seen that done, he\n\nsaid, \"many times.\"    He also stated that he sometimes wears gloves\n\nwhen doing a job like this, and sometimes does not, even though\n\ngloves are required by company policy.2\n\n     In addition, although McCormick stated that his decision to go\n\nahead and do the job was made on the \"spur of the moment,\" the\n\nevidence shows that he did not act hastily.        He took the time to\nsharpen his knife, insulate his tools, and place the cardboard\n\nbetween sections of the distribution panel.          In so doing, he\n\nexercised his judgment and took deliberate steps that could be\nunderstood as intended to satisfy the instructions given to him by\n\nSmith, which even Mass. Electric acknowledges were (1) to ascertain\n\nif you can do this job without shutting off the power, and (2) if\n\nyou can, to let me know what safety equipment you need. Neither\n\nMcCormick nor Smith reported during their interviews a direct\n\ninstruction not to proceed until McCormick obtained the specific\n\nprotective gear required by company and OSHA policy.3            It is\n\n     2\n       He explained that he chose not to wear gloves this time\nbecause the work was delicate.\n     3\n       We note Mass. Electric’s claim that the ALJ credited an\nerroneous statement by the compliance officer that McCormick had\n\n                                 -6-\n\ftherefore reasonable to conclude from a reading of McCormick’s and\n\nSmith’s interview accounts that the steps McCormick took were all\n\nhe felt he \"needed\" to ensure safety, thereby satisfying Smith’s\ninstructions,        notwithstanding       company   policy.      In    sum,    both\n\nMcCormick’s and Smith’s interviews reasonably can be taken as\n\nevidence that the company permitted McCormick to forge ahead if he\nthought he could do the work safely without using the protective\n\nequipment that is conceded to be mandatory.4\n          We recognize that the interview statements also could be\n\nconstrued to support an understanding on the part of Smith that\n\nMcCormick,     in    accordance     with    official   company    policy,      would\n\nrequest the proper safety equipment before working on a live panel.\n\nIt is for that reason that we disagree with the ALJ’s depiction of\nthe   interviews          and   later   testimony    as     \"starkly    at    odds.\"\n\nNonetheless,        the    ALJ’s   determination     that   McCormick    at    least\n\nimpliedly was given authority to proceed without the specific\n\n\n\ntold the officer that he (McCormick) had been given an explicit\nokay to \"go ahead and install\" the circuit breakers while the panel\nwas charged. We agree that the interview statements were not this\nexplicit, but there is no indication that the ALJ relied on the\ncompliance officer’s testimony rather than on the actual taped\ninterviews, which he quoted later in his opinion. Presumably, the\nALJ understood that the compliance officer’s testimony contained\ninferences based on what he had heard.\n      4\n       In its reply brief, Mass. Electric emphasizes that none of\nSmith’s references to \"use your own judgment\" constituted\npermission to McCormick to work on the panel without safety\nequipment. This contention does not necessarily take the company\nto the result it desires. McCormick did take safety measures, but\nthey did not comply with federal regulations. The ALJ concluded\nthat Smith left up to McCormick the nature of the precautions he\nwould take, and Smith’s and McCormick’s interviews permit an\ninference that this approach was not unique to this job.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fequipment is supported by the interviews.             And we cannot fault the\n\njudge’s discrediting of testimony at the hearing that minimized the\n\nscope of McCormick’s discretion; that testimony was given a year\nafter the accident, when all concerned presumably were more aware\n\nof the legal significance of the McCormick-Smith conversation.\n\n       If the record had established unequivocally that McCormick had\nno authority to proceed until after he called Smith, either to plan\n\na power shutdown or to obtain the required protective equipment,\n\nthe company’s employee misconduct defense would be more powerful.\n\nWhile the company’s reliance, as found by the ALJ, on the usually\n\ngood    judgment   of    an    experienced    electrician     may   have     been\n\nreasonable, it was not in compliance with federal regulations.                 We\n\ntherefore must credit the ALJ’s conclusion that McCormick’s failure\nto take proper safety measures could have been avoided with more\n\ndiligent supervision and enforcement of company policies, negating\n\nMass. Electric’s employee misconduct defense.                See Gioioso, 115\n\nF.3d at 109-10 (\"Even if an employer establishes work rules and\n\ncommunicates them to its employees, the defense of unpreventable\nemployee misconduct cannot be sustained unless the employer also\n\nproves that it insists upon compliance with the rules and regularly\n\nenforces them.\").\n\n       We touch only briefly on Mass. Electric’s other claim, that\n\nthe    ALJ   improperly       allowed   rebuttal   testimony     from      OSHA’s\n\ncompliance officer.        The ALJ rejected this claim as moot on the\n\nground   that   the     disputed    testimony   was    not   material   to    the\n\ndisposition of the case.           Our review gives us no reason to think\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthe testimony played any role in the judge’s decision. Because any\n\nerror therefore would be harmless, we decline to consider the\n\nmatter further.\n     The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f</pre>",
