Alfredo Cespedes, Jose Antonio Rivero-\r                                \r\n\nCabanas and Julio Figueroa-Romero (collectively \"defendants\")\r\n\npleaded  guilty to  drug  trafficking and  firearm counts  in\r\n\nPuerto Rico Federal District Court.  Each appeals his firearm\r\n\nconviction or  sentence under 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1), pursuant\r\n\nto  the Supreme  Court's  more recent  opinion  in Bailey  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited States,     U.S.    , 116 S. Ct. 501 (1995).  Cespedes\r                         \r\n\nalso appeals the court's  calculation of his criminal history\r\n\ncategory.  We affirm.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          The  indictments and subsequent pleas were based on\r\n\nthe following facts.   Beginning in 1993,  the defendants and\r\n\nseveral  others   entered  into   a  conspiracy   to  smuggle\r\n\ncontrolled substances  into Puerto  Rico.  They  made several\r\n\nattempts to import  illegal substances; some succeeded,  some\r\n\ndid  not.  Pre-sentence reports  indicate that Rivero was the\r\n\noverall organizer  and manager  of the conspiracy.   Cespedes\r\n\nmanaged  distribution  in Miami  while  Figueroa managed  the\r\n\noperations based in Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          The defendants'  guilty pleas relate to   incidents\r\n\nthat occurred in November  of 1993.  The first  incident took\r\n\nplace in  mid-November.  Cespedes left Miami  for Puerto Rico\r\n\nin  order to assist Rivero in taking delivery of 3,000 pounds\r\n\nof marijuana.  On the night of the planned delivery, Figueroa\r\n\ndistributed guns to the other conspirators.  The group waited\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nat the  mouth of the  Humacoa river  for two  nights but  the\r\n\ndelivery  failed   to   materialize.     They   tried   again\r\n\napproximately one week later;   however, once again the drugs\r\n\neluded their grasp.\r\n\n          Rivero  next  made  arrangements  with  a Colombian\r\n\nsupplier  to deliver cocaine by  air drop.   The group, again\r\n\narmed, succeeded in retrieving  approximately twenty bales of\r\n\ncocaine  from the ocean  before they were  intercepted by law\r\n\nenforcement officials.\r\n\n          In April 1994, the  defendants were indicted on ten\r\n\ndrug  trafficking and firearm  counts.  One  year later, each\r\n\ndefendant  pleaded  guilty  to  one count  of  conspiracy  to\r\n\npossess  with   intent  to  distribute  cocaine,   21  U.S.C.\r\n\n   841(a)(1), 846, and  one count of aiding  and abetting the\r\n\nuse  and carrying of firearms during the commission of a drug\r\n\ntrafficking crime, 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).\r\n\n                       II.  Discussion\r                                                  \r\n\n          18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1) imposes a mandatory five-year\r\n\nprison term on any  person who \"during and in relation to any\r\n\ncrime of  violence or  drug trafficking crime  . . . uses  or\r\n\ncarries a firearm.\"  After  the defendants were sentenced but\r\n\nprior to this appeal,  the Supreme Court held in  Bailey that\r                                                                    \r\n\nthe  word  \"use\" was  to be  given  its \"ordinary  or natural\r\n\nmeaning.\"  116 S. Ct.  at 506.  Accordingly, to  be convicted\r\n\nof  \"use\" under the statute,  a defendant must have \"actively\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nemployed the firearm during and in  relation to the predicate\r\n\ncrime.\"   Id. at 509.   The government concedes  that none of\r                         \r\n\nthe defendants' actions rise to this level but maintains that\r\n\nthe   record  contains   sufficient  facts  to   support  the\r\n\nconvictions under the \"carry\" prong.\r\n\n          We have said that  the Bailey Court recognized that\r                                                   \r\n\nthe \"carry\" prong  of   924(c) would take on added importance\r\n\nin  light of the new limitations on  \"use.\"  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRamirez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d 1149,  1152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n117  S.  Ct.  405 (1996).    Recently,  in  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCleveland,  106  F.3d 1056  (1st  Cir.  1997), we  recognized\r                     \r\n\n\"carry\"  as applying both to transport  in a vehicle and on a\r\n\ndefendant's person.   Id. at 1067.  We declined to limit this\r                                     \r\n\nreading by  adopting a requirement of  accessibility, finding\r\n\ninstead that \"the distinguishing characteristic of \"carry\" is\r\n\nnot the  instant availability  of the  item carried, but  the\r\n\nfact that the item  is being moved from one place  to another\r\n\nby  the carrier. . . .  Id. at 1068.  This movement, however,\r                                       \r\n\nmust  have  some nexus  to the  predicate offense.   Ramirez-\r                                                                         \r\n\nFerrer, 82 F.3d at  1152.  Because the firearms  charges were\r                  \r\n\nfor aiding and  abetting, the convictions will  stand \"if one\r\n\ndefendant  is  found to  have to  have  carried a  firearm in\r\n\nviolation of    924(c)(1) and  the others  to have  aided and\r\n\nabetted.\"  Id.  We examine each defendant's case in turn.\r                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          A. Figueroa\r                                 \r\n\n          Figueroa pleaded guilty to aiding and  abetting the\r\n\nuse or  carrying of  firearms in  connection with  the failed\r\n\nmarijuana delivery and  the cocaine air  drop.  He  maintains\r\n\nthat  he  himself  did not  use  or  carry  any firearms  and\r\n\nobjected to  the section  of his Pre-Sentence  Report (\"PSR\")\r\n\nstating that he possessed and distributed firearms to the co-\r\n\nconspirators.   When  Figueroa voiced  this objection  at his\r\n\nsentencing, the court ordered the government to make an offer\r\n\nof  proof  in  support   of  its  allegations  that  Figueroa\r\n\n\"facilitated\"  and   \"distributed\"   firearms  to   the   co-\r\n\nconspirators.   The government  informed the court  that five\r\n\nco-conspirators  were ready  to  testify  that they  received\r\n\nweapons  from Figueroa  during  the  unsuccessful attempt  to\r\n\nimport  marijuana  and during  the  cocaine  drop.   Figueroa\r\n\nresponded  that  he  would  have  impeached these  witnesses'\r\n\ntestimony by his own testimony and that of Rivera.  The court\r\n\nfound  by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence  that  Figueroa\r\n\nfacilitated   and  distributed   the  weapons   to   the  co-\r\n\nconspirators on the two relevant occasions.\r\n\n          This finding is enough  to support  carrying within\r\n\nthe  meaning of   924(c)(1) and under Cleveland.  In order to\r                                                           \r\n\nbring   and  distribute  firearms   to  his  co-conspirators,\r\n\nFigueroa would have had to transport them either in a vehicle\r\n\nor   on  his  person.    Either  is  enough  to  fulfill  the\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nrequirements  of carrying  as in  this context,  the required\r\n\nnexus to the predicate offense is unquestionably present.\r\n\n          Figueroa,   however,  did   not  plead   guilty  to\r\n\n\"carrying\",  but to  aiding and abetting  carrying, requiring\r\n\nthat  at least  one other  defendant carry  a firearm.   This\r\n\nrequirement,  however,  is  easily   met.    In  his  written\r\n\nobjections  to the  PSR,  Figueroa acknowledged  that he  had\r\n\n\"pleaded  guilty  to   participating  in   an  illegal   drug\r\n\ndistribution scheme  knowing (as  an aider and  abettor) that\r\n\nanother  co-conspirator(s) carried firearm(s) during the said\r                   \r\n\ndistribution.  . . .\"  (emphasis in original).1  The evidence\r\n\nis sufficient to support Figueroa's guilty plea to the aiding\r\n\nand abetting of carrying under   924(c)(1).\r\n\n          B. Rivero\r                               \r\n\n          Rivero, like  the other defendants,  pleaded guilty\r\n\nto  aiding  and abetting  the  use or  carrying  of firearms.\r\n\nBecause we  have found that Figueroa  carried firearms within\r\n\nthe meaning  of    924(c)(1),  Rivero's  admitted  status  as\r\n\nFigueroa's co-conspirator  in the drug trafficking offense is\r\n\nsufficient  to uphold his  guilty plea to  the firearms count\r\n\nunder Ramirez-Ferrer.  Moreover, Rivero did not object to the\r                                \r\n\nsection  in  his  PSR  that  stated  that  Figueroa  brought,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We also note that all three defendants at their change of\r\nplea  hearings agreed  with the  government's version  of the\r\nfacts which stated that during the commission of the two drug\r\ntrafficking offenses \"the co-conspirators carried firearms.\"\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ndistributed  and  hence,  carried  the  firearms  during  the\r\n\ncommission of a drug trafficking offense.\r\n\n          Rivero also maintains that  he should be allowed to\r\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea because the court gave an  imprecise\r\n\ndefinition  of \"aiding  and  abetting\" when  it accepted  his\r\n\nplea.   During  the  Rule 11  hearing the  following colloquy\r\n\nensued:\r\n\n          THE  COURT:   The  charge  is  aiding and\r\n          abetting, which means if there is a group\r\n          of  persons that  are  in common  consort\r\n          carrying out an activity  and one or more\r\n          has weapons while the illegal activity is\r\n          going on, if you  are aiding and abetting\r\n          in the importation of cocaine and persons\r\n          are using weapons and you  are charged as\r\n          an aider  or abettor in the possession of\r\n          those firearms.    You may  not have  had\r\n          them  personally  on your  person  but if\r\n          there were others that had them, then you\r\n          could be charged as  an aider and abettor\r\n          and that is what  you are charged with in\r\n          Count 6.\r\n\n          THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\r\n\n          THE  COURT:   And  that is  what you  are\r\n          pleading guilty to.\r\n\n          THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\r\n\nWe  fail to  see,  and Rivero  has  not explained,  what  was\r\n\nlacking in this explanation.  Based on Figueroa's carrying of\r\n\nfirearms we find that the  evidence is sufficient to  support\r\n\nRivero's aiding and abetting the carrying of firearms.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Rivero also complains that the court  erred by using pre-\r\nBailey  law  in  its  explanation  of  the  firearms  charge,\r                  \r\nrendering the guilty  plea non-knowing and voluntary.   As we\r\nexplained,  ante, however,  Rivero accepted  the government's\r                            \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n          C. Cespedes\r                                 \r\n\n          Unlike the other two defendants, Cespedes  does not\r\n\nseek  to overturn  his guilty  plea to  the firearms  charge.\r\n\nInstead,  he  contests   the  imposition  of   the  five-year\r\n\nconsecutive sentence required under    924(c), arguing for  a\r\n\nconcurrent  sentence under  U.S.S.G.   5G1.2(c).3   Although,\r\n\nstrictly speaking,  appeals to \"correct a  sentence\" are more\r\n\nproperly  pursued  via  a  habeas petition  under  28  U.S.C.\r\n\n  2255,  Cespedes' arguments  touch  on the  validity of  the\r\n\nconviction, making review appropriate in this forum.\r\n\n           Cespedes contends \"the elements of carrying or use\r\n\nwere not  present in relation  to the Count  One crime.\"   We\r\n\ndispose of  this assertion  in  short order.   Cespedes'  PSR\r\n\nstated that during the earlier unsuccessful attempt to import\r\n\nmarijuana  \"Mr. Figueroa  distributed several  firearms among\r\n\nthe co-conspirators\" and that Cespedes, among  others, \"while\r\n\nin possession of firearms, waited at the mouth of the Humacao\r\n\nRiver  . . . .\"  Cespedes did  not object to  this section of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncontention  that  Figueroa  facilitated and  distributed  the\r\nfirearms,  negating  any  possible  claim  of   ignorance  or\r\ninvoluntariness.\r\n\n3.  Section 5G1.2(c) states:\r\n\n          If  the  sentence  imposed on  the  count\r\n          carrying the highest statutory maximum is\r\n          adequate to achieve the total punishment,\r\n          then  the sentences  on all  counts shall\r\n          run  concurrently,  except to  the extent\r\n          otherwise required by law.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nthe  PSR.  Given that  we have already  found that Figueroa's\r\n\nbehavior meets  the standard for carrying  within the meaning\r\n\nof    924(c)(1),  we  see  no  reason  to  reverse  Cespedes'\r\n\nsentence on this basis.\r\n\n          Cespedes  also  claims  that  the  court  erred  in\r\n\nincluding  in his  criminal history  category computation  an\r\n\nearlier  withheld  adjudication  ending  in a  plea  of  nolo\r\n\ncontendere.   There are two prongs to  his attack.  First, he\r\n\nargues that a plea of nolo contendere can not be equated with\r\n\na guilty plea for the purposes  of the sentencing guidelines.\r\n\nWe addressed this issue  in United States v. Pierce,  60 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n886  (1st Cir. 1995), cert.  denied, 116 S.  Ct. 2580 (1996),\r                                               \r\n\nwhere  we concluded  that an  event which  establishes guilt,\r\n\nwhether  \"by  guilty   plea,  trial,  or  by   plea  of  nolo\r\n\ncontendere,\" is includable in a  defendant's criminal history\r\n\ncomputation.  Id. at 892.\r                             \r\n\n          Cespedes' second argument is that the court  should\r\n\nhave  allowed  him to  attack  collaterally  this same  state\r\n\ncharge because he was appointed counsel only at the \"instant\"\r\n\nhe made the nolo contendere  plea.  For support he relies  on\r\n\nCustis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485 (1994), which held that\r                                   \r\n\na  collateral attack on a prior state conviction at a federal\r\n\nsentencing proceeding  can be had  only if the  defendant can\r\n\nclaim  total absence  of  counsel in  violation of  the Sixth\r\n\nAmendment.    Id. at  496.    Such  was  not the  case  here.\r                             \r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nCespedes acknowledges that  he had counsel  when he gave  the\r\n\nplea of nolo contendere.  That it was, perhaps, not effective\r\n\ncounsel because of the timing, is an argument to be made in a\r\n\nhabeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255.\r\n\n          The convictions and sentences of the defendants are\r                                                                         \r\n\naffirmed.\r                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n",

Cespedes\r                         \r\n\nalso appeals the court's  calculation of his criminal history\r\n\ncategory.  We affirm.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          The  indictments and subsequent pleas were based on\r\n\nthe following facts.   Beginning in 1993,  the defendants and\r\n\nseveral  others   entered  into   a  conspiracy   to  smuggle\r\n\ncontrolled substances  into Puerto  Rico.  They  made several\r\n\nattempts to import  illegal substances; some succeeded,  some\r\n\ndid  not.  Pre-sentence reports  indicate that Rivero was the\r\n\noverall organizer  and manager  of the conspiracy.   Cespedes\r\n\nmanaged  distribution  in Miami  while  Figueroa managed  the\r\n\noperations based in Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          The defendants'  guilty pleas relate to   incidents\r\n\nthat occurred in November  of 1993.  The first  incident took\r\n\nplace in  mid-November.  Cespedes left Miami  for Puerto Rico\r\n\nin  order to assist Rivero in taking delivery of 3,000 pounds\r\n\nof marijuana.  On the night of the planned delivery, Figueroa\r\n\ndistributed guns to the other conspirators.  The group waited\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nat the  mouth of the  Humacoa river  for two  nights but  the\r\n\ndelivery  failed   to   materialize.     They   tried   again\r\n\napproximately one week later;   however, once again the drugs\r\n\neluded their grasp.\r\n\n          Rivero  next  made  arrangements  with  a Colombian\r\n\nsupplier  to deliver cocaine by  air drop.   The group, again\r\n\narmed, succeeded in retrieving  approximately twenty bales of\r\n\ncocaine  from the ocean  before they were  intercepted by law\r\n\nenforcement officials.\r\n\n          In April 1994, the  defendants were indicted on ten\r\n\ndrug  trafficking and firearm  counts.  One  year later, each\r\n\ndefendant  pleaded  guilty  to  one count  of  conspiracy  to\r\n\npossess  with   intent  to  distribute  cocaine,   21  U.S.C.\r\n\n   841(a)(1), 846, and  one count of aiding  and abetting the\r\n\nuse  and carrying of firearms during the commission of a drug\r\n\ntrafficking crime, 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).\r\n\n                       II.  Discussion\r                                                  \r\n\n          18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1) imposes a mandatory five-year\r\n\nprison term on any  person who \"during and in relation to any\r\n\ncrime of  violence or  drug trafficking crime  . . . uses  or\r\n\ncarries a firearm.\"  After  the defendants were sentenced but\r\n\nprior to this appeal,  the Supreme Court held in  Bailey that\r                                                                    \r\n\nthe  word  \"use\" was  to be  given  its \"ordinary  or natural\r\n\nmeaning.\"  116 S. Ct.  at 506.  Accordingly, to  be convicted\r\n\nof  \"use\" under the statute,  a defendant must have \"actively\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nemployed the firearm during and in  relation to the predicate\r\n\ncrime.\"   Id. at 509.   The government concedes  that none of\r                         \r\n\nthe defendants' actions rise to this level but maintains that\r\n\nthe   record  contains   sufficient  facts  to   support  the\r\n\nconvictions under the \"carry\" prong.\r\n\n          We have said that  the Bailey Court recognized that\r                                                   \r\n\nthe \"carry\" prong  of   924(c) would take on added importance\r\n\nin  light of the new limitations on  \"use.\"  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRamirez-Ferrer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196736\"><a href=\"/opinion/196736/united-states-v-ramirez-ferrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1152 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n117  S.

We declined to limit this\r                                     \r\n\nreading by  adopting a requirement of  accessibility, finding\r\n\ninstead that \"the distinguishing characteristic of \"carry\" is\r\n\nnot the  instant availability  of the  item carried, but  the\r\n\nfact that the item  is being moved from one place  to another\r\n\nby  the carrier. . . .

Ramirez-\r                                                                         \r\n\nFerrer, 82 F.3d at  1152.  Because the firearms  charges were\r                  \r\n\nfor aiding and  abetting, the convictions will  stand \"if one\r\n\ndefendant  is  found to  have to  have  carried a  firearm in\r\n\nviolation of    924(c)(1) and  the others  to have  aided and\r\n\nabetted.\"  Id.  We examine each defendant's case in turn.\r                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          A. Figueroa\r                                 \r\n\n          Figueroa pleaded guilty to aiding and  abetting the\r\n\nuse or  carrying of  firearms in  connection with  the failed\r\n\nmarijuana delivery and  the cocaine air  drop.  He  maintains\r\n\nthat  he  himself  did not  use  or  carry  any firearms  and\r\n\nobjected to  the section  of his Pre-Sentence  Report (\"PSR\")\r\n\nstating that he possessed and distributed firearms to the co-\r\n\nconspirators.   When  Figueroa voiced  this objection  at his\r\n\nsentencing, the court ordered the government to make an offer\r\n\nof  proof  in  support   of  its  allegations  that  Figueroa\r\n\n\"facilitated\"  and   \"distributed\"   firearms  to   the   co-\r\n\nconspirators.   The government  informed the court  that five\r\n\nco-conspirators  were ready  to  testify  that they  received\r\n\nweapons  from Figueroa  during  the  unsuccessful attempt  to\r\n\nimport  marijuana  and during  the  cocaine  drop.   Figueroa\r\n\nresponded  that  he  would  have  impeached these  witnesses'\r\n\ntestimony by his own testimony and that of Rivera.  The court\r\n\nfound  by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence  that  Figueroa\r\n\nfacilitated   and  distributed   the  weapons   to   the  co-\r\n\nconspirators on the two relevant occasions.\r\n\n          This finding is enough  to support  carrying within\r\n\nthe  meaning of   924(c)(1) and under Cleveland.  In order to\r                                                           \r\n\nbring   and  distribute  firearms   to  his  co-conspirators,\r\n\nFigueroa would have had to transport them either in a vehicle\r\n\nor   on  his  person.    Either  is  enough  to  fulfill  the\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nrequirements  of carrying  as in  this context,  the required\r\n\nnexus to the predicate offense is unquestionably present.\r\n\n          Figueroa,   however,  did   not  plead   guilty  to\r\n\n\"carrying\",  but to  aiding and abetting  carrying, requiring\r\n\nthat  at least  one other  defendant carry  a firearm.   This\r\n\nrequirement,  however,  is  easily   met.    In  his  written\r\n\nobjections  to the  PSR,  Figueroa acknowledged  that he  had\r\n\n\"pleaded  guilty  to   participating  in   an  illegal   drug\r\n\ndistribution scheme  knowing (as  an aider and  abettor) that\r\n\nanother  co-conspirator(s) carried firearm(s) during the said\r                   \r\n\ndistribution.  . . .\"  (emphasis in original).1  The evidence\r\n\nis sufficient to support Figueroa's guilty plea to the aiding\r\n\nand abetting of carrying under   924(c)(1).\r\n\n          B. Rivero\r                               \r\n\n          Rivero, like  the other defendants,  pleaded guilty\r\n\nto  aiding  and abetting  the  use or  carrying  of firearms.\r\n\nBecause we  have found that Figueroa  carried firearms within\r\n\nthe meaning  of    924(c)(1),  Rivero's  admitted  status  as\r\n\nFigueroa's co-conspirator  in the drug trafficking offense is\r\n\nsufficient  to uphold his  guilty plea to  the firearms count\r\n\nunder Ramirez-Ferrer.  Moreover, Rivero did not object to the\r                                \r\n\nsection  in  his  PSR  that  stated  that  Figueroa  brought,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We also note that all three defendants at their change of\r\nplea  hearings agreed  with the  government's version  of the\r\nfacts which stated that during the commission of the two drug\r\ntrafficking offenses \"the co-conspirators carried firearms.\"\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ndistributed  and  hence,  carried  the  firearms  during  the\r\n\ncommission of a drug trafficking offense.\r\n\n          Rivero also maintains that  he should be allowed to\r\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea because the court gave an  imprecise\r\n\ndefinition  of \"aiding  and  abetting\" when  it accepted  his\r\n\nplea.   During  the  Rule 11  hearing the  following colloquy\r\n\nensued:\r\n\n          THE  COURT:   The  charge  is  aiding and\r\n          abetting, which means if there is a group\r\n          of  persons that  are  in common  consort\r\n          carrying out an activity  and one or more\r\n          has weapons while the illegal activity is\r\n          going on, if you  are aiding and abetting\r\n          in the importation of cocaine and persons\r\n          are using weapons and you  are charged as\r\n          an aider  or abettor in the possession of\r\n          those firearms.    You may  not have  had\r\n          them  personally  on your  person  but if\r\n          there were others that had them, then you\r\n          could be charged as  an aider and abettor\r\n          and that is what  you are charged with in\r\n          Count 6.\r\n\n          THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\r\n\n          THE  COURT:   And  that is  what you  are\r\n          pleading guilty to.\r\n\n          THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\r\n\nWe  fail to  see,  and Rivero  has  not explained,  what  was\r\n\nlacking in this explanation.  Based on Figueroa's carrying of\r\n\nfirearms we find that the  evidence is sufficient to  support\r\n\nRivero's aiding and abetting the carrying of firearms.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Rivero also complains that the court  erred by using pre-\r\nBailey  law  in  its  explanation  of  the  firearms  charge,\r                  \r\nrendering the guilty  plea non-knowing and voluntary.   As we\r\nexplained,  ante, however,  Rivero accepted  the government's\r                            \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n          C. Cespedes\r                                 \r\n\n          Unlike the other two defendants, Cespedes  does not\r\n\nseek  to overturn  his guilty  plea to  the firearms  charge.\r\n\nInstead,  he  contests   the  imposition  of   the  five-year\r\n\nconsecutive sentence required under    924(c), arguing for  a\r\n\nconcurrent  sentence under  U.S.S.G.   5G1.2(c).3   Although,\r\n\nstrictly speaking,  appeals to \"correct a  sentence\" are more\r\n\nproperly  pursued  via  a  habeas petition  under  28  U.S.C.\r\n\n  2255,  Cespedes' arguments  touch  on the  validity of  the\r\n\nconviction, making review appropriate in this forum.\r\n\n           Cespedes contends \"the elements of carrying or use\r\n\nwere not  present in relation  to the Count  One crime.\"   We\r\n\ndispose of  this assertion  in  short order.   Cespedes'  PSR\r\n\nstated that during the earlier unsuccessful attempt to import\r\n\nmarijuana  \"Mr. Figueroa  distributed several  firearms among\r\n\nthe co-conspirators\" and that Cespedes, among  others, \"while\r\n\nin possession of firearms, waited at the mouth of the Humacao\r\n\nRiver  . . . .\"  Cespedes did  not object to  this section of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncontention  that  Figueroa  facilitated and  distributed  the\r\nfirearms,  negating  any  possible  claim  of   ignorance  or\r\ninvoluntariness.\r\n\n3.  Section 5G1.2(c) states:\r\n\n          If  the  sentence  imposed on  the  count\r\n          carrying the highest statutory maximum is\r\n          adequate to achieve the total punishment,\r\n          then  the sentences  on all  counts shall\r\n          run  concurrently,  except to  the extent\r\n          otherwise required by law.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nthe  PSR.  Given that  we have already  found that Figueroa's\r\n\nbehavior meets  the standard for carrying  within the meaning\r\n\nof    924(c)(1),  we  see  no  reason  to  reverse  Cespedes'\r\n\nsentence on this basis.\r\n\n          Cespedes  also  claims  that  the  court  erred  in\r\n\nincluding  in his  criminal history  category computation  an\r\n\nearlier  withheld  adjudication  ending  in a  plea  of  nolo\r\n\ncontendere.   There are two prongs to  his attack.  First, he\r\n\nargues that a plea of nolo contendere can not be equated with\r\n\na guilty plea for the purposes  of the sentencing guidelines.\r\n\nWe addressed this issue  in United States v. Pierce,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196196\"><a href=\"/opinion/196196/united-states-v-pierce/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r                                                               \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1st Cir. 1995), cert.  denied, 116 S.

Id. at 892.\r                             \r\n\n          Cespedes' second argument is that the court  should\r\n\nhave  allowed  him to  attack  collaterally  this same  state\r\n\ncharge because he was appointed counsel only at the \"instant\"\r\n\nhe made the nolo contendere  plea.  For support he relies  on\r\n\nCustis v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994), which held that\r                                   \r\n\na  collateral attack on a prior state conviction at a federal\r\n\nsentencing proceeding  can be had  only if the  defendant can\r\n\nclaim  total absence  of  counsel in  violation of  the Sixth\r\n\nAmendment.

That it was, perhaps, not effective\r\n\ncounsel because of the timing, is an argument to be made in a\r\n\nhabeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255.\r\n\n          The convictions and sentences of the defendants are\r                                                                         \r\n\naffirmed.\r                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n</pre>",
