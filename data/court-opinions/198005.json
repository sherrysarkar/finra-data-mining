Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Harry Murphy Seavey on brief pro se.\r\n Henry W. Griffin on brief for appellant.\r\n Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, Margaret D.\r\nMcGaughey and Gail F. Malone, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 12, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs\r\n(including appellant's pro se filings) and the record, we find\r\nno merit in any of appellant's arguments:\r\n          1.   There was no plain error in sentencing appellant\r\nunder the armed career criminal provisions.  See United Statesv. Sullivan, 98 F.3d 686, 689 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\r\n117 S.Ct. 1344 (1997).\r\n          2.   The applicable offense level was properly\r\ndetermined under U.S.S.G.  4B1.4(b), thereby mooting\r\nappellant's argument about calculation of a lower offense level\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  2B3.1(b)(2).\r\n          3.   Before the sentencing hearing, appellant\r\nwithdrew his motion for a downward departure based on\r\nmitigating circumstances, and so his argument on that subject\r\nwas waived. \r\n          4.   The record before us gives no hint of any\r\nirregularity in the plea proceedings.  If defendant believes he\r\nhas claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in that regard\r\nor in any other regard, he may raise those claims in\r\nproceedings under 28 U.S.C.  2255, but we will not consider\r\nthem in the context of this direct appeal.  See United Statesv. Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d 1289, 1297 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
