In this case, the Commissioner of\r\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service (the Commissioner) issued a deficiency\r\n\nnotice to the State Police Association of Massachusetts (the\r\n\nAssociation) for income taxes allegedly due but unpaid. When the\r\n\nAssociation protested, the Tax Court sided with the Commissioner.\r\n\nSee State \r                    Police \r                           Ass'n \r                                 of \r                                    Mass. v. Commissioner, 72 T.C.M. (CCH)\r\n\n582 (1996) (Tax Ct. Op.). The Association appeals, contending that\r\n\nthe Tax Court erred both in finding that the deficiency assessment\r\n\nwas timely and in holding that certain of the Association's\r\n\nactivities gave rise to liability for unrelated business income\r\n\ntax. We affirm.\r\n\nI. BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The Association is a labor organization, and, as such, is\r\n\nexempt from income taxes under 26 U.S.C. S 501(c)(5) (1994). The\r\n\npurpose of the organization is to represent its members in\r\n\nbargaining over the terms and conditions of their employment and to\r\n\npromote a fraternal spirit among members. Virtually all the\r\n\ntroopers who are eligible to join the Association do so.\r\n\n          During the years at issue, the Association published an\r\n\nannual yearbook, known as \r                                   The \r                                      Constabulary. The yearbook consisted\r\n\nof photographs, articles, display advertisements, and a business\r\n\ndirectory. We describe     infra the sales effort (which the\r\n\nAssociation in more salubrious times called the \"earnings program\")\r\n\n     From this point forward, we will refer to the applicable\r\nprovisions of the Tax Code, as they appeared on the date(s) in\r\nquestion, by using the preface \"IRC.\" To illustrate, 26 U.S.C. S\r\n501(c)(5) will be cited as IRC S 501(c)(5), and so on and so forth.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nand the mechanics of publication and distribution. It is enough\r\n\nfor now to say that the earnings program proved to be aptly named:\r\n\ngross receipts related to the publication of The Constabulary for\r\n\nthe years at issue totalled $8,788,211. Of this amount, the\r\n\nAssociation retained somewhat over 40% (the precise percentage\r\n\nvaried from year to year, and is of no consequence here). The\r\n\nAssociation paid no tax on the income.\r\n\n          It is said that all good things come to an end. Federal\r\n\nlaw requires that an otherwise tax-exempt organization must pay\r\n\nfederal income tax on income derived from business ventures which\r\n\nare not substantially related to its tax-exempt purpose(s).   See\r\n\nIRC S 511. After due investigation, the Commissioner concluded\r\n\nthat the Association had violated this stricture because the sale\r\n\nof advertising in \r                           The \r                               Constabulary yielded taxable income. Acting\r\n\non this conclusion, the Commissioner issued a deficiency notice\r\n\nseeking $1,352,433 in taxes due for the tax years ended April 30,\r\n\n1986 through April 30, 1989, the three months ended July 31, 1989,\r\n\nand the tax years ended July 31, 1990 and 1991, along with\r\n\nadditions to tax and penalties totalling $711,075.\r\n\n          Displeased by this turn of events, the Association\r\n\nbrought suit in the Tax Court under IRC S 6213(a) to obtain a\r\n\nredetermination of the taxes allegedly due. It claimed that, for\r\n\ncertain tax years, the notice of deficiency had been issued beyond\r\n\nthe applicable limitation period; and that, on a broader plane, the\r\n\nactivity cited by the Commissioner   the solicitation, sale, and\r\n\npublication of display ads and listings in The Constabulary   did\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nnot constitute an unrelated trade or business regularly carried on,\r\n\nand that, therefore, the income derived from that activity was\r\n\nexempt from tax. The Tax Court rejected both of these theses and\r\n\nsustained the Commissioner's determination of the existence and\r\n\nextent of the deficiency (although it eliminated the additions to\r\n\ntax and the penalties). See Tax Ct. Op. at 589, 594. This appeal\r\n\nensued.\r\n\nII. THE PUTATIVE TIME BAR\r\n\n          The Association claims that the statute of limitations\r\n\nbars the collection of taxes as to some or all of the affected\r\n\nperiods. The relevant facts are not in dispute. On August 3,\r\n\n1992, the Association and the Commissioner, through their\r\n\nauthorized representatives, executed a form entitled \"Consent to\r\n\nExtend the Time to Assess Tax\" (the Form). The Form, a copy of\r\n\nwhich is reprinted in the appendix, permitted the Commissioner to\r\n\nassess income tax on or before April 30, 1993, for the contested\r\n\nperiods through July 31, 1989. The Commissioner assessed the taxes\r\n\nallegedly due for these periods by issuing a deficiency notice on\r\n\nApril 22, 1993. The applicable limitation period is three years.\r\n\nSee IRC S 6501(a). If the Form sufficed to extend the limitation\r\n\nperiod, then the deficiency notice was timely as to all the tax\r\n\nyears at issue; if not, the Commissioner's claim for certain\r\n\nperiods is probably time-barred.\r\n\n          The Association advances a purely linguistic argument on\r\n\nthis point. It notes that the text of the Form provides for an\r\n\nextension of the limitation period solely with respect to tax due\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\non \"any return(s) made\" by the Association during the periods in\r\n\nquestion. The only returns so made were information returns, on\r\n\nForm 990, entitled \"Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax.\"\r\n\nBy definition, no tax could possibly be due on an information\r\n\nreturn. Taking this literal view, the Association contends that\r\n\nthe Form did not extend the limitation period at all.\r\n\n          The Tax Court refused to swallow this slippery syllogism.\r\n\nIt impliedly found the language of the Form ambiguous and construed\r\n\nit as broad enough to include not only taxes due on returns made\r\n\nbut also taxes due on returns deemed to be made.  See Tax Ct. Op.\r\n\nat 589. Ascertaining the ambiguity  vel non of a writing requires\r\n\na court to ask and answer a question of law, and, therefore, we\r\n\nreview this conclusion de novo. See IRC S 7482(c)(1); \r                                                               see \r                                                                   also \r                                                                        RCI\r\n\nNortheast Servs. Div.\r                               v. \r                                  Boston Edison Co.\r                                                   , 822 F.2d 199, 202 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1987).\r\n\n          The Tax Court's rendition withstands scrutiny. Tax forms\r\n\nare rarely models of syntactical clarity, and the Form signed by\r\n\nthe parties is no exception. The Tax Court read the phrase\r\n\n\"return(s) made\" as encompassing returns deemed to be made. This\r\n\nconstruction strikes us as reasonable.\r\n\n          Words must be read in context. Though a plain vanilla\r\n\nreading of the Form would support an inference that the parties\r\n\nwished to extend the limitation period for assessing taxes due on\r\n\nactual returns filed for the applicable periods, the context casts\r\n\na different light on the phrase \"return(s) made.\" When one takes\r\n\ninto account that the only \"returns made\" were information returns\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\non which no tax could conceivably be due, and that the signatories\r\n\nto the Form knew as much, the ambiguity of the phrase becomes\r\n\napparent.\r\n\n          Our thinking runs along the following lines. It would be\r\n\nnonsensical to extend the limitation period for assessment of taxes\r\n\ndue on a return on which, by operation of law, no tax conceivably\r\n\ncould be due. The law, in turn, should be reluctant to insist that\r\n\ncourts construe a document in a way that leads to an absurd or\r\n\nnonsensical result. Indeed, the maxim   ut res magis valeat  quam\r\n\npereat teaches that a written instrument ordinarily should be given\r\n\na meaning that will make it legally functional rather than a\r\n\nmeaning which will render it legally dysfunctional.  See 3 Arthur\r\n\nLinton Corbin, Corbin on Contracts S 532 (1960); see also Blackie\r\n\nv. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 722 (1st Cir. 1996). Thus, the very\r\n\nimplausibility of the Association's proposed construction suggests\r\n\nthat the phrase \"return[s] made\" must have some other meaning.\r\n\n          This conclusion is fortified by the wonted operation of\r\n\nthe relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\r\n\nSpecifically, a return relative to the unrelated business taxable\r\n\nincome of a normally tax-exempt organization (a so-called \"990-T\"\r\n\nreturn) is deemed made, for purposes of starting the running of the\r\n\nlimitation period, when the information return (a so-called \"990\"\r\n\nreturn) is in fact made.    See California \r                                                     Thoroughbred \r                                                                   Breeders\r\n\nAss'n v. Commissioner, 47 T.C. 335, 338 (1966) (construing IRC S\r\n\n6501(g)(2)). Without this rule deeming the Association's 990\r\n\nreturn to be a 990-T return, the statute of limitations that the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nAssociation seeks to invoke would, presumably, not yet have begun\r\n\nto run. The Association thus seeks to link the two forms for the\r\n\npurposes of starting the limitations period, but would have us\r\n\ndecouple the forms in reviewing its agreement to extend that\r\n\nperiod. Perhaps more important, reading the Form against the\r\n\nbackdrop of the  California \r                                      Thoroughbred \r                                                    Breeders rule suggests\r\n\nanother (broader) meaning for the phrase \"return(s) made\"   a\r\n\nmeaning which extends to returns deemed made   and thus highlights\r\n\nthe ambiguity of the Form.\r\n\n          That ends the matter. The presence of an ambiguity\r\n\npermits a reviewing court to examine extrinsic evidence in an\r\n\neffort to clarify the intent of the parties. \r                                                      See \r                                                          Smart v. \r                                                                   Gillette\r\n\nCo. \r              Long-Term \r                        Disability \r                                   Plan, 70 F.3d 173, 179 (1st Cir. 1995);\r\n\nRCI \r              Northeast, 822 F.2d at 202. Here, the extrinsic evidence is\r\n\ntelling: the Association's reading of the Form contradicts what\r\n\neven the Association admits was the parties' mutual intention   to\r\n\nextend the limitation period as to any unrelated business income\r\n\ntax that might be due for the affected periods.\r\n\n          We need not linger. We resolve contractual ambiguity in\r\n\n     The court below suggested that, if it were unable to construe\r\nthe language in the Form to give effect to the parties' discerned\r\nintention, it could reach the same result by reforming the\r\ninstrument.  See Tax Ct. Op. at 589 n.4. In general, reformation\r\nis available when a writing is clear on its face (i.e.,\r\nunambiguous) but nonetheless misstates the parties' intent.  See,\r\ne.g., \r               United States\r                             v. \r                                Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.\r                                                        , 917 F.2d 654, 658\r\n(1st Cir. 1990); \r                          Rocanville Corp.\r                                           v. \r                                              Natural Gas Pipeline Co.\r                                                                      , 823\r\nF.2d 92, 94 (5th Cir. 1987);   see also Restatement (Second) of\r\nContracts S 155 (1979). The doctrine can be applied in tax cases.\r\nSee, e.g., Woods v.  Commissioner, 92 T.C. 776, 782-83 (1989).\r\nHowever, because we uphold the Tax Court's implicit finding that\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nfavor of effectiveness, accept the discerned intent of the parties,\r\n\nendorse the Tax Court's interpretation of the phrase \"return[s]\r\n\nmade,\" and hold that the Form extended the limitation period as to\r\n\nthe assessment of unrelated business income tax. The notice of\r\n\ndeficiency was, therefore, timely as to all the contested tax\r\n\nyears.\r\n\nIII. THE MERITS\r\n\n            The gravamen of the Commissioner's case is the charge\r\n\nthat the activity undertaken in connection with publication of \r                                                                        The\r\n\nConstabulary generated unrelated business taxable income. The\r\n\nallegation that an activity engaged in by a tax-exempt organization\r\n\ngives rise to unrelated business taxable income requires proof of\r\n\nthree components. The Commissioner must demonstrate (1) that the\r\n\nactivity comprises a trade or business, (2) which is regularly\r\n\ncarried on, and (3) which is not substantially related to the\r\n\norganization's tax-exempt purpose.  See United States v. American\r\n\nBar Endowment, 477 U.S. 105, 110 (1986); see also IRC S 513(a).\r\n\n                               A.\r\n\n          At the gateway to this issue, the parties dispute the\r\n\nstandard of review. The Association asserts that the Tax Court's\r\n\nfindings   that publication of \r                                       The \r                                           Constabulary involved a business\r\n\nregularly carried on    are subject to de novo review. The\r\n\nthe Form is ambiguous, we need not reach the reformation issue.\r\n\n     The Association does not mount a challenge on the third prong\r\nof the tripartite test, instead conceding that if the activity\r\namounts to a regularly conducted trade or business, it is, as the\r\nTax Court found, not substantially related to the Association's\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nCommissioner maintains that these findings are entitled to greater\r\n\ndeference.\r\n\n          Congress has directed the courts of appeals to use the\r\n\nsame standards in reviewing Tax Court decisions that traditionally\r\n\nare used in appellate review of district court decisions in civil\r\n\nactions tried without a jury. See IRC S 7482(a). Consequently, we\r\n\nevaluate the Tax Court's findings of fact under the clearly\r\n\nerroneous standard. See \r                                  Commissioner v. \r                                                  Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278,\r\n\n291 (1960); Manzoli v. Commissioner, 904 F.2d 101, 103 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1990); see  also Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). This mode of review\r\n\nrequires us to accept the Tax Court's credibility determinations\r\n\nand its findings about historical facts unless, after careful\r\n\nevaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction\r\n\nthat those determinations and findings are simply wrong.      See\r\n\nReliance Steel Prods. Co.\r                                   v. \r                                      National Fire Ins. Co.\r                                                            , 880 F.2d 575,\r\n\n576 (1st Cir. 1989). Notwithstanding the clearly erroneous rule,\r\n\nhowever, the Tax Court's ultimate conclusions (e.g., whether the\r\n\nfacts, as found, are legally sufficient to demonstrate that the\r\n\nAssociation engaged in a trade or business) are conclusions of law,\r\n\nand are therefore subject to de novo review.\r\n\n          On the merits, the Association advances two challenges:\r\n\nit asserts that the activities in question did not constitute a\r\n\ntrade or business, and that in all events those activities were not\r\n\nconducted with the requisite regularity. We address these\r\n\nchallenges sequentially.\r\n\ntax-exempt purpose.  See Tax Ct. Op. at 591.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n                               B.\r\n\n          The operating paradigm permitted the Association to\r\n\nexercise significant control over the sales effort, the handling of\r\n\nthe funds generated, and the publication of    The  Constabulary.\r\n\nUnder this paradigm, the Association contracted with an outside\r\n\nfirm (originally Brent-Wyatt East, and later R.H. McKnight Co.) to\r\n\npublish the yearbook and recruit telemarketers. These\r\n\ntelemarketers were considered joint employees of the Association\r\n\nand the outside firm.\r                               Groups of eight to twelve callers worked out\r\n\nof field offices selected by the outside firm with the\r\n\nAssociation's approval and solicited local and national businesses\r\n\nwithin geographic areas demarcated by the Association. In so\r\n\ndoing, they utilized a canned solicitation format approved by the\r\n\nAssociation, introducing themselves as calling on behalf of the\r\n\nAssociation. Troopers monitored all solicitations to make certain\r\n\nthat the sales staff did not trespass into forbidden terrain. The\r\n\nAssociation also retained the right to inspect, without prior\r\n\nnotice, the field offices from which solicitations took place.\r\n\n          Prospective customers were offered the opportunity to\r\n\npurchase display advertisements and listings. Displays ranged in\r\n\nsize from one-sixth of a page to a full page, and, at the\r\n\npurchaser's option, could contain text, logos, slogans, borders,\r\n\n     We describe the relationship as it existed through mid-1990,\r\nunder contractual arrangements with Brent-Wyatt East. Although the\r\ncontract signed with McKnight on June 20, 1990, contained some\r\nvariations, the Tax Court supportably found that these changes were\r\nlargely cosmetic and did not alter the essential character of the\r\nrelationship.  See Tax Ct. Op. at 585.\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nand blocking. The fee charged for a display advertisement or a\r\n\ndirectory listing varied in direct proportion to the size of the\r\n\ndisplay or listing and to the number of editions in which it\r\n\nappeared.   The Constabulary was arranged so that displays were\r\n\ninterspersed with editorial matter, and the publication contained\r\n\na so-called \"Index to Advertisers.\" Listings were arranged by type\r\n\nof product or service in a separate business directory section.\r\n\n          Payments for ads sold were made to the Association and\r\n\nthe Association deposited the receipts in its account. It made\r\n\nweekly accountings   retaining a stipulated percentage \"off the\r\n\ntop\" for itself, paying set percentages of the gross receipts to\r\n\nthe telemarketers and to the outside firm, defraying the costs\r\n\nassociated with solicitation and publication   and kept any excess.\r\n\n          The Association published  The  Constabulary annually.\r\n\nAssociation members acted as the editorial staff, writing and\r\n\nediting articles for the publication and approving the contents of\r\n\nthe finished product. The Association distributed the yearbook\r\n\nfree of charge at various state troopers' barracks, the\r\n\nAssociation's annual picnic (the \"Police Chase\"), and other\r\n\noccasions. Copies were sometimes sent to advertisers.\r\n\n          Based on this scenario, the Commissioner's theory is that\r\n\nthe Association   which from time to time called The Constabulary\r\n\nan \"ad book\" and which, in its contract with Brent-Wyatt East,\r\n\nreferred to the latter's assignment as \"marketing advertising\"  \r\n\n     The Association produced five regional editions with common\r\neditorial material.\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\nengaged in the business of selling advertising. The Association\r\n\ncounters that it did not engage in that business; in its view, the\r\n\ndisplays and listings were not advertising at all, but merely a\r\n\nmeans of identifying sponsors. The Tax Court rejected this\r\n\ncontention, see Tax Ct. Op. at 590, and so do we.\r\n\n          Even a cursory glance at the yearbook, the pricing\r\n\nstructure, and the terminology used by the Association belies the\r\n\nbelated claim that the ads and listings were not \"advertising\" as\r\n\nthat term is commonly understood. Nor is the Association's\r\n\nattempted recharacterization made any more palatable by its\r\n\nreliance on Proposed Treas. Reg. S 1.513-4, 58 Fed. Reg. 5690, 5690\r\n\n(1993). The proposed regulation describes the permissible contents\r\n\nof acknowledgements of sponsorship payments; it allows value-\r\n\nneutral descriptions of a sponsor's products or services, and logos\r\n\nor slogans \"that are an established part of a sponsor's identity.\"\r\n\nSee id. S 1.513-4(c). We need not decide, however, whether the\r\n\nmaterials in The Constabulary meet these exacting criteria; the\r\n\nproposed regulation, by its terms, does not apply to periodicals\r\n\nproduced by tax-exempt organizations.  See id. S 1.513-4(a).\r\n\n          Putting the proposed regulation to one side, the\r\n\nCommissioner's appraisal of The Constabulary's contents comports\r\n\nwith common sense: the displays look like ads, the directory\r\n\nlistings function as guides to products and services, and the\r\n\nAssociation itself, at least during the first four years of the\r\n\nundertaking, consistently referred to the displays and listings as\r\n\nads rather than as acknowledgements. That appraisal also is\r\n\n                               12\r\r\n\nsupported by well-reasoned precedent.\r\n\n          Fraternal Order of Police, Etc.\r                                                   v. \r                                                      Commissioner, 87 T.C.\r\n\n747 (1986), aff'd, 833 F.2d 717 (7th Cir. 1987) (FOP), which also\r\n\ninvolved the solicitation and sale of insertions in a publication\r\n\nsponsored by a tax-exempt policemen's organization, bears a strong\r\n\nresemblance to the case at bar. The Tax Court found that the\r\n\nactivity in question amounted to an unrelated business. 87 T.C. at\r\n\n757. The Seventh Circuit affirmed this finding. 833 F.2d at 721-\r\n\n22. The similarities are striking. There, as here, the\r\n\npublication included display ads (using logos, slogans, and\r\n\nblocking), a directory section, and a message asking readers to\r\n\npatronize the businesses listed therein.     See id. at 719-20.\r\n\nThere, as here, the size of an insertion was directly proportionate\r\n\nto the price charged.    See id. at 721. There, as here, the\r\n\nsponsoring organization, prior to the time the Commissioner came\r\n\ncalling, characterized the disputed activity as advertising.  See\r\n\nid.\r\n\n          Given these similarities, FOP is powerful authority for\r\n\nthe Commissioner's position that the activity here in question\r\n\ncomprises a separate, unrelated business. We consider         FOP\r\n\ncorrectly decided, and we find unconvincing the Association's\r\n\nattempts to distinguish it.  Consequently, we hold that the Tax\r\n\n     In striving to reach escape velocity from \r                                                         FOP's precedential\r\norbit, the Association relies heavily on its presentation of expert\r\ntestimony at trial. But this testimony was discounted by the Tax\r\nCourt because the expert was dismally uninformed. See Tax Ct. Op.\r\nat 589-90. That determination was well within the trier's purview.\r\nSee \r             Seagate Tech., Inc.\r                                 v. \r                                    Commissioner, 102 T.C. 149, 186 (1994).\r\n\n                               13\r\r\n\nCourt did not commit clear error in finding that the Association's\r\n\nsolicitation, sale, and publication of displays and listings in \r                                                                        The\r\n\nConstabulary constituted the business of advertising.\r\n\n          The Association's fallback position is its claim that the\r\n\nCommissioner erred in treating the outside firms (Brent-Wyatt East\r\n\nand McKnight, respectively) as agents of the Association (and,\r\n\nthus, in attributing these firms' activities to the Association).\r\n\nTo bolster this claim, the Association stresses that the contract\r\n\ndocuments required these firms to operate as independent\r\n\ncontractors. It follows, the Association says, that even if the\r\n\ncited activities constituted the business of advertising, the\r\n\nbusiness belonged to the outside firms.\r\n\n          We are not persuaded. In the first place, an independent\r\n\ncontractor can be an agent if, and to the extent that, the\r\n\ncontractor acts for the benefit of another and under its control in\r\n\na particular transaction. See Restatement (Second) of Agency SS 2,\r\n\n14N (1957). In the second place, the label which contracting\r\n\nparties place on their relationship is not decisive of their status\r\n\nvis-a-vis third parties.  See Board \r                                              of \r                                                 Trade v.

Either way, answering the question\r\n\nthat the Association raises requires that we examine the substance\r\n\nof the contracting parties' relationship.\r\n\n          In this analysis, no single factor is dispositive.  See\r\n\nLabor \r                Relations \r                          Div. \r                               of \r                                  Constr. \r                                           Indus. v.

Rather, the nature of\r\n\nthe relationship between the Association and the outside firms\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\ndepends on a myriad of factors, including control over the manner\r\n\nand means of performing the work, the skill required, the method of\r\n\npayment, the duration of the relationship, and similar factors.\r\n\nSee, \r              e.g., \r                    Saenger Org., Inc.\r                                       v. \r                                         Nationwide Ins. Licensing Assocs.,\r\n\nInc.,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1997) [No. 96-2197, slip op. at\r\n\n12]; \r              Speen v. \r                       Crown Clothing Corp.\r                                           , 102 F.3d 625, 629-30 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1996). The relevant factors here, taken as a whole, solidly\r\n\nsupport the Tax Court's determination that the outside firms acted\r\n\nas the Association's agents.\r\n\n          First and foremost, the manner in which the Association\r\n\nconducted its affairs undercuts its claim that it lacked the\r\n\nrequisite degree of suasion over the outside firms' activities.\r\n\nThe Association retained very tight control over the method and\r\n\nmanner of solicitation, the ingredients of the sales pitch, the\r\n\nidentity of the solicitors, the financial aspects of the\r\n\narrangement, the use of its name, the advertising formats, and the\r\n\ncontents of the yearbook. We refer the reader who hungers for a\r\n\nblow-by-blow account to the details set out in the opinion below.\r\n\nSee Tax Ct. Op. at 584-85. Without belaboring the point, it is\r\n\nenough to say that the record reveals an ample factual predicate\r\n\nfor the finding that an agency relationship existed between the\r\n\nAssociation and the outside firms.\r\n\n                               C.\r\n\n          The Association's final contention is that, even if its\r\n\nactivities comprise a business attributable to it, that business\r\n\nwas not carried on regularly. To buttress this contention, the\r\n\n                               15\r\r\n\nAssociation makes two separate, but related, arguments.\r\n\n          Its first asseveration rests on the decisions in \r                                                                   National\r\n\nCollegiate Athletic Ass'n\r                                   v. \r                                      Commissioner, 914 F.2d 1417 (10th Cir.\r\n\n1990) (NCAA), and Suffolk \r                                    County \r                                           Patrolmen's \r                                                       Benevolent \r                                                                  Ass'n v.\r\n\nCommissioner, 77 T.C. 1314 (1981). These decisions are inapposite.\r\n\nIn each instance, the advertising activity was tied to the program\r\n\nfor a specific event.   See  NCAA, 914 F.2d at 1420 (collegiate\r\n\nbasketball tournament); \r                                 Suffolk County\r                                               , 77 T.C. at 1316 (vaudeville\r\n\nshow). Thus, resolution of those cases depended on Treas. Reg. S\r\n\n1.513-1(c)(2)(ii), which specifically provides that \"publication of\r\n\nadvertising in programs for sports events or music or drama\r\n\nperformances will not ordinarily be deemed to be the regular\r\n\ncarrying on of business.\" That regulation is of no assistance here\r\n\nbecause the Tax Court found specially that the Association's\r\n\npublication of \r                        The \r                            Constabulary was not linked to the occurrence of\r\n\na specific event, see Tax Ct. Op. at 593, and the Association has\r\n\nnot challenged that finding in this venue.\r\n\n          We hasten to add, moreover, that the mode of analysis\r\n\nused in NCAA and Suffolk County cannot be employed here. Because\r\n\nthose cases each involved a particular event, they looked to the\r\n\ntime frame of the event in determining the regularity with which\r\n\nthe business was carried on.    See  NCAA, 914 F.2d at 1422-23;\r\n\nSuffolk County\r                       , 77 T.C. at 1322-24. In a case like this one, where\r\n\n     It is interesting to note that Proposed Treas. Reg. S 1.513-4\r\ndraws a clear distinction between periodicals and material\r\npublished in connection with a specific sponsored event. We find\r\nthe distinction significant.\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nthe publication of an ad book is not pegged to a particular event,\r\n\na court must assay the activities which collectively comprise the\r\n\nbusiness, and look to the overall time frame in which they\r\n\noccurred. For present purposes, that means the time frame in which\r\n\nthe Association solicited, sold, and published advertising.   See\r\n\nTreas. Reg. S 1.513-1(b) (noting that the activities of soliciting,\r\n\nselling, and publishing advertising collectively constitute a\r\n\nbusiness). Those activities persisted for approximately 46 weeks\r\n\na year.   See Tax Ct. Op. at 593. This is more than sufficient\r\n\nregularity by any standard.\r\n\n          The Association next argues that it did not regularly\r\n\nengage in a business because it did not carry on the advertising\r\n\nactivity with the same entrepreneurial zeal that might typify a\r\n\ncommercial operator. But this is an ill-conceived comparison.\r\n\nAlthough the purpose behind the unrelated business income tax is to\r\n\ncreate a more level playing field between taxed and tax-exempt\r\n\nenterprises, competitive similarities are not the only factors to\r\n\nbe taken into account.     See  FOP, 833 F.2d at 722-23. The\r\n\napplicable regulation stipulates that the activity in question must\r\n\nbe judged \"in light of the purpose\" of the tax, but it does not\r\n\nrequire that either actual competition or competitive equality be\r\n\n     To be sure, the Association argues that the time frame is much\r\nshorter because, although solicitation and sales transpired 46\r\nweeks a year, publication occurred within a very narrow temporal\r\nwindow. This argument is disingenuous. Treas. Reg. S 1.513-1(b)\r\nrefers to the activities of soliciting, selling, and publishing\r\nadvertising as a singular business. That business must be\r\nregularly carried on, but there is no requirement that each task\r\nwithin the scope of the business must be carried on regularly.\r\n\n                               17\r\r\n\nshown. Treas. Reg. S 1.513-1(c)(1).\r\n\n          In this instance, the Association carried on its\r\n\nactivities in a systematic and well-organized fashion, with a\r\n\nclearly defined profit motive. Given the limitations of clear-\r\n\nerror review, we cannot disturb the lower court's finding that the\r\n\nAssociation's activities were sufficiently regular to bring them\r\n\nwithin the ambit of the regulation.  See Tax Ct. Op. at 593.\r\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further. While the Association makes\r\n\nseveral other arguments, none requires discussion; each of them is\r\n\neither adequately treated in the Tax Court's opinion, or obviously\r\n\nincorrect, or both. It suffices to say that the Commissioner's\r\n\ndetermination of the tax due and owing rests on a sturdy factual\r\n\nand legal foundation.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r\n\n                               18\r\n",

Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.M.</span>\r\n\n<span class=\"page\">582</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996) (Tax Ct. Op.). The Association appeals, contending that\r\n\nthe Tax Court erred both in finding that the deficiency assessment\r\n\nwas timely and in holding that certain of the Association's\r\n\nactivities gave rise to liability for unrelated business income\r\n\ntax. We affirm.\r\n\nI. BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The Association is a labor organization, and, as such, is\r\n\nexempt from income taxes under 26 U.S.C. S 501(c)(5) (1994). The\r\n\npurpose of the organization is to represent its members in\r\n\nbargaining over the terms and conditions of their employment and to\r\n\npromote a fraternal spirit among members. Virtually all the\r\n\ntroopers who are eligible to join the Association do so.\r\n\n          During the years at issue, the Association published an\r\n\nannual yearbook, known as \r                                   The \r                                      Constabulary. The yearbook consisted\r\n\nof photographs, articles, display advertisements, and a business\r\n\ndirectory. We describe     infra the sales effort (which the\r\n\nAssociation in more salubrious times called the \"earnings program\")\r\n\n     From this point forward, we will refer to the applicable\r\nprovisions of the Tax Code, as they appeared on the date(s) in\r\nquestion, by using the preface \"IRC.\" To illustrate, 26 U.S.C. S\r\n501(c)(5) will be cited as IRC S 501(c)(5), and so on and so forth.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nand the mechanics of publication and distribution. It is enough\r\n\nfor now to say that the earnings program proved to be aptly named:\r\n\ngross receipts related to the publication of The Constabulary for\r\n\nthe years at issue totalled $8,788,211. Of this amount, the\r\n\nAssociation retained somewhat over 40% (the precise percentage\r\n\nvaried from year to year, and is of no consequence here). The\r\n\nAssociation paid no tax on the income.\r\n\n          It is said that all good things come to an end. Federal\r\n\nlaw requires that an otherwise tax-exempt organization must pay\r\n\nfederal income tax on income derived from business ventures which\r\n\nare not substantially related to its tax-exempt purpose(s).   See\r\n\nIRC S 511. After due investigation, the Commissioner concluded\r\n\nthat the Association had violated this stricture because the sale\r\n\nof advertising in \r                           The \r                               Constabulary yielded taxable income. Acting\r\n\non this conclusion, the Commissioner issued a deficiency notice\r\n\nseeking $1,352,433 in taxes due for the tax years ended April 30,\r\n\n1986 through April 30, 1989, the three months ended July 31, 1989,\r\n\nand the tax years ended July 31, 1990 and 1991, along with\r\n\nadditions to tax and penalties totalling $711,075.\r\n\n          Displeased by this turn of events, the Association\r\n\nbrought suit in the Tax Court under IRC S 6213(a) to obtain a\r\n\nredetermination of the taxes allegedly due. It claimed that, for\r\n\ncertain tax years, the notice of deficiency had been issued beyond\r\n\nthe applicable limitation period; and that, on a broader plane, the\r\n\nactivity cited by the Commissioner   the solicitation, sale, and\r\n\npublication of display ads and listings in The Constabulary   did\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nnot constitute an unrelated trade or business regularly carried on,\r\n\nand that, therefore, the income derived from that activity was\r\n\nexempt from tax. The Tax Court rejected both of these theses and\r\n\nsustained the Commissioner's determination of the existence and\r\n\nextent of the deficiency (although it eliminated the additions to\r\n\ntax and the penalties). See Tax Ct. Op. at 589, 594. This appeal\r\n\nensued.\r\n\nII. THE PUTATIVE TIME BAR\r\n\n          The Association claims that the statute of limitations\r\n\nbars the collection of taxes as to some or all of the affected\r\n\nperiods. The relevant facts are not in dispute. On August 3,\r\n\n1992, the Association and the Commissioner, through their\r\n\nauthorized representatives, executed a form entitled \"Consent to\r\n\nExtend the Time to Assess Tax\" (the Form). The Form, a copy of\r\n\nwhich is reprinted in the appendix, permitted the Commissioner to\r\n\nassess income tax on or before April 30, 1993, for the contested\r\n\nperiods through July 31, 1989. The Commissioner assessed the taxes\r\n\nallegedly due for these periods by issuing a deficiency notice on\r\n\nApril 22, 1993. The applicable limitation period is three years.\r\n\nSee IRC S 6501(a). If the Form sufficed to extend the limitation\r\n\nperiod, then the deficiency notice was timely as to all the tax\r\n\nyears at issue; if not, the Commissioner's claim for certain\r\n\nperiods is probably time-barred.\r\n\n          The Association advances a purely linguistic argument on\r\n\nthis point. It notes that the text of the Form provides for an\r\n\nextension of the limitation period solely with respect to tax due\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\non \"any return(s) made\" by the Association during the periods in\r\n\nquestion. The only returns so made were information returns, on\r\n\nForm 990, entitled \"Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax.\"\r\n\nBy definition, no tax could possibly be due on an information\r\n\nreturn. Taking this literal view, the Association contends that\r\n\nthe Form did not extend the limitation period at all.\r\n\n          The Tax Court refused to swallow this slippery syllogism.\r\n\nIt impliedly found the language of the Form ambiguous and construed\r\n\nit as broad enough to include not only taxes due on returns made\r\n\nbut also taxes due on returns deemed to be made.  See Tax Ct. Op.\r\n\nat 589. Ascertaining the ambiguity  vel non of a writing requires\r\n\na court to ask and answer a question of law, and, therefore, we\r\n\nreview this conclusion de novo. See IRC S 7482(c)(1); \r                                                               see \r                                                                   also \r                                                                        RCI\r\n\nNortheast Servs. Div.\r                               v. \r                                  Boston Edison Co.\r                                                   , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490520\"><a href=\"/opinion/490520/rci-northeast-services-division-v-boston-edison-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1987).\r\n\n          The Tax Court's rendition withstands scrutiny. Tax forms\r\n\nare rarely models of syntactical clarity, and the Form signed by\r\n\nthe parties is no exception. The Tax Court read the phrase\r\n\n\"return(s) made\" as encompassing returns deemed to be made. This\r\n\nconstruction strikes us as reasonable.\r\n\n          Words must be read in context. Though a plain vanilla\r\n\nreading of the Form would support an inference that the parties\r\n\nwished to extend the limitation period for assessing taxes due on\r\n\nactual returns filed for the applicable periods, the context casts\r\n\na different light on the phrase \"return(s) made.\" When one takes\r\n\ninto account that the only \"returns made\" were information returns\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\non which no tax could conceivably be due, and that the signatories\r\n\nto the Form knew as much, the ambiguity of the phrase becomes\r\n\napparent.\r\n\n          Our thinking runs along the following lines. It would be\r\n\nnonsensical to extend the limitation period for assessment of taxes\r\n\ndue on a return on which, by operation of law, no tax conceivably\r\n\ncould be due. The law, in turn, should be reluctant to insist that\r\n\ncourts construe a document in a way that leads to an absurd or\r\n\nnonsensical result. Indeed, the maxim   ut res magis valeat  quam\r\n\npereat teaches that a written instrument ordinarily should be given\r\n\na meaning that will make it legally functional rather than a\r\n\nmeaning which will render it legally dysfunctional.  See 3 Arthur\r\n\nLinton Corbin, Corbin on Contracts S 532 (1960); see also Blackie\r\n\nv. Maine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712176\"><a href=\"/opinion/712176/dana-blackie-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722 (1st Cir. 1996). Thus, the very\r\n\nimplausibility of the Association's proposed construction suggests\r\n\nthat the phrase \"return[s] made\" must have some other meaning.\r\n\n          This conclusion is fortified by the wonted operation of\r\n\nthe relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\r\n\nSpecifically, a return relative to the unrelated business taxable\r\n\nincome of a normally tax-exempt organization (a so-called \"990-T\"\r\n\nreturn) is deemed made, for purposes of starting the running of the\r\n\nlimitation period, when the information return (a so-called \"990\"\r\n\nreturn) is in fact made.    See California \r                                                     Thoroughbred \r                                                                   Breeders\r\n\nAss'n v.

Without this rule deeming the Association's 990\r\n\nreturn to be a 990-T return, the statute of limitations that the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nAssociation seeks to invoke would, presumably, not yet have begun\r\n\nto run. The Association thus seeks to link the two forms for the\r\n\npurposes of starting the limitations period, but would have us\r\n\ndecouple the forms in reviewing its agreement to extend that\r\n\nperiod. Perhaps more important, reading the Form against the\r\n\nbackdrop of the  California \r                                      Thoroughbred \r                                                    Breeders rule suggests\r\n\nanother (broader) meaning for the phrase \"return(s) made\"   a\r\n\nmeaning which extends to returns deemed made   and thus highlights\r\n\nthe ambiguity of the Form.\r\n\n          That ends the matter. The presence of an ambiguity\r\n\npermits a reviewing court to examine extrinsic evidence in an\r\n\neffort to clarify the intent of the parties. \r                                                      See \r                                                          Smart v. \r                                                                   Gillette\r\n\nCo. \r              Long-Term \r                        Disability \r                                   Plan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196424\"><a href=\"/opinion/196424/smart-v-the-gillette-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179 (1st Cir. 1995);\r\n\nRCI \r              Northeast, 822 F.2d at 202.

The\r\n\nallegation that an activity engaged in by a tax-exempt organization\r\n\ngives rise to unrelated business taxable income requires proof of\r\n\nthree components. The Commissioner must demonstrate (1) that the\r\n\nactivity comprises a trade or business, (2) which is regularly\r\n\ncarried on, and (3) which is not substantially related to the\r\n\norganization's tax-exempt purpose.

The Association asserts that the Tax Court's\r\n\nfindings   that publication of \r                                       The \r                                           Constabulary involved a business\r\n\nregularly carried on    are subject to de novo review. The\r\n\nthe Form is ambiguous, we need not reach the reformation issue.\r\n\n     The Association does not mount a challenge on the third prong\r\nof the tripartite test, instead conceding that if the activity\r\namounts to a regularly conducted trade or business, it is, as the\r\nTax Court found, not substantially related to the Association's\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nCommissioner maintains that these findings are entitled to greater\r\n\ndeference.\r\n\n          Congress has directed the courts of appeals to use the\r\n\nsame standards in reviewing Tax Court decisions that traditionally\r\n\nare used in appellate review of district court decisions in civil\r\n\nactions tried without a jury.

In so\r\n\ndoing, they utilized a canned solicitation format approved by the\r\n\nAssociation, introducing themselves as calling on behalf of the\r\n\nAssociation. Troopers monitored all solicitations to make certain\r\n\nthat the sales staff did not trespass into forbidden terrain. The\r\n\nAssociation also retained the right to inspect, without prior\r\n\nnotice, the field offices from which solicitations took place.\r\n\n          Prospective customers were offered the opportunity to\r\n\npurchase display advertisements and listings. Displays ranged in\r\n\nsize from one-sixth of a page to a full page, and, at the\r\n\npurchaser's option, could contain text, logos, slogans, borders,\r\n\n     We describe the relationship as it existed through mid-1990,\r\nunder contractual arrangements with Brent-Wyatt East. Although the\r\ncontract signed with McKnight on June 20, 1990, contained some\r\nvariations, the Tax Court supportably found that these changes were\r\nlargely cosmetic and did not alter the essential character of the\r\nrelationship.  See Tax Ct. Op. at 585.\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nand blocking. The fee charged for a display advertisement or a\r\n\ndirectory listing varied in direct proportion to the size of the\r\n\ndisplay or listing and to the number of editions in which it\r\n\nappeared.   The Constabulary was arranged so that displays were\r\n\ninterspersed with editorial matter, and the publication contained\r\n\na so-called \"Index to Advertisers.\" Listings were arranged by type\r\n\nof product or service in a separate business directory section.\r\n\n          Payments for ads sold were made to the Association and\r\n\nthe Association deposited the receipts in its account. It made\r\n\nweekly accountings   retaining a stipulated percentage \"off the\r\n\ntop\" for itself, paying set percentages of the gross receipts to\r\n\nthe telemarketers and to the outside firm, defraying the costs\r\n\nassociated with solicitation and publication   and kept any excess.\r\n\n          The Association published  The  Constabulary annually.\r\n\nAssociation members acted as the editorial staff, writing and\r\n\nediting articles for the publication and approving the contents of\r\n\nthe finished product. The Association distributed the yearbook\r\n\nfree of charge at various state troopers' barracks, the\r\n\nAssociation's annual picnic (the \"Police Chase\"), and other\r\n\noccasions. Copies were sometimes sent to advertisers.\r\n\n          Based on this scenario, the Commissioner's theory is that\r\n\nthe Association   which from time to time called The Constabulary\r\n\nan \"ad book\" and which, in its contract with Brent-Wyatt East,\r\n\nreferred to the latter's assignment as \"marketing advertising\"  \r\n\n     The Association produced five regional editions with common\r\neditorial material.\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\nengaged in the business of selling advertising. The Association\r\n\ncounters that it did not engage in that business; in its view, the\r\n\ndisplays and listings were not advertising at all, but merely a\r\n\nmeans of identifying sponsors. The Tax Court rejected this\r\n\ncontention, see Tax Ct. Op. at 590, and so do we.\r\n\n          Even a cursory glance at the yearbook, the pricing\r\n\nstructure, and the terminology used by the Association belies the\r\n\nbelated claim that the ads and listings were not \"advertising\" as\r\n\nthat term is commonly understood. Nor is the Association's\r\n\nattempted recharacterization made any more palatable by its\r\n\nreliance on Proposed Treas. Reg. S 1.513-4, 58 Fed. Reg. 5690, 5690\r\n\n(1993). The proposed regulation describes the permissible contents\r\n\nof acknowledgements of sponsorship payments; it allows value-\r\n\nneutral descriptions of a sponsor's products or services, and logos\r\n\nor slogans \"that are an established part of a sponsor's identity.\"\r\n\nSee id. S 1.513-4(c). We need not decide, however, whether the\r\n\nmaterials in The Constabulary meet these exacting criteria; the\r\n\nproposed regulation, by its terms, does not apply to periodicals\r\n\nproduced by tax-exempt organizations.  See id. S 1.513-4(a).\r\n\n          Putting the proposed regulation to one side, the\r\n\nCommissioner's appraisal of The Constabulary's contents comports\r\n\nwith common sense: the displays look like ads, the directory\r\n\nlistings function as guides to products and services, and the\r\n\nAssociation itself, at least during the first four years of the\r\n\nundertaking, consistently referred to the displays and listings as\r\n\nads rather than as acknowledgements. That appraisal also is\r\n\n                               12\r\r\n\nsupported by well-reasoned precedent.\r\n\n          Fraternal Order of Police, Etc.\r                                                   v. \r                                                      Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span>\r\n\n<span class=\"page\">747</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), aff'd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497337\"><a href=\"/opinion/497337/fraternal-order-of-police-illinois-state-troopers-lodge-no-41/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1987) (FOP), which also\r\n\ninvolved the solicitation and sale of insertions in a publication\r\n\nsponsored by a tax-exempt policemen's organization, bears a strong\r\n\nresemblance to the case at bar. The Tax Court found that the\r\n\nactivity in question amounted to an unrelated business. 87 T.C. at\r\n\n757. The Seventh Circuit affirmed this finding. 833 F.2d at 721-\r\n\n22. The similarities are striking. There, as here, the\r\n\npublication included display ads (using logos, slogans, and\r\n\nblocking), a directory section, and a message asking readers to\r\n\npatronize the businesses listed therein.     See id. at 719-20.\r\n\nThere, as here, the size of an insertion was directly proportionate\r\n\nto the price charged.    See id. at 721. There, as here, the\r\n\nsponsoring organization, prior to the time the Commissioner came\r\n\ncalling, characterized the disputed activity as advertising.  See\r\n\nid.\r\n\n          Given these similarities, FOP is powerful authority for\r\n\nthe Commissioner's position that the activity here in question\r\n\ncomprises a separate, unrelated business. We consider         FOP\r\n\ncorrectly decided, and we find unconvincing the Association's\r\n\nattempts to distinguish it.  Consequently, we hold that the Tax\r\n\n     In striving to reach escape velocity from \r                                                         FOP's precedential\r\norbit, the Association relies heavily on its presentation of expert\r\ntestimony at trial. But this testimony was discounted by the Tax\r\nCourt because the expert was dismally uninformed. See Tax Ct. Op.\r\nat 589-90. That determination was well within the trier's purview.\r\nSee \r             Seagate Tech., Inc.\r                                 v. \r                                    Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186 (1994).\r\n\n                               13\r\r\n\nCourt did not commit clear error in finding that the Association's\r\n\nsolicitation, sale, and publication of displays and listings in \r                                                                        The\r\n\nConstabulary constituted the business of advertising.\r\n\n          The Association's fallback position is its claim that the\r\n\nCommissioner erred in treating the outside firms (Brent-Wyatt East\r\n\nand McKnight, respectively) as agents of the Association (and,\r\n\nthus, in attributing these firms' activities to the Association).\r\n\nTo bolster this claim, the Association stresses that the contract\r\n\ndocuments required these firms to operate as independent\r\n\ncontractors. It follows, the Association says, that even if the\r\n\ncited activities constituted the business of advertising, the\r\n\nbusiness belonged to the outside firms.\r\n\n          We are not persuaded. In the first place, an independent\r\n\ncontractor can be an agent if, and to the extent that, the\r\n\ncontractor acts for the benefit of another and under its control in\r\n\na particular transaction. See Restatement (Second) of Agency SS 2,\r\n\n14N (1957). In the second place, the label which contracting\r\n\nparties place on their relationship is not decisive of their status\r\n\nvis-a-vis third parties.

Either way, answering the question\r\n\nthat the Association raises requires that we examine the substance\r\n\nof the contracting parties' relationship.\r\n\n          In this analysis, no single factor is dispositive.

Rather, the nature of\r\n\nthe relationship between the Association and the outside firms\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\ndepends on a myriad of factors, including control over the manner\r\n\nand means of performing the work, the skill required, the method of\r\n\npayment, the duration of the relationship, and similar factors.\r\n\nSee, \r              e.g., \r                    Saenger Org., Inc.\r                                       v. \r                                         Nationwide Ins.

The relevant factors here, taken as a whole, solidly\r\n\nsupport the Tax Court's determination that the outside firms acted\r\n\nas the Association's agents.\r\n\n          First and foremost, the manner in which the Association\r\n\nconducted its affairs undercuts its claim that it lacked the\r\n\nrequisite degree of suasion over the outside firms' activities.\r\n\nThe Association retained very tight control over the method and\r\n\nmanner of solicitation, the ingredients of the sales pitch, the\r\n\nidentity of the solicitors, the financial aspects of the\r\n\narrangement, the use of its name, the advertising formats, and the\r\n\ncontents of the yearbook. We refer the reader who hungers for a\r\n\nblow-by-blow account to the details set out in the opinion below.\r\n\nSee Tax Ct. Op. at 584-85. Without belaboring the point, it is\r\n\nenough to say that the record reveals an ample factual predicate\r\n\nfor the finding that an agency relationship existed between the\r\n\nAssociation and the outside firms.\r\n\n                               C.\r\n\n          The Association's final contention is that, even if its\r\n\nactivities comprise a business attributable to it, that business\r\n\nwas not carried on regularly. To buttress this contention, the\r\n\n                               15\r\r\n\nAssociation makes two separate, but related, arguments.\r\n\n          Its first asseveration rests on the decisions in \r                                                                   National\r\n\nCollegiate Athletic Ass'n\r                                   v. \r                                      Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548479\"><a href=\"/opinion/548479/national-collegiate-athletic-association-v-commissioner-of-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir.\r\n\n1990) (NCAA), and Suffolk \r                                    County \r                                           Patrolmen's \r                                                       Benevolent \r                                                                  Ass'n v.\r\n\nCommissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">1314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981). These decisions are inapposite.\r\n\nIn each instance, the advertising activity was tied to the program\r\n\nfor a specific event.   See  NCAA, 914 F.2d at 1420 (collegiate\r\n\nbasketball tournament); \r                                 Suffolk County\r                                               , 77 T.C. at 1316 (vaudeville\r\n\nshow). Thus, resolution of those cases depended on Treas. Reg. S\r\n\n1.513-1(c)(2)(ii), which specifically provides that \"publication of\r\n\nadvertising in programs for sports events or music or drama\r\n\nperformances will not ordinarily be deemed to be the regular\r\n\ncarrying on of business.\" That regulation is of no assistance here\r\n\nbecause the Tax Court found specially that the Association's\r\n\npublication of \r                        The \r                            Constabulary was not linked to the occurrence of\r\n\na specific event, see Tax Ct. Op. at 593, and the Association has\r\n\nnot challenged that finding in this venue.\r\n\n          We hasten to add, moreover, that the mode of analysis\r\n\nused in NCAA and Suffolk County cannot be employed here. Because\r\n\nthose cases each involved a particular event, they looked to the\r\n\ntime frame of the event in determining the regularity with which\r\n\nthe business was carried on.    See  NCAA, 914 F.2d at 1422-23;\r\n\nSuffolk County\r                       , 77 T.C. at 1322-24. In a case like this one, where\r\n\n     It is interesting to note that Proposed Treas. Reg. S 1.513-4\r\ndraws a clear distinction between periodicals and material\r\npublished in connection with a specific sponsored event. We find\r\nthe distinction significant.\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nthe publication of an ad book is not pegged to a particular event,\r\n\na court must assay the activities which collectively comprise the\r\n\nbusiness, and look to the overall time frame in which they\r\n\noccurred. For present purposes, that means the time frame in which\r\n\nthe Association solicited, sold, and published advertising.   See\r\n\nTreas. Reg. S 1.513-1(b) (noting that the activities of soliciting,\r\n\nselling, and publishing advertising collectively constitute a\r\n\nbusiness). Those activities persisted for approximately 46 weeks\r\n\na year.   See Tax Ct. Op. at 593. This is more than sufficient\r\n\nregularity by any standard.\r\n\n          The Association next argues that it did not regularly\r\n\nengage in a business because it did not carry on the advertising\r\n\nactivity with the same entrepreneurial zeal that might typify a\r\n\ncommercial operator. But this is an ill-conceived comparison.\r\n\nAlthough the purpose behind the unrelated business income tax is to\r\n\ncreate a more level playing field between taxed and tax-exempt\r\n\nenterprises, competitive similarities are not the only factors to\r\n\nbe taken into account.     See  FOP, 833 F.2d at 722-23. The\r\n\napplicable regulation stipulates that the activity in question must\r\n\nbe judged \"in light of the purpose\" of the tax, but it does not\r\n\nrequire that either actual competition or competitive equality be\r\n\n     To be sure, the Association argues that the time frame is much\r\nshorter because, although solicitation and sales transpired 46\r\nweeks a year, publication occurred within a very narrow temporal\r\nwindow. This argument is disingenuous. Treas. Reg. S 1.513-1(b)\r\nrefers to the activities of soliciting, selling, and publishing\r\nadvertising as a singular business. That business must be\r\nregularly carried on, but there is no requirement that each task\r\nwithin the scope of the business must be carried on regularly.\r\n\n                               17\r\r\n\nshown. Treas. Reg. S 1.513-1(c)(1).\r\n\n          In this instance, the Association carried on its\r\n\nactivities in a systematic and well-organized fashion, with a\r\n\nclearly defined profit motive. Given the limitations of clear-\r\n\nerror review, we cannot disturb the lower court's finding that the\r\n\nAssociation's activities were sufficiently regular to bring them\r\n\nwithin the ambit of the regulation.  See Tax Ct. Op. at 593.\r\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further. While the Association makes\r\n\nseveral other arguments, none requires discussion; each of them is\r\n\neither adequately treated in the Tax Court's opinion, or obviously\r\n\nincorrect, or both. It suffices to say that the Commissioner's\r\n\ndetermination of the tax due and owing rests on a sturdy factual\r\n\nand legal foundation.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r\n\n                               18\r\n</pre>",
