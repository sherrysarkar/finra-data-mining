Defendant       Mario\n\nSaavedra’s five-day jury trial ended with a verdict of guilty on\n\nall three of the following counts:               (1) conspiring to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine\n\non board a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction in\n\nviolation of 46 U.S.C. § 1903; (2) conspiring to import cocaine\n\ninto the United States from a place outside thereof in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 963; and (3) attempting to import cocaine into\n\nthe    United   States,   also     in   violation       of   21    U.S.C.     §   963.\n\nSaavedra was sentenced on each count to 324 months in prison,\n\nthe    sentences   to    run    concurrently.          He    appeals,   asserting\n\nvarious errors by the district court.                 We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                        I.\n\n             The   drug        conspiracy      at      issue       involved        the\n\ntransportation of cocaine aboard the M/V DAYBREAK, a vessel\n\nregistered in the state of Florida.                   After many false starts\n\n(due    to   mechanical    troubles,         missed    contacts      and    customs\n\ndifficulties in different ports of call), the vessel finally\n\nstalled completely on July 26, 1994, off the coast of Puerto\n\nRico.    The crew (which did not include the defendant, who was\n\nnot on board) was rescued by the United States Coast Guard.                         The\n\nCoast Guard found over 297 kilos of cocaine on the M/V DAYBREAK\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fand arrested its crew of three.      These crew members eventually\n\ncooperated with the government, naming Maria Saavedra and a man\n\nnamed Christopher Munoz as the leaders in the drug smuggling\n\noperation.   An indictment issued against both Saavedra and Munoz\n\non November 15, 1995.1\n\n           Although not on board the DAYBREAK when the Coast Guard\n\nseized it, Saavedra did not dispute his participation in the\n\ndrug smuggling operation.    He admitted helping Munoz with the\n\nlogistics of the venture, primarily from his home in Santo\n\nDomingo in the Dominican Republic.      Saavedra’s duties included\n\nlooking after the vessel’s mechanical systems and serving as\n\nliaison between the crew and Munoz.       Saavedra acknowledged a\n\npast history with the United States Drug Enforcement Agency\n\n(“DEA”).   He had served time in federal prison in the late 1980s\n\nand early 1990s for drug smuggling (after which he was deported\n\nto his home in the Dominican Republic) and, prior to that, he\n\nhad served as a paid informant for the DEA aiding in surveilling\n\n\n\n\n    1  Saavedra and Munoz were tried separately, in part because\nSaavedra was not arraigned until 1997. This is because as of\nJanuary 11, 1996, Saavedra was incarcerated in the Netherlands\nawaiting trial on charges of cocaine importation, charges\ndifferent from those at issue here. In spring of 1997, he was\nextradited to the United States, arrested and arraigned before\nthe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\nfor the crimes described in the first paragraph of this opinion.\n\n                               -4-\n\fand curtailing drug smuggling operations into the United States\n\nthrough Central and South America.\n\n            Saavedra’s chief defense at trial was that based on\n\nassurances    from    Munoz,    he   thought     that    he   and    Munoz   were\n\nparticipating in the drug venture in order once again to aid the\n\nDEA -- in particular a DEA agent named Kazerowsky -- in the\n\ninvestigation    of   drug     smuggling      operations      into   the   United\n\nStates.     Saavedra testified that Munoz had spoken with Agent\n\nKazerowsky and that Munoz had instructed Saavedra that when the\n\nM/V DAYBREAK arrived in Puerto Rico, he was to inform Agent\n\nKazerowsky that the vessel was carrying about 270 kilos of\n\ncocaine in cargo.        Allegedly, Agent Kazerowsky would “take it\n\nfrom there.”\n\n            By convicting Saavedra, the jury indicated that it was\n\nunimpressed with his defense that he thought he was working\n\nundercover for the DEA.        Substantial evidence at trial provided\n\nan ample basis for the jury’s non-acceptance of Saavedra’s\n\ncontention along these lines.           Agent Kazerowsky testified that\n\nhe had not been involved with Saavedra and Munoz in the instant\n\nsmuggling    venture.2       Another    DEA    agent    testified     that   when\n\n\n    2  It was nevertheless undisputed that prior                to Saavedra’s\nincarceration for drug smuggling in the late                     1980s, Agent\nKazerowsky had worked with and paid Saavedra                    and Munoz as\ninformants in other drug smuggling operations.                    After being\nreleased from prison in 1991 and deported to                    the Dominican\n\n                                       -5-\n\fSaavedra   was        first    detained      in        Puerto    Rico    after    his\n\nextradition, he said nothing about a DEA investigation and\n\nclaimed only to be helping Munoz fix the boat.                      Also, Saavedra\n\nadmitted at trial that “this time” he was not being paid by the\n\nDEA for his purported informant role.                   He further admitted that\n\nthe Munoz team of which he was a member was to retain the\n\nproceeds from the sale of 15-20 kilos of the cocaine -- the\n\ndifference between the amount allegedly to be disgorged to the\n\nDEA and the total amount actually on board the M/V DAYBREAK.\n\n           Given the jury’s adverse resolution of this factual\n\nissue, Saavedra’s claim to have been aiding the DEA cannot serve\n\nas an effective ground for challenging his conviction on appeal.\n\nAccordingly, Saavedra now argues that the government failed to\n\nprove a supposedly essential element of the first count of the\n\nindictment, namely, that Saavedra knew the M/V DAYBREAK to be a\n\n“vessel of the United States” or otherwise “subject to the\n\njurisdiction     of    the    United   States.”           46    U.S.C.   §   1903(a).\n\nSaavedra also argues that the court’s jury instructions were, in\n\ncontext,   prejudicially        confusing         as    between    the   crimes   of\n\nconspiring to import and attempting to import cocaine (Counts II\n\nand III) and the crime of conspiring to possess with intent to\n\n\n\nRepublic, as far as Kazerowsky knew, Saavedra had no further\ncontact with the DEA.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdistribute cocaine on board a vessel subject to United States\n\njurisdiction (Count I).\n\n\n\n                                     II.\n\n         Section 1903 of Title 46 of the United States Code, the\n\nsubstantive    criminal        statute     allegedly        violated     by     the\n\nconspiracy    charged     in   the   first   count      of    the    indictment,\n\nprovides that “[i]t is unlawful for any person on board a vessel\n\nof the United States, or on board a vessel subject to the\n\njurisdiction   of   the    United    States,    .   .   .    to     knowingly   or\n\nintentionally manufacture or distribute, or to possess with\n\nintent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.”\n\n46 U.S.C. § 1903(a).3          While conceding that the government’s\n\nproof was “overwhelming” that the M/V DAYBREAK was a “vessel of\n\nthe United States,”4 Saavedra contends that the government erred\n\n\n    3    Defendant was convicted under this statute pursuant to\nits subsection (j), which states that “[a]ny person who attempts\nor conspires to commit any offense defined in this chapter shall\nbe subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the\noffense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt\nor conspiracy.” 46 U.S.C. § 1903(j).\n    4  Among the bases for qualification as a “vessel of the\nUnited States” is documentation under chapter 121 of Title 46 or\nnumbering as provided in chapter 123 of Title 46. See U.S.C. §\n1903(b)(1). Chapter 123 of Title 46 provides for the numbering\nof vessels by states with identification systems approved by\nthe United States Secretary of Transportation. See 46 U.S.C. §\n12301-12309.    It is undisputed that the M/V DAYBREAK was\nregistered at relevant times in Florida, a state whose numbering\n\n                                     -7-\n\fin failing to prove, as an additional element of the conspiracy,\n\nthat he actually knew that the vessel was “of the United States”\n\nor otherwise subject to United States jurisdiction.    Because no\n\nevidence was put before the jury of Saavedra’s knowledge, he\n\ncontends that the district court committed reversible error in\n\nnot granting his motion for acquittal based on an insufficiency\n\nof the evidence to convict him of participating in a conspiracy\n\nto violate 46 U.S.C. § 1903.\n\n         In support of his contention that a conspirator’s\n\nknowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel must be\n\nalleged and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Saavedra points to\n\nthe fact that in 1996, after his arrest, the substantive statute\n\nwas amended to include the following statement:    “Jurisdiction\n\nof the United States with respect to vessels subject to this\n\nchapter is not an element of any offense.    All jurisdictional\n\nissues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of\n\nlaw to be determined solely by the trial judge.”      46 U.S.C. §\n\n1903(f)(1996).   Defendant argues that this statutory amendment\n\nshows that prior to 1996, the jurisdictional requirement was an\n\nelement of the criminal offense the government had to prove to\n\nthe jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nsystem is approved by the United States Secretary of\nTransportation. See 46 U.S.C. §§ 12101(b)(1), 12302; 33 C.F.R.\n173, App. A.\n\n                               -8-\n\f          But assuming this is so – that before 1996 it was for\n\nthe jury to pass upon the jurisdiction of the United States with\n\nrespect to the vessel and that this was an element of the crime\n\n–   the statute neither then nor now expressly made defendant’s\n\nknowledge that a vessel belonged to or was otherwise subject to\n\nthe jurisdiction of the United States either an element of the\n\ncrime or a jurisdictional prerequisite to conviction.       Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Guerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 339 & n.9 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (stating that the first element of 46 U.S.C. § 1903(a), as\n\nit stood in 1995, “requires the government to prove that the\n\n[vessel] was ’a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates’”); United States v. Passos-Paternina, 918 F.2d 979, 981\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (stating only that the jury determines the\n\njurisdictional question under § 1903).5\n\n\n     5  It is not uncommon for federal criminal statutes to\ncontain jurisdictional prerequisites which do not require\ndefendant’s knowledge of their fulfillment in order to secure a\nconviction. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (unlawful possession\nof a firearm, which requires proof that the firearm has been\ntransported through interstate commerce). This court held in\nUnited States v. Corey, 207 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2000), that\nthe \"interstate nexus\" element required to convict under\n922(g)(1) was met when the government demonstrated that\ndefendant possessed the shotgun in a state other than the one in\nwhich it was manufactured, not that defendant had to know that\nthe shotgun had in fact traveled in interstate commerce. See\nalso Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563, 575 (1977)\n(concluding that section 922(g) requires only \"the minimal nexus\nthat the firearm have been, at some time, in interstate\ncommerce\"). The federal bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2113\nhas a similar jurisdictional aspect, requiring the bank’s\n\n                              -9-\n\f             Not only is there no mention in § 1903 that a defendant\n\nmust know of the vessel’s nationality, but the wording of the\n\nstatute suggests Congress’s deliberate omission of any such\n\nrequirement.       The plain language of the statute proscribes being\n\n“on board a vessel of the United States or . . . subject to the\n\njurisdiction of the United States[] . . . [and] . . . knowingly\n\nor     intentionally        manufactur[ing]        or   distribut[ing]         or\n\npossess[ing] with intent to . . . distribute . . . a controlled\n\nsubstance.”        46 U.S.C. § 1903(a)(1996)(emphasis added).                 The\n\nplacement     of    the     word    “knowingly”      before    the    acts     of\n\nmanufacturing, distributing and possessing and not before the\n\nphrase “on board a vessel of the United States or . . . subject\n\nto    the   jurisdiction     of    the    United   States”    indicates      that\n\nknowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel is not\n\nan additional element of the crime.                See, e.g., Lopez-Soto v.\n\nHawayek, 175 F.3d 170, 172 (1st Cir. 1999) (“We start our search\n\nfor   the   meaning    of   the    words    that   Congress   wrote   with     an\n\nappraisal of the statutory text and structure, mindful that if\n\n\n\n\ndeposits be FDIC-insured.     See 18 U.S.C. § 2113(f)(defining\n“bank” as used in the statute as “any institution the deposits\nof which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation”); United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 299\n(1st Cir. 2000)(stating that conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2113\nrequires “the government to prove that the money taken during\nthe robbery was insured by the FDIC,” and not that the defendant\nknew it was so insured).\n\n                                         -10-\n\fthe plain language of the statute points unerringly in a single\n\ndirection,     an     inquiring     court     ordinarily    should   look    no\n\nfurther.”) (citation omitted).                Had Congress wanted to make\n\ndefendant’s knowledge of United States jurisdiction over the\n\nvessel an element of the crime, it could readily have inserted\n\n“knowingly” before “on board” as it did before “manufacture or\n\ndistribute, or to possess.”            “Courts in applying criminal laws\n\ngenerally must follow the plain and unambiguous meaning of the\n\nstatutory language.”         United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675,\n\n680 (1985).     “’[O]nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary\n\nintentions’ in the legislative history will justify a departure\n\nfrom that language.” Id. (quoting Garcia v. United States, 469\n\nU.S. 70, 75 (1984)).         No such showing has been made here.\n\n            We add that to require a knowing drug smuggler to also\n\nknow whether his vessel is under United States jurisdiction\n\nwould   make        the   statute   virtually      unenforceable     in     some\n\ninstances.     A vessel may be “of the United States,” or otherwise\n\nbe subject to United States jurisdiction, for a variety of\n\nreasons, federal or qualifying state documentation being only\n\ntwo.    For example, under 46 U.S.C. § 1903(c)(1)(E), a foreign\n\nnation’s consent to United States jurisdiction over a vessel in\n\nthe former’s territorial waters may be “obtained by radio,\n\ntelephone      or     similar   oral     or    electronic    means   and      is\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconclusively proved by certification of the Secretary of State\n\nor the Secretary’s designee.”         46 U.S.C. § 1903(c)(1).     A crew\n\nperson aboard the drug smuggling vessel might well not know\n\nwhether    the   nation-state    in    whose   waters   the   vessel   was\n\noperating had consented to the enforcement of United States law\n\nby the United States.         See also 46 U.S.C. § 1903(b)(2)(D)\n\n(defining “vessel of the United States” as a “vessel owned in\n\nwhole or in part by . . . a corporation created under the laws\n\nof the United States or any State . . . ”); 46 U.S.C. §\n\n1903(c)(1)(C) (defining “vessel subject to the jurisdiction of\n\nthe United States” as “a vessel registered in a foreign nation\n\nwhere the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the\n\nenforcement of United States law by the United States”).                 A\n\ndefendant’s knowledge of one or another of the foregoing factors\n\nwould, in many cases, be difficult if not impossible to prove.\n\n\n\n           We conclude that defendant’s interpretation requiring\n\na conspirator to have known that the M/V DAYBREAK was a “vessel\n\nof   the   United   States”     or    was   otherwise   subject   to   the\n\njurisdiction of the United States is incorrect, being both\n\nimplausible and contrary to the plain language of 46 U.S.C. §\n\n1903, which calls for no such knowledge.         All the government had\n\nto prove jurisdictionally was that the United States did in fact\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fhave jurisdiction over the vessel at issue.               This the government\n\naccomplished without any dispute, because, as noted earlier, see\n\nsupra note 4, the evidence at trial was uncontradicted that the\n\nM/V DAYBREAK was registered in Florida, and was therefore a\n\n“vessel of the United States” as defined by 46 U.S.C. § 1903(b),\n\nhence within United States jurisdiction. Defendant’s conviction\n\nunder Count I is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                    III.\n\n          Defendant’s      last    two    claims    of    error    are    equally\n\nlacking in merit.        Both concern the accuracy of the district\n\ncourt’s jury instructions and neither was preserved below.                      We\n\ntherefore review for plain error.          See United States v. Savinon-\n\nAcosta, 232 F.3d 265, 268 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             Defendant     complains       that     the    district       court’s\n\ninstructions to the jury were plainly erroneous in two ways.\n\nFirst, he contends that it was error not to instruct the jury\n\nthat in order to convict it must find beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat   Saavedra   knew   that     the    vessel    on    board    which   he   was\n\nconspiring to distribute cocaine was a vessel over which the\n\nUnited States had jurisdiction.            For reasons we have discussed\n\nabove, there is no such requirement; defendant’s contention on\n\nthis score is simply incorrect.          Second, defendant contends that\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthe jury instructions on the crimes of importation (conspiring\n\nto import and to attempt to import cocaine, Counts II and III\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 963) and the crime of conspiring to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine on board a vessel subject to\n\nUnited States jurisdiction (Count I under 46 U.S.C. § 1903) were\n\nprejudicially confusing.         On this theory, Saavedra contends that\n\n(1) had the jurors believed that he was working for the DEA, and\n\n(2)   had    they   not   been   misled       by   the    instructions     that   he\n\ncontends insufficiently distinguished between the two crimes, he\n\nwould   have    been      acquitted      of    possession       with   intent     to\n\ndistribute all of the 297 kilos aboard the M/V DAYBREAK, leaving\n\nhim responsible only for the importation of 15-20 kilos that he\n\nand his team planned to import and sell as compensation for\n\ntheir roles in the venture.             This would have resulted in a much\n\nreduced sentence from the 324 months that he received for the\n\n297 kilos of cocaine on all three counts.\n\n             The government admits that elements of Count I and\n\nCount   II    overlap     (as    they    are       both   conspiracy     charges).\n\nNevertheless,       the   government       argues,        the   district   court’s\n\ninstructions on each of these charges were correct.                    Indeed, the\n\ndefendant does not contest the accuracy of the instructions,\n\nonly that in the peculiar circumstances of this case the overlap\n\nof elements and instructions thereon prejudiced his defense to\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fCount I (that he had authority to possess 270 kilos aboard the\n\nvessel as he was aiding the DEA in their investigations).                In\n\nother   words,     defendant     claims    that     despite      accurate\n\ninstructions, by not treating the two conspiracies separately in\n\nthe instructions to the jury, that is, serially, the district\n\ncourt   confused   the    jury   and   allowed    them    to   convict   on\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute for Count I once\n\nthey found a conspiracy to import for Count II.\n\n          The short answer to Saavedra’s argument is that the\n\ncourt did not commit plain error simply because, in hindsight,\n\ninstructions can be conceived that would have better served the\n\ndefense’s strategy.      The defense did not request instructions of\n\nthe type it now says should have been given.             The instructions\n\nactually given here were adequate and correct.            Defendant falls\n\nfar short of pointing to the commission of plain error.              See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480, 484 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(stating that failing defendant’s contemporaneous objection at\n\ntrial to the district court’s jury instructions, an appellate\n\ncourt reviews for plain error, a type of review that “entails\n\ninquiry into whether affirmance would skew[ ] the fundamental\n\nfairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in some\n\nmajor respect so as to result in a miscarriage of justice”)\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f(alterations in the original) (quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Moreover, the failure of the jury to acquit Saavedra\n\nof the crime charged in Count I can be attributed to the\n\nsubstantial proof contradicting Saavedra’s claim of cooperation\n\nwith the DEA.     As no inaccuracy in the jury charge has been\n\npointed   to,   nor   was   the   evidence   lacking   in   proof   beyond\n\nreasonable doubt of the government’s case, there is no reason to\n\nupset the judgment below.

Saavedra was sentenced on each count to 324 months in prison, the sentences to run concurrently. He appeals, asserting various errors by the district court. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug conspiracy at issue involved the transportation of cocaine aboard the M/V DAYBREAK, a vessel registered in the state of Florida. After many false starts (due to mechanical troubles, missed contacts and customs difficulties in different ports of call), the vessel finally stalled completely on July 26, 1994, off the coast of Puerto Rico. The crew (which did not include the defendant, who was not on board) was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard found over 297 kilos of cocaine on the M/V DAYBREAK and arrested its crew of three. These crew members eventually cooperated with the government, naming Maria Saavedra and a man named Christopher Munoz as the leaders in the drug smuggling operation. An indictment issued against both Saavedra and Munoz on November 15, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not on board the DAYBREAK when the Coast Guard seized it, Saavedra did not dispute his participation in the drug smuggling operation. He admitted helping Munoz with the logistics of the venture, primarily from his home in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. Saavedra's duties included looking after the vessel's mechanical systems and serving as liaison between the crew and Munoz. Saavedra acknowledged a past history with the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"). He had served time in federal prison in the late 1980s and early 1990s for drug smuggling (after which he was deported to his home in the Dominican Republic) and, prior to that, he had served as a paid informant for the DEA aiding in surveilling and curtailing drug smuggling operations into the United States through Central and South America.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saavedra's chief defense at trial was that based on assurances from Munoz, he thought that he and Munoz were participating in the drug venture in order once again to aid the DEA -- in particular a DEA agent named Kazerowsky in the investigation of drug smuggling operations into the United States. Saavedra testified that Munoz had spoken with Agent Kazerowsky and that Munoz had instructed Saavedra that when the M/V DAYBREAK arrived in Puerto Rico, he was to inform Agent Kazerowsky that the vessel was carrying about 270 kilos of cocaine in cargo. Allegedly, Agent Kazerowsky would \"take it from there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By convicting Saavedra, the jury indicated that it was unimpressed with his defense that he thought he was working undercover for the DEA. Substantial evidence at trial provided an ample basis for the jury's non-acceptance of Saavedra's contention along these lines. Agent Kazerowsky testified that he had not been involved with Saavedra and Munoz in the instant smuggling venture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Another DEA agent testified that when Saavedra was first detained in Puerto Rico after his extradition, he said nothing about a DEA investigation and claimed only to be helping Munoz fix the boat. Also, Saavedra admitted at trial that \"this time\" he was not being paid by the DEA for his purported informant role. He further admitted that the Munoz team of which he was a member was to retain the proceeds from the sale of 15-20 kilos of the cocaine -- the difference between the amount allegedly to be disgorged to the DEA and the total amount actually on board the M/V DAYBREAK.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the jury's adverse resolution of this factual issue, Saavedra's claim to have been aiding the DEA cannot serve as an effective ground for challenging his conviction on appeal. Accordingly, Saavedra now argues that the government failed to prove a supposedly essential element of the first count of the indictment, namely, that Saavedra knew the M/V DAYBREAK to be a \"vessel of the United States\" or otherwise \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a). Saavedra also argues that the court's jury instructions were, in context, prejudicially confusing as between the crimes of conspiring to import and attempting to import cocaine (Counts II and III) and the crime of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine on board a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction (Count I).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1903 of Title 46 of the United States Code, the substantive criminal statute allegedly violated by the conspiracy charged in the first count of the indictment, provides that \"[i]t is unlawful for any person on board a vessel of the United States, or on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, . . . to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While conceding that the government's proof was \"overwhelming\" that the M/V DAYBREAK was a \"vessel of the United States,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Saavedra contends that the government erred in failing to prove, as an additional element of the conspiracy, that he actually knew that the vessel was \"of the United States\" or otherwise subject to United States jurisdiction. Because no evidence was put before the jury of Saavedra's knowledge, he contends that the district court committed reversible error in not granting his motion for acquittal based on an insufficiency of the evidence to convict him of participating in a conspiracy to violate 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his contention that a conspirator's knowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel must be alleged and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Saavedra points to the fact that in 1996, after his arrest, the substantive statute was amended to include the following statement: \"Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(f)(1996). Defendant argues that this statutory amendment shows that prior to 1996, the jurisdictional requirement was an elementof the criminal offense the government had to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But assuming this is so - that before 1996 it was for the jury to pass upon the jurisdiction of the United States with respect to the vessel and that this was an element of the crime - the statute neither then nor now expressly made defendant's knowledge that a vessel belonged to or was otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States either an element of the crime or a jurisdictional prerequisite to conviction. Cf. United States v. Guerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 339 &amp; n.9 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that the first element of 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a), as it stood in 1995, \"requires the government to prove that the [vessel] was 'a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'\"); United States v. Passos-Paternina, 918 F.2d 979, 981 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating only that the jury determines the jurisdictional question under &#167; 1903).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only is there no mention in &#167; 1903 that a defendant must know of the vessel's nationality, but the wording of the statute suggests Congress's deliberate omission of any such requirement. The plain language of the statute proscribes being \"on board a vessel of the United States or . . . subject to the jurisdiction of the United States[] . . . [and] . . . knowingly or intentionally manufactur[ing] or distribut[ing] or possess[ing] with intent to . . . distribute . . . a controlled substance.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a)(1996)(emphasis added). The placement of the word \"knowingly\" before the acts of manufacturing, distributing and possessing and not before the phrase \"on board a vessel of the United States or . . . subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" indicates that knowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel is not an additional element of the crime. See, e.g., Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek, 175 F.3d 170, 172 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"We start our search for the meaning of the words that Congress wrote with an appraisal of the statutory text and structure, mindful that if the plain language of the statute points unerringly in a single direction, an inquiring court ordinarily should look no further.\") (citation omitted). Had Congress wanted to make defendant's knowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel an element of the crime, it could readily have inserted \"knowingly\" before \"on board\" as it did before \"manufacture or distribute, or to possess.\" \"Courts in applying criminal laws generally must follow the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statutory language.\" United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985). \"'[O]nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions' in the legislative history will justify a departure from that language.\" Id. (quoting Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70, 75 (1984)). No such showing has been made here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that to require a knowing drug smuggler to also know whether his vessel is under United States jurisdiction would make the statute virtually unenforceable in some instances. A vessel may be \"of the United States,\" or otherwise be subject to United States jurisdiction, for a variety of reasons, federal or qualifying state documentation being only two. For example, under 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(E), a foreign nation's consent to United States jurisdiction over a vessel in the former's territorial waters may be \"obtained by radio, telephone or similar oral or electronic means and is conclusively proved by certification of the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(c)(1). A crew person aboard the drug smuggling vessel might well not know whether the nation-state in whose waters the vessel was operating had consented to the enforcement of United States law by the United States. See also 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(b)(2)(D) (defining \"vessel of the United States\" as a \"vessel owned in whole or in part by . . . a corporation created under the laws of the United States or any State . . . \"); 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(C) (defining \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" as \"a vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States\"). A defendant's knowledge of one or another of the foregoing factors would, in many cases, be difficult if not impossible to prove.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that defendant's interpretation requiring a conspirator to have known that the M/V DAYBREAK was a \"vessel of the United States\" or was otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is incorrect, being both implausible and contrary to the plain language of 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903, which calls for no such knowledge. All the government had to prove jurisdictionally was that the United States did in fact have jurisdiction over the vessel at issue. This the government accomplished without any dispute, because, as noted earlier, see supra note 4, the evidence at trial was uncontradicted that the M/V DAYBREAK was registered in Florida, and was therefore a \"vessel of the United States\" as defined by 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(b), hence within United States jurisdiction. Defendant's conviction under Count I is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's last two claims of error are equally lacking in merit. Both concern the accuracy of the district court's jury instructions and neither was preserved below. We therefore review for plain error. See United States v. Savinon-Acosta, 232 F.3d 265, 268 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant complains that the district court's instructions to the jury were plainly erroneous in two ways. First, he contends that it was error not to instruct the jury that in order to convict it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Saavedra knew that the vessel on board which he was conspiring to distribute cocaine was a vessel over which the United States had jurisdiction. For reasons we have discussed above, there is no such requirement; defendant's contention on this score is simply incorrect. Second, defendant contends that the jury instructions on the crimes of importation (conspiring to import and to attempt to import cocaine, Counts II and III under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963) and the crime of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine on board a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction (Count I under 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903) were prejudicially confusing. On this theory, Saavedra contends that (1) had the jurors believed that he was working for the DEA, and (2) had they not been misled by the instructions that he contends insufficiently distinguished between the two crimes, he would have been acquitted of possession with intent to distribute all of the 297 kilos aboard the M/V DAYBREAK, leaving him responsible only for the importation of 15-20 kilos that he and his team planned to import and sell as compensation for their roles in the venture. This would have resulted in a much reduced sentence from the 324 months that he received for the 297 kilos of cocaine on all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government admits that elements of Count I and Count II overlap (as they are both conspiracy charges). Nevertheless, the government argues, the district court's instructions on each of these charges were correct. Indeed, the defendant does not contest the accuracy of the instructions, only that in the peculiar circumstances of this case the overlap of elements and instructions thereon prejudiced his defense to Count I (that he had authority to possess 270 kilos aboard the vessel as he was aiding the DEA in their investigations). In other words, defendant claims that despite accurate instructions, by not treating the two conspiracies separately in the instructions to the jury, that is, serially, the district court confused the jury and allowed them to convict on conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute for Count I once they found a conspiracy to import for Count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to Saavedra's argument is that the court did not commit plain error simply because, in hindsight, instructions can be conceived that would have better served the defense's strategy. The defense did not request instructions of the type it now says should have been given. The instructions actually given here were adequate and correct. Defendant falls far short of pointing to the commission of plain error. See, e.g., United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480, 484 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating that failing defendant's contemporaneous objection at trial to the district court's jury instructions, an appellate court reviews for plain error, a type of review that \"entails inquiry into whether affirmance would skew[ ] the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in some major respect so as to result in a miscarriage of justice\") (alterations in the original) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the failure of the jury to acquit Saavedra of the crime charged in Count I can be attributed to the substantial proof contradicting Saavedra's claim of cooperation with the DEA. As no inaccuracy in the jury charge has been pointed to, nor was the evidence lacking in proof beyond reasonable doubt of the government's case, there is no reason to upset the judgment below. See United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating that a Court of Appeals looks \"at the entire charge, in light of the evidence, and determine[s] whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions fairly and adequately submit[ted] the issues in the case to the jury\") (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Saavedra and Munoz were tried separately, in part because Saavedra was not arraigned until 1997.

See 46 U.S.C. &#167; 12301-12309. It is undisputed that the M/V DAYBREAK was registered at relevant times in Florida, a state whose numbering system is approved by the United States Secretary of Transportation.

See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) (unlawful possession of a firearm, which requires proof that the firearm has been transported through interstate commerce). This court held in United States v. Corey, 207 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2000), that the \"interstate nexus\" element required to convict under 922(g)(1) was met when the government demonstrated that defendant possessed the shotgun in a state other than the one in which it was manufactured, not that defendant had to know that the shotgun had in fact traveled in interstate commerce. See also Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563, 575 (1977) (concluding that section 922(g) requires only \"the minimal nexus that the firearm have been, at some time, in interstate commerce\"). The federal bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113 has a similar jurisdictional aspect, requiring the bank's deposits be FDIC-insured. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(f)(defining \"bank\" as used in the statute as \"any institution the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\"); United States v.

Saavedra was sentenced on each count to 324 months in prison, the sentences to run concurrently. He appeals, asserting various errors by the district court. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug conspiracy at issue involved the transportation of cocaine aboard the M/V DAYBREAK, a vessel registered in the state of Florida. After many false starts (due to mechanical troubles, missed contacts and customs difficulties in different ports of call), the vessel finally stalled completely on July 26, 1994, off the coast of Puerto Rico. The crew (which did not include the defendant, who was not on board) was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard found over 297 kilos of cocaine on the M/V DAYBREAK and arrested its crew of three. These crew members eventually cooperated with the government, naming Maria Saavedra and a man named Christopher Munoz as the leaders in the drug smuggling operation. An indictment issued against both Saavedra and Munoz on November 15, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not on board the DAYBREAK when the Coast Guard seized it, Saavedra did not dispute his participation in the drug smuggling operation. He admitted helping Munoz with the logistics of the venture, primarily from his home in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. Saavedra's duties included looking after the vessel's mechanical systems and serving as liaison between the crew and Munoz. Saavedra acknowledged a past history with the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"). He had served time in federal prison in the late 1980s and early 1990s for drug smuggling (after which he was deported to his home in the Dominican Republic) and, prior to that, he had served as a paid informant for the DEA aiding in surveilling and curtailing drug smuggling operations into the United States through Central and South America.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saavedra's chief defense at trial was that based on assurances from Munoz, he thought that he and Munoz were participating in the drug venture in order once again to aid the DEA -- in particular a DEA agent named Kazerowsky in the investigation of drug smuggling operations into the United States. Saavedra testified that Munoz had spoken with Agent Kazerowsky and that Munoz had instructed Saavedra that when the M/V DAYBREAK arrived in Puerto Rico, he was to inform Agent Kazerowsky that the vessel was carrying about 270 kilos of cocaine in cargo. Allegedly, Agent Kazerowsky would \"take it from there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By convicting Saavedra, the jury indicated that it was unimpressed with his defense that he thought he was working undercover for the DEA. Substantial evidence at trial provided an ample basis for the jury's non-acceptance of Saavedra's contention along these lines. Agent Kazerowsky testified that he had not been involved with Saavedra and Munoz in the instant smuggling venture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Another DEA agent testified that when Saavedra was first detained in Puerto Rico after his extradition, he said nothing about a DEA investigation and claimed only to be helping Munoz fix the boat. Also, Saavedra admitted at trial that \"this time\" he was not being paid by the DEA for his purported informant role. He further admitted that the Munoz team of which he was a member was to retain the proceeds from the sale of 15-20 kilos of the cocaine -- the difference between the amount allegedly to be disgorged to the DEA and the total amount actually on board the M/V DAYBREAK.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the jury's adverse resolution of this factual issue, Saavedra's claim to have been aiding the DEA cannot serve as an effective ground for challenging his conviction on appeal. Accordingly, Saavedra now argues that the government failed to prove a supposedly essential element of the first count of the indictment, namely, that Saavedra knew the M/V DAYBREAK to be a \"vessel of the United States\" or otherwise \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a). Saavedra also argues that the court's jury instructions were, in context, prejudicially confusing as between the crimes of conspiring to import and attempting to import cocaine (Counts II and III) and the crime of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine on board a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction (Count I).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1903 of Title 46 of the United States Code, the substantive criminal statute allegedly violated by the conspiracy charged in the first count of the indictment, provides that \"[i]t is unlawful for any person on board a vessel of the United States, or on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, . . . to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While conceding that the government's proof was \"overwhelming\" that the M/V DAYBREAK was a \"vessel of the United States,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Saavedra contends that the government erred in failing to prove, as an additional element of the conspiracy, that he actually knew that the vessel was \"of the United States\" or otherwise subject to United States jurisdiction. Because no evidence was put before the jury of Saavedra's knowledge, he contends that the district court committed reversible error in not granting his motion for acquittal based on an insufficiency of the evidence to convict him of participating in a conspiracy to violate 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his contention that a conspirator's knowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel must be alleged and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Saavedra points to the fact that in 1996, after his arrest, the substantive statute was amended to include the following statement: \"Jurisdiction of the United States with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense. All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(f)(1996). Defendant argues that this statutory amendment shows that prior to 1996, the jurisdictional requirement was an elementof the criminal offense the government had to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But assuming this is so - that before 1996 it was for the jury to pass upon the jurisdiction of the United States with respect to the vessel and that this was an element of the crime - the statute neither then nor now expressly made defendant's knowledge that a vessel belonged to or was otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States either an element of the crime or a jurisdictional prerequisite to conviction. Cf. United States v. Guerrero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197385\"><a href=\"/opinion/197385/united-states-v-amado-guerrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 339 &amp; n.9 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that the first element of 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a), as it stood in 1995, \"requires the government to prove that the [vessel] was 'a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'\"); United States v. Passos-Paternina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551470\"><a href=\"/opinion/551470/united-states-v-emiro-miguel-passos-paternina-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 981 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating only that the jury determines the jurisdictional question under &#167; 1903).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only is there no mention in &#167; 1903 that a defendant must know of the vessel's nationality, but the wording of the statute suggests Congress's deliberate omission of any such requirement. The plain language of the statute proscribes being \"on board a vessel of the United States or . . . subject to the jurisdiction of the United States[] . . . [and] . . . knowingly or intentionally manufactur[ing] or distribut[ing] or possess[ing] with intent to . . . distribute . . . a controlled substance.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(a)(1996)(emphasis added). The placement of the word \"knowingly\" before the acts of manufacturing, distributing and possessing and not before the phrase \"on board a vessel of the United States or . . . subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" indicates that knowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel is not an additional element of the crime. See, e.g., Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198421\"><a href=\"/opinion/198421/lopez-soto-v-hawayek/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 172 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"We start our search for the meaning of the words that Congress wrote with an appraisal of the statutory text and structure, mindful that if the plain language of the statute points unerringly in a single direction, an inquiring court ordinarily should look no further.\") (citation omitted). Had Congress wanted to make defendant's knowledge of United States jurisdiction over the vessel an element of the crime, it could readily have inserted \"knowingly\" before \"on board\" as it did before \"manufacture or distribute, or to possess.\" \"Courts in applying criminal laws generally must follow the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statutory language.\" United States v. Albertini, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111487\"><a href=\"/opinion/111487/united-states-v-albertini/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 680 (1985). \"'[O]nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions' in the legislative history will justify a departure from that language.\" Id. (quoting Garcia v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span>, 75 (1984)). No such showing has been made here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that to require a knowing drug smuggler to also know whether his vessel is under United States jurisdiction would make the statute virtually unenforceable in some instances. A vessel may be \"of the United States,\" or otherwise be subject to United States jurisdiction, for a variety of reasons, federal or qualifying state documentation being only two. For example, under 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(E), a foreign nation's consent to United States jurisdiction over a vessel in the former's territorial waters may be \"obtained by radio, telephone or similar oral or electronic means and is conclusively proved by certification of the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee.\" 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(c)(1). A crew person aboard the drug smuggling vessel might well not know whether the nation-state in whose waters the vessel was operating had consented to the enforcement of United States law by the United States. See also 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(b)(2)(D) (defining \"vessel of the United States\" as a \"vessel owned in whole or in part by . . . a corporation created under the laws of the United States or any State . . . \"); 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(C) (defining \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" as \"a vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States\"). A defendant's knowledge of one or another of the foregoing factors would, in many cases, be difficult if not impossible to prove.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that defendant's interpretation requiring a conspirator to have known that the M/V DAYBREAK was a \"vessel of the United States\" or was otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is incorrect, being both implausible and contrary to the plain language of 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903, which calls for no such knowledge. All the government had to prove jurisdictionally was that the United States did in fact have jurisdiction over the vessel at issue. This the government accomplished without any dispute, because, as noted earlier, see supra note 4, the evidence at trial was uncontradicted that the M/V DAYBREAK was registered in Florida, and was therefore a \"vessel of the United States\" as defined by 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903(b), hence within United States jurisdiction. Defendant's conviction under Count I is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's last two claims of error are equally lacking in merit. Both concern the accuracy of the district court's jury instructions and neither was preserved below. We therefore review for plain error. See United States v. Savinon-Acosta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199154\"><a href=\"/opinion/199154/united-states-v-savinon-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 268 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant complains that the district court's instructions to the jury were plainly erroneous in two ways. First, he contends that it was error not to instruct the jury that in order to convict it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Saavedra knew that the vessel on board which he was conspiring to distribute cocaine was a vessel over which the United States had jurisdiction. For reasons we have discussed above, there is no such requirement; defendant's contention on this score is simply incorrect. Second, defendant contends that the jury instructions on the crimes of importation (conspiring to import and to attempt to import cocaine, Counts II and III under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963) and the crime of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine on board a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction (Count I under 46 U.S.C. &#167; 1903) were prejudicially confusing. On this theory, Saavedra contends that (1) had the jurors believed that he was working for the DEA, and (2) had they not been misled by the instructions that he contends insufficiently distinguished between the two crimes, he would have been acquitted of possession with intent to distribute all of the 297 kilos aboard the M/V DAYBREAK, leaving him responsible only for the importation of 15-20 kilos that he and his team planned to import and sell as compensation for their roles in the venture. This would have resulted in a much reduced sentence from the 324 months that he received for the 297 kilos of cocaine on all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government admits that elements of Count I and Count II overlap (as they are both conspiracy charges). Nevertheless, the government argues, the district court's instructions on each of these charges were correct. Indeed, the defendant does not contest the accuracy of the instructions, only that in the peculiar circumstances of this case the overlap of elements and instructions thereon prejudiced his defense to Count I (that he had authority to possess 270 kilos aboard the vessel as he was aiding the DEA in their investigations). In other words, defendant claims that despite accurate instructions, by not treating the two conspiracies separately in the instructions to the jury, that is, serially, the district court confused the jury and allowed them to convict on conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute for Count I once they found a conspiracy to import for Count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to Saavedra's argument is that the court did not commit plain error simply because, in hindsight, instructions can be conceived that would have better served the defense's strategy. The defense did not request instructions of the type it now says should have been given. The instructions actually given here were adequate and correct. Defendant falls far short of pointing to the commission of plain error. See, e.g., United States v. Alicea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 484 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating that failing defendant's contemporaneous objection at trial to the district court's jury instructions, an appellate court reviews for plain error, a type of review that \"entails inquiry into whether affirmance would skew[ ] the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in some major respect so as to result in a miscarriage of justice\") (alterations in the original) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the failure of the jury to acquit Saavedra of the crime charged in Count I can be attributed to the substantial proof contradicting Saavedra's claim of cooperation with the DEA. As no inaccuracy in the jury charge has been pointed to, nor was the evidence lacking in proof beyond reasonable doubt of the government's case, there is no reason to upset the judgment below. See United States v. Woodward, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating that a Court of Appeals looks \"at the entire charge, in light of the evidence, and determine[s] whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions fairly and adequately submit[ted] the issues in the case to the jury\") (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Saavedra and Munoz were tried separately, in part because Saavedra was not arraigned until 1997. This is because as of January 11, 1996, Saavedra was incarcerated in the Netherlands awaiting trial on charges of cocaine importation, charges different from those at issue here. In spring of 1997, he was extradited to the United States, arrested and arraigned before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico for the crimes described in the first paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It was nevertheless undisputed that prior to Saavedra's incarceration for drug smuggling in the late 1980s, Agent Kazerowsky had worked with and paid Saavedra and Munoz as informants in other drug smuggling operations.

See 46 U.S.C. &#167; 12301-12309. It is undisputed that the M/V DAYBREAK was registered at relevant times in Florida, a state whose numbering system is approved by the United States Secretary of Transportation.

See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) (unlawful possession of a firearm, which requires proof that the firearm has been transported through interstate commerce). This court held in United States v.

See also Scarborough v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109672\"><a href=\"/opinion/109672/scarborough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 575 (1977) (concluding that section 922(g) requires only \"the minimal nexus that the firearm have been, at some time, in interstate commerce\"). The federal bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113 has a similar jurisdictional aspect, requiring the bank's deposits be FDIC-insured.
