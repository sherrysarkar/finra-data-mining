They   sought   a   preliminary   injunction   or   temporary\n\nrestraining order to prevent any further performances of the\n\nPlay by appellees, the Play’s producers and directors.              The\n\ndistrict court denied both the temporary restraining order and\n\nthe preliminary injunction.\n\n            In order to demonstrate entitlement to a preliminary\n\ninjunction, appellants must show that: (1) they will suffer\n\nirreparable injury absent the injunction; (2) the injury will\n\noutweigh the harm imposed on any defendant if the injunction is\n\ngranted; (3) they are likely to succeed on the merits of the\n\ncase; (4) the injunction does not adversely affect the public\n\ninterest.
