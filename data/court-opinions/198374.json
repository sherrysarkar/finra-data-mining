Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\nMark J. Gardner, by appointment of the Court, for appellant.\r\nJames H. Leavey, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                    March 15, 1999\r\n                                                TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  The defendant, George Sacko\r\n(\"Sacko\"), was arrested in December 1996, and charged with: (1)\r\npossession of firearms by a convicted felon, and (2) possession of\r\na silencer by a convicted felon.  On July 8, 1997, Sacko pled\r\nguilty to both counts.  The district court determined that Sacko\r\nwas an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C.  924(e)(1) because of\r\nthree previous Rhode Island convictions for: (1) assault with a\r\ndangerous weapon; (2) assault with intent to murder; and (3)\r\nstatutory rape or, as it is described under Rhode Island General\r\nLaws, sexual assault in the third degree.  Sacko was sentenced, as\r\na level 31 Category VI offender, to 212 months imprisonment and\r\nfive years of supervised release to be served concurrently on each\r\ncount.\r\n                       DISCUSSION\r\n     The only issue before us is the propriety of the district\r\ncourt's sentencing of Sacko as an armed career criminal by virtue\r\nof his previous conviction for statutory rape under Rhode Island\r\nlaw.  The Rhode Island statutory rape statute punishes a person\r\nover the age of eighteen who engages in sexual penetration with\r\nanother person over the age of fourteen and under the age of\r\nconsent, which is sixteen years of age.  See  R.I. Gen. Laws  11-\r\n37-6 (1989).  Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), this\r\nenhancement was only proper if Sacko's conviction was for a\r\n\"violent felony.\"  18 U.S.C.  924(e)(1).  The district court\r\ndetermined that it was such a crime.  This issue is one of law, and\r\nour review is de novo.  See United States v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876,\r\n881 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 729 (1998).\r\nSection 924(e)(2)(B) defines a \"violent felony\" as\r\nfollows:\r\n[T]he term \"violent felony\" means any crime\r\npunishable by imprisonment for a term\r\nexceeding one year . . . that\r\n\n(i)  has as an element the use, attempted use,\r\nor threatened use of physical force against\r\nthe person of another; or\r\n(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion,\r\ninvolves use of explosives, or otherwise\r\ninvolves conduct that presents a serious\r\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\r\n\nUnder Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990),\r\nwhether a predicate offense qualifies as a crime of violence\r\nrequires a \"categorical\" examination of the statutory crime. \r\nTaylor considered whether the defendant's predicate offenses\r\nconstituted \"burglary\" as defined in 18 U.S.C.  924(e), a\r\nsentencing enhancement statute.  Taylor had been convicted of\r\n\"burglary\" in Missouri at a time when Missouri had seven different\r\nstatutes under which a person could be charged for that crime.  The\r\nSupreme Court held that, rather than examining the particular\r\ncircumstances of the crimes for which the defendant was convicted,\r\na sentencing court should look only to whether the statute of\r\nconviction contained the elements of a \"generic\" burglary and\r\nshould not inquire whether the specific crime committed was\r\nespecially dangerous to others.  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 598.  The\r\nCourt defined generic burglary as a crime that consists of:\r\n\"unlawful and unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building\r\nor structure, with intent to commit a crime.\"  Id.  Taylor noted\r\nthat in some situations the statute of conviction may include\r\nelements beyond those of a generic burglary (e.g., entry into\r\nplaces other than buildings).  See id. at 599-600.\r\nTo address that issue, and other problems of\r\ninterpretation of  924(e), sentencing courts should employ a\r\n\"formal categorical approach,\" and generally \"look only to the fact\r\nof conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\" \r\nId. at 602.  A sentencing court may go beyond the fact of\r\nconviction in those cases where the statute encompasses both\r\nviolent felonies (e.g., generic burglary) and non-violent felonies\r\n(e.g., burglary of a vehicle rather than of a building).  See id. \r\nIn such a situation, the sentencing court may examine the\r\nindictment or information and jury instructions in order to discern\r\nwhich type of crime the offender was convicted of perpetrating. \r\nSee id.  The Taylor Court remanded the case so that this\r\ndetermination could be made with respect to Taylor's prior\r\nconvictions.\r\nAfter Taylor, our analysis of predicate offenses has\r\nfollowed this categorical approach.  See United States v. Damon,\r\n127 F.3d 139, 141-46 (1st Cir. 1997); Meader, 118 F.3d at 881-83\r\n(\"[T]he standard approach for determining whether a particular\r\ncrime fits within the 'crime of violence' rubric is a generic one,\r\nin which inquiry is restricted to the statutory definitions of\r\nprior offenses, without regard to the particular facts underlying\r\nthem.\") (citations omitted); United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15,\r\n18 (1st Cir. 1994);  United States v. De Jess, 984 F.2d 21, 23\r\n(1st Cir. 1993) (\"[R]ather than examining the actual circumstances\r\nunderlying the earlier conviction, we examine only the statutory\r\nformulation of the crime charged . . . to see if that crime is a\r\ncrime of  violence . . . .\").\r\nThe Rhode Island statute, defining third degree sexual\r\nassault as it applied in 1989 at the time of Sacko's conviction, is\r\nas follows: \r\nA \"person\" is guilty of third degree sexual\r\nassault if he or she is over the age of\r\neighteen (18) years and engaged in sexual\r\npenetration with another person over the age\r\nof fourteen (14) years and under the age of\r\nconsent, sixteen (16) years of age.\r\n\nBecause the Rhode Island statute does not include as an\r\nelement the use or threat of physical force, it is undisputed that\r\nin order to qualify as a \"violent felony,\" it must fall under the\r\n\"otherwise\" clause of  924(e)(2)(B), and therefore be an offense\r\nthat presents \"a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" The\r\ndistrict court, in determining the potential risk of physical\r\ninjury posed by statutory rape, made the following observations:\r\n     So what the Court has to determine here is\r\nwhether statutory rape presents a serious\r\nrisk, serious potential risk of physical\r\ninjury to another, and whether that risk is\r\ninherent in the usual type of conduct that\r\nconstitutes the offense . . . .\r\n\n     What the Court has to look at here is what's\r\nthe typical, usual type of conduct that makes\r\nup the offense of statutory rape.  And it\r\nseems to me, there were two paradigms here. \r\nOne category of usual conduct in statutory\r\nrape would be where the young woman or female\r\nconsents in every sense of the word except the\r\nlegal sense, since the law does not recognize\r\nthe ability of a minor to consent to such\r\nactivity.  But, but for that, it would be\r\nconsidered a consensual, mutually-consensual\r\nact on the part of the two participants, where\r\nthe only reason that an offense is committed\r\nis the age of the woman, of the female.\r\n\n     The other model for statutory rape is one\r\nthat is very similar to any other kind of\r\nrape, except that there has been no actual\r\nforce used or threatened, but the activity\r\ncannot be characterized as consensual on the\r\npart of the victim and, therefore, because it\r\nis not consensual, it clearly presents a\r\nserious potential risk of physical injury\r\nbecause of the likelihood that if the victim\r\nresists, that force will be used and serious\r\nharm will result.\r\n\n     As best I can make out from the pre-sentence\r\nreport here, the pre-sentence report indicates\r\nthat the Defendant--the Defendant met the\r\nvictim on the street, somehow induced her to\r\ngo back to his apartment or his mother's\r\nhouse, I guess it was, and directed her to\r\ntake off her clothes and then had sexual\r\nintercourse with her. Shortly thereafter,\r\nthree males--three other males entered the\r\nroom, the victim ran away and, obviously,\r\nreported the incident to the police.\r\n\n     So it seems clear that what happened in this\r\ncase falls into the second category of\r\noffenses, and not the first.  And, therefore,\r\nI find that this is a violent felony within\r\nthe meaning of the statute.\r\n\nTr. 11/14/97 at 27-29.\r\nSacko argues: (1) that the district court's approach was\r\na violation of the \"categorical\" approach, and (2) that the\r\ndetermination that Sacko's conviction was for a \"violent felony\"\r\nwas in error.\r\nWhile the categorical approach frames our inquiry, as\r\nwith most any rule, there is an exception.  A basis for expanding\r\nthe inquiry beyond the cold words of the statute is found in\r\nTaylor, where the Supreme Court carved out a narrow exception to\r\nthe categorical approach for cases in which the statute of\r\nconviction covers conduct both inside and outside the \"violent\r\nfelony\" sphere.  In such instances, the sentencing court may look\r\nto the information or indictment and jury instructions to ascertain\r\nwhether the conduct that was the basis for the conviction\r\nconstituted a violent felony.  See Meader, 118 F.3d at 882 n.9.\r\nBecause statutory rape can encompass both violent and\r\nnon-violent conduct, it was permissible for the district court to\r\nexamine the indictment to learn that \"George Sacko [age 21] . . .\r\ndid engage in sexual penetration, vaginal intercourse, with [Jane\r\nDoe], age 14 . . . .\"  The district court's investigation of the\r\ncircumstances of the crime should have ended there.  It was error\r\nfor the district court to delve into the facts of Sacko's crime as\r\ndescribed in the presentence report in order to determine whether\r\nhis conviction was for a violent or a non-violent crime.  SeeDamon, 127 F.3d at 144-45 (holding that it is error for a district\r\ncourt to rely on an offender's uncontested presentencing report).\r\nIn deciding whether Sacko's conviction constitutes a\r\n\"violent felony,\" we look to Meader, United States v. Shannon, 110\r\nF.3d 382 (7th Cir. 1996) (en banc), and United States v. Thomas,\r\n159 F.3d 296 (7th Cir. 1998).  \r\nIn Meader, we held that the conviction of a 39 year old\r\nman under a Maine statute for statutory rape with a girl under the\r\nage of fourteen was a \"crime of violence.\"  See Meader, 118 F.3d at\r\n884-85.  Two crucial factors supporting our conclusion were: (1)\r\nthe age of the girl; (2) the large chronological gap between the\r\nvictim and the defendant; and (3) the medical literature regarding\r\nthe possible physical injuries to the girl as a result of sexual\r\nintercourse with the defendant.  See id. at 884.\r\nIn Shannon, the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, decided\r\nan issue remarkably similar to the one at hand: whether sexual\r\nintercourse between a 17 year old boy and a 13 year old girl is a\r\ncrime of violence.  See Shannon, 110 F.3d at 385.  Writing for the\r\nCourt, Chief Judge Posner discussed the issue of whether any\r\nfelonious act with a minor creates a serious potential risk of\r\nphysical injury.  See id. at 386.  Citing the wide variation in age\r\nabove which sex with a minor is not regarded as felonious in the\r\nabsence of any aggravating factors, he concluded that \"a serious\r\nrisk of physical injury cannot be automatically inferred from the\r\nexistence of a statutory-rape law.\"  Id.  (noting, for example,\r\nthat in Iowa, \"the minor need only have reached the age of 14, and\r\nin Pennsylvania, she need only have turned 13\").\r\nHis conclusion that sexual intercourse between a 17 year\r\nold boy and a 13 year old girl involved conduct that presents a\r\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another was based on \r\n\"medical literature which indicated that a 13 year old is unlikely\r\nto appreciate fully or be able to cope effectively with the disease\r\nrisks and fertility risks of intercourse and that if she does\r\nbecome pregnant it is likely to be a high risk pregnancy both for\r\nher and the fetus.\" Id. at 387-88.\r\nIn Thomas, Chief Judge Posner, writing for the panel,\r\nstated that \"it is difficult to maintain on a priori grounds that\r\nsex is physically dangerous to 16 year old girls,\"  Thomas, 159\r\nF.3d at 299, because \"[m]ore than 40 percent of the 16 year old\r\ngirls in our society have had sexual intercourse . . . and 45 of\r\nthe 50 states permit marriage at 16.\"  Id.  Relying on these facts\r\nand the government's failure to cite any secondary literature\r\ndelineating the potential risk of injury posed by a 16 year old\r\ngirl engaging in sexual intercourse, the Court vacated Thomas's\r\nsentence as an armed career criminal.\r\nThis Court stands in the midst of an issue fraught with\r\nperil.  As we stated in Meader, this is an issue that \"appeals\r\ncourts, have neither the expertise nor the authority to resolve in\r\nthe first instance,\" 118 F.3d at 885, and which should be resolved\r\nby the Sentencing Commission and Congress.  In Meader, it was\r\n\"commonsensical\" that there was a serious potential risk of injury\r\nbecause of the large age difference between the defendant and the\r\nvictim.  In Shannon, the Seventh Circuit relied on copious medical\r\nevidence discussing the potential risks that result from a 13 year\r\nold girl engaging in sexual intercourse.  Here, we are unprepared\r\nto say a priori that sex is not physically dangerous for a 14 year\r\nold girl.  However, we have no legal basis for the opposite\r\nconclusion, no studies or medical journals to ground such a\r\nholding.\r\nAs a result, we remand this case to the district court to\r\ntake evidence on the issue whether the crime of sexual penetration\r\nof a fourteen year-old by someone over the age of eighteen involves\r\nconduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to\r\nthe former.  As a circuit, we have not yet needed to address the\r\nissue with these age characteristics.  Our opinion in Meaderinvolved a thirteen year-old and relied on physical injuries\r\n\"includ[ing] abrasions, hymenal transections, first-degree vaginal\r\ntears, and perianal tears.\"  Meader, 118 F.3d at 882 n.7 (quoting\r\nState v. Rundlett, 391 A.2d 815, 819 (Me. 1978)).  For the purposes\r\nof Meader, we found these injuries sufficient to find that the\r\ndefendant's conduct \"involve[d] conduct that present[ed] a serious \r\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G.  4B1.2.\r\nIn so doing, we explicitly recognized the fact that we\r\n\"bypassed a number of troubling and complex issues\" including \"what\r\nis meant by 'physical injury'[.]\"  Meader, 118 F.3d at 884.  We\r\nthen highlighted the disagreement on this particular point among\r\nthe judges of the Seventh Circuit.  See Meader, 118 F.3d at 884-85. \r\nWe have already outlined the more expansive views of the majority. \r\nSee supra at 9.  However, a concurrence suggested that \"the risk of\r\nphysical injury referred to in the Guideline must be confined to\r\nthe act of intercourse, not the possible consequences that could\r\ndevelop, such as pregnancy or disease.\"  Shannon, 110 F.3d at 390\r\n(Manion, J., concurring).\r\nThe district court may find the risks of physical injury\r\nduring penetration to be sufficient to meet the requisite \"serious\r\npotential risk of physical injury.\"  If not, it will have to\r\naddress the alternative noted above.  In the continuing absence of\r\nguidance from Congress and the Sentencing Commission, additional\r\nbriefing by the parties, and an initial determination by the\r\ndistrict court, we deem it inappropriate to proceed.\r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we REMAND this\r\ncase to the district court for further proceedings consistent with\r\nthis opinion.\n",
