Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Mark Pennington, Assistant General Counsel, with whom David\nM.

Barrett and Butters,\nBrazilian & Small, LLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       September 13, 2001\n\f\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge.               These appeals — procedurally,\n\nthere are two, but for all practical purposes they may be\n\ntreated as one — require us to determine whether virtual shares\n\nin an enterprise existing only in cyberspace fall within the\n\npurview of the federal securities laws.                     SG Ltd., a Dominican\n\ncorporation, and its affiliate, SG Trading Ltd. (collectively,\n\n\"SG\" or \"defendants\"), asseverate that the virtual shares were\n\npart of a fantasy investment game created for the personal\n\nentertainment        of    Internet    users,       and   therefore,   that    those\n\nshares   do    not    implicate       the    federal      securities   laws.     The\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"the SEC\"), plaintiff below\n\nand appellant here, counters that substance ought to prevail\n\nover form, and that merely labeling a website as a game should\n\nnot   negate    the       applicability      of     the   securities   laws.     The\n\ndistrict court accepted the defendants' view and dismissed the\n\nSEC's complaint.           SEC v. SG Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 2d 126 (D. Mass.\n\n2001).    Concluding, as we do, that the SEC alleged sufficient\n\nfacts to state a triable claim, we reverse.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n              We take the facts as alleged in the SEC's first amended\n\ncomplaint      (shorn,      however,    of        empty   rhetoric).    Aulson    v.\n\nBlanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\f            The underlying litigation was spawned by SG's operation\n\nof a \"StockGeneration\" website offering on-line denizens an\n\nopportunity to purchase shares in eleven different \"virtual\n\ncompanies\" listed on the website's \"virtual stock exchange.\"                    SG\n\narbitrarily set the purchase and sale prices of each of these\n\nimaginary companies in biweekly \"rounds,\" and guaranteed that\n\ninvestors could buy or sell any quantity of shares at posted\n\nprices.    SG placed no upper limit on the amount of funds that an\n\ninvestor could squirrel away in its virtual offerings.\n\n            The SEC's complaint focused on shares in a particular\n\nvirtual    enterprise    referred      to   by    SG   as     the    \"privileged\n\ncompany,\" and so do we.       SG advised potential purchasers to pay\n\n\"particular attention\" to shares in the privileged company and\n\nboasted that investing in those shares was a \"game without any\n\nrisk.\"     To this end, its website announced that the privileged\n\ncompany's     shares     would    unfailingly          appreciate,          boldly\n\nproclaiming that \"[t]he share price of [the privileged company]\n\nis   supported   by    the   owners   of    SG,   this   is    why    its    value\n\nconstantly rises; on average at a rate of 10% monthly (this is\n\napproximately 215% annually).\"              To add plausibility to this\n\nrepresentation and to allay anxiety about future pricing, SG\n\npublished prices of the privileged company's shares one month in\n\nadvance.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            While SG conceded that a decline in the share price was\n\ntheoretically possible, it assured prospective participants that\n\n\"under the rules governing the fall in prices, [the share price\n\nfor the privileged company] cannot fall by more than 5% in a\n\nround.\"    To bolster this claim, it vouchsafed that shares in the\n\nprivileged company were supported by several distinct revenue\n\nstreams.    According to SG's representations, capital inflow from\n\nnew participants provided liquidity for existing participants\n\nwho might choose to sell their virtual shareholdings.                As a\n\nbackstop, SG pledged to allocate an indeterminate portion of the\n\nprofits derived from its website operations to a special reserve\n\nfund designed to maintain the price of the privileged company's\n\nshares.     SG asserted that these profits emanated from four\n\nsources:     (1) the collection of a 1.5% commission on each\n\ntransaction conducted on its virtual stock exchange; (2) the\n\nbid-ask    spread   on   the   virtual   shares;   (3)    the   \"skillful\n\nmanipulation\" of the share prices of eight particular imaginary\n\ncompanies, not including the privileged company, listed on the\n\nvirtual stock exchange; and (4) SG's right to sell shares of\n\nthree     other   virtual   companies    (including      the    privileged\n\ncompany).    As a further hedge against adversity, SG alluded to\n\nthe availability of auxiliary stabilization funds which could be\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\ftapped to ensure the continued operation of its virtual stock\n\nexchange.\n\n            SG's     website         contained         lists        of    purported      \"big\n\nwinners,\" an Internet bulletin board featuring testimonials from\n\nsupposedly satisfied participants, and descriptions of incentive\n\nprograms    that    held       out    the    prospect          of    rewards       for   such\n\nactivities as the referral of new participants (e.g., SG's\n\nrepresentation that it would pay \"20, 25 or 30% of the referred\n\nplayer's    highest       of    the     first          three    payments\")         and    the\n\nestablishment of affiliate websites.\n\n            At least 800 United States domiciliaries, paying real\n\ncash, purchased virtual shares in the virtual companies listed\n\non the defendants' virtual stock exchange.                          In the fall of 1999,\n\nover $4,700,000 in participants' funds was deposited into a\n\nLatvian bank account in the name of SG Trading Ltd.                                      The\n\nfollowing spring, more than $2,700,000 was deposited in Estonian\n\nbank accounts standing in the names of SG Ltd. and SG Perfect\n\nLtd., respectively.\n\n            In     late    1999,       participants            began       to   experience\n\ndifficulties in redeeming their virtual shares.                             On March 20,\n\n2000, these difficulties crested; SG unilaterally suspended all\n\npending     requests      to     withdraw         funds        and       sharply    reduced\n\nparticipants'      account      balances          in    all    companies        except    the\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fprivileged company.       Two weeks later, SG peremptorily announced\n\na reverse stock split, which caused the share prices of all\n\ncompanies listed on the virtual stock exchange, including the\n\nprivileged company, to plummet to 1/10,000 of their previous\n\nvalues.     At about the same time, SG stopped responding to\n\nparticipant requests for the return of funds, yet continued to\n\nsolicit new participants through its website.\n\n            The   SEC    undertook       an    investigation      into    SG's\n\nactivities, which culminated in the filing of a civil action in\n\nfederal   district      court.     The     SEC's     complaint   alleged,    in\n\nsubstance, that SG's operations constituted a fraudulent scheme\n\nin violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the\n\nfederal securities laws.          See Securities Act of 1933 § 5(a),\n\n(c), 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a), (c) (offer, sale, or delivery of\n\nunregistered securities); id. § 17(a), 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a) (fraud\n\nin offer or sale of securities);              Securities Exchange Act of\n\n1934 § 10(b), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R.\n\n240.10b-5    (fraud     in    connection      with   purchase    or   sale   of\n\nsecurities).      The SEC sought injunctive relief, disgorgement,\n\nand civil penalties.\n\n            The district court entered a temporary restraining\n\norder   (subsequently        converted   to    a   preliminary   injunction)\n\nblocking SG's operation of the website pendente lite.                 The court\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\falso instituted an asset freeze that infrigidated approximately\n\n$5,500,000.      The SEC's success was short-lived; after some\n\nskirmishing, not relevant here, the district court granted SG's\n\nmotion    to   dismiss   the   complaint   for    failure   to   state    a\n\ncognizable claim on the ground that the virtual shares were a\n\nclearly marked and defined game lacking a business context.           See\n\nSEC v. SG Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 2d at 131.             The SEC immediately\n\nappealed, and we issued a stay keeping both the preliminary\n\ninjunction and the asset freeze in place for the time being.\n\n           These appeals hinge on whether the district court erred\n\nin ruling that transactions in the privileged company's shares\n\ndid not constitute transactions in securities.              In the pages\n\nthat follow, we explore the makeup of that particular type of\n\nsecurity known as an investment contract; examine the district\n\ncourt's    rationale;    and   apply    the    tripartite    \"investment\n\ncontract\" test to the facts as alleged.          Because the lower court\n\ndismissed the SEC's first amended complaint for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief might be granted, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6), we conduct a de novo review, \"accepting as true all\n\nwell-pleaded factual averments and indulging all reasonable\n\ninferences in the plaintiff's favor.\"         Aulson, 83 F.3d at 3.      If\n\nthe facts contained in the complaint, viewed in this favorable\n\nlight, justify recovery under any applicable legal theory, we\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fmust set aside the order of dismissal.                   Conley v. Gibson, 355\n\nU.S. 41, 45-46 (1957); Aulson, 83 F.3d at 3.\n\nII.    THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\n\n            These appeals turn on whether the SEC alleged facts\n\nwhich,     if        proven,      would     bring     this     case    within      the\n\njurisdictional            ambit     of     the   federal       securities        laws.\n\nConsequently, we focus on the type of security that the SEC\n\nalleges is apposite here:                investment contracts.\n\n                           A.     Investment Contracts.\n\n            The       applicable         regulatory    regime     rests     on     two\n\ncomplementary pillars:             the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§\n\n77a-77aa, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §§\n\n78a-78mm.       These statutes employ nearly identical definitions of\n\nthe term \"security.\"              See Securities Act of 1933 § 2(a)(1), 15\n\nU.S.C. § 77b(a)(1); Securities Exchange Act of 1934 § 3(a)(10),\n\n15    U.S.C.     §   78c(a)(10).          Congress    intended    these   sweeping\n\ndefinitions, set forth in an appendix hereto, to encompass a\n\nwide     array       of   financial       instruments,       ranging   from      well-\n\nestablished investment vehicles (e.g., stocks and bonds) to much\n\nmore arcane arrangements.                SEC v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp.,\n\n320 U.S. 344, 351 (1943).                   Included in this array is the\n\nelusive, essentially protean, concept of an investment contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f         Judicial efforts to delineate what is — and what is not\n\n— an investment contract are grounded in the seminal case of SEC\n\nv. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).            The   Howey   Court\n\nestablished a tripartite test to determine whether a particular\n\nfinancial instrument constitutes an investment contract (and,\n\nhence, a security).    This test has proven durable.      Under it, an\n\ninvestment contract comprises (1) the investment of money (2) in\n\na common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits to be\n\nderived solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third\n\nparty.   Id. at 298-99.      This formulation must be applied in\n\nlight of the economic realities of the transaction.               United\n\nHous. Found., Inc. v.      Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 851-52 (1975);\n\nTcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); Futura Dev.\n\nCorp. v. Centex Corp., 761 F.2d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 1985).              In\n\nother words,\n\n         substance governs form, and the substance of\n         an investment contract is a security-like\n         interest in a \"common enterprise\" that,\n         through the efforts of the promoter or\n         others, is expected to generate profits for\n         the security holder, either for direct\n         distribution or as an increase in the value\n         of the investment.\n\nRodriguez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 990 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n         The   Supreme     Court   has   long     espoused   a     broad\n\nconstruction   of   what   constitutes   an     investment   contract,\n\n                                -10-\n\faspiring \"to afford the investing public a full measure of\n\nprotection.\"       Howey, 328 U.S. at 298.                The investment contract\n\ntaxonomy    thus        \"embodies     a     flexible      rather   than    a   static\n\nprinciple,       one    that   is    capable       of   adaptation    to    meet    the\n\ncountless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use\n\nof the money of others on the promise of profits.\"                        Id. at 299.\n\n            The Howey test has proven to be versatile in practice.\n\nOver time, courts have classified as investment contracts a\n\nkaleidoscopic assortment of pecuniary arrangements that defy\n\ncategorization in conventional financial terms, yet nonetheless\n\nsatisfy    the    Howey    Court's         three   criteria.       See,    e.g.,    id.\n\n(holding that sale of citrus groves, in conjunction with service\n\ncontract,    qualifies         as   an     investment      contract);      Teague    v.\n\nBakker, 35 F.3d 978, 981, 990 (4th Cir. 1994) (same re purchase\n\nof life partnership in evangelical community); Long v. Shultz\n\nCattle Co., 881 F.2d 129, 132 (5th Cir. 1989) (same re cattle-\n\nfeeding and consulting agreement); Miller v. Cent. Chinchilla\n\nGroup,    494    F.2d     414,      415,    418    (8th    Cir.    1974)   (same     re\n\nchinchilla breeding and resale arrangement).\n\n\n\n                   B.    The District Court's Rationale.\n\n            We pause at this juncture to address the district\n\ncourt's rationale.         Relying upon a dictum from Howey discussing\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f\"the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall\n\nwithin the ordinary concept of a security,\" 328 U.S. at 299\n\n(quoting    legislative               history),       the    district     court    drew    a\n\ndistinction between what it termed \"commercial dealings\" and\n\nwhat it termed \"games.\"                SEC v. SG Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 2d at 131.\n\nCharacterizing purchases of the privileged company's shares as\n\na \"clearly marked and defined game,\" the court concluded that\n\nsince that activity was not part of the commercial world, it\n\nfell beyond the jurisdictional reach of the federal securities\n\nlaws.      Id.         In       so   ruling,     the    court      differentiated       SG's\n\noperations from a classic Ponzi or pyramid scheme on the ground\n\nthat    those    types          of    chicanery      involved      commercial     dealings\n\nwithin a business context.                 Id.\n\n            We    do        not      gainsay   the     obvious     correctness     of    the\n\ndistrict    court's             observation      that       investment    contracts      lie\n\nwithin the commercial world.                    Contrary to the district court's\n\nview, however, this locution does not translate into a dichotomy\n\nbetween business dealings, on the one hand, and games, on the\n\nother    hand,     as       a     failsafe     way     for    determining     whether      a\n\nparticular       financial           arrangement       should      (or   should   not)    be\n\ncharacterized as an investment contract.                             Howey remains the\n\ntouchstone       for    ascertaining           whether        an   investment     contract\n\nexists — and the test that it prescribes must be administered\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\fwithout regard to nomenclature.             See Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v.\n\nDaniel, 439 U.S. 551, 561 (1979); see also Forman, 421 U.S. at\n\n851-52 (warning against reliance on \"the names that may have\n\nbeen   employed    by    the       parties\"    to    identify        a   particular\n\ninvestment); cf. William Shakespeare, Romeo & Juliet, act 2, sc.\n\n2 (circa 1597) (\"A rose by any other name would smell as\n\nsweet.\").    As long as the three-pronged Howey test is satisfied,\n\nthe instrument must be classified as an investment contract.\n\nHowey,   328   U.S.     at    301.     Once   that       has   occurred,     \"it   is\n\nimmaterial     whether       the   enterprise       is    speculative       or   non-\n\nspeculative or whether there is a sale of property with or\n\nwithout intrinsic value.\"            Id.   It is equally immaterial whether\n\nthe promoter depicts the enterprise as a serious commercial\n\nventure or dubs it a game.\n\n            A fairly recent Supreme Court opinion demonstrates that\n\nthe \"commercial world\" to which the Howey Court alluded actually\n\nencompasses     the     total      universe     of       financial       instruments\n\navailable to investors, rather than the subset of financial\n\ninstruments envisioned by the district court (i.e., \"commerce\"\n\nas opposed to \"games\").            In that case, Justice Marshall wrote:\n\n            In defining the scope of the market that it\n            wished to regulate, Congress painted with a\n            broad brush.   It recognized the virtually\n            limitless   scope   of   human    ingenuity,\n            especially in the creation of \"countless and\n            variable schemes devised by those who seek\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            the use of the money of others on the\n            promise of profits,\" and determined that the\n            best way to achieve its goal of protecting\n            investors   was   \"to   define   'the   term\n            \"security\" in sufficiently broad and general\n            terms   so  as   to   include  within   that\n            definition the many types of instruments\n            that in our commercial world fall within the\n            ordinary concept of a security.'\" Congress\n            therefore did not attempt precisely to cabin\n            the scope of the Securities Acts. Rather,\n            it enacted a definition of \"security\"\n            sufficiently broad to encompass virtually\n            any instrument that might be sold as an\n            investment.\n\nReves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 60-61 (1990) (citations\n\nomitted).     This expansive language, coupled with Congress's\n\nsweeping definitions of \"security,\" persuade us to reject the\n\ndistrict court's use of Howey's \"commercial world\" reference as\n\na limiting principle.\n\n            To sum up, Howey supplies the appropriate template for\n\nidentifying investment contracts within the overarching ambit of\n\nthe federal securities laws.     Contrary to the district court's\n\nconclusion, this template admits of no exception for games or\n\ngaming.     Thus, the language on SG's website emphasizing the\n\ngame-like nature of buying and selling virtual shares of the\n\nprivileged company does not place such transactions beyond the\n\nlong reach of the federal securities laws.\n\nIII.   ADMINISTERING THE TRIPARTITE TEST\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f           What remains is to analyze whether purchases of the\n\nprivileged company's shares constitute investment contracts. We\n\nturn to that task, taking the three Howey criteria in sequence.\n\n\n\n\n                     A.   Investment of Money.\n\n           The first component of the Howey test focuses on the\n\ninvestment of money.      The determining factor is whether an\n\ninvestor \"chose to give up a specific consideration in return\n\nfor a separable financial interest with the characteristics of\n\na security.\"    Daniel, 439 U.S. at 559.       We conclude that the\n\nSEC's   complaint   sufficiently   alleges   the   existence   of   this\n\nfactor.\n\n           To be sure, SG disputes the point.      It argues that the\n\nindividuals who purchased shares in the privileged company were\n\nnot so much investing money in return for rights in the virtual\n\nshares as paying for an entertainment commodity (the opportunity\n\nto play the StockGeneration game).     This argument suggests that\n\nan interesting factual issue may await resolution — whether\n\nparticipants were motivated primarily by a perceived investment\n\nopportunity or by the visceral excitement of playing a game.\n\nNevertheless, this case comes to us following a dismissal under\n\nRule 12(b)(6), and the SEC's complaint memorializes, inter alia,\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fSG's representation that participants could \"firmly expect a 10%\n\nprofit monthly\" on purchases of the privileged company's shares.\n\nThat representation plainly supports the SEC's legal claim that\n\nparticipants     who   invested    substantial    amounts   of      money   in\n\nexchange for virtual shares in the privileged company likely did\n\nso in anticipation of investment gains.           Given the procedural\n\nposture of the case, no more is exigible to fulfill the first\n\npart of the Howey test.\n\n                         B.    Common Enterprise.\n\n          The second component of the Howey test involves the\n\nexistence of a common enterprise.           Before diving headlong into\n\nthe sea of facts, we must dispel the miasma that surrounds the\n\nappropriate legal standard.\n\n          1.     The Legal Standard.        Courts are in some disarray\n\nas to the legal rules associated with the ascertainment of a\n\ncommon enterprise.       See generally II Louis Loss & Joel Seligman,\n\nSecurities Regulation 989-97 (3d ed. rev. 1999).                Many courts\n\nrequire   a    showing    of   horizontal    commonality    —   a   type    of\n\ncommonality that involves the pooling of assets from multiple\n\ninvestors so that all share in the profits and risks of the\n\nenterprise.     See SEC v. Infinity Group Co., 212 F.3d 180, 187-88\n\n(3d Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1228 (2001); SEC v.\n\nLife Partners, Inc., 87 F.3d 536, 543 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Wals v.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fFox Hills Dev. Corp., 24 F.3d 1016, 1018 (7th Cir. 1994); Revak\n\nv. SEC Realty Co., 18 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 1994); Curran v.\n\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, 622 F.2d 216, 222, 224\n\n(6th Cir. 1980), aff'd on other grounds, 456 U.S. 353 (1982).\n\nOther courts have modeled the concept of common enterprise\n\naround fact patterns in which an investor's fortunes are tied to\n\nthe promoter's success rather than to the fortunes of his or her\n\nfellow investors.    This doctrine, known as vertical commonality,\n\nhas two variants.    Broad vertical commonality requires that the\n\nwell-being of all investors be dependent upon the promoter's\n\nexpertise.   See Villeneuve v. Advanced Bus. Concepts Corp., 698\n\nF.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir. 1983), aff'd en banc, 730 F.2d 1403\n\n(11th Cir. 1984); SEC v. Koscot Interplanetary, Inc., 497 F.2d\n\n473, 478-79 (5th Cir. 1974).              In contrast, narrow vertical\n\ncommonality requires that the investors' fortunes be \"interwoven\n\nwith and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking\n\nthe investment or of third parties.\"             SEC v. Glenn W. Turner\n\nEnters., 474 F.2d 476, 482 n.7 (9th Cir. 1973).\n\n         Courts     also   differ    in    the   steadfastness   of   their\n\nallegiance to a single standard of commonality.            Two courts of\n\nappeals recognize only horizontal commonality.             See Wals, 24\n\nF.3d at 1018; Curran, 622 F.2d at 222, 224.            Two others adhere\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fexclusively to broad vertical commonality.1         See Villeneuve, 698\n\nF.2d at 1124; Koscot, 497 F.2d at 478-79.               The Ninth Circuit\n\nrecognizes   both   horizontal      commonality   and    narrow   vertical\n\ncommonality.     See Hocking v. Dubois, 885 F.2d 1449, 1459 (9th\n\nCir. 1989) (en banc).         To complicate matters further, four\n\ncourts of appeals have accepted horizontal commonality, but have\n\nnot yet ruled on whether they also will accept some form of\n\nvertical commonality.    See Infinity Group, 212 F.3d at 187 n.8;\n\nLife Partners, 87 F.3d at 544;             Teague, 35 F.3d at 986 n.8;\n\nRevak, 18 F.3d at 88.     At least one of these courts, however,\n\nhas explicitly rejected broad vertical commonality.            See Revak,\n\n18 F.3d at 88.\n\n           Thus far, neither the Supreme Court nor this court has\n\nauthoritatively determined what type of commonality must be\n\npresent to satisfy the common enterprise element.           We came close\n\nin Rodriguez, in which we hinted at a preference for horizontal\n\ncommonality.     There, promoters selling parcels of land made\n\n\"strong and repeated suggestions that the surrounding area would\n\ndevelop into a thriving residential community.\"           990 F.2d at 11.\n\nAlthough   we   held   that   the    financial    arrangement     did   not\n\n\n\n    1We note that broad vertical commonality is an expansive\nconcept which typically overspreads other types of commonality.\nSee Mordaunt v. Incomco, 469 U.S. 1115, 1115-16 (1985) (White,\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari).\n\n                                    -18-\n\fconstitute a security, we implied that an actual commitment by\n\nthe promoters to develop the community themselves, coupled with\n\nthe buyers' joint financing of the enterprise, could constitute\n\na common enterprise.    See id.\n\n           The case at bar requires us to take a position on the\n\ncommon enterprise component of the Howey test.         We hold that a\n\nshowing of horizontal commonality — the pooling of assets from\n\nmultiple investors in such a manner that all share in the\n\nprofits and risks of the enterprise — satisfies the test.            This\n\nholding flows naturally from the facts of Howey, in which the\n\npromoter   commingled   fruit   from     the   investors'   groves    and\n\nallocated net profits based upon the production from each tract.\n\nSee Howey, 328 U.S. at 296.       Adopting this rule also aligns us\n\nwith the majority view and confirms the intimation of Rodriguez.\n\nLast, but surely not least, the horizontal commonality standard\n\nplaces easily ascertainable and predictable limits on the types\n\nof financial instruments that will qualify as securities.2\n\n           2.   Applying the Standard.     Here, the pooling element\n\nof horizontal commonality jumps off the screen.        The defendants'\n\nwebsite stated that:    \"The players' money is accumulated on the\n\n\n    2 Since the complaint in this case alleges facts sufficient\nto establish horizontal commonality, see infra Part III(B)(2),\nwe take no view as to whether vertical commonality, in either of\nits iterations, also may suffice to satisfy the \"common\nenterprise\" requirement.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fSG current account and is not invested anywhere, because no\n\ninvestment, not even the most profitable one, could possibly\n\nfully     compensate       for      the     lack    of     sufficiency      in    settling\n\naccounts      with      players,      which       lack   would     otherwise      be   more\n\nlikely.\"          Thus,        as     the        SEC's   complaint        suggests,      SG\n\nunambiguously represented to its clientele that participants'\n\nfunds     were        pooled    in     a    single       account     used    to     settle\n\nparticipants'          on-line       transactions.           Therefore,      pooling     is\n\nestablished.\n\n              Of course, horizontal commonality requires more than\n\npooling alone; it also requires that investors share in the\n\nprofits and risks of the enterprise.                     The SEC maintains that two\n\nseparate      elements         of   SG's    operations       embody    the       necessary\n\nsharing.       First, it asserts that SG was running a Ponzi or\n\npyramid scheme dependent upon a continuous influx of new money\n\nto   remain      in    operation,3         and    argues    that   such     arrangements\n\n\n      3\n      While the terms \"Ponzi\" and \"pyramid\" often are used\ninterchangeably to describe financial arrangements which rob\nPeter to pay Paul, the two differ slightly. In Ponzi schemes —\nnamed after a notorious Boston swindler, Charles Ponzi, who\nparlayed an initial stake of $150 into a fortune by means of an\nelaborate scheme featuring promissory notes yielding interest at\nannual rates of up to 50% — money tendered by later investors is\nused to pay off earlier investors. In contrast, pyramid schemes\nincorporate   a   recruiting   element;   they   are   marketing\narrangements in which participants are rewarded financially\nbased upon their ability to induce others to participate. The\nSEC alleges that SG's operations aptly can be characterized\nunder either appellation.\n\n                                             -20-\n\finherently       involve    the    sharing     of    profit    and    risk    among\n\ninvestors.       Second, the SEC construes SG's promise to divert a\n\nportion of its profits from website operations to support the\n\nprivileged company's shares as a bond that ties together the\n\ncollective fortunes of those who have purchased the shares.\n\nWhile we analyze each of these theories, we note that any one of\n\nthem suffices to support a finding of commonality.\n\n            We endorse the SEC's suggestion that Ponzi schemes\n\ntypically    satisfy       the    horizontal     commonality    standard.        In\n\nInfinity Group, investors contributed substantial sums of money\n\nto   a   trust    established      by   the    defendants     and    received    in\n\nexchange a property transfer agreement guaranteeing stupendous\n\nannual rates of return.              212 F.3d at 184-85.             The economic\n\nguarantees were based upon the trust's purported performance\n\nexperience, financial connections, and ability to pool large\n\namounts of money.       Id. at 185.        Participants were promised that\n\ninvesting in the trust was a risk-free proposition, and that\n\ntheir cash infusions would be repaid in full upon demand.                       Id.\n\nat 184-85.       Expected profits were a function of the number of\n\n\"capital units\" held pursuant to the contract with the trust; in\n\nturn, the number of capital units allocated to each investor was\n\ndirectly proportional to the size of his or her investment.                     Id.\n\nat   188-89.       On   these     facts,   the      Third   Circuit    held    that\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fhorizontal       commonality    existed,        emphasizing       that    under   the\n\nplan's terms each investor was entitled to receive returns\n\ndirectly proportionate to his or her investment stake.                       Id. at\n\n188.\n\n            SG's virtual shares bear striking factual similarities\n\nto the financial instruments classified as investment contracts\n\nin Infinity Group.         SG's flat 10% guaranteed return applied to\n\nall privileged company shares, expected returns were dependent\n\nupon the number of shares held, the economic assurances were\n\nbased on the promoter's ability to keep the ball rolling, the\n\ninvestment was proclaimed to be free from risk, and participants\n\nwere promised that their principal would be repaid in full upon\n\ndemand.     Like the Third Circuit, we think that these facts\n\nsuffice to make out horizontal commonality.\n\n            In all events, SG's promise to pay referral fees to\n\nexisting    participants        who   induced     others     to    patronize      the\n\nvirtual    exchange       provides    an   alternative       basis   for     finding\n\nhorizontal commonality.          The SEC argues convincingly that this\n\nshows the existence of a pyramid scheme sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe    horizontal       commonality    standard.       The    most       instructive\n\ncomparison is to SEC v. Int'l Loan Network, 968 F.2d 1304 (D.C.\n\nCir.    1992).      A    key   element     of   the   defendants'         elaborate,\n\nmultifaceted, financial distribution network in that case was a\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fpyramid sales program in which participants stood to receive 50%\n\ncommissions on membership fees paid by individuals whom they\n\nrecruited, plus lesser commissions on sales by those recruited\n\nby their recruits.         Id. at 1306.      The court of appeals ruled\n\nthat this structure satisfied the requirements of horizontal\n\ncommonality.       Id. at 1308.     In the process, it relied heavily\n\nupon the fact that the network generated income only through\n\nconstant expansion of membership, which depended on individual\n\nrecruiting and the appeal of the promoter's larger marketing\n\ncampaign.    Id.\n\n            Like     the    investors      in     Int'l     Loan     Network,\n\nStockGeneration participants who recruited new participants were\n\npromised    bonuses    worth     20%-30%   of    the    recruit's   payments.\n\nTaking as true the SEC's plausible allegation that the sine qua\n\nnon of SG's operations was the continued net inflow of funds,\n\nthe investment pool supporting the referral bonus payments was\n\nentirely dependent upon the infusion of fresh capital.                  Since\n\nall participants shared in the profits and risks under this\n\npyramidal    structure,     it   furnishes      the    sharing   necessary   to\n\nwarrant a finding of horizontal commonality.\n\n            We will not paint the lily.                We conclude, without\n\nserious question, that the arrangement described in the SEC's\n\ncomplaint fairly can be characterized as either a Ponzi or\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fpyramid scheme, and that it provides the requisite profit-and-\n\nrisk sharing to support a finding of horizontal commonality.\n\nTaking as true the SEC's allegation that SG's ability to fulfill\n\nits pecuniary guarantees was fully predicated upon the net\n\ninflow of new money, the fortunes of the participants were\n\ninextricably intertwined.            As long as the privileged company\n\ncontinued     to     receive    net        capital    infusions,      existing\n\nshareholders could dip into the well of funds to draw out their\n\nprofits or collect their commissions.                But all of them shared\n\nthe risk that new participants would not emerge, cash flow would\n\ndry up, and the underlying pool would empty.\n\n            SG's most perfervid argument against a finding of\n\nhorizontal commonality consists of a denial that its operations\n\ncomprise a Ponzi or pyramid scheme.                  It says that any such\n\nscheme requires a material misrepresentation of fact and some\n\nelement of fraud or deception, and adds that those additional\n\nfeatures    are    lacking   here;    to     the   contrary,   the   rules    of\n\nStockGeneration      were    fully   and     accurately   disclosed    to    all\n\nparticipants.      We do not gainsay that considerable disclosure\n\noccurred.    SG emphasized that new participants constituted the\n\nsole source of all financial income for its StockGeneration\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fwebsite.4      Indeed, in describing the structure and mechanism of\n\nits virtual stock exchange, SG drew a colorful analogy between\n\nthe privileged company's shares and an enormous card table with\n\na mountain of money.             According to SG, thousands of participants\n\ncontinuously threw money onto the table by purchasing shares in\n\nthe privileged company, while other participants simultaneously\n\nsold       their   shares      back    to    the    exchange         to    retrieve    their\n\nwinnings from the table.                   SG remarked that the system would\n\nremain      stable       so   long    as    the    size    of   the       mountain    either\n\nremained constant or continued to grow.\n\n              Despite the fact that SG was relatively candid in\n\npointing out the fragile structure of the venture, its argument\n\nlacks force.             Even if we assume, for argument's sake, that\n\nmisrepresentations of fact and badges of fraud are necessary for\n\nthe existence of a Ponzi or pyramid scheme, the SEC's complaint\n\ncontains allegations sufficient, as a matter of pleading, to\n\nestablish both elements.               First, the complaint alleges that SG\n\nmaterially         misrepresented          the    nature     of      the    enterprise    by\n\nconcealing         the    fact    that      the     supply      of    new    participants\n\ninevitably would be exhausted, causing the scheme to implode and\n\n\n       4\n     SG specifically addressed this issue on its website,\ndeclaring that: \"New players: that is the only source of all\nfinancial income to any game. It does not and cannot have other\nsources of income. Otherwise, the game becomes unprofitable and\ntherefore simply pointless.\"\n\n                                             -25-\n\fall existing participants to lose their money.5                  Second, the\n\nSEC's complaint plausibly characterized SG's flat guarantee of\n\na 10% monthly return on the privileged company's shares and its\n\nassurances    that   it    would    support   those    shares    as   material\n\nmisrepresentations of fact.           Third, the SEC alleged that SG\n\ndeceived participants by failing to disclose its intent to keep\n\ninvestor money for itself.\n\n            Of course, given its \"this was only a game\" defense,\n\nSG may well have colorable arguments anent materiality and\n\nreliance (i.e., that, based upon its explicit disclosures, no\n\nreasonable investor should have been deceived or misled).                  But\n\nit is not this court's place to resolve such fact-sensitive\n\nquestions    in   the     context    of   a   Rule    12(b)(6)   motion    for\n\ndismissal.     See Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 21-22 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).      For present purposes, it is enough that the SEC's\n\n\n\n\n    5As the SEC points out, SG specifically represented on its\nwebsite that SG was not a pyramid scheme that would \"collapse\ninevitably as soon as the inflow of new players stops.\" It went\non to state:\n          This is not a pyramid. The similarities are\n          purely superficial here. A whale might look\n          like a fish, but there are millions of years\n          of evolution between the two.      The main\n          fundamental difference is the lack of\n          critical points in time, namely those of\n          mass payments.   By manipulating profit, an\n          optimal way of spreading them in time is\n          successfully found.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fallegations,     taken   as     true,   satisfy   the    common     enterprise\n\ncomponent of the Howey test.6\n\nC.    Expectation of Profits Solely From the Efforts of Others.\n\n           The final component of the Howey test — the expectation\n\nof   profits    solely   from    the    efforts   of   others   —   is   itself\n\ndivisible.      We address each sub-element separately.\n\n           1.     Expectation of Profits.          The Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized an expectation of profits in two situations, namely,\n\n(1) capital appreciation from the original investment, and (2)\n\nparticipation in earnings resulting from the use of investors'\n\nfunds.    Forman, 421 U.S. at 852.            These situations are to be\n\ncontrasted with transactions in which an individual purchases a\n\ncommodity for personal use or consumption.              Id. at 858.      The SEC\n\nposits that SG's guarantees created a reasonable expectancy of\n\nprofit from investments in the privileged company, whereas SG\n\nmaintains that participants paid money not to make money, but,\n\n\n      6\n     If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — SG's\npromise to divert a portion of profits from website operations\nto support share prices if the need arose also warrants a\nfinding of horizontal commonality. Through this arrangement, SG\nprovided participants with the opportunity to share income\nderived from website operations on a pro rata basis. The SEC's\ncomplaint notes these facts and alleges in substance that a\npercentage of participants' funds were pooled; that participants\nwere told of their entitlement to support from this monetary\npool; and that they collectively stood to gain or lose\n(depending on whether they received the guaranteed return on\ntheir shares). In and of themselves, these averred facts boost\nthe SEC across the legal threshold for horizontal commonality.\n\n                                       -27-\n\frather,    to    acquire   an    entertainment      commodity   for    personal\n\nconsumption.         Relying heavily on         Forman, the district court\n\naccepted SG's thesis.           SEC v. SG Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 2d at 130-\n\n31.     We do not agree.\n\n               In Forman, apartment dwellers who desired to reside in\n\na New York City cooperative were required to buy shares of stock\n\nin the nonprofit cooperative housing corporation that owned and\n\noperated       the   complex.         Based    on   its   determination      that\n\n\"investors were attracted solely by the prospect of acquiring a\n\nplace     to    live,   and     not    by     financial   returns     on    their\n\ninvestments,\" the Forman Court held that the cooperative housing\n\narrangement did not qualify as a security under either the\n\n\"stock\" or \"investment contract\" rubrics.                  Id. at 853.       The\n\nCourt's conclusion rested in large part upon an Information\n\nBulletin distributed to prospective residents which stressed the\n\nnonprofit nature of the cooperative housing endeavor.                      Id. at\n\n854 (emphasizing that \"[n]owhere does the Bulletin seek to\n\nattract investors by the prospect of profits resulting from the\n\nefforts of the promoters or third parties\").7\n\n\n      7\n      The Court reiterated this conclusion in dismissing the\npossibility that the co-op would lease commercial facilities,\nprofessional offices, parking spaces, and communal washing\nmachines.    Noting that the Information Bulletin made no\nreference to the prospect of any such income as a means of\noffsetting rental costs, the Court concluded \"that investors\nwere not attracted to Co-op City by the offer of these potential\n\n                                        -28-\n\f             We think it noteworthy that the Forman Court contrasted\n\nthe   case   before          it    with    Joiner.         In    that    case,      economic\n\ninducements made by promoters in conjunction with the assignment\n\nof oil well leases transformed the financial instrument under\n\nconsideration from a naked leasehold right to an investment\n\ncontract.     320 U.S. at 348.                 The Joiner Court found dispositive\n\nadvertising        literature         circulated          by    the     promoters      which\n\nemphasized     the      benefits          to    be     reaped   from    the     exploratory\n\ndrilling     of    a    test       well.         Id.    (\"Had   the     offer      mailed   by\n\ndefendants omitted the economic inducements of the proposed and\n\npromised exploration well, it would have been a quite different\n\nproposition.\").\n\n             The       way    in     which       these     cases       fit    together      is\n\ninstructive.           In     Forman,          the   apartment     was       the   principal\n\nattraction for prospective buyers, the purchase of shares was\n\nmerely incidental, and the combination of the two did not add up\n\nto an investment contract.                     421 U.S. at 853.          In Joiner, the\n\nprospect of exploratory drilling gave the investments \"most of\n\ntheir value and all of their lure,\" the leasehold interests\n\nthemselves were no more than an incidental consideration in the\n\ntransaction, and the combination of the two added up to an\n\ninvestment contract.                320 U.S. at 349.             This distinction is\n\n\nrental reductions.\"               Forman, 421 U.S. at 856.\n\n                                                -29-\n\fcrucial, see Forman, 421 U.S. at 853 n.18, and it furnishes the\n\nbeacon by which we must steer.\n\n             Seen in this light, SG's persistent representations of\n\nsubstantial pecuniary gains for privileged company shareholders\n\ndistinguish its StockGeneration website from the Information\n\nBulletin circulated to prospective purchasers in Forman.                                While\n\nSG's   use    of    gaming      language       is       roughly       analogous       to   the\n\ncooperative's emphasis on the nonprofit nature of the housing\n\nendeavor, SG made additional representations on its website that\n\nplayed   upon      greed      and    fueled    expectations            of    profit.       For\n\nexample, SG flatly guaranteed that investments in the shares of\n\nthe privileged company would be profitable, yielding monthly\n\nreturns of 10% and annual returns of 215%.                            In our view, these\n\nprofit-related guarantees constitute a not-very-subtle form of\n\neconomic     inducement,            closely    analogous         to     the    advertising\n\nrepresentations in Joiner.              In the same way that the prospect of\n\nprofitable discoveries induced investors to buy oil well leases,\n\nthe prospect of a sure-fire return lured participants to buy\n\nshares in the privileged company (or so it can be argued).\n\n             This is not to say that SG's gaming language and\n\nrepeated     disclaimers        are        irrelevant.           SG    has    a     plausible\n\nargument,     forcefully            advanced       by     able        counsel,      that    no\n\nparticipant        in   his    or    her    right       mind   should        have    expected\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\fguaranteed profits from purchases of privileged company shares.\n\nBut this argument, though plausible, is not inevitable.      In the\n\nend, it merely gives rise to an issue of fact (or, perhaps,\n\nmultiple issues of fact) regarding whether SG's representations\n\nsatisfy Howey's expectation-of-profit requirement.\n\n         2.    Solely from the Efforts of Others.    We turn now to\n\nthe question of whether the expected profits can be said to\n\nresult solely from the efforts of others.   The courts of appeals\n\nhave been unanimous in declining to give literal meaning to the\n\nword \"solely\" in this context, instead holding the requirement\n\nsatisfied as long as \"the efforts made by those other than the\n\ninvestor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential\n\nmanagerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the\n\nenterprise.\"    Turner Enters., 474 F.2d at 482; accord Rivanna\n\nTrawlers Unlimited v. Thompson Trawlers, Inc., 840 F.2d 236, 240\n\nn.4 (4th Cir. 1988) (adopting this holding and listing eight\n\nother circuits which have held to like effect).       This liberal\n\ninterpretation of the requirement seemingly comports with the\n\nSupreme Court's restatement of the Howey test.      See Forman, 421\n\nU.S. at 852 (explaining that \"the touchstone is the presence of\n\nan investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fexpectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or\n\nmanagerial efforts of others\").8\n\n            We need not reach the issue of whether a lesser degree\n\nof control by a promoter or third party suffices to give rise to\n\nan investment contract because SG's alleged scheme meets the\n\nliteral   definition     of   \"solely.\"          According    to   the   SEC's\n\nallegations,    SG   represented      to   its    customers    the   lack   of\n\ninvestor effort required to make guaranteed profits on purchases\n\nof the privileged company's shares, noting, for example, that\n\n\"playing with [the] privileged shares practically requires no\n\ntime at all.\"     SG was responsible for all the important efforts\n\nthat undergirded the 10% guaranteed monthly return.                As the sole\n\nproprietor of the StockGeneration website, SG enjoyed direct\n\noperational    control   over   all    aspects     of   the   virtual    stock\n\nexchange.     And SG's marketing efforts generated direct capital\n\ninvestment and commissions on the transactions (which it pledged\n\nto earmark to support the privileged company's shares).\n\n            SG's payment of referral bonuses to participants who\n\nintroduced new users to the website does not require a different\n\nresult.     Even if a participant chose not to refer others to the\n\nStockGeneration website, he or she still could expect, based on\n\n\n    8We caution, however, that the Forman Court explicitly\nreserved judgment on adoption of the Turner Enterprises\nformulation. See 421 U.S. at 852 n.16.\n\n                                   -32-\n\fSG's profit-related guarantees, to reap monthly profits from\n\nmere ownership of the privileged company's shares.                Accordingly,\n\nthe    SEC's   complaint    makes   out    a   triable    issue    on   whether\n\nparticipants expected to receive profits derived solely from the\n\nefforts of others.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.              Giving due weight to the\n\neconomic realities of the situation, we hold that the SEC has\n\nalleged a set of facts which, if proven, satisfy the three-part\n\nHowey test and support its assertion that the opportunity to\n\ninvest in the shares of the privileged company, described on\n\nSG's    website,    constituted     an    invitation     to   enter     into    an\n\ninvestment     contract    within   the    jurisdictional      reach     of    the\n\nfederal securities laws.        Accordingly, we reverse the order of\n\ndismissal and remand the case for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.        The preliminary injunction and asset freeze\n\nshall remain in force pending conclusion of the proceedings\n\nbelow.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f                APPENDIX A\n\nSecurities Act of 1933 § 2(a)(1), 15 U.S.C.\n§ 77b(a)(1):\n\n      The term \"security\" means any\n      note, stock, treasury stock,\n      security     future,      bond,\n      debenture,     evidence      of\n      indebtedness, certificate of\n      interest or participation in\n      any profit-sharing agreement,\n      collateral-trust certificate,\n      preorganization certificate or\n      subscription,     transferable\n      share, investment contract,\n      voting-trust     certificate,\n      certificate of deposit for a\n      security, fractional undivided\n      interest in oil, gas, or other\n      mineral rights, any put, call,\n      straddle, option, or privilege\n      on any security, certificate\n      of deposit, or group or index\n      of securities (including any\n      interest therein or based on\n      the value thereof), or any\n      put, call, straddle, option,\n      or privilege entered into on a\n      national securities exchange\n      relating to foreign currency,\n      or, in general, any interest\n      or instrument commonly known\n      as   a  \"security,\"    or   any\n      certificate of interest or\n      participation in, temporary or\n      interim    certificate     for,\n      receipt for, guarantee of, or\n      warrant or right to subscribe\n      to or purchase, any of the\n      foregoing.\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 § 3(a)(10),\n15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)\n\n\n\n                   -34-\n\fThe term \"security\" means any\nnote, stock, treasury stock,\nsecurity      future,       bond,\ndebenture,     certificate      of\ninterest or participation in\nany profit-sharing agreement\nor in any oil, gas, or other\nmineral royalty or lease, any\ncollateral-trust certificate,\npreorganization certificate or\nsubscription,       transferable\nshare, investment contract,\nvoting-trust        certificate,\ncertificate of deposit for a\nsecurity,    any     put,    call,\nstraddle, option, or privilege\non any security, certificate\nof deposit, or group or index\nof securities (including any\ninterest therein or based on\nthe value thereof), or any\nput, call, straddle, option,\nor privilege entered into on a\nnational securities exchange\nrelating to foreign currency,\nor in general, any instrument\ncommonly      known       as     a\n\"security\"; or any certificate\nof interest or participation\nin,   temporary      or   interim\ncertificate for, receipt for,\nor   warrant     or    right    to\nsubscribe to or purchase, any\nof the foregoing; but shall\nnot include currency or any\nnote, draft, bill of exchange,\nor banker's acceptance, which\nhas a maturity at the time of\nissuance of not exceeding nine\nmonths, exclusive of days of\ngrace, or any renewal thereof\nthe   maturity    of    which   is\nlikewise limited.\n\n\n\n\n              -35-\n\f",

These appeals — procedurally,\n\nthere are two, but for all practical purposes they may be\n\ntreated as one — require us to determine whether virtual shares\n\nin an enterprise existing only in cyberspace fall within the\n\npurview of the federal securities laws.                     SG Ltd., a Dominican\n\ncorporation, and its affiliate, SG Trading Ltd. (collectively,\n\n\"SG\" or \"defendants\"), asseverate that the virtual shares were\n\npart of a fantasy investment game created for the personal\n\nentertainment        of    Internet    users,       and   therefore,   that    those\n\nshares   do    not    implicate       the    federal      securities   laws.

SG placed no upper limit on the amount of funds that an\n\ninvestor could squirrel away in its virtual offerings.\n\n            The SEC's complaint focused on shares in a particular\n\nvirtual    enterprise    referred      to   by    SG   as     the    \"privileged\n\ncompany,\" and so do we.       SG advised potential purchasers to pay\n\n\"particular attention\" to shares in the privileged company and\n\nboasted that investing in those shares was a \"game without any\n\nrisk.\"     To this end, its website announced that the privileged\n\ncompany's     shares     would    unfailingly          appreciate,          boldly\n\nproclaiming that \"[t]he share price of [the privileged company]\n\nis   supported   by    the   owners   of    SG,   this   is    why    its    value\n\nconstantly rises; on average at a rate of 10% monthly (this is\n\napproximately 215% annually).\"              To add plausibility to this\n\nrepresentation and to allay anxiety about future pricing, SG\n\npublished prices of the privileged company's shares one month in\n\nadvance.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            While SG conceded that a decline in the share price was\n\ntheoretically possible, it assured prospective participants that\n\n\"under the rules governing the fall in prices, [the share price\n\nfor the privileged company] cannot fall by more than 5% in a\n\nround.\"    To bolster this claim, it vouchsafed that shares in the\n\nprivileged company were supported by several distinct revenue\n\nstreams.    According to SG's representations, capital inflow from\n\nnew participants provided liquidity for existing participants\n\nwho might choose to sell their virtual shareholdings.                As a\n\nbackstop, SG pledged to allocate an indeterminate portion of the\n\nprofits derived from its website operations to a special reserve\n\nfund designed to maintain the price of the privileged company's\n\nshares.     SG asserted that these profits emanated from four\n\nsources:     (1) the collection of a 1.5% commission on each\n\ntransaction conducted on its virtual stock exchange; (2) the\n\nbid-ask    spread   on   the   virtual   shares;   (3)    the   \"skillful\n\nmanipulation\" of the share prices of eight particular imaginary\n\ncompanies, not including the privileged company, listed on the\n\nvirtual stock exchange; and (4) SG's right to sell shares of\n\nthree     other   virtual   companies    (including      the    privileged\n\ncompany).    As a further hedge against adversity, SG alluded to\n\nthe availability of auxiliary stabilization funds which could be\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\ftapped to ensure the continued operation of its virtual stock\n\nexchange.\n\n            SG's     website         contained         lists        of    purported      \"big\n\nwinners,\" an Internet bulletin board featuring testimonials from\n\nsupposedly satisfied participants, and descriptions of incentive\n\nprograms    that    held       out    the    prospect          of    rewards       for   such\n\nactivities as the referral of new participants (e.g., SG's\n\nrepresentation that it would pay \"20, 25 or 30% of the referred\n\nplayer's    highest       of    the     first          three    payments\")         and    the\n\nestablishment of affiliate websites.\n\n            At least 800 United States domiciliaries, paying real\n\ncash, purchased virtual shares in the virtual companies listed\n\non the defendants' virtual stock exchange.                          In the fall of 1999,\n\nover $4,700,000 in participants' funds was deposited into a\n\nLatvian bank account in the name of SG Trading Ltd.                                      The\n\nfollowing spring, more than $2,700,000 was deposited in Estonian\n\nbank accounts standing in the names of SG Ltd. and SG Perfect\n\nLtd., respectively.\n\n            In     late    1999,       participants            began       to   experience\n\ndifficulties in redeeming their virtual shares.                             On March 20,\n\n2000, these difficulties crested; SG unilaterally suspended all\n\npending     requests      to     withdraw         funds        and       sharply    reduced\n\nparticipants'      account      balances          in    all    companies        except    the\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fprivileged company.       Two weeks later, SG peremptorily announced\n\na reverse stock split, which caused the share prices of all\n\ncompanies listed on the virtual stock exchange, including the\n\nprivileged company, to plummet to 1/10,000 of their previous\n\nvalues.     At about the same time, SG stopped responding to\n\nparticipant requests for the return of funds, yet continued to\n\nsolicit new participants through its website.\n\n            The   SEC    undertook       an    investigation      into    SG's\n\nactivities, which culminated in the filing of a civil action in\n\nfederal   district      court.     The     SEC's     complaint   alleged,    in\n\nsubstance, that SG's operations constituted a fraudulent scheme\n\nin violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the\n\nfederal securities laws.          See Securities Act of 1933 § 5(a),\n\n(c), 15 U.S.C. § 77e(a), (c) (offer, sale, or delivery of\n\nunregistered securities); id. § 17(a), 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a) (fraud\n\nin offer or sale of securities);              Securities Exchange Act of\n\n1934 § 10(b), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R.\n\n240.10b-5    (fraud     in    connection      with   purchase    or   sale   of\n\nsecurities).      The SEC sought injunctive relief, disgorgement,\n\nand civil penalties.\n\n            The district court entered a temporary restraining\n\norder   (subsequently        converted   to    a   preliminary   injunction)\n\nblocking SG's operation of the website pendente lite.                 The court\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\falso instituted an asset freeze that infrigidated approximately\n\n$5,500,000.      The SEC's success was short-lived; after some\n\nskirmishing, not relevant here, the district court granted SG's\n\nmotion    to   dismiss   the   complaint   for    failure   to   state    a\n\ncognizable claim on the ground that the virtual shares were a\n\nclearly marked and defined game lacking a business context.           See\n\nSEC v. SG Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 2d at 131.             The SEC immediately\n\nappealed, and we issued a stay keeping both the preliminary\n\ninjunction and the asset freeze in place for the time being.\n\n           These appeals hinge on whether the district court erred\n\nin ruling that transactions in the privileged company's shares\n\ndid not constitute transactions in securities.              In the pages\n\nthat follow, we explore the makeup of that particular type of\n\nsecurity known as an investment contract; examine the district\n\ncourt's    rationale;    and   apply    the    tripartite    \"investment\n\ncontract\" test to the facts as alleged.          Because the lower court\n\ndismissed the SEC's first amended complaint for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief might be granted, Fed. R. Civ.

The District Court's Rationale.\n\n            We pause at this juncture to address the district\n\ncourt's rationale.         Relying upon a dictum from Howey discussing\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f\"the many types of instruments that in our commercial world fall\n\nwithin the ordinary concept of a security,\" 328 U.S. at 299\n\n(quoting    legislative               history),       the    district     court    drew    a\n\ndistinction between what it termed \"commercial dealings\" and\n\nwhat it termed \"games.\"                SEC v. SG Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 2d at 131.\n\nCharacterizing purchases of the privileged company's shares as\n\na \"clearly marked and defined game,\" the court concluded that\n\nsince that activity was not part of the commercial world, it\n\nfell beyond the jurisdictional reach of the federal securities\n\nlaws.      Id.         In       so   ruling,     the    court      differentiated       SG's\n\noperations from a classic Ponzi or pyramid scheme on the ground\n\nthat    those    types          of    chicanery      involved      commercial     dealings\n\nwithin a business context.                 Id.\n\n            We    do        not      gainsay   the     obvious     correctness     of    the\n\ndistrict    court's             observation      that       investment    contracts      lie\n\nwithin the commercial world.                    Contrary to the district court's\n\nview, however, this locution does not translate into a dichotomy\n\nbetween business dealings, on the one hand, and games, on the\n\nother    hand,     as       a     failsafe     way     for    determining     whether      a\n\nparticular       financial           arrangement       should      (or   should   not)    be\n\ncharacterized as an investment contract.                             Howey remains the\n\ntouchstone       for    ascertaining           whether        an   investment     contract\n\nexists — and the test that it prescribes must be administered\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\fwithout regard to nomenclature.

William Shakespeare, Romeo & Juliet, act 2, sc.\n\n2 (circa 1597) (\"A rose by any other name would smell as\n\nsweet.\").    As long as the three-pronged Howey test is satisfied,\n\nthe instrument must be classified as an investment contract.\n\nHowey,   328   U.S.     at    301.     Once   that       has   occurred,     \"it   is\n\nimmaterial     whether       the   enterprise       is    speculative       or   non-\n\nspeculative or whether there is a sale of property with or\n\nwithout intrinsic value.\"            Id.   It is equally immaterial whether\n\nthe promoter depicts the enterprise as a serious commercial\n\nventure or dubs it a game.\n\n            A fairly recent Supreme Court opinion demonstrates that\n\nthe \"commercial world\" to which the Howey Court alluded actually\n\nencompasses     the     total      universe     of       financial       instruments\n\navailable to investors, rather than the subset of financial\n\ninstruments envisioned by the district court (i.e., \"commerce\"\n\nas opposed to \"games\").            In that case, Justice Marshall wrote:\n\n            In defining the scope of the market that it\n            wished to regulate, Congress painted with a\n            broad brush.   It recognized the virtually\n            limitless   scope   of   human    ingenuity,\n            especially in the creation of \"countless and\n            variable schemes devised by those who seek\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            the use of the money of others on the\n            promise of profits,\" and determined that the\n            best way to achieve its goal of protecting\n            investors   was   \"to   define   'the   term\n            \"security\" in sufficiently broad and general\n            terms   so  as   to   include  within   that\n            definition the many types of instruments\n            that in our commercial world fall within the\n            ordinary concept of a security.'\" Congress\n            therefore did not attempt precisely to cabin\n            the scope of the Securities Acts. Rather,\n            it enacted a definition of \"security\"\n            sufficiently broad to encompass virtually\n            any instrument that might be sold as an\n            investment.\n\nReves v.

This expansive language, coupled with Congress's\n\nsweeping definitions of \"security,\" persuade us to reject the\n\ndistrict court's use of Howey's \"commercial world\" reference as\n\na limiting principle.\n\n            To sum up, Howey supplies the appropriate template for\n\nidentifying investment contracts within the overarching ambit of\n\nthe federal securities laws.     Contrary to the district court's\n\nconclusion, this template admits of no exception for games or\n\ngaming.     Thus, the language on SG's website emphasizing the\n\ngame-like nature of buying and selling virtual shares of the\n\nprivileged company does not place such transactions beyond the\n\nlong reach of the federal securities laws.\n\nIII.   ADMINISTERING THE TRIPARTITE TEST\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f           What remains is to analyze whether purchases of the\n\nprivileged company's shares constitute investment contracts. We\n\nturn to that task, taking the three Howey criteria in sequence.\n\n\n\n\n                     A.   Investment of Money.\n\n           The first component of the Howey test focuses on the\n\ninvestment of money.      The determining factor is whether an\n\ninvestor \"chose to give up a specific consideration in return\n\nfor a separable financial interest with the characteristics of\n\na security.\"    Daniel, 439 U.S. at 559.       We conclude that the\n\nSEC's   complaint   sufficiently   alleges   the   existence   of   this\n\nfactor.\n\n           To be sure, SG disputes the point.      It argues that the\n\nindividuals who purchased shares in the privileged company were\n\nnot so much investing money in return for rights in the virtual\n\nshares as paying for an entertainment commodity (the opportunity\n\nto play the StockGeneration game).     This argument suggests that\n\nan interesting factual issue may await resolution — whether\n\nparticipants were motivated primarily by a perceived investment\n\nopportunity or by the visceral excitement of playing a game.\n\nNevertheless, this case comes to us following a dismissal under\n\nRule 12(b)(6), and the SEC's complaint memorializes, inter alia,\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fSG's representation that participants could \"firmly expect a 10%\n\nprofit monthly\" on purchases of the privileged company's shares.\n\nThat representation plainly supports the SEC's legal claim that\n\nparticipants     who   invested    substantial    amounts   of      money   in\n\nexchange for virtual shares in the privileged company likely did\n\nso in anticipation of investment gains.           Given the procedural\n\nposture of the case, no more is exigible to fulfill the first\n\npart of the Howey test.\n\n                         B.    Common Enterprise.\n\n          The second component of the Howey test involves the\n\nexistence of a common enterprise.           Before diving headlong into\n\nthe sea of facts, we must dispel the miasma that surrounds the\n\nappropriate legal standard.\n\n          1.     The Legal Standard.        Courts are in some disarray\n\nas to the legal rules associated with the ascertainment of a\n\ncommon enterprise.       See generally II Louis Loss & Joel Seligman,\n\nSecurities Regulation 989-97 (3d ed. rev. 1999).                Many courts\n\nrequire   a    showing    of   horizontal    commonality    —   a   type    of\n\ncommonality that involves the pooling of assets from multiple\n\ninvestors so that all share in the profits and risks of the\n\nenterprise.

To complicate matters further, four\n\ncourts of appeals have accepted horizontal commonality, but have\n\nnot yet ruled on whether they also will accept some form of\n\nvertical commonality.    See Infinity Group, 212 F.3d at 187 n.8;\n\nLife Partners, 87 F.3d at 544;             Teague, 35 F.3d at 986 n.8;\n\nRevak, 18 F.3d at 88.

We came close\n\nin Rodriguez, in which we hinted at a preference for horizontal\n\ncommonality.

See id.\n\n           The case at bar requires us to take a position on the\n\ncommon enterprise component of the Howey test.         We hold that a\n\nshowing of horizontal commonality — the pooling of assets from\n\nmultiple investors in such a manner that all share in the\n\nprofits and risks of the enterprise — satisfies the test.            This\n\nholding flows naturally from the facts of Howey, in which the\n\npromoter   commingled   fruit   from     the   investors'   groves    and\n\nallocated net profits based upon the production from each tract.\n\nSee Howey, 328 U.S. at 296.       Adopting this rule also aligns us\n\nwith the majority view and confirms the intimation of Rodriguez.\n\nLast, but surely not least, the horizontal commonality standard\n\nplaces easily ascertainable and predictable limits on the types\n\nof financial instruments that will qualify as securities.2\n\n           2.   Applying the Standard.     Here, the pooling element\n\nof horizontal commonality jumps off the screen.        The defendants'\n\nwebsite stated that:    \"The players' money is accumulated on the\n\n\n    2 Since the complaint in this case alleges facts sufficient\nto establish horizontal commonality, see infra Part III(B)(2),\nwe take no view as to whether vertical commonality, in either of\nits iterations, also may suffice to satisfy the \"common\nenterprise\" requirement.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fSG current account and is not invested anywhere, because no\n\ninvestment, not even the most profitable one, could possibly\n\nfully     compensate       for      the     lack    of     sufficiency      in    settling\n\naccounts      with      players,      which       lack   would     otherwise      be   more\n\nlikely.\"          Thus,        as     the        SEC's   complaint        suggests,      SG\n\nunambiguously represented to its clientele that participants'\n\nfunds     were        pooled    in     a    single       account     used    to     settle\n\nparticipants'          on-line       transactions.           Therefore,      pooling     is\n\nestablished.\n\n              Of course, horizontal commonality requires more than\n\npooling alone; it also requires that investors share in the\n\nprofits and risks of the enterprise.                     The SEC maintains that two\n\nseparate      elements         of   SG's    operations       embody    the       necessary\n\nsharing.       First, it asserts that SG was running a Ponzi or\n\npyramid scheme dependent upon a continuous influx of new money\n\nto   remain      in    operation,3         and    argues    that   such     arrangements\n\n\n      3\n      While the terms \"Ponzi\" and \"pyramid\" often are used\ninterchangeably to describe financial arrangements which rob\nPeter to pay Paul, the two differ slightly. In Ponzi schemes —\nnamed after a notorious Boston swindler, Charles Ponzi, who\nparlayed an initial stake of $150 into a fortune by means of an\nelaborate scheme featuring promissory notes yielding interest at\nannual rates of up to 50% — money tendered by later investors is\nused to pay off earlier investors. In contrast, pyramid schemes\nincorporate   a   recruiting   element;   they   are   marketing\narrangements in which participants are rewarded financially\nbased upon their ability to induce others to participate. The\nSEC alleges that SG's operations aptly can be characterized\nunder either appellation.\n\n                                             -20-\n\finherently       involve    the    sharing     of    profit    and    risk    among\n\ninvestors.       Second, the SEC construes SG's promise to divert a\n\nportion of its profits from website operations to support the\n\nprivileged company's shares as a bond that ties together the\n\ncollective fortunes of those who have purchased the shares.\n\nWhile we analyze each of these theories, we note that any one of\n\nthem suffices to support a finding of commonality.\n\n            We endorse the SEC's suggestion that Ponzi schemes\n\ntypically    satisfy       the    horizontal     commonality    standard.        In\n\nInfinity Group, investors contributed substantial sums of money\n\nto   a   trust    established      by   the    defendants     and    received    in\n\nexchange a property transfer agreement guaranteeing stupendous\n\nannual rates of return.              212 F.3d at 184-85.             The economic\n\nguarantees were based upon the trust's purported performance\n\nexperience, financial connections, and ability to pool large\n\namounts of money.       Id. at 185.        Participants were promised that\n\ninvesting in the trust was a risk-free proposition, and that\n\ntheir cash infusions would be repaid in full upon demand.                       Id.\n\nat 184-85.       Expected profits were a function of the number of\n\n\"capital units\" held pursuant to the contract with the trust; in\n\nturn, the number of capital units allocated to each investor was\n\ndirectly proportional to the size of his or her investment.                     Id.\n\nat   188-89.       On   these     facts,   the      Third   Circuit    held    that\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fhorizontal       commonality    existed,        emphasizing       that    under   the\n\nplan's terms each investor was entitled to receive returns\n\ndirectly proportionate to his or her investment stake.                       Id. at\n\n188.\n\n            SG's virtual shares bear striking factual similarities\n\nto the financial instruments classified as investment contracts\n\nin Infinity Group.         SG's flat 10% guaranteed return applied to\n\nall privileged company shares, expected returns were dependent\n\nupon the number of shares held, the economic assurances were\n\nbased on the promoter's ability to keep the ball rolling, the\n\ninvestment was proclaimed to be free from risk, and participants\n\nwere promised that their principal would be repaid in full upon\n\ndemand.     Like the Third Circuit, we think that these facts\n\nsuffice to make out horizontal commonality.\n\n            In all events, SG's promise to pay referral fees to\n\nexisting    participants        who   induced     others     to    patronize      the\n\nvirtual    exchange       provides    an   alternative       basis   for     finding\n\nhorizontal commonality.          The SEC argues convincingly that this\n\nshows the existence of a pyramid scheme sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe    horizontal       commonality    standard.       The    most       instructive\n\ncomparison is to SEC v. Int'l Loan Network, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586802\"><a href=\"/opinion/586802/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-international-loan-network-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\n\nCir.    1992).      A    key   element     of   the   defendants'         elaborate,\n\nmultifaceted, financial distribution network in that case was a\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fpyramid sales program in which participants stood to receive 50%\n\ncommissions on membership fees paid by individuals whom they\n\nrecruited, plus lesser commissions on sales by those recruited\n\nby their recruits.         Id. at 1306.      The court of appeals ruled\n\nthat this structure satisfied the requirements of horizontal\n\ncommonality.       Id. at 1308.     In the process, it relied heavily\n\nupon the fact that the network generated income only through\n\nconstant expansion of membership, which depended on individual\n\nrecruiting and the appeal of the promoter's larger marketing\n\ncampaign.    Id.\n\n            Like     the    investors      in     Int'l     Loan     Network,\n\nStockGeneration participants who recruited new participants were\n\npromised    bonuses    worth     20%-30%   of    the    recruit's   payments.\n\nTaking as true the SEC's plausible allegation that the sine qua\n\nnon of SG's operations was the continued net inflow of funds,\n\nthe investment pool supporting the referral bonus payments was\n\nentirely dependent upon the infusion of fresh capital.                  Since\n\nall participants shared in the profits and risks under this\n\npyramidal    structure,     it   furnishes      the    sharing   necessary   to\n\nwarrant a finding of horizontal commonality.\n\n            We will not paint the lily.                We conclude, without\n\nserious question, that the arrangement described in the SEC's\n\ncomplaint fairly can be characterized as either a Ponzi or\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fpyramid scheme, and that it provides the requisite profit-and-\n\nrisk sharing to support a finding of horizontal commonality.\n\nTaking as true the SEC's allegation that SG's ability to fulfill\n\nits pecuniary guarantees was fully predicated upon the net\n\ninflow of new money, the fortunes of the participants were\n\ninextricably intertwined.            As long as the privileged company\n\ncontinued     to     receive    net        capital    infusions,      existing\n\nshareholders could dip into the well of funds to draw out their\n\nprofits or collect their commissions.                But all of them shared\n\nthe risk that new participants would not emerge, cash flow would\n\ndry up, and the underlying pool would empty.\n\n            SG's most perfervid argument against a finding of\n\nhorizontal commonality consists of a denial that its operations\n\ncomprise a Ponzi or pyramid scheme.                  It says that any such\n\nscheme requires a material misrepresentation of fact and some\n\nelement of fraud or deception, and adds that those additional\n\nfeatures    are    lacking   here;    to     the   contrary,   the   rules    of\n\nStockGeneration      were    fully   and     accurately   disclosed    to    all\n\nparticipants.      We do not gainsay that considerable disclosure\n\noccurred.    SG emphasized that new participants constituted the\n\nsole source of all financial income for its StockGeneration\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fwebsite.4      Indeed, in describing the structure and mechanism of\n\nits virtual stock exchange, SG drew a colorful analogy between\n\nthe privileged company's shares and an enormous card table with\n\na mountain of money.             According to SG, thousands of participants\n\ncontinuously threw money onto the table by purchasing shares in\n\nthe privileged company, while other participants simultaneously\n\nsold       their   shares      back    to    the    exchange         to    retrieve    their\n\nwinnings from the table.                   SG remarked that the system would\n\nremain      stable       so   long    as    the    size    of   the       mountain    either\n\nremained constant or continued to grow.\n\n              Despite the fact that SG was relatively candid in\n\npointing out the fragile structure of the venture, its argument\n\nlacks force.             Even if we assume, for argument's sake, that\n\nmisrepresentations of fact and badges of fraud are necessary for\n\nthe existence of a Ponzi or pyramid scheme, the SEC's complaint\n\ncontains allegations sufficient, as a matter of pleading, to\n\nestablish both elements.               First, the complaint alleges that SG\n\nmaterially         misrepresented          the    nature     of      the    enterprise    by\n\nconcealing         the    fact    that      the     supply      of    new    participants\n\ninevitably would be exhausted, causing the scheme to implode and\n\n\n       4\n     SG specifically addressed this issue on its website,\ndeclaring that: \"New players: that is the only source of all\nfinancial income to any game. It does not and cannot have other\nsources of income. Otherwise, the game becomes unprofitable and\ntherefore simply pointless.\"\n\n                                             -25-\n\fall existing participants to lose their money.5                  Second, the\n\nSEC's complaint plausibly characterized SG's flat guarantee of\n\na 10% monthly return on the privileged company's shares and its\n\nassurances    that   it    would    support   those    shares    as   material\n\nmisrepresentations of fact.           Third, the SEC alleged that SG\n\ndeceived participants by failing to disclose its intent to keep\n\ninvestor money for itself.\n\n            Of course, given its \"this was only a game\" defense,\n\nSG may well have colorable arguments anent materiality and\n\nreliance (i.e., that, based upon its explicit disclosures, no\n\nreasonable investor should have been deceived or misled).                  But\n\nit is not this court's place to resolve such fact-sensitive\n\nquestions    in   the     context    of   a   Rule    12(b)(6)   motion    for\n\ndismissal.     See Cruz v. Melecio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198832\"><a href=\"/opinion/198832/oscar-cruz-v-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).      For present purposes, it is enough that the SEC's\n\n\n\n\n    5As the SEC points out, SG specifically represented on its\nwebsite that SG was not a pyramid scheme that would \"collapse\ninevitably as soon as the inflow of new players stops.\" It went\non to state:\n          This is not a pyramid. The similarities are\n          purely superficial here. A whale might look\n          like a fish, but there are millions of years\n          of evolution between the two.      The main\n          fundamental difference is the lack of\n          critical points in time, namely those of\n          mass payments.   By manipulating profit, an\n          optimal way of spreading them in time is\n          successfully found.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fallegations,     taken   as     true,   satisfy   the    common     enterprise\n\ncomponent of the Howey test.6\n\nC.    Expectation of Profits Solely From the Efforts of Others.\n\n           The final component of the Howey test — the expectation\n\nof   profits    solely   from    the    efforts   of   others   —   is   itself\n\ndivisible.      We address each sub-element separately.\n\n           1.     Expectation of Profits.          The Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized an expectation of profits in two situations, namely,\n\n(1) capital appreciation from the original investment, and (2)\n\nparticipation in earnings resulting from the use of investors'\n\nfunds.    Forman, 421 U.S. at 852.            These situations are to be\n\ncontrasted with transactions in which an individual purchases a\n\ncommodity for personal use or consumption.              Id. at 858.      The SEC\n\nposits that SG's guarantees created a reasonable expectancy of\n\nprofit from investments in the privileged company, whereas SG\n\nmaintains that participants paid money not to make money, but,\n\n\n      6\n     If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — SG's\npromise to divert a portion of profits from website operations\nto support share prices if the need arose also warrants a\nfinding of horizontal commonality. Through this arrangement, SG\nprovided participants with the opportunity to share income\nderived from website operations on a pro rata basis. The SEC's\ncomplaint notes these facts and alleges in substance that a\npercentage of participants' funds were pooled; that participants\nwere told of their entitlement to support from this monetary\npool; and that they collectively stood to gain or lose\n(depending on whether they received the guaranteed return on\ntheir shares). In and of themselves, these averred facts boost\nthe SEC across the legal threshold for horizontal commonality.\n\n                                       -27-\n\frather,    to    acquire   an    entertainment      commodity   for    personal\n\nconsumption.         Relying heavily on         Forman, the district court\n\naccepted SG's thesis.           SEC v. SG Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 2d at 130-\n\n31.     We do not agree.\n\n               In Forman, apartment dwellers who desired to reside in\n\na New York City cooperative were required to buy shares of stock\n\nin the nonprofit cooperative housing corporation that owned and\n\noperated       the   complex.         Based    on   its   determination      that\n\n\"investors were attracted solely by the prospect of acquiring a\n\nplace     to    live,   and     not    by     financial   returns     on    their\n\ninvestments,\" the Forman Court held that the cooperative housing\n\narrangement did not qualify as a security under either the\n\n\"stock\" or \"investment contract\" rubrics.                  Id. at 853.       The\n\nCourt's conclusion rested in large part upon an Information\n\nBulletin distributed to prospective residents which stressed the\n\nnonprofit nature of the cooperative housing endeavor.                      Id. at\n\n854 (emphasizing that \"[n]owhere does the Bulletin seek to\n\nattract investors by the prospect of profits resulting from the\n\nefforts of the promoters or third parties\").7\n\n\n      7\n      The Court reiterated this conclusion in dismissing the\npossibility that the co-op would lease commercial facilities,\nprofessional offices, parking spaces, and communal washing\nmachines.    Noting that the Information Bulletin made no\nreference to the prospect of any such income as a means of\noffsetting rental costs, the Court concluded \"that investors\nwere not attracted to Co-op City by the offer of these potential\n\n                                        -28-\n\f             We think it noteworthy that the Forman Court contrasted\n\nthe   case   before          it    with    Joiner.         In    that    case,      economic\n\ninducements made by promoters in conjunction with the assignment\n\nof oil well leases transformed the financial instrument under\n\nconsideration from a naked leasehold right to an investment\n\ncontract.     320 U.S. at 348.                 The Joiner Court found dispositive\n\nadvertising        literature         circulated          by    the     promoters      which\n\nemphasized     the      benefits          to    be     reaped   from    the     exploratory\n\ndrilling     of    a    test       well.         Id.    (\"Had   the     offer      mailed   by\n\ndefendants omitted the economic inducements of the proposed and\n\npromised exploration well, it would have been a quite different\n\nproposition.\").\n\n             The       way    in     which       these     cases       fit    together      is\n\ninstructive.           In     Forman,          the   apartment     was       the   principal\n\nattraction for prospective buyers, the purchase of shares was\n\nmerely incidental, and the combination of the two did not add up\n\nto an investment contract.                     421 U.S. at 853.          In Joiner, the\n\nprospect of exploratory drilling gave the investments \"most of\n\ntheir value and all of their lure,\" the leasehold interests\n\nthemselves were no more than an incidental consideration in the\n\ntransaction, and the combination of the two added up to an\n\ninvestment contract.                320 U.S. at 349.             This distinction is\n\n\nrental reductions.\"               Forman, 421 U.S. at 856.\n\n                                                -29-\n\fcrucial, see Forman, 421 U.S. at 853 n.18, and it furnishes the\n\nbeacon by which we must steer.\n\n             Seen in this light, SG's persistent representations of\n\nsubstantial pecuniary gains for privileged company shareholders\n\ndistinguish its StockGeneration website from the Information\n\nBulletin circulated to prospective purchasers in Forman.                                While\n\nSG's   use    of    gaming      language       is       roughly       analogous       to   the\n\ncooperative's emphasis on the nonprofit nature of the housing\n\nendeavor, SG made additional representations on its website that\n\nplayed   upon      greed      and    fueled    expectations            of    profit.       For\n\nexample, SG flatly guaranteed that investments in the shares of\n\nthe privileged company would be profitable, yielding monthly\n\nreturns of 10% and annual returns of 215%.                            In our view, these\n\nprofit-related guarantees constitute a not-very-subtle form of\n\neconomic     inducement,            closely    analogous         to     the    advertising\n\nrepresentations in Joiner.              In the same way that the prospect of\n\nprofitable discoveries induced investors to buy oil well leases,\n\nthe prospect of a sure-fire return lured participants to buy\n\nshares in the privileged company (or so it can be argued).\n\n             This is not to say that SG's gaming language and\n\nrepeated     disclaimers        are        irrelevant.           SG    has    a     plausible\n\nargument,     forcefully            advanced       by     able        counsel,      that    no\n\nparticipant        in   his    or    her    right       mind   should        have    expected\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\fguaranteed profits from purchases of privileged company shares.\n\nBut this argument, though plausible, is not inevitable.      In the\n\nend, it merely gives rise to an issue of fact (or, perhaps,\n\nmultiple issues of fact) regarding whether SG's representations\n\nsatisfy Howey's expectation-of-profit requirement.\n\n         2.    Solely from the Efforts of Others.    We turn now to\n\nthe question of whether the expected profits can be said to\n\nresult solely from the efforts of others.   The courts of appeals\n\nhave been unanimous in declining to give literal meaning to the\n\nword \"solely\" in this context, instead holding the requirement\n\nsatisfied as long as \"the efforts made by those other than the\n\ninvestor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential\n\nmanagerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the\n\nenterprise.\"    Turner Enters., 474 F.2d at 482; accord Rivanna\n\nTrawlers Unlimited v. Thompson Trawlers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502274\"><a href=\"/opinion/502274/rivanna-trawlers-unlimited-a-virginia-general-partnership-bruce-h-cabell/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240\n\nn.4 (4th Cir. 1988) (adopting this holding and listing eight\n\nother circuits which have held to like effect).       This liberal\n\ninterpretation of the requirement seemingly comports with the\n\nSupreme Court's restatement of the Howey test.      See Forman, 421\n\nU.S. at 852 (explaining that \"the touchstone is the presence of\n\nan investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fexpectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or\n\nmanagerial efforts of others\").8\n\n            We need not reach the issue of whether a lesser degree\n\nof control by a promoter or third party suffices to give rise to\n\nan investment contract because SG's alleged scheme meets the\n\nliteral   definition     of   \"solely.\"          According    to   the   SEC's\n\nallegations,    SG   represented      to   its    customers    the   lack   of\n\ninvestor effort required to make guaranteed profits on purchases\n\nof the privileged company's shares, noting, for example, that\n\n\"playing with [the] privileged shares practically requires no\n\ntime at all.\"     SG was responsible for all the important efforts\n\nthat undergirded the 10% guaranteed monthly return.                As the sole\n\nproprietor of the StockGeneration website, SG enjoyed direct\n\noperational    control   over   all    aspects     of   the   virtual    stock\n\nexchange.     And SG's marketing efforts generated direct capital\n\ninvestment and commissions on the transactions (which it pledged\n\nto earmark to support the privileged company's shares).\n\n            SG's payment of referral bonuses to participants who\n\nintroduced new users to the website does not require a different\n\nresult.     Even if a participant chose not to refer others to the\n\nStockGeneration website, he or she still could expect, based on\n\n\n    8We caution, however, that the Forman Court explicitly\nreserved judgment on adoption of the Turner Enterprises\nformulation. See 421 U.S. at 852 n.16.\n\n                                   -32-\n\fSG's profit-related guarantees, to reap monthly profits from\n\nmere ownership of the privileged company's shares.                Accordingly,\n\nthe    SEC's   complaint    makes   out    a   triable    issue    on   whether\n\nparticipants expected to receive profits derived solely from the\n\nefforts of others.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.              Giving due weight to the\n\neconomic realities of the situation, we hold that the SEC has\n\nalleged a set of facts which, if proven, satisfy the three-part\n\nHowey test and support its assertion that the opportunity to\n\ninvest in the shares of the privileged company, described on\n\nSG's    website,    constituted     an    invitation     to   enter     into    an\n\ninvestment     contract    within   the    jurisdictional      reach     of    the\n\nfederal securities laws.        Accordingly, we reverse the order of\n\ndismissal and remand the case for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.        The preliminary injunction and asset freeze\n\nshall remain in force pending conclusion of the proceedings\n\nbelow.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f                APPENDIX A\n\nSecurities Act of 1933 § 2(a)(1), 15 U.S.C.\n§ 77b(a)(1):\n\n      The term \"security\" means any\n      note, stock, treasury stock,\n      security     future,      bond,\n      debenture,     evidence      of\n      indebtedness, certificate of\n      interest or participation in\n      any profit-sharing agreement,\n      collateral-trust certificate,\n      preorganization certificate or\n      subscription,     transferable\n      share, investment contract,\n      voting-trust     certificate,\n      certificate of deposit for a\n      security, fractional undivided\n      interest in oil, gas, or other\n      mineral rights, any put, call,\n      straddle, option, or privilege\n      on any security, certificate\n      of deposit, or group or index\n      of securities (including any\n      interest therein or based on\n      the value thereof), or any\n      put, call, straddle, option,\n      or privilege entered into on a\n      national securities exchange\n      relating to foreign currency,\n      or, in general, any interest\n      or instrument commonly known\n      as   a  \"security,\"    or   any\n      certificate of interest or\n      participation in, temporary or\n      interim    certificate     for,\n      receipt for, guarantee of, or\n      warrant or right to subscribe\n      to or purchase, any of the\n      foregoing.\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 § 3(a)(10),\n15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)\n\n\n\n                   -34-\n\fThe term \"security\" means any\nnote, stock, treasury stock,\nsecurity      future,       bond,\ndebenture,     certificate      of\ninterest or participation in\nany profit-sharing agreement\nor in any oil, gas, or other\nmineral royalty or lease, any\ncollateral-trust certificate,\npreorganization certificate or\nsubscription,       transferable\nshare, investment contract,\nvoting-trust        certificate,\ncertificate of deposit for a\nsecurity,    any     put,    call,\nstraddle, option, or privilege\non any security, certificate\nof deposit, or group or index\nof securities (including any\ninterest therein or based on\nthe value thereof), or any\nput, call, straddle, option,\nor privilege entered into on a\nnational securities exchange\nrelating to foreign currency,\nor in general, any instrument\ncommonly      known       as     a\n\"security\"; or any certificate\nof interest or participation\nin,   temporary      or   interim\ncertificate for, receipt for,\nor   warrant     or    right    to\nsubscribe to or purchase, any\nof the foregoing; but shall\nnot include currency or any\nnote, draft, bill of exchange,\nor banker's acceptance, which\nhas a maturity at the time of\nissuance of not exceeding nine\nmonths, exclusive of days of\ngrace, or any renewal thereof\nthe   maturity    of    which   is\nlikewise limited.\n\n\n\n\n              -35-\n\f</pre>",
