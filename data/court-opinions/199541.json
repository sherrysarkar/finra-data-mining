This is an appeal from a\n\ndistrict court decision granting a petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in the context of a removal order issued by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals.        We affirm the district court, though on\n\nalternate grounds.\n\n            John Brian Attwood is a native and citizen of Canada\n\nwho was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent\n\nresident on January 16, 1963.          On May 24, 1995, Attwood pled\n\nguilty to trafficking in cocaine, and was sentenced to a term of\n\nimprisonment of five to seven years (ultimately he served only\n\nfour   years    and   eleven     months).     On   April       18,    1996,   the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service issued, signed, and dated\n\nan Order to Show Cause charging Attwood with deportability under\n\nsections     241(a)(2)(A)(iii)        and     241(a)(2)(B)(i)           of    the\n\nImmigration         and    Naturalization       Act,       8         U.S.C.   §§\n\n1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 1251(a)(2)(B)(i) (1994), as an alien\n\nconvicted      of   both   an   aggravated    felony   and      a     controlled\n\nsubstance violation.            The OSC, however, was not served on\n\nAttwood until June 6, 1996, and was filed with the immigration\n\ncourt on July 8, 1996.\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f         Attwood   conceded    proper   service   of   the   OSC   and\n\ndeportability before the immigration judge, but requested leave\n\nto file for relief in the form of a discretionary waiver under\n\nformer § 212(c) of the INA.1    The immigration judge denied his\n\nrequest for leave to file for § 212(c) relief, holding that his\n\nconsideration for such relief was precluded under § 440(d) of\n\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,2 and on June\n\n18, 1997, ordered Attwood deported.        Attwood appealed this\n\ndecision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and on May 19,\n\n1998, the BIA denied Attwood's appeal.\n\n         Attwood then filed a petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in federal district court, challenging the denial of his\n\n\n    1     Section 212(c) of the INA (as it existed before April\n24, 1996, as codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994)), \"although\nexplicitly directed at certain excludable aliens not yet\nadmitted, had been read to give the Attorney General\ndiscretionary authority to waive deportation for aliens already\nwithin the United States who were deportable for having\ncommitted   aggravated   felonies   or   controlled   substance\nviolations.\"   Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 281 (1st Cir.\n1999). Such waiver was precluded for aggravated felons who had\nserved five years or more in jail. Id. (citing Immigration Act\nof 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 511(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5052).\n    2     Enacted on April 24, 1996, § 440(d) of AEDPA revised\n§ 212(c) of the INA to eliminate the availability of waiver for\naliens convicted of most drug offenses, regardless of the amount\nof time served. See Wallace, 194 F.3d at 281.\n\n                                -4-\n\frequest   for   consideration   for    §   212(c)   relief   on   several\n\ngrounds. First, Attwood contended that since the INS had issued\n\n(and signed) the OSC on April 18, 1996, he was in deportation\n\nproceedings prior to the enactment of AEDPA § 440(d), and\n\ntherefore its limitations on waiver are inapplicable to his\n\ncase. See Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 286-87 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(considering a case where the OSC was served but not filed prior\n\nto AEPDA's enactment and finding that § 440(d) did not affect\n\nthe statutory entitlement to consideration for § 212(c) waiver\n\nin such a case because deportation proceedings had already begun\n\nprior to its enactment).     Attwood also argued that retroactive\n\napplication of AEDPA § 440(d) in his case, where he pled guilty\n\nto the crime before AEDPA's enactment, would violate principles\n\nof providing fair notice and protecting reasonable expectations\n\nand reliance interests.     Finally, Attwood said that the refusal\n\nto afford him consideration for § 212(c) relief violated equal\n\nprotection and due process.\n\n          The    district   court     granted   Attwood's     petition.\n\nExtending the reasoning of Wallace, the district court concluded\n\nthat deportation proceedings against Attwood fairly began on the\n\ndate the OSC was issued by the INS (April 18, 1996), not the\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdate that he was served (June 6, 1996).              This determination\n\nplaced the initiation of deportation proceedings against Attwood\n\nprior to the enactment of AEDPA and therefore rendered his\n\napplication for § 212(c) relief outside of AEDPA's statutory\n\nbar.\n\n           The   INS   appeals,   contesting   the    district   court's\n\ndetermination that the deportation proceedings began on the date the\n\nOSC was issued and not the date it was served. Attwood responds, both\n\ndefending the district court's determination that deportation proceeds\n\nhad fairly begun and again raising his arguments that even if they had\n\nnot, application of AEDPA § 440(d) in his case would violate other\n\nfundamental principles of fairness, due process, and equal protection.3\n\n       3  Upon granting Attwood's petition, the district court\nremanded the case to the INS to consider whether, assuming his\nstatutory eligibility for § 212(c) relief, Attwood merited that\nrelief in the exercise of discretion. While this appeal was\npending, immigration proceedings resumed under the district\ncourt's order, and on July 21, 2000, the immigration judge\ngranted Attwood a discretionary waiver. The INS appealed to the\nBIA, challenging only Attwood's statutory eligibility for the\nwaiver and not the immigration judge's favorable exercise of\ndiscretion.    On October 18, 2000, BIA dismissed the INS's\nappeal, finding that it was compelled to do so in light of the\ndistrict court's determination of statutory eligibility.      At\noral argument, it was suggested that these subsequent decisions\nrender the current appeal moot, as the subsequent order of the\nimmigration judge granting Attwood relief is not properly before\nthe court. While it is correct that this order is not before\nus, and hence our holding does not have direct legal effect on\nthat order, this does not render the dispute between the parties\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          At the time of Attwood's petition, a defendant in this\n\ncircuit who pled guilty prior to AEDPA's enactment was entitled to\n\nconsideration for § 212(c) relief only if he could demonstrate actual\n\nreliance on the availability of such relief. See Mattis v. Reno, 212\n\nF.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).     Subsequent to the district court's\n\ndecision, the Supreme Court addressed the availability of § 212(c)\n\nrelief to such defendants in INS v. St. Cyr, --- U.S. ---, 121 S. Ct.\n\n2271 (2001). In St. Cyr, the Court held that \"§ 212(c) relief remains\n\navailable for aliens . . . whose convictions were obtained through plea\n\nagreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been\n\neligible for § 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law\n\nthen in effect.\" Id. at 2293. As the government has properly conceded\n\nin supplemental briefing, this holding applies to Attwood. Therefore,\n\non the ground that he pled guilty prior to the enactment of AEDPA,\n\nAttwood is, and was, entitled to a hearing on his request for a\n\ndiscretionary waiver under § 212(c).4 We assume that, since Attwood was\n\n\n\nmoot. Rather, the INS and Attwood both have a continued stake\nin the outcome of this appeal -- the BIA explicitly relied on\nthe district court's remand order in affirming the immigration\njudge, and a decision on appeal vacating that order would leave\nthe INS free to pursue a remedy before the Board.\n     4    Because Attwood is entitled to consideration for §\n212(c) relief under St. Cyr, we do not address the district\ncourt's conclusion that deportation proceedings had fairly begun\non the date of issuance of the OSC.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fgiven such a hearing and awarded § 212(c) relief, our affirmance of the\n\ndistrict court's order will conclude this matter in Attwood's favor.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",
