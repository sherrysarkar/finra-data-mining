The  petitioner, P.  Gioioso &amp;\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nSons,  Inc. (Gioioso),  seeks  review of  a  final order  of  the\r\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission)\r\n\ndetermining that  it violated the Occupational  Safety and Health\r\n\nAct of 1970 (OSH Act), 19 U.S.C.    651-678 (1994).  The petition\r\n\npurports  to raise  six distinct  objections to  the Commission's\r\n\norder.   The Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) maintains that we\r\n\nlack  jurisdiction  to hear  three  of  these objections  because\r\n\nGioioso failed  to raise them  when it petitioned  the Commission\r\n\nfor  review  of the  hearing  examiner's adverse  decision.   The\r\n\nremaining objections, the Secretary tells us, are without force.\r\n\n          The  jurisdictional question is new to  this court.  We\r\n\nresolve  it favorably  to the  Secretary and  dispose  of certain\r\n\nobjections on that ground.  We deny the  remnants of the petition\r\n\non the merits.\r\n\nI.  THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r          I.  THE STATUTORY SCHEME\r\n\n          Congress enacted  the  OSH Act  \"to  assure so  far  as\r\n\npossible . . . safe and healthful working conditions.\"  29 U.S.C.\r\n\n  651(b).  The  Act spins an intricate administrative  web which,\r\n\namong  other  things,  separates  rulemaking,   enforcement,  and\r\n\nadjudication.  See Martin v. OSHRC, 499 U.S. 144, 151 (1991).  In\r                                            \r\n\ngeneral, the Secretary sets mandatory safety and health standards\r\n\napplicable to particular businesses.  See 29  U.S.C.   651(b)(3).\r                                                   \r\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces\r\n\nthose standards.  See id.     658-659, 666.  Citations issued  in\r                                   \r\n\nrespect to alleged violations  are adjudicated by the Commission.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nSee id.    659, 661.\r                 \r\n\n          The Commission  operates in the first  instance through\r\n\nadministrative  law  judges  (ALJs),  who   function  as  hearing\r\n\nofficers.  See id.    661(j).  After hearing  a contested matter,\r                            \r\n\nthe ALJ prepares a report.  See 29 C.F.R.   2200.90(a) (1996).  A\r                                         \r\n\nmember of the Commission may direct review of a report on his own\r\n\nmotion (as long as he does so within 30 days  after the docketing\r\n\ndate,  see id.   2200.92(b)),  or on application  of an aggrieved\r                        \r\n\nparty.    See id.     2200.91(a).   The  instrument  by which  an\r                           \r\n\naggrieved party  solicits the Commission's attention  is called a\r\n\npetition for discretionary review (PDR),  and the party must file\r\n\nit  within a  prescribed  20-day period  following the  docketing\r\n\ndate.  See id.   2200.91(b).  The ALJ's report  becomes the final\r                        \r\n\norder  of the Commission unless  review is granted  \"on or before\r\n\nthe  thirtieth day  following  the  [docketing]  date.\"    Id.   \r                                                                        \r\n\n2200.90(d).  In other words, the Commission's failure to act on a\r\n\nPDR within the stipulated 30-day period is tantamount to a denial\r\n\nof review.\r\n\n          Regardless of whether a final order comes about through\r\n\naction or inaction  on the Commission's part,  an aggrieved party\r\n\nmay  seek judicial  review  of it  in  the appropriate  court  of\r\n\nappeals.  See 29 U.S.C.   660(a).\r                       \r\n\nII.  THE ORIGINS OF THE DISPUTE\r          II.  THE ORIGINS OF THE DISPUTE\r\n\n          Gioioso is  in the construction  industry, specializing\r\n\nin  utilities.     Some  time   ago,  it   contracted  with   the\r\n\nMassachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) to lay water lines\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nin Winthrop, Massachusetts.  During a lengthy period beginning in\r\n\n1993, it laid  several thousand  feet of pipe  under or near  the\r\n\naccess road to MWRA's Deer Island work site.\r\n\n          In the course of its endeavors, Gioioso dug an 18-foot-\r\n\nlong trench at the intersection of  Shirley and Taft Avenues.  On\r\n\nOctober  6, 1994,  Gioioso's  foreman, Salvatore  Santone, and  a\r\n\nlaborer,  Fernando Camara, were standing in this trench.  At that\r\n\nmoment,  several OSHA compliance officers happened to pass by the\r\n\nwork  site.1   The  meandering  traffic  afforded the  compliance\r\n\nofficers  a clear  view of  the trench  and one of  their number,\r\n\nEdward Wells,  did not like what he saw:  the trench's walls were\r\n\nunsloped and unsupported, the two workmen standing in  the trench\r\n\nwere visible only from  the shoulders up, and a  ten-foot section\r\n\nof cast metal pipe was suspended aloft from the bucket of a piece\r\n\nof heavy construction equipment located at one end of the trench.\r\n\nWells sounded  the alarm  (figuratively speaking) and  the driver\r\n\nstopped the car.\r\n\n          One  of Wells' colleagues,  Patrick Griffin, exited the\r\n\nvehicle  and hurried toward the trench.  Griffin noticed that the\r\n\ndangling pipe was connected  to the bucket of a  large excavating\r\n\nmachine  by  only a  single attachment  point  and watched  as it\r\n\nrotated  into a position parallel to the trench and directly over\r\n\nthe  workmen's  heads.    When  Griffin  reached the  trench,  he\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  exquisite  timing  of this  coincidence  suggests that\r\nEmerson's epigram (\"Wherever a  man commits a crime, God  finds a\r\nwitness.\"    Ralph  Waldo  Emerson,  \"Natural  Religion,\"  Essays\r                                                                           \r\n(1875)) may  apply to  breaches of administrative  regulations as\r\nwell as to violations of the criminal code.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ndiscovered that it  measured no less than six  feet deep and four\r\n\nfeet wide and had  been dug in gravelly soil.  No  trench box was\r\n\nin place  to guard against  a cave-in  (although Santone  claimed\r\n\nthat  he and Camara had been measuring the trench to ascertain if\r\n\nit could  accommodate  one).   Moreover, because  the trench  lay\r\n\nadjacent  to  the  only road  providing  access  to  Deer Island,\r\n\nvibrations from traffic increased the  risk of a cave-in.   A gas\r\n\npipe,  six inches in diameter, traversed the width of the trench.\r\n\nWells corroborated many of Griffin's observations.\r\n\n          In  due  course, OSHA  issued citations  alleging three\r\n\nserious violations  (one of  which the Secretary  later withdrew)\r\n\nand  a repeat violation.2   The two serious  violations (which we\r\n\nshall label \"A\" and \"B\") were as follows:\r\n\n               A.  Permitting employees to work beneath\r\n          the suspended pipe in violation of  29 C.F.R.\r\n             1926.651(e)  (1996) (which  instructs that\r\n          \"[n]o employee shall be  permitted underneath\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2A serious violation occurs\r\n\n          if  there is  a substantial  probability that\r\n          death  or serious physical  harm could result\r\n          from a condition which exists, or from one or\r\n          more  practices, means,  methods, operations,\r\n          or processes which  have been adopted  or are\r\n          in use . . . unless the employer did not, and\r\n          could  not with  the  exercise of  reasonable\r\n          diligence,  know  of  the  presence   of  the\r\n          violation.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.   666(k).  While  the OSH Act does not define the  term\r\n\"repeat violation,\"  courts  typically  require  proof  that  the\r\nrespondent violated the same standard on an earlier occasion in a\r\nsubstantially similar fashion.   See, e.g., D &amp; S  Grading Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\nSecretary of Labor, 899  F.2d 1145, 1147 (11th Cir.  1990); Bunge\r                                                                           \r\nCorp.  v.  Secretary of  Labor, 638  F.2d  831, 836-37  (5th Cir.\r                                        \r\n1981);  George Hyman Constr. Co.  v.

Permitting  workers to use  a ladder\r\n          that did not extend at least three feet above\r\n          the  top of  the  trench in  violation of  29\r\n          C.F.R.       1926.1053(b)(1)  (1996)   (which\r\n          directs  that  \"[w]hen  portable ladders  are\r\n          used for access to an upper landing  surface,\r\n          the ladder side rails shall extend at least 3\r\n          feet (.9m) above the upper landing\").\r\n\n          The repeat violation (which we shall  label \"C\") was as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n               C.    Failing  to  provide  an  adequate\r\n          protective system for workers in  an unshored\r\n          trench,   in   violation  of   29   C.F.R.   \r\n          1926.652(a)(1)  (1996) (which  provides that,\r\n          except when excavations are made  entirely in\r\n          stable  rock or  are less  than five  feet in\r\n          depth,  \"[e]ach  employee  in  an  excavation\r\n          shall  be  protected  from  cave-ins   by  an\r\n          adequate protective system\").\r\n\n          The  petitioner filed a  timely notice of  contest.  At\r\n\nthe outset of the  hearing, it moved for disqualification  on the\r\n\nground  that the ALJ, several years earlier (while employed as an\r\n\nattorney  in the Department of Labor), had prosecuted one or more\r\n\nsimilar  cases involving  Gioioso.   The  ALJ  refused to  recuse\r\n\nhimself.    After considering  the  evidence, he  found  that the\r\n\nviolations    had    in    fact    occurred,    accepted   OSHA's\r\n\ncharacterizations of  them, and  imposed penalties of  $1,600 for\r\n\neach  of the  two serious  violations and  $8,000 for  the repeat\r\n\nviolation.\r\n\n          Gioioso  petitioned  the  Commission for  discretionary\r\n\nreview of the ALJ's decision.   Its PDR called attention to  only\r\n\nthree issues (described  infra Part  IV).  The  PDR generated  no\r                                        \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ninterest  and the  ALJ's decision  ripened into  the Commission's\r\n\nfinal order.3  Gioioso then sought a judicial anodyne.\r\n\nIII.  THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE\r          III.  THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE\r\n\n          We  turn  first to  the  jurisdictional  quandary.   In\r\n\npressing its cause before this  court, the petitioner raises  not\r\n\nonly the  three issues which  it enumerated in  the PDR  but also\r\n\nthree additional issues,  namely, whether  the ALJ  erred in  (1)\r\n\nfailing  to recuse  himself,  (2) characterizing  violation B  as\r\n\nserious, and (3) assessing  substantial penalties.  The question,\r\n\nthen, is whether Gioioso's  failure to press these points  in the\r\n\nPDR constitutes a forfeiture of the right  to bring them before a\r\n\nreviewing court.  We think that it does.\r\n\n          We begin  with bedrock.   In the  administrative state,\r\n\nexhaustion  of administrative  remedies is  \"generally required.\"\r\n\nWeinberger  v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 765 (1975).  This requirement\r                              \r\n\nis more than  a matter of form.  \"Insisting  on exhaustion forces\r\n\nparties  to  take  administrative  proceedings  seriously, allows\r\n\nadministrative  agencies  an  opportunity  to  correct their  own\r\n\nerrors, and potentially avoids  the need for judicial involvement\r\n\naltogether.\"  Portela-Gonzalez v. Secretary of the Navy, 109 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n74, 79  (1st Cir.  1997).  In  this way, the  exhaustion doctrine\r\n\ncreates  a  win-win situation:    adhering  to it  simultaneously\r\n\nenhances the efficacy of the agency, fosters judicial efficiency,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3By its  inaction,  the Commission  effectively adopted  the\r\nALJ's  recommended findings and report.   We sometimes will refer\r\nto these findings as if  they had been made by the  Commission in\r\nthe first instance.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nand  safeguards   the  integrity   of  the   inter-branch  review\r\n\nrelationship.  See Power Plant Div., Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. OSHRC,\r                                                                          \r\n\n673   F.2d  111,  113  (5th  Cir.  1982);  see  also  Ezratty  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCommonwealth  of Puerto Rico, 648  F.2d 770, 774  (1st Cir. 1981)\r                                      \r\n\n(stating  that  the  \"doctrine  serves  interests  of   accuracy,\r\n\nefficiency, agency autonomy and judicial economy\").\r\n\n          The OSH  Act warmly  embraces the exhaustion  doctrine.\r\n\nIt provides in relevant part that persons such as Gioioso who are\r\n\n\"adversely affected or  aggrieved by an order  of the Commission\"\r\n\nmay  obtain  judicial review  in the  \"court  of appeals  for the\r\n\ncircuit in which the violation is alleged  to have occurred.\"  29\r\n\nU.S.C.     660(a).   The right  to  judicial review,  however, is\r\n\ncarefully cabined.   Congress  specifically  directed that  \"[n]o\r\n\nobjection  that has not been urged before the Commission shall be\r\n\nconsidered  by the court, unless  the failure or  neglect to urge\r\n\nsuch  objection   shall  be  excused  because   of  extraordinary\r\n\ncircumstances.\"   Id.   The  regulations complement  the statute,\r                               \r\n\nexplaining that an aggrieved  party's failure to file a  PDR \"may\r\n\nforeclose  court   review  of  the  objections   to  the  [ALJ's]\r\n\ndecision.\"  29 C.F.R.   2200.91(f).\r\n\n          Interestingly, the commentary accompanying this part of\r\n\nthe regulations directs the reader to the Third Circuit's opinion\r\n\nin Keystone Roofing Co.  v. OSHRC, 539  F.2d 960 (3d Cir.  1976),\r                                           \r\n\nfor guidance.   The  Keystone court  considered  the question  of\r                                       \r\n\nwhether the OSH  Act \"permits  a reviewing court  to consider  an\r\n\nemployer's  objection to an OSHA citation which was argued to the\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nOSHA hearing examiner,  but which  was neither the  subject of  a\r\n\npetition to the .  . . [Commission] for discretionary  review, 29\r\n\nC.F.R.     2200.91,  nor  the  subject  of  review  by  the  full\r\n\nCommission  at  the direction  of a  single  member, 29  U.S.C.  \r\n\n661(i).\"   Id. at 961.   The court answered this  question in the\r                        \r\n\nnegative.  See id. at 964.\r                            \r\n\n          Although the rule announced in Keystone makes eminently\r                                                           \r\n\ngood  sense both  textually (that  is, as  a matter  of statutory\r\n\ninterpretation) and practically (that is, as a matter of policy),\r\n\nthe  petitioner attempts to elude its grasp.  Gioioso first notes\r\n\nthat the regulations  say only that an  aggrieved party's failure\r\n\nto file a PDR \"may foreclose court review of .  . . objections to\r                            \r\n\nthe  [ALJ's]  decision.\"     29  C.F.R.     2200.91(f)  (emphasis\r\n\nsupplied).    Gioioso contends  that the  use  of the  word \"may\"\r\n\nimplies  that  raising  the  objections  in  the  PDR  is  not  a\r\n\nprerequisite  to judicial review.   We disagree.   For one thing,\r\n\nthe regulations cannot  alter the statutory scheme.   For another\r\n\nthing,  the statute  leaves  a  door  ajar  for  cases  in  which\r\n\nextraordinary circumstances obtain.  See 29 U.S.C.   660(a).  The\r                                                  \r\n\nregulation's  use of  the  verb \"may\"  is  no doubt  intended  to\r\n\npreserve this narrow exception to the exhaustion doctrine, not to\r\n\nwiden it beyond all recognition.4\r\n\n          The petitioner  has a fallback position.   It maintains\r\n\nthat  it in  fact \"urged\"  the three  omitted issues  \"before the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4We need not dwell on the exception itself as the petitioner\r\ndoes not even venture to suggest that extraordinary circumstances\r\nexisted in this case.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nCommission\" in  the statutorily required sense.   The linchpin of\r\n\nthis assertion is the petitioner's claim that urging an objection\r\n\nbefore  the ALJ is functionally and  legally equivalent to urging\r\n\nit before the Commission.   The Fifth Circuit has  encouraged the\r\n\npetitioner's view, suggesting in dicta that an objection might be\r\n\npreserved for judicial review  if the aggrieved party articulated\r\n\nit sufficiently before the ALJ.  See Cleveland Consolidated, Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  OSHRC, 649 F.2d 1160, 1165 (5th Cir. 1981) (assuming, without\r                   \r\n\ndeciding, that  an issue had  been preserved for  judicial review\r\n\nbecause it was \"evident  from the record below,\" even  though the\r\n\naggrieved party did not specify it in the PDR).\r\n\n          This dictum  distorts the clear  congressional intent.5\r\n\nWe believe it follows from the bifurcation of duties contained in\r\n\nthe statutory scheme, as well as from plain meaning, that the OSH\r\n\nAct precludes  judicial review of  those objections not  urged in\r\n\nfront  of  the  Commission.     To  be  specific,  the   OSH  Act\r\n\nacknowledges  the existence  of two  separate adjudicators    the\r\n\nCommission   and  the   ALJs      and   assigns  very   different\r\n\nresponsibilities  to  each.   The  Commission  members, whom  the\r\n\nPresident  appoints  based  on  their  training,  expertise,  and\r\n\nexperience,  see  29  U.S.C.     661(a),  carry  out   the  broad\r                          \r\n\nadjudicatory functions required  by the OSH Act.  Conversely, the\r\n\nALJs'  functions  are  case-specific.   This  division  of  labor\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5This dictum goes much  further than the position originally\r\ntaken by the Fifth Circuit in McGowan v. Marshall, 604  F.2d 885,\r                                                           \r\n889-91  (5th  Cir. 1979).   Our  preference  is for  that court's\r\nearlier iteration.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\ncarries  with  it  disparate  responsibilities,  leaving  in  the\r\n\nCommission's  hands the  task of  ensuring the  development of  a\r\n\ncohesive  body  of  decisional   rules  which  comport  with  the\r\n\nobjectives of the OSH Act.\r\n\n          Given this framework, we think that the wiser course is\r\n\nto construe  the statute according  to its  letter.   Only if  an\r\n\nissue  is  actually called  to the  attention of  the Commission,\r\n\nthrough  the   PDR  or  by  a   Commission  member's  spontaneous\r\n\ninitiative,  will the  Commission have  the informed  opportunity\r\n\nthat Congress intended   a meaningful chance to correct a mistake\r\n\nbefore an order  becomes final.   Thus, the  model that  Congress\r\n\nenvisioned  can function  optimally only  if the  aggrieved party\r\n\nalerts the Commission to those issues which that party thinks are\r\n\nworthy of review.  Accord McGowan v. Marshall, 604 F.2d 885, 890-\r                                                       \r\n\n91 (5th Cir. 1979); Keystone, 539 F.2d at 963.\r                                      \r\n\n          The language set forth  in the OSH Act drives  home the\r\n\npoint.   While the statute  recognizes the existence  of both the\r\n\nCommission  and  the ALJs,  compare    661(a)  with    661(e), it\r                                                             \r\n\nspecifically  precludes judicial  review  of those  issues  which\r\n\n\"h[ave]  not  been urged  before the  Commission.\"   29  U.S.C.  \r                                                          \r\n\n660(a) (emphasis supplied).   In  our view, the  omission of  the\r\n\nterm \"ALJ\" or words  of like import from section 660(a)  can only\r\n\nbe  regarded as intentional,  not inadvertent.   See  Russello v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States, 464  U.S. 16,  23 (1983) (explaining  that \"where\r                        \r\n\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a statute\r\n\nbut omits  it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\npresumed that  Congress acts  intentionally and purposely  in the\r\n\ndisparate   inclusion  or  exclusion\")   (citation  and  internal\r\n\nquotation marks  omitted); 2A Norman J.

In  short,  we  agree   with  the  Fifth  Circuit's\r\n\nstatement, albeit in a case that predates Cleveland Consolidated,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthat \"[t]he language of section 660(a) indicates that proceedings\r\n\ntargeted towards  the Commission, not those before  the ALJs, are\r\n\nthe predicate to judicial review.\"  McGowan, 604 F.2d at 890.\r                                                     \r\n\n          The language of the  statute is not only plain,  but it\r\n\nis also fortified  by the regulations (which, if ambiguity lurks,\r\n\nare deserving of deference, see  Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

It  provides, inter alia,\r                                                                          \r\nthat  a  PDR  should  state  specifically  why review  should  be\r\ndirected,   including  whether  the  ALJ's  \"decision  raises  an\r\nimportant  question of  law, policy  or discretion\"  and \"whether\r\nreview  by the Commission will resolve a question about which the\r\nCommission's [ALJs]  have  rendered differing  opinions.\"   These\r\ndirectives would  be  emptied  of  meaning if  we  construed  the\r\nstatute to relieve  the aggrieved party of any  responsibility to\r\nidentify issues with particularity in the PDR itself.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nbrought to the Commission's attention either by its inclusion  in\r\n\na PDR or by the unilateral act of a single commissioner.\r\n\n          Consistent with this  conclusion, we  next examine  the\r\n\nPDR which Gioioso filed.   We find absolutely no  reference in it\r\n\neither to the alleged mischaracterization of the ladder violation\r\n\nor to the supposedly excessive nature of the penalty assessments.\r\n\nBecause  Gioioso  failed  to  urge these  objections  before  the\r\n\nCommission, we are without jurisdiction to entertain them.\r\n\n          The recusal  issue presents  a variation on  the theme.\r\n\nAlthough  the PDR  did not  list this  objection as an  issue for\r\n\nreview, there was a glancing  mention of it in a footnote.7   The\r\n\npetitioner claims  to have preserved  the issue in  this fashion.\r\n\nBut the exhaustion doctrine demands more than oblique references,\r\n\nand the  statute's  use of  the verb  \"urge\" in  this contest  is\r\n\ntelling.   See  Webster's  Collegiate Dictionary  1300 (10th  ed.\r                        \r\n\n1993)  (defining  \"urge\" as  meaning  \"to  present, advocate,  or\r\n\ndemand earnestly or pressingly\" or \"to declare, advance, or press\r\n\nearnestly a statement, argument,  charge or claim\"); The American\r\n\nHeritage Dictionary of  the English Language  1965 (3d ed.  1992)\r\n\n(defining \"urge\" as \"[t]o entreat earnestly and often repeatedly;\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The footnote reads in its entirety:\r\n\n          Gioioso moved  to recuse the  ALJ based  upon\r\n          the   fact  that   the  ALJ   had  previously\r\n          prosecuted  Gioioso   for  similar  citations\r\n          while a solicitor  and that prosecution could\r\n          impact the ALJ's judgment  in this case.  The\r\n          ALJ  denied the  motion.   Later, Complainant\r\n          introduced   into  evidence   the  settlement\r\n          agreement  in  that  case  to  establish  the\r\n          appropriateness of the penalty in this case.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nexhort . . . [t]o present a forceful argument, claim, or  case\").\r\n\nIn an OSHA  case, an  objection is not  \"urged\" in the  requisite\r\n\nsense  (and will  not  be deemed  preserved for  judicial review)\r\n\nunless the PDR conveys the substance of the objection face up and\r\n\nsquarely,  in  a  manner   reasonably  calculated  to  alert  the\r\n\nCommission to the crux of the perceived problem.8\r\n\n          The petitioner's treatment of  the recusal issue  fails\r\n\nto meet  this benchmark.  As the PDR reads, the matter of recusal\r\n\nis  little  more than  a  passing  comment, designed  to  provide\r\n\ninformation buttressing another argument rather than to carve out\r\n\nan  independent ground for inquiry.  Since the footnote failed to\r\n\nplace  the Commission  on proper  notice, it  did not  suffice to\r\n\npreserve the issue of recusal for judicial review.\r\n\n          The upshot of the matter  is simply this:  in order  to\r\n\neffectuate  the  statute  that  Congress  wrote  and  assure  the\r\n\nefficiency,  effectiveness,  and autonomy  of  the administrative\r\n\nstructure, an aggrieved  party desiring to preserve an  issue for\r\n\njudicial  review must  raise  it before  the  ALJ, articulate  it\r\n\nclearly   in  its   PDR,  and  offer   a  modicum   of  developed\r\n\nargumentation in support  of it.

We\r\n\nsee none.\r\n\n          The  citation   underpinning  Violation  A   states  in\r\n\nrelevant part  that Gioioso's personnel \"were  exposed to serious\r\n\ninjury while  working in a trench in which a section of 12\" water\r\n\nline  was being lowered.\"  In adjudicating this citation, the ALJ\r\n\ncredited the  testimony of two compliance  officers who described\r\n\nseeing a ten-foot section  of cast metal pipe suspended  from the\r\n\nbucket of  an excavating machine by  a chain sling.   As the pipe\r\n\nmoved,  it  rotated around  the  single point  of  suspension and\r\n\npassed over  the heads of the men who were working in the trench.\r\n\nWhile the  observations of the  two compliance officers  were not\r\n\nentirely  congruent,   the   ALJ  determined   that  the   modest\r\n\ndiscrepancies  in their  accounts  were easily  explained by  the\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nofficers'  differing  vantage  points.    He  also  found  that a\r\n\nphotograph taken shortly thereafter corroborated their testimony.\r\n\nKeeping  in mind the frailty of Gioioso's rebuttal   its foreman,\r\n\nSantone,  stated only  that he  did not  recall the  pipe passing\r\n\noverhead    there is no principled  basis on which a  court could\r\n\njustify  substituting its  judgment  for the  factfinder's.

The petitioner again  spies error.\r\n\nWe do not.\r\n\n          It is  undisputed  that  the  petitioner  neglected  to\r\n\nfurnish  a  support  system,  shield system,  or  other  adequate\r\n\nsafeguarding  within the  trench  as  required  by  29  C.F.R.   \r\n\n1926.652(c).  Additionally, the  petitioner failed to comply with\r\n\nthe provisions of 29 C.F.R.   1926.652(b)(1)(i) (which delineates\r\n\na protection  option accomplished by  the gradual sloping  of the\r\n\nexcavation's walls).   But  the regulations exempt  some unsloped\r\n\nexcavations  that are  less than five  feet in  depth, see  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1926.652(a)(1)(ii), and the petitioner  seeks the shelter of this\r\n\nexemption.   The petitioner  hypothesizes that its  workers never\r\n\nwere exposed to the hazards  inherent in an excavation  exceeding\r\n\nfive feet  in depth  because they  were standing  on a pipe  that\r\n\ntraversed  the  width  of the  trench.    The  ALJ rejected  this\r\n\ndefense:  although he  believed it was unlikely that  the workmen\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nwere  standing on  the floor  of the  trench when  the compliance\r\n\nofficers  arrived,  he found  that  \"no  matter where  they  were\r\n\nstanding,  [they]  were  still  inside  a  trench  that  was  not\r\n\nprotected  in accordance with    1926.652(a)(1).\"  We review this\r\n\nessentially legal judgment de novo.\r\n\n          In reaching this conclusion,  the ALJ relied heavily on\r\n\nFord Dev.  Corp., 15 O.S.H. Cas.  (BNA) 2003 (1992).   There, the\r                          \r\n\nemployer claimed that its  employees were supposed to stand  on a\r\n\npipe while in  a trench, and  that in so  doing they  effectively\r\n\nwould  be exposed to a depth of  only 3.5 feet (the distance from\r\n\nthe upper  surface of the  pipe to the  top of the  trench).  The\r\n\nCommission  rejected this  argument.   It  noted  that the  depth\r\n\nexception  applies only  if an  excavation is  \"less than  5 feet\r\n\n(1.52m) in depth  and examination  of the ground  by a  competent\r\n\nperson provides no indication of a potential cave-in.\"  29 C.F.R.\r\n\n  1926.652(a)(1)(ii).  The  Commission then explained that \"[t]he\r\n\nstandard  speaks of the depth of  the trench, not of the position\r\n\nof employees in the trench.\"   Ford Dev. Corp., 15 O.S.H. Cas. at\r                                                        \r\n\n2011.   On  this  basis,  the  Commission  held  that  the  depth\r\n\nexception did not apply.  See id.\r                                           \r\n\n          The reasoning  in Ford embodies a sensible construction\r                                          \r\n\nof the regulation    and one that  comports with its wording  and\r\n\npurpose.   The safety  standard is implicated  by the depth  of a\r\n\nparticular  trench,  without  regard  to an  individual  worker's\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nprecise position in it.9  The notion that having workers stand on\r\n\na  laid  pipe  within  a  trench  is  a  satisfactory  method  of\r\n\nprotecting them from the risk of cave-ins is nonsense.  While the\r\n\nregulations are performance-oriented,  they only allow  employers\r\n\nto choose from a limited  universe of acceptable procedures,  not\r\n\nto  jury-rig  convenient  alternatives  and  impose  them  on  an\r\n\nimperilled work force.  See Conie Constr., Inc. v. Reich, 73 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n382, 384 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          We  have  said  enough  on this  score.    Because  the\r\n\nexcavation regulation  applies to the trench  in question whereas\r\n\nthe  depth exception  does  not, the  Commission's resolution  of\r\n\nViolation C must stand.\r\n\n              D.  Unpreventable Employee Misconduct.\r                        D.  Unpreventable Employee Misconduct.\r                                                             \r\n\n          The  Commission  rejected the  petitioner's affirmative\r\n\ndefense of  unpreventable employee misconduct (the  UEM defense).\r\n\nThe petitioner challenges this  determination as a matter  of law\r\n\nand as a matter of fact.  We reject both challenges.\r\n\n          The  OSH Act  requires that  an employer  do everything\r\n\nreasonably within its power  to ensure that its personnel  do not\r\n\nviolate safety standards.   But if  an employer lives up  to that\r\n\nbilling and an employee nonetheless fails to use proper equipment\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9The  record in this  case aptly  illustrates the  wisdom of\r\nthis conclusion.  A compliance officer, Griffin, testified to the\r\nclose  proximity of traffic on the adjacent roads and warned that\r\nthis  could  cause  vibrations   along  the  trench  walls,  thus\r\nheightening the  risk of a cave-in.   If a cave-in  occurred in a\r\ntrench of  this depth, Griffin  believed that  workers within  it\r\nwould  \"probably . . .  be buried\" regardless  of where they were\r\nstanding.\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nor otherwise ignores firmly established safety measures, it seems\r\n\nunfair to hold  the employer  liable.  To  address this  dilemma,\r\n\nboth OSHRC and the courts have recognized the availability of the\r\n\nUEM defense.\r\n\n          The  contours of  the UEM  defense are  relatively well\r\n\ndefined.  To reach safe harbor, an employer must demonstrate that\r\n\nit (1) established a  work rule to prevent the  reckless behavior\r\n\nand/or   unsafe   condition   from   occurring,   (2)  adequately\r\n\ncommunicated  the  rule  to  its employees,  (3)  took  steps  to\r\n\ndiscover incidents of noncompliance, and (4) effectively enforced\r\n\nthe  rule whenever employees transgressed it.  See New York State\r                                                                           \r\n\nElec. &amp; Gas Corp. v.

(BNA) 1477, 1479 (1979).\r\n\n          The employer  must shoulder  the burden of  proving all\r\n\nfour  elements of the UEM defense.   See Brock v. L.E. Myers Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n818 F.2d 1270, 1276  (6th Cir. 1987); General Dynamics,  599 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat  459.    Sustaining  this  burden  requires  more  than  pious\r\n\nplatitudes:  \"an employer must do  all it feasibly can to prevent\r\n\nforeseeable  hazards,   including   dangerous  conduct   by   its\r\n\nemployees.\"   General  Dynamics,  599 F.2d  at  458; accord  H.B.\r                                                                           \r\n\nZachry Co. v. OSHRC, 638 F.2d 812, 818 (5th Cir. 1981).\r                             \r\n\n          The  mainstay of  Gioioso's  argument is  that the  ALJ\r\n\nunnecessarily required repetitive  documentary proof referable to\r\n\nthe UEM  defense.   But  this is  smoke and  mirrors; the  record\r\n\nreveals  quite clearly that the ALJ applied the appropriate legal\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nstandard in a wholly unremarkable way and found that the employer\r\n\nfailed  to   carry  the   devoir  of   persuasion  on   both  the\r\n\nimplementation and  enforcement components of the  defense.  This\r\n\ndeficit is fatal.  Even if an employer establishes work rules and\r\n\ncommunicates them to its  employees, the defense of unpreventable\r\n\nemployee misconduct cannot be  sustained unless the employer also\r\n\nproves  that  it  insists  upon  compliance with  the  rules  and\r\n\nregularly  enforces  them.   See  Centex-Rooney  Constr. Co.,  16\r                                                                      \r\n\nO.S.H. CAS. (BNA) 2127, 2130 (1994).\r\n\n          Contrary to the petitioner's insinuations,  the ALJ did\r\n\nnot presume to  establish a per se  rule requiring documentation.\r\n\nRather,  he  counted the  absence  of  documentation against  the\r\n\nproponent  of the defense in the circumstances  of this case.  We\r                                                                      \r\n\ncannot fault this approach.  Given the nature of the issue, there\r\n\nis no reason why a factfinder must accept an employer's anecdotal\r\n\nevidence uncritically.  And  in this instance, we agree  with the\r\n\nALJ that the absence of any vestige of documentary  proof was not\r\n\nonly a relevant datum but a telling one.\r\n\n          The  petitioner also questions whether the Commission's\r\n\nrejection of its UEM defense is supported by substantial evidence\r\n\nin  the  record.    After  giving  due  deference  to  the  ALJ's\r\n\ncredibility determinations,  we conclude  that the  ruling passes\r\n\nmuster.\r\n\n          While  the  record   reflects  that   Gioioso  made   a\r\n\nmeaningful effort to develop a satisfactory safety program, it is\r\n\nmuch  less  conclusive  on   the  issues  of  implementation  and\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nenforcement.   The petitioner's best case is  that it distributes\r\n\nsafety manuals to  all new employees; that  these manuals contain\r\n\ninformation regarding, inter alia,  the lifting of loads, methods\r                                           \r\n\nof  trench protection,  and the  proper placement  of  ladders in\r\n\ntrenches;  and that  it  supplements these  materials in  various\r\n\nways.    The  petitioner's  safety chairman  testified  that  the\r\n\ncompany  sponsors weekly  \"toolbox  talks\" at  its work  sites,10\r\n\nmonthly safety  meetings for supervisory personnel,  and biennial\r\n\nsafety seminars for all  employees.  But this evidence  left some\r\n\nfairly  conspicuous  gaps  as  to  the  content  of  the training\r\n\nexercises,  who conducted  each session,  and who  attended them.\r\n\nDocumentation    say, syllabi or attendance  rosters   would have\r\n\ngone a long  way toward  filling these gaps,  but the  petitioner\r\n\nproffered   none.      Absent  such   documentation,   it  cannot\r\n\npersuasively argue that it  effectively communicated the rules to\r\n\nits employees.\r\n\n          The  ALJ   found  most  compelling  the   lack  of  any\r\n\nsubstantial  evidence   in   the  record   that  the   petitioner\r\n\neffectively enforced its safety program.  It provided no evidence\r\n\nof unscheduled safety audits  or mandatory safety checklists, and\r\n\nno   documentation  that   it  ever   executed   its  four-tiered\r\n\ndisciplinary policy.   This  lacuna in  the proof undermines  its\r\n\nattempt to mount a viable UEM defense.  See Hamilton Fixture,  16\r                                                                      \r\n\nO.S.H.

Even when a safety program\r               \r\n\nis thorough and properly conceived, lax administration renders it\r\n\nineffective (and,  thus, vitiates  reliance on the  UEM defense).\r\n\nSee Brock,  818 F.2d at 1274,  1278 (in which the  ALJ rejected a\r                   \r\n\nUEM  defense   when  the  employer  could   not  produce  records\r\n\nevidencing employees'  receipt of safety manuals,  the occurrence\r\n\nof safety meetings, and the like).\r\n\n          Brock   also  illustrates   another  point   which  has\r                         \r\n\npertinence  here.

See id. at 1277.\r                                                                  \r\n\nThe  case at hand  is not  dissimilar; Santone,  the petitioner's\r\n\nforeman,  in  effect  acknowledged   that  his  actions  directly\r\n\ncontravened  the  company's  safety  policies.    And  while  the\r\n\npetitioner  argues that  a foreman  should not  be regarded  as a\r\n\nsupervisor,  the  company's  own  safety  manual  identifies  the\r\n\nforeman as the \"safety foreman for his crew,\" instructs employees\r\n\nto \"listen to  your foreman\"  in respect to  safety matters,  and\r\n\ndirects  foremen (along  with other  company safety  officers) to\r\n\ninspect work sites regularly  and to enforce safety rules.   Seen\r\n\nin  the context of  these instructions,  the foreman's  breach of\r\n\nsafety  rules supplies  the  basis  for  an  inference  that  the\r\n\nemployer's  implementation  of   safety  procedures  and/or   its\r\n\nenforcement  policies left something to be desired.

The same circumstance  also\r                          \r\n\nbuttresses the  ALJ's finding  that Gioioso's  employees probably\r\n\nwere unaware  that a threat  of disciplinary  action existed  for\r\n\nnonobservance of safety rules.\r\n\n          Finally, it bears mentioning that one of the violations\r\n\n(Violation C) is a  repeat violation.  Recent violations  provide\r\n\nsome  evidence of  ineffective  safety enforcement.   See  Jensen\r                                                                           \r\n\nConstr.

Taking  into  account the\r\n\ntotality of the circumstances and the allocation of the burden of\r\n\nproof,  we  find  the  petitioner's  claim  that  the  Commission\r\n\nimproperly rejected its UEM defense to be without merit.\r\n\n          The petition for review is denied and dismissed.\r                    The petition for review is denied and dismissed.\r                                                                   \r\n\n                                25\r\r\n",

Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc.  (Gioioso), seeks review of a final order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) determining that it violated the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 651-678 (1994).  The petition purports to raise six distinct objections to the Commission's order.  The Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) maintains that we lack jurisdiction to hear three of these objections because Gioioso failed to raise them when it petitioned the Commission for review of the hearing examiner's adverse decision.  The remaining objections, the Secretary tells us, are without force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurisdictional question is new to this court.  We resolve it favorably to the Secretary and dispose of certain objections on that ground.  We deny the remnants of the petition on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the OSH Act \"to assure so far as possible ... safe and healthful working conditions.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 651(b).  The Act spins an intricate administrative web which, among other things, separates rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudication.  See Martin v. OSHRC, 499 U.S. 144, 151, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 1176, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991).  In general, the Secretary sets mandatory safety and health standards applicable to particular businesses.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 651(b)(3).  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces those standards.  See id. &#167;&#167; 658-659, 666.  Citations issued in respect to alleged violations are adjudicated by the Commission.  See id. &#167;&#167; 659, 661.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission operates in the first instance through administrative law judges (ALJs), who function as hearing officers.  See id. &#167; 661(j).  After hearing a contested matter, the ALJ prepares a report.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.90(a) (1996).  A member of the Commission may direct review of a report on his own motion (as long as he does so within 30 days after the docketing date, see id. &#167; 2200.92(b)), or on application of an aggrieved party.  See id. &#167; 2200.91(a).  The instrument by which an aggrieved party solicits the Commission's attention is called a petition for discretionary review (PDR), and the party must file it within a prescribed 20-day period following the docketing date.  See id. &#167; 2200.91(b).  The ALJ's report becomes the final order of the Commission unless review is granted \"on or before the thirtieth day following the [docketing] date.\"  Id. &#167; 2200.90(d).  In other words, the Commission's failure to act on a PDR within the stipulated 30-day period is tantamount to a denial of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether a final order comes about through action or inaction on the Commission's part, an aggrieved party may seek judicial review of it in the appropriate court of appeals.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ORIGINS OF THE DISPUTE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gioioso is in the construction industry, specializing in utilities.  Some time ago, it contracted with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) to lay water lines in Winthrop, Massachusetts.  During a lengthy period beginning in 1993, it laid several thousand feet of pipe under or near the access road to MWRA's Deer Island work site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of its endeavors, Gioioso dug an 18-foot-long trench at the intersection of Shirley and Taft Avenues.  On October 6, 1994, Gioioso's foreman, Salvatore Santone, and a laborer, Fernando Camara, were standing in this trench.  At that moment, several OSHA compliance officers happened to pass by the work site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The meandering traffic afforded the compliance officers a clear view of the trench and one of their number, Edward Wells, did not like what he saw:  the trench's walls were unsloped and unsupported, the two workmen standing in the trench were visible only from the shoulders up, and a ten-foot section of cast metal pipe was suspended aloft from the bucket of a piece of heavy construction equipment located at one end of the trench.  Wells sounded the alarm (figuratively speaking) and the driver stopped the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of Wells' colleagues, Patrick Griffin, exited the vehicle and hurried toward the trench.  Griffin noticed that the dangling pipe was connected to the bucket of a large excavating machine by only a single attachment point and watched as it rotated into a position parallel to the trench and directly over the workmen's heads.  When Griffin reached the trench, he discovered that it measured no less than six feet deep and four feet wide and had been dug in gravelly soil.  No trench box was in place to guard against a cave-in (although Santone claimed that he and Camara had been measuring the trench to ascertain if it could accommodate one).  Moreover, because the trench lay adjacent to the only road providing access to Deer Island, vibrations from traffic increased the risk of a cave-in.  A gas pipe, six inches in diameter, traversed the width of the trench.  Wells corroborated many of Griffin's observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, OSHA issued citations alleging three serious violations (one of which the Secretary later withdrew) and a repeat violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The two serious violations (which we shall label \"A\" and \"B\") were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Permitting employees to work beneath the suspended pipe in violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.651(e) (1996) (which instructs that \"[n]o employee shall be permitted underneath loads handled by lifting or digging equipment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Permitting workers to use a ladder that did not extend at least three feet above the top of the trench in violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.1053(b)(1) (1996) (which directs that \"[w]hen portable ladders are used for access to an upper landing surface, the ladder side rails shall extend at least 3 feet (.9m) above the upper landing\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The repeat violation (which we shall label \"C\") was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Failing to provide an adequate protective system for workers in an unshored trench, in violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1) (1996) (which provides that, except when excavations are made entirely in stable rock or are less than five feet in depth, \"[e]ach employee in an excavation shall be protected from cave-ins by an adequate protective system\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner filed a timely notice of contest.  At the outset of the hearing, it moved for disqualification on the ground that the ALJ, several years earlier (while employed as an attorney in the Department of Labor), had prosecuted one or more similar cases involving Gioioso.  The ALJ refused to recuse himself.  After considering the evidence, he found that the violations had in fact occurred, accepted OSHA's characterizations of them, and imposed penalties of $1,600 for each of the two serious violations and $8,000 for the repeat violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gioioso petitioned the Commission for discretionary review of the ALJ's decision.  Its PDR called attention to only three issues (described infra Part IV).  The PDR generated no interest and the ALJ's decision ripened into the Commission's final order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Gioioso then sought a judicial anodyne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the jurisdictional quandary.  In pressing its cause before this court, the petitioner raises not only the three issues which it enumerated in the PDR but also three additional issues, namely, whether the ALJ erred in (1) failing to recuse himself, (2) characterizing violation B as serious, and (3) assessing substantial penalties.  The question, then, is whether Gioioso's failure to press these points in the PDR constitutes a forfeiture of the right to bring them before a reviewing court.  We think that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  In the administrative state, exhaustion of administrative remedies is \"generally required.\"  Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 765, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2467, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975).  This requirement is more than a matter of form.  \"Insisting on exhaustion forces parties to take administrative proceedings seriously, allows administrative agencies an opportunity to correct their own errors, and potentially avoids the need for judicial involvement altogether.\"  Portela-Gonzalez v. Secretary of the Navy, 109 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir.1997).  In this way, the exhaustion doctrine creates a win-win situation:  adhering to it simultaneously enhances the efficacy of the agency, fosters judicial efficiency, and safeguards the integrity of the inter-branch review relationship.  See Power Plant Div., Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. OSHRC, 673 F.2d 111, 113 (5th Cir.1982);  see also Ezratty v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 648 F.2d 770, 774 (1st Cir.1981) (stating that the \"doctrine serves interests of accuracy, efficiency, agency autonomy and judicial economy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act warmly embraces the exhaustion doctrine.  It provides in relevant part that persons such as Gioioso who are \"adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Commission\" may obtain judicial review in the \"court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation is alleged to have occurred.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).  The right to judicial review, however, is carefully cabined.  Congress specifically directed that \"[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"  Id. The regulations complement the statute, explaining that an aggrieved party's failure to file a PDR \"may foreclose court review of the objections to the [ALJ's] decision.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interestingly, the commentary accompanying this part of the regulations directs the reader to the Third Circuit's opinion in Keystone Roofing Co. v. OSHRC, 539 F.2d 960 (3d Cir.1976), for guidance.  The Keystone court considered the question of whether the OSH Act \"permits a reviewing court to consider an employer's objection to an OSHA citation which was argued to the OSHA hearing examiner, but which was neither the subject of a petition to the ... [Commission] for discretionary review, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91, nor the subject of review by the full Commission at the direction of a single member, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 661(i).\"  Id. at 961.   The court answered this question in the negative.  See id. at 964.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the rule announced in Keystone makes eminently good sense both textually (that is, as a matter of statutory interpretation) and practically (that is, as a matter of policy), the petitioner attempts to elude its grasp.  Gioioso first notes that the regulations say only that an aggrieved party's failure to file a PDR \"may foreclose court review of ... objections to the [ALJ's] decision.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91(f) (emphasis supplied).  Gioioso contends that the use of the word \"may\" implies that raising the objections in the PDR is not a prerequisite to judicial review.  We disagree.  For one thing, the regulations cannot alter the statutory scheme.  For another thing, the statute leaves a door ajar for cases in which extraordinary circumstances obtain.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).  The regulation's use of the verb \"may\" is no doubt intended to preserve this narrow exception to the exhaustion doctrine, not to widen it beyond all recognition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner has a fallback position.  It maintains that it in fact \"urged\" the three omitted issues \"before the Commission\" in the statutorily required sense.  The linchpin of this assertion is the petitioner's claim that urging an objection before the ALJ is functionally and legally equivalent to urging it before the Commission.  The Fifth Circuit has encouraged the petitioner's view, suggesting in dicta that an objection might be preserved for judicial review if the aggrieved party articulated it sufficiently before the ALJ.  See Cleveland Consolidated, Inc. v. OSHRC, 649 F.2d 1160, 1165 (5th Cir.1981) (assuming, without deciding, that an issue had been preserved for judicial review because it was \"evident from the record below,\" even though the aggrieved party did not specify it in the PDR).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dictum distorts the clear congressional intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We believe it follows from the bifurcation of duties contained in the statutory scheme, as well as from plain meaning, that the OSH Act precludes judicial review of those objections not urged in front of the Commission.  To be specific, the OSH Act acknowledges the existence of two separate adjudicators--the Commission and the ALJs--and assigns very different responsibilities to each.  The Commission members, whom the President appoints based on their training, expertise, and experience, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 661(a), carry out the broad adjudicatory functions required by the OSH Act.  Conversely, the ALJs' functions are case-specific.  This division of labor carries with it disparate responsibilities, leaving in the Commission's hands the task of ensuring the development of a cohesive body of decisional rules which comport with the objectives of the OSH Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this framework, we think that the wiser course is to construe the statute according to its letter.  Only if an issue is actually called to the attention of the Commission, through the PDR or by a Commission member's spontaneous initiative, will the Commission have the informed opportunity that Congress intended--a meaningful chance to correct a mistake before an order becomes final.  Thus, the model that Congress envisioned can function optimally only if the aggrieved party alerts the Commission to those issues which that party thinks are worthy of review.  Accord McGowan v. Marshall, 604 F.2d 885, 890-91 (5th Cir.1979);  Keystone, 539 F.2d at 963.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language set forth in the OSH Act drives home the point.  While the statute recognizes the existence of both the Commission and the ALJs, compare &#167; 661(a) with &#167; 661(e), it specifically precludes judicial review of those issues which \"h[ave] not been urged before the Commission.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a) (emphasis supplied).  In our view, the omission of the term \"ALJ\" or words of like import from section 660(a) can only be regarded as intentional, not inadvertent.  See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (explaining that \"where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);  2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Stat.  Const. &#167; 47.23 (5th ed.1992) (explaining that the inference that an omission is an intentional exclusion is strengthened \"where a thing is provided in one part of the statute and omitted in another\").  In short, we agree with the Fifth Circuit's statement, albeit in a case that predates Cleveland Consolidated, that \"[t]he language of section 660(a) indicates that proceedings targeted towards the Commission, not those before the ALJs, are the predicate to judicial review.\"  McGowan, 604 F.2d at 890.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the statute is not only plain, but it is also fortified by the regulations (which, if ambiguity lurks, are deserving of deference, see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and by the agency's stated adherence to the Third Circuit's seminal decision in Keystone, 539 F.2d at 964.   Against this backdrop, we are persuaded that merely raising an issue before the ALJ--no matter how clearly--fails to preserve the issue for judicial review.  Something more is needed:  the issue thereafter must be brought to the Commission's attention either by its inclusion in a PDR or by the unilateral act of a single commissioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this conclusion, we next examine the PDR which Gioioso filed.  We find absolutely no reference in it either to the alleged mischaracterization of the ladder violation or to the supposedly excessive nature of the penalty assessments.  Because Gioioso failed to urge these objections before the Commission, we are without jurisdiction to entertain them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recusal issue presents a variation on the theme.  Although the PDR did not list this objection as an issue for review, there was a glancing mention of it in a footnote.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The petitioner claims to have preserved the issue in this fashion.  But the exhaustion doctrine demands more than oblique references, and the statute's use of the verb \"urge\" in this contest is telling.  See Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1300 (10th ed.1993) (defining \"urge\" as meaning \"to present, advocate, or demand earnestly or pressingly\" or \"to declare, advance, or press earnestly a statement, argument, charge or claim\");  The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1965 (3d ed.1992) (defining \"urge\" as \"[t]o entreat earnestly and often repeatedly;  exhort ... [t]o present a forceful argument, claim, or case\").  In an OSHA case, an objection is not \"urged\" in the requisite sense (and will not be deemed preserved for judicial review) unless the PDR conveys the substance of the objection face up and squarely, in a manner reasonably calculated to alert the Commission to the crux of the perceived problem.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's treatment of the recusal issue fails to meet this benchmark.  As the PDR reads, the matter of recusal is little more than a passing comment, designed to provide information buttressing another argument rather than to carve out an independent ground for inquiry.  Since the footnote failed to place the Commission on proper notice, it did not suffice to preserve the issue of recusal for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot of the matter is simply this:  in order to effectuate the statute that Congress wrote and assure the efficiency, effectiveness, and autonomy of the administrative structure, an aggrieved party desiring to preserve an issue for judicial review must raise it before the ALJ, articulate it clearly in its PDR, and offer a modicum of developed argumentation in support of it.  See Durez Div. of Occidental Chem.  Corp. v. OSHA, 906 F.2d 1, 5 (D.C.Cir.1990) (refusing to hear an issue listed as one of five issues in the PDR, but neither discussed nor supported by citations of authority therein);  see also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91(d) (\"[A] petition should concisely state the portions of the decision for which review is sought.\");   cf. Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that to preserve an issue for review on an appeal from a magistrate's report to a district judge, a party must \"spell out his arguments squarely and distinctly\").  Because the petitioner did not satisfy this criterion with respect to three of its six putative issues, we lack jurisdiction to hear those issues in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction to hear three of the petitioner's six objections marks only the end of the beginning.  We still must resolve the three preserved claims, namely, (1) whether substantial evidence supports the finding that the petitioner's employees worked below a suspended pipe (Violation A);  (2) whether the Commission erred in finding that the petitioner's employees were exposed to trench-related hazards without an adequate protection system (Violation C);  and (3) whether the record supports the rejection of the petitioner's unpreventable employee misconduct defense.  We discuss each of these contentions separately, pausing first to delineate certain principles affecting the standard of appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>A. Principles Affecting Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reviewing court customarily defers to an agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute that it administers.  See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44 &amp; n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-83 &amp; n. 11;  Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  Dep't of Human Servs., 96 F.3d 542, 547 (1st Cir.1996).  The impetus for deference escalates when the agency interprets its own regulations.  See Lyng v. Payne, 476 U.S. 926, 939, 106 S.Ct. 2333, 2341-42, 90 L.Ed.2d 921 (1986);  Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).  In the final analysis, a reviewing court should respect an agency's interpretation of its own regulation as long as the interpretation meshes sensibly with the regulation's language and purpose.  See Martin, 499 U.S. at 151, 111 S.Ct. at 1176.   These principles apply to the regulations that the Secretary of Labor promulgated to implement the OSH Act.  See id. at 152, 111 S.Ct. at 1176-77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a), incorporates the basic judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.  Under those provisions, agency determinations should be upheld unless they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"  5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's findings of fact are conclusive as long as they are \"supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).  The Court delineated the contours of the \"substantial evidence\" standard nearly half a century ago in Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 477, 491, 71 S.Ct. 456, 459, 466, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), and they are by now too familiar to warrant repetition.  We mention specially, however, that the standard applies with undiminished force where, as here, an administrative body, like the Commission, does not itself hear witnesses but instead adopts an ALJ's findings of fact.  See Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 170 v. NLRB, 993 F.2d 990, 998-99 (1st Cir.1993).  As a corollary to the standard, the hearing examiner's credibility determinations are entitled to great deference.  See General Dynamics Corp. v. OSHRC, 599 F.2d 453, 463 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>B. Violation A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission found that Gioioso breached the excavation standard, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.651(e), which mandates that \"[n]o employee shall be permitted underneath loads handled by lifting or digging equipment.\"   The petitioner assigns error.  We see none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The citation underpinning Violation A states in relevant part that Gioioso's personnel \"were exposed to serious injury while working in a trench in which a section of 12\" water line was being lowered.\"   In adjudicating this citation, the ALJ credited the testimony of two compliance officers who described seeing a ten-foot section of cast metal pipe suspended from the bucket of an excavating machine by a chain sling.  As the pipe moved, it rotated around the single point of suspension and passed over the heads of the men who were working in the trench.  While the observations of the two compliance officers were not entirely congruent, the ALJ determined that the modest discrepancies in their accounts were easily explained by the officers' differing vantage points.  He also found that a photograph taken shortly thereafter corroborated their testimony.  Keeping in mind the frailty of Gioioso's rebuttal--its foreman, Santone, stated only that he did not recall the pipe passing overhead--there is no principled basis on which a court could justify substituting its judgment for the factfinder's.  See General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 463.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>C. Violation C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission found that Gioioso failed to provide an adequate protective system within the trench, thereby violating 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1).  The petitioner again spies error.  We do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the petitioner neglected to furnish a support system, shield system, or other adequate safeguarding within the trench as required by 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(c).  Additionally, the petitioner failed to comply with the provisions of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(b)(1)(i) (which delineates a protection option accomplished by the gradual sloping of the excavation's walls).  But the regulations exempt some unsloped excavations that are less than five feet in depth, see id. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1)(ii), and the petitioner seeks the shelter of this exemption.  The petitioner hypothesizes that its workers never were exposed to the hazards inherent in an excavation exceeding five feet in depth because they were standing on a pipe that traversed the width of the trench.  The ALJ rejected this defense:  although he believed it was unlikely that the workmen were standing on the floor of the trench when the compliance officers arrived, he found that \"no matter where they were standing, [they] were still inside a trench that was not protected in accordance with &#167; 1926.652(a)(1).\"   We review this essentially legal judgment de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ relied heavily on Ford Dev.  Corp., 15 O.S.H. Cas.  (BNA) 2003 (1992).  There, the employer claimed that its employees were supposed to stand on a pipe while in a trench, and that in so doing they effectively would be exposed to a depth of only 3.5 feet (the distance from the upper surface of the pipe to the top of the trench).  The Commission rejected this argument.  It noted that the depth exception applies only if an excavation is \"less than 5 feet (1.52m) in depth and examination of the ground by a competent person provides no indication of a potential cave-in.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1)(ii).  The Commission then explained that \"[t]he standard speaks of the depth of the trench, not of the position of employees in the trench.\"   Ford Dev.  Corp., 15 O.S.H. Cas. at 2011.   On this basis, the Commission held that the depth exception did not apply.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning in Ford embodies a sensible construction of the regulation--and one that comports with its wording and purpose.  The safety standard is implicated by the depth of a particular trench, without regard to an individual worker's precise position in it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The notion that having workers stand on a laid pipe within a trench is a satisfactory method of protecting them from the risk of cave-ins is nonsense.  While the regulations are performance-oriented, they only allow employers to choose from a limited universe of acceptable procedures, not to jury-rig convenient alternatives and impose them on an imperilled work force.  See Conie Constr., Inc. v. Reich, 73 F.3d 382, 384 (D.C.Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.  Because the excavation regulation applies to the trench in question whereas the depth exception does not, the Commission's resolution of Violation C must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>D. Unpreventable Employee Misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission rejected the petitioner's affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct (the UEM defense).  The petitioner challenges this determination as a matter of law and as a matter of fact.  We reject both challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act requires that an employer do everything reasonably within its power to ensure that its personnel do not violate safety standards.  But if an employer lives up to that billing and an employee nonetheless fails to use proper equipment or otherwise ignores firmly established safety measures, it seems unfair to hold the employer liable.  To address this dilemma, both OSHRC and the courts have recognized the availability of the UEM defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contours of the UEM defense are relatively well defined.  To reach safe harbor, an employer must demonstrate that it (1) established a work rule to prevent the reckless behavior and/or unsafe condition from occurring, (2) adequately communicated the rule to its employees, (3) took steps to discover incidents of noncompliance, and (4) effectively enforced the rule whenever employees transgressed it.  See New York State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp. v. Secretary of Labor, 88 F.3d 98, 105 (2d Cir.1996);  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 458-59;  Jensen Constr.  Co., 7 O.S.H. Cas.  (BNA) 1477, 1479 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employer must shoulder the burden of proving all four elements of the UEM defense.  See Brock v. L.E. Myers Co., 818 F.2d 1270, 1276 (6th Cir.1987);  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 459.   Sustaining this burden requires more than pious platitudes:  \"an employer must do all it feasibly can to prevent foreseeable hazards, including dangerous conduct by its employees.\"  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 458;  accord H.B. Zachry Co. v. OSHRC, 638 F.2d 812, 818 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mainstay of Gioioso's argument is that the ALJ unnecessarily required repetitive documentary proof referable to the UEM defense.  But this is smoke and mirrors;  the record reveals quite clearly that the ALJ applied the appropriate legal standard in a wholly unremarkable way and found that the employer failed to carry the devoir of persuasion on both the implementation and enforcement components of the defense.  This deficit is fatal.  Even if an employer establishes work rules and communicates them to its employees, the defense of unpreventable employee misconduct cannot be sustained unless the employer also proves that it insists upon compliance with the rules and regularly enforces them.  See Centex-Rooney Constr.  Co., 16 O.S.H. CAS.  (BNA) 2127, 2130 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the petitioner's insinuations, the ALJ did not presume to establish a per se rule requiring documentation.  Rather, he counted the absence of documentation against the proponent of the defense in the circumstances of this case.   We cannot fault this approach.  Given the nature of the issue, there is no reason why a factfinder must accept an employer's anecdotal evidence uncritically.  And in this instance, we agree with the ALJ that the absence of any vestige of documentary proof was not only a relevant datum but a telling one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also questions whether the Commission's rejection of its UEM defense is supported by substantial evidence in the record.  After giving due deference to the ALJ's credibility determinations, we conclude that the ruling passes muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the record reflects that Gioioso made a meaningful effort to develop a satisfactory safety program, it is much less conclusive on the issues of implementation and enforcement.  The petitioner's best case is that it distributes safety manuals to all new employees;  that these manuals contain information regarding, inter alia, the lifting of loads, methods of trench protection, and the proper placement of ladders in trenches;  and that it supplements these materials in various ways.  The petitioner's safety chairman testified that the company sponsors weekly \"toolbox talks\" at its work sites,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> monthly safety meetings for supervisory personnel, and biennial safety seminars for all employees.  But this evidence left some fairly conspicuous gaps as to the content of the training exercises, who conducted each session, and who attended them.  Documentation--say, syllabi or attendance rosters--would have gone a long way toward filling these gaps, but the petitioner proffered none.  Absent such documentation, it cannot persuasively argue that it effectively communicated the rules to its employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found most compelling the lack of any substantial evidence in the record that the petitioner effectively enforced its safety program.  It provided no evidence of unscheduled safety audits or mandatory safety checklists, and no documentation that it ever executed its four-tiered disciplinary policy.  This lacuna in the proof undermines its attempt to mount a viable UEM defense.  See Hamilton Fixture, 16 O.S.H. Cas.  (BNA) 1073, 1090 (1993) (finding the evidence insufficient where there was no proof to establish adequate enforcement even though the written work rule was adequate), aff'd, 28 F.3d 1213 (6th Cir.1994).  Even when a safety program is thorough and properly conceived, lax administration renders it ineffective (and, thus, vitiates reliance on the UEM defense).  See Brock, 818 F.2d at 1274, 1278 (in which the ALJ rejected a UEM defense when the employer could not produce records evidencing employees' receipt of safety manuals, the occurrence of safety meetings, and the like).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brock also illustrates another point which has pertinence here.  The Brock court regarded the circumstances surrounding the actions of the employer's foreman as further evidence that the employer's program was lax.  See id. at 1277.   The case at hand is not dissimilar;  Santone, the petitioner's foreman, in effect acknowledged that his actions directly contravened the company's safety policies.  And while the petitioner argues that a foreman should not be regarded as a supervisor, the company's own safety manual identifies the foreman as the \"safety foreman for his crew,\" instructs employees to \"listen to your foreman\" in respect to safety matters, and directs foremen (along with other company safety officers) to inspect work sites regularly and to enforce safety rules.  Seen in the context of these instructions, the foreman's breach of safety rules supplies the basis for an inference that the employer's implementation of safety procedures and/or its enforcement policies left something to be desired.  See id.;   see also H.B. Zachry, 638 F.2d at 819.   The same circumstance also buttresses the ALJ's finding that Gioioso's employees probably were unaware that a threat of disciplinary action existed for nonobservance of safety rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it bears mentioning that one of the violations (Violation C) is a repeat violation.  Recent violations provide some evidence of ineffective safety enforcement.  See Jensen Constr.  Co., 7 O.S.H. Cas. at 1479 &amp; nn. 5-6.   The ALJ was entitled to draw such an inference here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Taking into account the totality of the circumstances and the allocation of the burden of proof, we find the petitioner's claim that the Commission improperly rejected its UEM defense to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is denied and dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The exquisite timing of this coincidence suggests that Emerson's epigram (\"Wherever a man commits a crime, God finds a witness.\"   Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"Natural Religion,\" Essays (1875)) may apply to breaches of administrative regulations as well as to violations of the criminal code</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> A serious violation occurs</p>\n        <p>if there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes which have been adopted or are in use ... unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.</p>\n        <p>29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(k).  While the OSH Act does not define the term \"repeat violation,\" courts typically require proof that the respondent violated the same standard on an earlier occasion in a substantially similar fashion.  See, e.g., D &amp; S Grading Co. v. Secretary of Labor, 899 F.2d 1145, 1147 (11th Cir.1990);  Bunge Corp. v. Secretary of Labor, 638 F.2d 831, 836-37 (5th Cir.1981);  George Hyman Constr.  Co. v. OSHRC, 582 F.2d 834, 838-39 (4th Cir.1978).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> By its inaction, the Commission effectively adopted the ALJ's recommended findings and report.

It provides, inter alia, that a PDR should state specifically why review should be directed, including whether the ALJ's \"decision raises an important question of law, policy or discretion\" and \"whether review by the Commission will resolve a question about which the Commission's [ALJs] have rendered differing opinions.\"   These directives would be emptied of meaning if we construed the statute to relieve the aggrieved party of any responsibility to identify issues with particularity in the PDR itself</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The footnote reads in its entirety:</p>\n        <p>Gioioso moved to recuse the ALJ based upon the fact that the ALJ had previously prosecuted Gioioso for similar citations while a solicitor and that prosecution could impact the ALJ's judgment in this case.  The ALJ denied the motion.  Later, Complainant introduced into evidence the settlement agreement in that case to establish the appropriateness of the penalty in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To be sure, some courts have speculated that \"[b]road language in a petition for review might be sufficient to satisfy this requirement.\"  Power Plant Div., Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v.

But short of holding that the Commission is satisfactorily alerted to an issue if it appears anywhere in the record below (a proposition that we already have rejected), no court has suggested that so nondescript a reference as is contained in the quoted footnote is enough to satisfy the imperative of section 660(a)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The record in this case aptly illustrates the wisdom of this conclusion.

OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112561\"><a href=\"/opinion/112561/martin-v-occupational-safety-and-health-review-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 151, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112561\"><a href=\"/opinion/112561/martin-v-occupational-safety-and-health-review-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 651(b)(3).  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces those standards.  See id. &#167;&#167; 658-659, 666.  Citations issued in respect to alleged violations are adjudicated by the Commission.  See id. &#167;&#167; 659, 661.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission operates in the first instance through administrative law judges (ALJs), who function as hearing officers.  See id. &#167; 661(j).  After hearing a contested matter, the ALJ prepares a report.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.90(a) (1996).  A member of the Commission may direct review of a report on his own motion (as long as he does so within 30 days after the docketing date, see id. &#167; 2200.92(b)), or on application of an aggrieved party.  See id. &#167; 2200.91(a).  The instrument by which an aggrieved party solicits the Commission's attention is called a petition for discretionary review (PDR), and the party must file it within a prescribed 20-day period following the docketing date.  See id. &#167; 2200.91(b).  The ALJ's report becomes the final order of the Commission unless review is granted \"on or before the thirtieth day following the [docketing] date.\"  Id. &#167; 2200.90(d).  In other words, the Commission's failure to act on a PDR within the stipulated 30-day period is tantamount to a denial of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether a final order comes about through action or inaction on the Commission's part, an aggrieved party may seek judicial review of it in the appropriate court of appeals.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE ORIGINS OF THE DISPUTE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gioioso is in the construction industry, specializing in utilities.  Some time ago, it contracted with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) to lay water lines in Winthrop, Massachusetts.  During a lengthy period beginning in 1993, it laid several thousand feet of pipe under or near the access road to MWRA's Deer Island work site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of its endeavors, Gioioso dug an 18-foot-long trench at the intersection of Shirley and Taft Avenues.  On October 6, 1994, Gioioso's foreman, Salvatore Santone, and a laborer, Fernando Camara, were standing in this trench.  At that moment, several OSHA compliance officers happened to pass by the work site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The meandering traffic afforded the compliance officers a clear view of the trench and one of their number, Edward Wells, did not like what he saw:  the trench's walls were unsloped and unsupported, the two workmen standing in the trench were visible only from the shoulders up, and a ten-foot section of cast metal pipe was suspended aloft from the bucket of a piece of heavy construction equipment located at one end of the trench.  Wells sounded the alarm (figuratively speaking) and the driver stopped the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of Wells' colleagues, Patrick Griffin, exited the vehicle and hurried toward the trench.  Griffin noticed that the dangling pipe was connected to the bucket of a large excavating machine by only a single attachment point and watched as it rotated into a position parallel to the trench and directly over the workmen's heads.  When Griffin reached the trench, he discovered that it measured no less than six feet deep and four feet wide and had been dug in gravelly soil.  No trench box was in place to guard against a cave-in (although Santone claimed that he and Camara had been measuring the trench to ascertain if it could accommodate one).  Moreover, because the trench lay adjacent to the only road providing access to Deer Island, vibrations from traffic increased the risk of a cave-in.  A gas pipe, six inches in diameter, traversed the width of the trench.  Wells corroborated many of Griffin's observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, OSHA issued citations alleging three serious violations (one of which the Secretary later withdrew) and a repeat violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The two serious violations (which we shall label \"A\" and \"B\") were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Permitting employees to work beneath the suspended pipe in violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.651(e) (1996) (which instructs that \"[n]o employee shall be permitted underneath loads handled by lifting or digging equipment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Permitting workers to use a ladder that did not extend at least three feet above the top of the trench in violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.1053(b)(1) (1996) (which directs that \"[w]hen portable ladders are used for access to an upper landing surface, the ladder side rails shall extend at least 3 feet (.9m) above the upper landing\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The repeat violation (which we shall label \"C\") was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Failing to provide an adequate protective system for workers in an unshored trench, in violation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1) (1996) (which provides that, except when excavations are made entirely in stable rock or are less than five feet in depth, \"[e]ach employee in an excavation shall be protected from cave-ins by an adequate protective system\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner filed a timely notice of contest.  At the outset of the hearing, it moved for disqualification on the ground that the ALJ, several years earlier (while employed as an attorney in the Department of Labor), had prosecuted one or more similar cases involving Gioioso.  The ALJ refused to recuse himself.  After considering the evidence, he found that the violations had in fact occurred, accepted OSHA's characterizations of them, and imposed penalties of $1,600 for each of the two serious violations and $8,000 for the repeat violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gioioso petitioned the Commission for discretionary review of the ALJ's decision.  Its PDR called attention to only three issues (described infra Part IV).  The PDR generated no interest and the ALJ's decision ripened into the Commission's final order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Gioioso then sought a judicial anodyne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the jurisdictional quandary.  In pressing its cause before this court, the petitioner raises not only the three issues which it enumerated in the PDR but also three additional issues, namely, whether the ALJ erred in (1) failing to recuse himself, (2) characterizing violation B as serious, and (3) assessing substantial penalties.  The question, then, is whether Gioioso's failure to press these points in the PDR constitutes a forfeiture of the right to bring them before a reviewing court.  We think that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  In the administrative state, exhaustion of administrative remedies is \"generally required.\"  Weinberger v. Salfi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109308\"><a href=\"/opinion/109308/weinberger-v-salfi/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 765, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109308\"><a href=\"/opinion/109308/weinberger-v-salfi/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2457</span></a></span>, 2467, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109308\"><a href=\"/opinion/109308/weinberger-v-salfi/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span> (1975).  This requirement is more than a matter of form.  \"Insisting on exhaustion forces parties to take administrative proceedings seriously, allows administrative agencies an opportunity to correct their own errors, and potentially avoids the need for judicial involvement altogether.\"  Portela-Gonzalez v. Secretary of the Navy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738223\"><a href=\"/opinion/738223/astrid-l-portela-gonzalez-v-secretary-of-the-navy/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.1997).  In this way, the exhaustion doctrine creates a win-win situation:  adhering to it simultaneously enhances the efficacy of the agency, fosters judicial efficiency, and safeguards the integrity of the inter-branch review relationship.  See Power Plant Div., Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"400962\"><a href=\"/opinion/400962/power-plant-division-brown-root-inc-v-occupational-safety-and-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 113 (5th Cir.1982);  see also Ezratty v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390295\"><a href=\"/opinion/390295/laurice-j-ezratty-v-the-commonwealth-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 774 (1st Cir.1981) (stating that the \"doctrine serves interests of accuracy, efficiency, agency autonomy and judicial economy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act warmly embraces the exhaustion doctrine.  It provides in relevant part that persons such as Gioioso who are \"adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Commission\" may obtain judicial review in the \"court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation is alleged to have occurred.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).  The right to judicial review, however, is carefully cabined.  Congress specifically directed that \"[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"  Id. The regulations complement the statute, explaining that an aggrieved party's failure to file a PDR \"may foreclose court review of the objections to the [ALJ's] decision.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interestingly, the commentary accompanying this part of the regulations directs the reader to the Third Circuit's opinion in Keystone Roofing Co. v. OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"338333\"><a href=\"/opinion/338333/keystone-roofing-company-inc-v-occupational-safety-and-health-review/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1976), for guidance.  The Keystone court considered the question of whether the OSH Act \"permits a reviewing court to consider an employer's objection to an OSHA citation which was argued to the OSHA hearing examiner, but which was neither the subject of a petition to the ... [Commission] for discretionary review, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91, nor the subject of review by the full Commission at the direction of a single member, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 661(i).\"  Id. at 961.   The court answered this question in the negative.  See id. at 964.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the rule announced in Keystone makes eminently good sense both textually (that is, as a matter of statutory interpretation) and practically (that is, as a matter of policy), the petitioner attempts to elude its grasp.  Gioioso first notes that the regulations say only that an aggrieved party's failure to file a PDR \"may foreclose court review of ... objections to the [ALJ's] decision.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91(f) (emphasis supplied).  Gioioso contends that the use of the word \"may\" implies that raising the objections in the PDR is not a prerequisite to judicial review.  We disagree.  For one thing, the regulations cannot alter the statutory scheme.  For another thing, the statute leaves a door ajar for cases in which extraordinary circumstances obtain.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).  The regulation's use of the verb \"may\" is no doubt intended to preserve this narrow exception to the exhaustion doctrine, not to widen it beyond all recognition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner has a fallback position.  It maintains that it in fact \"urged\" the three omitted issues \"before the Commission\" in the statutorily required sense.  The linchpin of this assertion is the petitioner's claim that urging an objection before the ALJ is functionally and legally equivalent to urging it before the Commission.  The Fifth Circuit has encouraged the petitioner's view, suggesting in dicta that an objection might be preserved for judicial review if the aggrieved party articulated it sufficiently before the ALJ.  See Cleveland Consolidated, Inc. v. OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390870\"><a href=\"/opinion/390870/9-osh-casbna-1563-9-osh-casbna-2043-1981-oshd-cch-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1165 (5th Cir.1981) (assuming, without deciding, that an issue had been preserved for judicial review because it was \"evident from the record below,\" even though the aggrieved party did not specify it in the PDR).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dictum distorts the clear congressional intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We believe it follows from the bifurcation of duties contained in the statutory scheme, as well as from plain meaning, that the OSH Act precludes judicial review of those objections not urged in front of the Commission.  To be specific, the OSH Act acknowledges the existence of two separate adjudicators--the Commission and the ALJs--and assigns very different responsibilities to each.  The Commission members, whom the President appoints based on their training, expertise, and experience, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 661(a), carry out the broad adjudicatory functions required by the OSH Act.  Conversely, the ALJs' functions are case-specific.  This division of labor carries with it disparate responsibilities, leaving in the Commission's hands the task of ensuring the development of a cohesive body of decisional rules which comport with the objectives of the OSH Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this framework, we think that the wiser course is to construe the statute according to its letter.  Only if an issue is actually called to the attention of the Commission, through the PDR or by a Commission member's spontaneous initiative, will the Commission have the informed opportunity that Congress intended--a meaningful chance to correct a mistake before an order becomes final.  Thus, the model that Congress envisioned can function optimally only if the aggrieved party alerts the Commission to those issues which that party thinks are worthy of review.  Accord McGowan v. Marshall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369239\"><a href=\"/opinion/369239/john-w-mcgowan-v-f-ray-marshall-secretary-of-labor-and-occupational/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 890-91 (5th Cir.1979);  Keystone, 539 F.2d at 963.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language set forth in the OSH Act drives home the point.  While the statute recognizes the existence of both the Commission and the ALJs, compare &#167; 661(a) with &#167; 661(e), it specifically precludes judicial review of those issues which \"h[ave] not been urged before the Commission.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a) (emphasis supplied).  In our view, the omission of the term \"ALJ\" or words of like import from section 660(a) can only be regarded as intentional, not inadvertent.  See Russello v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Singer, Sutherland Stat.  Const. &#167; 47.23 (5th ed.1992) (explaining that the inference that an omission is an intentional exclusion is strengthened \"where a thing is provided in one part of the statute and omitted in another\").  In short, we agree with the Fifth Circuit's statement, albeit in a case that predates Cleveland Consolidated, that \"[t]he language of section 660(a) indicates that proceedings targeted towards the Commission, not those before the ALJs, are the predicate to judicial review.\"  McGowan, 604 F.2d at 890.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the statute is not only plain, but it is also fortified by the regulations (which, if ambiguity lurks, are deserving of deference, see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Against this backdrop, we are persuaded that merely raising an issue before the ALJ--no matter how clearly--fails to preserve the issue for judicial review.  Something more is needed:  the issue thereafter must be brought to the Commission's attention either by its inclusion in a PDR or by the unilateral act of a single commissioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this conclusion, we next examine the PDR which Gioioso filed.  We find absolutely no reference in it either to the alleged mischaracterization of the ladder violation or to the supposedly excessive nature of the penalty assessments.  Because Gioioso failed to urge these objections before the Commission, we are without jurisdiction to entertain them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recusal issue presents a variation on the theme.  Although the PDR did not list this objection as an issue for review, there was a glancing mention of it in a footnote.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The petitioner claims to have preserved the issue in this fashion.  But the exhaustion doctrine demands more than oblique references, and the statute's use of the verb \"urge\" in this contest is telling.  See Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1300 (10th ed.1993) (defining \"urge\" as meaning \"to present, advocate, or demand earnestly or pressingly\" or \"to declare, advance, or press earnestly a statement, argument, charge or claim\");  The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1965 (3d ed.1992) (defining \"urge\" as \"[t]o entreat earnestly and often repeatedly;  exhort ... [t]o present a forceful argument, claim, or case\").  In an OSHA case, an objection is not \"urged\" in the requisite sense (and will not be deemed preserved for judicial review) unless the PDR conveys the substance of the objection face up and squarely, in a manner reasonably calculated to alert the Commission to the crux of the perceived problem.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's treatment of the recusal issue fails to meet this benchmark.  As the PDR reads, the matter of recusal is little more than a passing comment, designed to provide information buttressing another argument rather than to carve out an independent ground for inquiry.  Since the footnote failed to place the Commission on proper notice, it did not suffice to preserve the issue of recusal for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The upshot of the matter is simply this:  in order to effectuate the statute that Congress wrote and assure the efficiency, effectiveness, and autonomy of the administrative structure, an aggrieved party desiring to preserve an issue for judicial review must raise it before the ALJ, articulate it clearly in its PDR, and offer a modicum of developed argumentation in support of it.  See Durez Div. of Occidental Chem.  Corp. v. OSHA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543586\"><a href=\"/opinion/543586/durez-division-of-occidental-chemical-corp-v-occupational-safety-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (D.C.Cir.1990) (refusing to hear an issue listed as one of five issues in the PDR, but neither discussed nor supported by citations of authority therein);  see also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.91(d) (\"[A] petition should concisely state the portions of the decision for which review is sought.\");   cf.

THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction to hear three of the petitioner's six objections marks only the end of the beginning.  We still must resolve the three preserved claims, namely, (1) whether substantial evidence supports the finding that the petitioner's employees worked below a suspended pipe (Violation A);  (2) whether the Commission erred in finding that the petitioner's employees were exposed to trench-related hazards without an adequate protection system (Violation C);  and (3) whether the record supports the rejection of the petitioner's unpreventable employee misconduct defense.  We discuss each of these contentions separately, pausing first to delineate certain principles affecting the standard of appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>A.

See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44 &amp; n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-83 &amp; n. 11;  Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.

The impetus for deference escalates when the agency interprets its own regulations.  See Lyng v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span> (1965).  In the final analysis, a reviewing court should respect an agency's interpretation of its own regulation as long as the interpretation meshes sensibly with the regulation's language and purpose.  See Martin, 499 U.S. at 151, 111 S.Ct. at 1176.   These principles apply to the regulations that the Secretary of Labor promulgated to implement the OSH Act.  See id. at 152, 111 S.Ct. at 1176-77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a), incorporates the basic judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.  Under those provisions, agency determinations should be upheld unless they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"  5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's findings of fact are conclusive as long as they are \"supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a).  The Court delineated the contours of the \"substantial evidence\" standard nearly half a century ago in Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 477, 491, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></span> (1951), and they are by now too familiar to warrant repetition.  We mention specially, however, that the standard applies with undiminished force where, as here, an administrative body, like the Commission, does not itself hear witnesses but instead adopts an ALJ's findings of fact.  See Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 170 v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607108\"><a href=\"/opinion/607108/truck-drivers-helpers-union-local-no-170-v-national-labor-relations/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span>, 998-99 (1st Cir.1993).  As a corollary to the standard, the hearing examiner's credibility determinations are entitled to great deference.  See General Dynamics Corp. v. OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"366528\"><a href=\"/opinion/366528/7-osh-casbna-1373-1979-oshd-cch-p-23573-general-dynamics/\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 463 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>B. Violation A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission found that Gioioso breached the excavation standard, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.651(e), which mandates that \"[n]o employee shall be permitted underneath loads handled by lifting or digging equipment.\"   The petitioner assigns error.  We see none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The citation underpinning Violation A states in relevant part that Gioioso's personnel \"were exposed to serious injury while working in a trench in which a section of 12\" water line was being lowered.\"   In adjudicating this citation, the ALJ credited the testimony of two compliance officers who described seeing a ten-foot section of cast metal pipe suspended from the bucket of an excavating machine by a chain sling.  As the pipe moved, it rotated around the single point of suspension and passed over the heads of the men who were working in the trench.  While the observations of the two compliance officers were not entirely congruent, the ALJ determined that the modest discrepancies in their accounts were easily explained by the officers' differing vantage points.  He also found that a photograph taken shortly thereafter corroborated their testimony.  Keeping in mind the frailty of Gioioso's rebuttal--its foreman, Santone, stated only that he did not recall the pipe passing overhead--there is no principled basis on which a court could justify substituting its judgment for the factfinder's.  See General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 463.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>C. Violation C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission found that Gioioso failed to provide an adequate protective system within the trench, thereby violating 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1).  The petitioner again spies error.  We do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the petitioner neglected to furnish a support system, shield system, or other adequate safeguarding within the trench as required by 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(c).  Additionally, the petitioner failed to comply with the provisions of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(b)(1)(i) (which delineates a protection option accomplished by the gradual sloping of the excavation's walls).  But the regulations exempt some unsloped excavations that are less than five feet in depth, see id. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1)(ii), and the petitioner seeks the shelter of this exemption.  The petitioner hypothesizes that its workers never were exposed to the hazards inherent in an excavation exceeding five feet in depth because they were standing on a pipe that traversed the width of the trench.  The ALJ rejected this defense:  although he believed it was unlikely that the workmen were standing on the floor of the trench when the compliance officers arrived, he found that \"no matter where they were standing, [they] were still inside a trench that was not protected in accordance with &#167; 1926.652(a)(1).\"   We review this essentially legal judgment de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ relied heavily on Ford Dev.  Corp., 15 O.S.H. Cas.  (BNA) 2003 (1992).  There, the employer claimed that its employees were supposed to stand on a pipe while in a trench, and that in so doing they effectively would be exposed to a depth of only 3.5 feet (the distance from the upper surface of the pipe to the top of the trench).  The Commission rejected this argument.  It noted that the depth exception applies only if an excavation is \"less than 5 feet (1.52m) in depth and examination of the ground by a competent person provides no indication of a potential cave-in.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.652(a)(1)(ii).  The Commission then explained that \"[t]he standard speaks of the depth of the trench, not of the position of employees in the trench.\"   Ford Dev.  Corp., 15 O.S.H. Cas. at 2011.   On this basis, the Commission held that the depth exception did not apply.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasoning in Ford embodies a sensible construction of the regulation--and one that comports with its wording and purpose.  The safety standard is implicated by the depth of a particular trench, without regard to an individual worker's precise position in it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The notion that having workers stand on a laid pipe within a trench is a satisfactory method of protecting them from the risk of cave-ins is nonsense.  While the regulations are performance-oriented, they only allow employers to choose from a limited universe of acceptable procedures, not to jury-rig convenient alternatives and impose them on an imperilled work force.  See Conie Constr., Inc. v. Reich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710865\"><a href=\"/opinion/710865/conie-construction-inc-v-robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 384 (D.C.Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.  Because the excavation regulation applies to the trench in question whereas the depth exception does not, the Commission's resolution of Violation C must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>D. Unpreventable Employee Misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission rejected the petitioner's affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct (the UEM defense).  The petitioner challenges this determination as a matter of law and as a matter of fact.  We reject both challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OSH Act requires that an employer do everything reasonably within its power to ensure that its personnel do not violate safety standards.  But if an employer lives up to that billing and an employee nonetheless fails to use proper equipment or otherwise ignores firmly established safety measures, it seems unfair to hold the employer liable.  To address this dilemma, both OSHRC and the courts have recognized the availability of the UEM defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contours of the UEM defense are relatively well defined.  To reach safe harbor, an employer must demonstrate that it (1) established a work rule to prevent the reckless behavior and/or unsafe condition from occurring, (2) adequately communicated the rule to its employees, (3) took steps to discover incidents of noncompliance, and (4) effectively enforced the rule whenever employees transgressed it.  See New York State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp. v. Secretary of Labor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721309\"><a href=\"/opinion/721309/new-york-state-electric-gas-corporation-v-secretary-of-labor-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 105 (2d Cir.1996);  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 458-59;  Jensen Constr.  Co., 7 O.S.H. Cas.  (BNA) 1477, 1479 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employer must shoulder the burden of proving all four elements of the UEM defense.  See Brock v. L.E. Myers Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488550\"><a href=\"/opinion/488550/william-e-brock-secretary-of-labor-v-the-le-myers-company-high/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1270</span></a></span>, 1276 (6th Cir.1987);  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 459.   Sustaining this burden requires more than pious platitudes:  \"an employer must do all it feasibly can to prevent foreseeable hazards, including dangerous conduct by its employees.\"  General Dynamics, 599 F.2d at 458;  accord H.B. Zachry Co. v. OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"386055\"><a href=\"/opinion/386055/h-b-zachry-company-v-occupational-safety-and-health-review-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 818 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mainstay of Gioioso's argument is that the ALJ unnecessarily required repetitive documentary proof referable to the UEM defense.  But this is smoke and mirrors;  the record reveals quite clearly that the ALJ applied the appropriate legal standard in a wholly unremarkable way and found that the employer failed to carry the devoir of persuasion on both the implementation and enforcement components of the defense.  This deficit is fatal.  Even if an employer establishes work rules and communicates them to its employees, the defense of unpreventable employee misconduct cannot be sustained unless the employer also proves that it insists upon compliance with the rules and regularly enforces them.  See Centex-Rooney Constr.  Co., 16 O.S.H. CAS.  (BNA) 2127, 2130 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the petitioner's insinuations, the ALJ did not presume to establish a per se rule requiring documentation.  Rather, he counted the absence of documentation against the proponent of the defense in the circumstances of this case.   We cannot fault this approach.  Given the nature of the issue, there is no reason why a factfinder must accept an employer's anecdotal evidence uncritically.  And in this instance, we agree with the ALJ that the absence of any vestige of documentary proof was not only a relevant datum but a telling one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also questions whether the Commission's rejection of its UEM defense is supported by substantial evidence in the record.  After giving due deference to the ALJ's credibility determinations, we conclude that the ruling passes muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the record reflects that Gioioso made a meaningful effort to develop a satisfactory safety program, it is much less conclusive on the issues of implementation and enforcement.  The petitioner's best case is that it distributes safety manuals to all new employees;  that these manuals contain information regarding, inter alia, the lifting of loads, methods of trench protection, and the proper placement of ladders in trenches;  and that it supplements these materials in various ways.  The petitioner's safety chairman testified that the company sponsors weekly \"toolbox talks\" at its work sites,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> monthly safety meetings for supervisory personnel, and biennial safety seminars for all employees.  But this evidence left some fairly conspicuous gaps as to the content of the training exercises, who conducted each session, and who attended them.  Documentation--say, syllabi or attendance rosters--would have gone a long way toward filling these gaps, but the petitioner proffered none.  Absent such documentation, it cannot persuasively argue that it effectively communicated the rules to its employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found most compelling the lack of any substantial evidence in the record that the petitioner effectively enforced its safety program.  It provided no evidence of unscheduled safety audits or mandatory safety checklists, and no documentation that it ever executed its four-tiered disciplinary policy.  This lacuna in the proof undermines its attempt to mount a viable UEM defense.  See Hamilton Fixture, 16 O.S.H. Cas.  (BNA) 1073, 1090 (1993) (finding the evidence insufficient where there was no proof to establish adequate enforcement even though the written work rule was adequate), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673689\"><a href=\"/opinion/673689/duncan-jeffrey-wayne-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1994).  Even when a safety program is thorough and properly conceived, lax administration renders it ineffective (and, thus, vitiates reliance on the UEM defense).  See Brock, 818 F.2d at 1274, 1278 (in which the ALJ rejected a UEM defense when the employer could not produce records evidencing employees' receipt of safety manuals, the occurrence of safety meetings, and the like).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brock also illustrates another point which has pertinence here.  The Brock court regarded the circumstances surrounding the actions of the employer's foreman as further evidence that the employer's program was lax.  See id. at 1277.   The case at hand is not dissimilar;  Santone, the petitioner's foreman, in effect acknowledged that his actions directly contravened the company's safety policies.  And while the petitioner argues that a foreman should not be regarded as a supervisor, the company's own safety manual identifies the foreman as the \"safety foreman for his crew,\" instructs employees to \"listen to your foreman\" in respect to safety matters, and directs foremen (along with other company safety officers) to inspect work sites regularly and to enforce safety rules.  Seen in the context of these instructions, the foreman's breach of safety rules supplies the basis for an inference that the employer's implementation of safety procedures and/or its enforcement policies left something to be desired.  See id.;   see also H.B. Zachry, 638 F.2d at 819.   The same circumstance also buttresses the ALJ's finding that Gioioso's employees probably were unaware that a threat of disciplinary action existed for nonobservance of safety rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it bears mentioning that one of the violations (Violation C) is a repeat violation.  Recent violations provide some evidence of ineffective safety enforcement.  See Jensen Constr.  Co., 7 O.S.H. Cas. at 1479 &amp; nn. 5-6.   The ALJ was entitled to draw such an inference here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Taking into account the totality of the circumstances and the allocation of the burden of proof, we find the petitioner's claim that the Commission improperly rejected its UEM defense to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is denied and dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The exquisite timing of this coincidence suggests that Emerson's epigram (\"Wherever a man commits a crime, God finds a witness.\"   Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"Natural Religion,\" Essays (1875)) may apply to breaches of administrative regulations as well as to violations of the criminal code</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> A serious violation occurs</p>\n        <p>if there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes which have been adopted or are in use ... unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.</p>\n        <p>29 U.S.C. &#167; 666(k).

It provides, inter alia, that a PDR should state specifically why review should be directed, including whether the ALJ's \"decision raises an important question of law, policy or discretion\" and \"whether review by the Commission will resolve a question about which the Commission's [ALJs] have rendered differing opinions.\"   These directives would be emptied of meaning if we construed the statute to relieve the aggrieved party of any responsibility to identify issues with particularity in the PDR itself</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The footnote reads in its entirety:</p>\n        <p>Gioioso moved to recuse the ALJ based upon the fact that the ALJ had previously prosecuted Gioioso for similar citations while a solicitor and that prosecution could impact the ALJ's judgment in this case.  The ALJ denied the motion.  Later, Complainant introduced into evidence the settlement agreement in that case to establish the appropriateness of the penalty in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To be sure, some courts have speculated that \"[b]road language in a petition for review might be sufficient to satisfy this requirement.\"  Power Plant Div., Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. OSHRC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"394837\"><a href=\"/opinion/394837/power-plant-division-brown-root-inc-v-occupational-safety-and-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span>, 1294 (5th Cir.1981) (quoting Cleveland Consolidated, 649 F.2d at 1164-65).   But short of holding that the Commission is satisfactorily alerted to an issue if it appears anywhere in the record below (a proposition that we already have rejected), no court has suggested that so nondescript a reference as is contained in the quoted footnote is enough to satisfy the imperative of section 660(a)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The record in this case aptly illustrates the wisdom of this conclusion.  A compliance officer, Griffin, testified to the close proximity of traffic on the adjacent roads and warned that this could cause vibrations along the trench walls, thus heightening the risk of a cave-in.  If a cave-in occurred in a trench of this depth, Griffin believed that workers within it would \"probably ... be buried\" regardless of where they were standing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The safety chairman submitted a newsletter published by the National Utility Contractors Association summarizing various representative \"toolbox talks.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
