Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Mark S. Horrigan for appellant.\r\n   Guy P. Tully, with whom Joan Ackerstein and Jackson, Lewis,\r\nSchnitzler &amp; Krupman were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\nMay 8, 1998\r\n\nLynch, Circuit Judge.  David Thomas worked for Sears,\r\nRoebuck &amp; Co. for twenty-seven years.  Thomas performed well during\r\nhis career, and before the events in 1995 that led to this lawsuit\r\nhe was offered promotions to Sears corporate headquarters in\r\nIllinois, which he declined for personal reasons.  Thomas was\r\nterminated from his position as the Sears Automotive District\r\nBusiness Manager for the Boston District (Automotive District #285)\r\nin 1996 during a restructuring of Sears' automotive business.\r\nThomas brought suit, claiming that the termination of his\r\nemployment was motivated by unlawful age discrimination and that\r\nSears defamed him.  He also alleged that Steven Moore, a Sears\r\ncorporate headquarters employee, tortiously interfered with his\r\ncontract and advantageous relations with Sears.  The district court\r\ngranted summary judgment in favor of both defendants.  Finding no\r\nerror in the district court's judgment, we affirm.\r\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\nde novo, and view all facts in the light most favorable to Thomas,\r\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.  See Aponte-Matosv. Toldeo-Davila, 135 F.3d 182, 186 (1st Cir. 1998).  Summary\r\njudgment is appropriate when the evidence shows \"that there is no\r\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\r\nThe plaintiff bears the \"burden of proving that his years\r\nwere the determinative factor in his discharge, that is, that he\r\nwould not have been fired but for his age.\"  Freeman v. Package\r\nMach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1335 (1st Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). \r\nOnce the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of age\r\ndiscrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a\r\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision.  See St.\r\nMary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-7 (1993); Hidalgo v.\r\nOverseas Condado Ins. Agencies, Inc., 120 F.3d 328, 334 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  The plaintiff must then show that the employer's proffered\r\nreason is a pretext for age discrimination.  See Hicks, 509 U.S. at\r\n515; Hidalgo, 120 F.3d at 335.\r\nTo avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff must \"elucidate\r\nspecific facts which would enable a jury to find the reason given\r\n[by the employer] was not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover\r\nup the employer's real motive: age discrimination.\"  Medina-Munozv. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n(citations omitted).  This Thomas has failed to do.  Assuming that\r\nThomas established a prima facie case, we agree with the district\r\ncourt that the undisputed evidence shows that Thomas did not meet\r\nhis burden of showing he was fired as a result of age\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nStarting in 1993, Sears underwent a process of\r\nreorganization which resulted in a newly-formed Sears Tire Group. \r\nThere were fewer managerial positions in this new Group than in the\r\nprior automotive organization.  Accordingly, some people, including\r\nThomas, were laid off.  Each manager was evaluated according to\r\nneutral criteria.  The criteria included the performance of the\r\ndistrict under that person's management.  Points for twelve types\r\nof \"leadership skills\" were assigned by both the home office\r\nassessment team and by Sears personnel within the manager's\r\ndistrict.  These points were added in a weighted average formula. \r\nThe overall performance of the manager's district in 1993 and 1994\r\nwas converted into points and these points were added to the\r\nleadership skills score to arrive at an overall score.  Thomas\r\nreceived low ratings on \"change leadership skills,\" due to his\r\nadmittedly vocal and intense disagreement with the new Sears\r\nbusiness plan.  His district also had not done well during the\r\nperiod under review.  Thomas' overall score was not high enough to\r\nresult in his retention.\r\nTo counter Sears' articulation of a non-discriminatory\r\nreason, Thomas challenges the assessment methodology and points to\r\nseveral statements.  One statement is a comment attributed to\r\nWilliam McCall in September of 1995 that a number of people \"had\r\nbeen around for a long time\" and when Sears reorganized there would\r\nbe a difference.  That statement appears to have been literally\r\ntrue.  The other statements, attributed to Steven Moore, were that\r\nThomas \"had been around too long\" and \"wasn't able to change,\" and\r\nthat Thomas' \"days were numbered.\"  Even if these remarks are,\r\ndubitante, interpreted as age animus, Thomas still has not produced\r\nsufficient evidence to meet his burden of showing that age\r\ndiscrimination was the real reason for the termination of his\r\nemployment.  See Hicks 509 U.S. at 515 (\"[A] reason cannot be\r\nproved to be 'a pretext for discrimination' unless it is shown both\r\nthat the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real\r\nreason.\").\r\nIn context, the inference of discrimination is, at best,\r\nvery weak, in light of Thomas' statement that he was outspoken in\r\nhis disagreement with Sears' change in business philosophy. \r\nPlaintiff in fact agreed that at least part of the motivation to\r\nselect him for layoff was his disagreement with the company's\r\nchange in business philosophy.  Under such circumstances, a\r\ncriticism that someone is unable to change is not a coded allusion\r\ncloaking age discrimination.  This gives added weight to the usual\r\nrule that stray comments are insufficient to meet the plaintiff's\r\nburden in an ADEA case.  See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950\r\nF.2d 816, 826 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n   As to Thomas' defamation claims, we agree with the\r\ndistrict court that the purported defamatory statements were not\r\nactionable and were protected by the employer's conditional\r\nprivilege.  The claims of libel and slander arise out of comments\r\nmade in internal company feedback and deficiency memoranda that\r\nwere drafted after visits to Thomas' district, and a comment\r\nattributed to an employee that Thomas was disloyal, a troublemaker\r\nand negative on automotive issues.  Under Massachusetts law, Sears'\r\ninternal business communications are protected by a conditional\r\nbusiness privilege.  See Masso v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., Inc.,\r\n884 F. Supp. 610, 621-22 (D. Mass. 1995).  \"'An employer has a\r\nconditional privilege to disclose defamatory information concerning\r\nan employee when the publication is reasonably necessary to serve\r\nthe employer's legitimate interest in the fitness of an employee to\r\nperform his or her job.'\"  McCone v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,\r\n471 N.E.2d 47, 51 (Mass. 1984) (quoting Bratt v. International Bus.\r\nMach. Corp., 467 N.E.2d 126, 129 (Mass. 1984)).  There is no\r\nevidence of reckless publication of the allegedly defamatory\r\nstatements and so there was no forfeiture of the conditional\r\nprivilege.\r\n   Thomas' tort claim for intentional interference with a\r\ncontractual or advantageous relationship also arises out of the\r\nmemoranda.  This claim fails for several reasons.  Because the\r\nmemoranda were within Sears' conditional business privilege, they\r\ncannot support a claim of intentional interference.  Moreover,\r\nThomas has not demonstrated that his supervisors acted out of an\r\nimproper motive or used improper means.  See Walker v. Waltham\r\nHous. Auth., 44 F.3d 1042, 1049 n.1 (1st Cir. 1995) (requiring\r\nimproper motive, not concern for business interests, to be\r\ndemonstrated); King v. Driscoll, 638 N.E.2d 488, 494 (Mass. 1994)\r\n(\"One of the elements of intentional interference with contractual\r\nrelations is improper motive or means on the part of the\r\ndefendant.\").  That Thomas and Moore had different views about how\r\nto run the stores, as Thomas admits, does not establish malice, but\r\nrather the contrary.  Thomas has failed to produce any evidence\r\nthat his superiors acted out of anything but concern for what they\r\nperceived to be Sears' legitimate business interests.\r\n   Thomas may well, and understandably, feel that his many\r\nyears of loyal service to Sears should have resulted in a different\r\nend.  But the law protects only against certain conduct and Thomas\r\ndid not prove his case.\r\n   Affirmed.  Costs are awarded to appellees.\n",
