FARQUHARSON,\r\n\n                 Respondent, Appellee.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nSamson Omosefunmi on brief pro se.\r\nDavid W. Ogden, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Michael P.\r\nLindemann, Assistant Director, and Terri J. Scadron, Senior\r\nLitigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJune 4, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of the record and the briefs,\r\nwe find no merit in this appeal.  The district court correctly\r\ndismissed this habeas action because petitioner's attack on the\r\nwithdrawal of his naturalization application raised no claim within\r\nthe scope of 28 U.S.C.  2241. \r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
