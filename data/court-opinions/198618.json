Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   David W. Bate on brief for appellant.\r\n   Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\r\nMcGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 6, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the record and\r\nbriefs, and even assuming that the question were properly\r\nbefore us, we conclude that the district court did not commit\r\nreversible error in refusing defendant's requests for\r\ninstruction and argument on his accomplice witness theory.  As\r\nthe district court explained, the theory was not supported by\r\nsufficient evidence of the witnesses' complicity in the\r\nspecific offense.  See United States v. Olmstead, 832 F.2d 642,\r\n647-48 (1st Cir. 1987).  Moreover, considering the whole of the\r\ninstructions and the evidence of defendant's possession of the\r\npistol, in any event defendant was not prejudiced by the\r\nrefused instruction and argument.  See id.\r\n          We will not override the jury's choice to credit at\r\nleast in part the government's witnesses, and so we reject\r\ndefendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.  See\r\nUnited States v. Lara,     F.3d    ,     No. 97-2215, slip op.\r\nat 40-41 (1st Cir. June 30, 1999) [1999 WL 431140, at *18].\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
