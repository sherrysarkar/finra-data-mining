This case raises an issue of\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nsignificance  in the administration  of criminal justice, one\r\n\nof first impression for this court.  It concerns the power of\r\n\na district court  to resentence on  the counts of  conviction\r\n\nremaining  after  the  sentence  on another  count  has  been\r\n\nvacated on a petition under 28 U.S.C.   2255.  \r\n\n          Isidro Rodriguez was  originally convicted in  1993\r\n\non four cocaine trafficking counts,  see 21 U.S.C.    841(a),\r                                                    \r\n\nfor which he received  a sentence of sixty-three months,  and\r\n\non one  count of using  or carrying a  firearm during and  in\r\n\nrelation  to a  drug trafficking  crime,  in violation  of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.      924(c),  for  which  he   received  a  mandatory,\r\n\nconsecutive sentence of sixty months.  Those convictions were\r\n\naffirmed  on appeal.  See United States v. Rodriguez, 29 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n619 (1st Cir. 1994) (per curiam).\r\n\n          On December  6,  1995, the  Supreme  Court  decided\r\n\nBailey  v.  United States,  116 S.  Ct.  501 (1995).   Bailey\r                                                                         \r\n\nclarified the  definition  of the term  \"use\" in 18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n924(c), changing the  law in  this and  many other  circuits.\r\n\nId.  Relying on Bailey, Rodriguez filed a pro se motion under\r                                                            \r\n\n28 U.S.C.   2255,  seeking to vacate his conviction  on the  \r\n\n924(c)  firearms  count.     The  government  conceded   that\r\n\nRodriguez's conviction  on that  count could not  stand after\r\n\nBailey. \r                  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          On March  1, 1996, the district  court ordered that\r\n\nRodriguez's  conviction and sentence on the   924(c) count be\r\n\nvacated,    thereby  eliminating the  mandatory,  consecutive\r\n\nfive-year sentence.  Rodriguez remains in the custody of  the\r\n\nBureau of Prisons as he has not finished serving his sentence\r\n\nfor the drug trafficking counts.\r\n\n           The  district court appointed counsel to represent\r\n\nRodriguez  and directed the  parties to address  the issue of\r\n\nwhether Rodriguez  could be  resentenced on the  drug counts.\r\n\nThe court also ordered  a revised presentence report (\"PSR\").\r\n\nAfter briefing  and argument,  the district court  ruled that\r\n\nRodriguez's  sentence on  the firearms  count was  part of  a\r\n\nsentencing  calculus based  on the  relationship between  the\r\n\nvarious   counts.     The   court  concluded   that  it   had\r\n\njurisdiction, under    2255  and First Circuit  precedent, to\r\n\nresentence  Rodriguez on  the drug  trafficking counts.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court   accepted   the  factual   conclusions   and\r\n\nGuidelines  application  of the  revised  PSR, including  the\r\n\nPSR's recommendation of a  two-level increase for  possession\r\n\nof a dangerous weapon during a drug offense.   This yielded a\r\n\ntotal  offense level  of 28,  and a  corresponding sentencing\r\n\nrange of seventy-eight to  ninety-seven months.  The district\r\n\ncourt  resentenced Rodriguez to  seventy-eight months  on the\r\n\ndrug  trafficking counts.    That is  less than  his original\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ntotal sentence on all counts of 123 months, but more than his\r\n\noriginal sentence of sixty-three months for the drug counts.\r\n\n          Rodriguez  argues that  the  district court  simply\r\n\nlacked  jurisdiction  to resentence  him  and, further,  that\r\n\ndoing  so  violated  his right  not  to  be  placed twice  in\r\n\njeopardy for the same offense and his right to due process of\r\n\nlaw.\r\n\n          Rodriguez's argument is complicated for  him by the\r\n\nfact  that, under  the  Sentencing Guidelines,  there was  an\r\n\nexplicit interaction  between the sentence  he was originally\r\n\ngiven  on the  drug trafficking  counts  and the  sentence he\r\n\nreceived  on the  firearms count.   The  Guidelines direct  a\r\n\nsentencing  judge  to  increase   the  sentence  for  a  drug\r\n\ntrafficking offense by two  levels where the offense involves\r\n\nthe possession  of a  dangerous weapon, including  a firearm.\r\n\nSee  U.S.S.G.     2D1.1(b)(1).    However,  to  avoid  double\r               \r\n\ncounting, the Guidelines do not permit such an enhancement of\r\n\nthe drug  sentence if the  defendant has also  been convicted\r\n\nunder certain  statutes, including 18 U.S.C.    924(c), which\r\n\nprovide  a  mandatory  minimum  penalty  for  weapons-related\r\n\nconduct.   U.S.S.G.   2K2.4  (comment. n. 2  &amp; backg'd).  For\r\n\nexample, if the jury had acquitted Rodriguez of the  firearms\r\n\noffense  under  18  U.S.C.      924(c),  but  the  judge  had\r\n\nnonetheless found,  by a preponderance of  the evidence, that\r\n\nRodriguez  possessed a  firearm during  the drug  crimes, the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\njudge  should  have,  under  the  Guidelines,  increased  the\r\n\nsentence for the drug offenses.\r\n\n          The  district court  judge apparently  thought that\r\n\nthis resentencing  was similar to that  hypothetical case and\r\n\nso enhanced the  sentence for the drug offenses.  This is, of\r\n\ncourse, an approach abundant with common sense.  It also fits\r\n\nwith the  notion that, where there  are multiple convictions,\r\n\nthe various sentences form a  package meant to work  together\r\n\nand  if part  of the  package of  convictions is  undone, the\r\n\ntrial judge ought to be free to reconsider how all the pieces\r\n\nshould fit together,  in order to do justice and  to meet the\r\n\nrequirements of the Guidelines. \r\n\n          But  such a  common sense  approach to  the problem\r\n\nmust fairly meet Rodriguez's objections that Congress did not\r\n\ngrant jurisdiction  to resentence and that  such an approach,\r\n\nwrit  broadly, poses  far  from hypothetical  dangers to  the\r\n\nconstitutional rights  of a criminal  defendant.  Rodriguez's\r\n\nassertion  is that to increase a sentence as a consequence of\r\n\na defendant's successful challenge to one count of conviction\r\n\npenalizes  the exercise of the right to collaterally attack a\r\n\nconviction.    Such  a sentencing  enhancement  deprives  the\r\n\nprisoner of his settled expectations about the length of  his\r\n\nsentence,   and   violates   the   rule,   embedded  in   our\r\n\njurisprudence,  that a  defendant only  be sentenced  for the\r\n\ncrimes of which he is convicted.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Rodriguez  starts with  an  argument  that  federal\r\n\ntrial  courts have  only  such jurisdiction  as Congress  has\r\n\ngranted and that there is no grant of jurisdiction to revise,\r\n\non  collateral attack,  a  sentence that  has already  become\r\n\nfinal.  Rodriguez argues  that Congress has expressly limited\r\n\na court's  ability to modify  an already imposed  sentence to\r\n\nthe three situations outlined in 18 U.S.C.   3582(c).  Two of\r\n\nthe circumstances described in that  section are inapplicable\r\n\nhere,  and  so,  he contends,  the  district  court  may only\r\n\nresentence him to the  extent \"expressly permitted by statute\r\n\nor  by Rule 35 of  the Federal Rules  of Criminal Procedure.\"\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3582(c)(1)(B).\r\n\n          On direct appeal (in contrast to the   2255  review\r\n\nhere),  this  court has  permitted  resentencing  for a  drug\r\n\ntrafficking conviction where  defendant's   924(c) conviction\r\n\nwas set aside, post-Bailey:\r                                      \r\n\n          Since   it   is   conceivable  that   our\r\n          disposition of the [firearms] count might\r\n          affect the sentencing calculus  in regard\r\n          to the [drug trafficking] count, we honor\r\n          counsels' joint request and remand to the\r\n          district      court     for      possible\r\n          reconsideration    of     the    sentence\r\n          originally    imposed    on   the    drug\r\n          trafficking count.\r\n\nUnited States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 218 (1st Cir. 1995).  At\r                                  \r\n\nleast  seven other circuits  have similarly  determined that,\r\n\nwhen a conviction  under    924(c) is reversed  on appeal  in\r                                                                     \r\n\nlight  of Bailey, it is appropriate to remand to the district\r                            \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ncourt  for resentencing  on the  remaining convictions.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v.  Jackson,  103  F.3d  561,  569  (7th  Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1996)(citing cases).\r\n\n          Rodriguez concedes that such resentencing on remand\r\n\nafter direct  appeal may be  appropriate because 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2106 permits the appellate  court to \"affirm, modify, vacate,\r\n\nset aside or reverse any judgment . . . brought before it for\r\n\nreview\"  and to  \"remand the  cause and  . .  .  require such\r\n\nfurther  proceedings to  be  had as  may  be just  under  the\r\n\ncircumstances.\"    28  U.S.C.    2106.    But that  statutory\r\n\nlanguage  is inapplicable here, Rodriguez argues, because the\r\n\ndrug trafficking convictions in this case have already become\r\n\nfinal after appeal;  thus,   2106's  broad grant of  remedial\r\n\npower  to the appellate court  cannot be read  to empower the\r                                   \r\n\ndistrict court on  a   2255 motion.  Rodriguez further argues\r\n\nthat his    2255  motion only sought  review of his    924(c)\r\n\nsentence  and  convictions,  and  that  his  drug trafficking\r\n\nsentence is therefore not properly \"before\" any court. \r\n\n          We  agree  with  the  basic  tenet  of  Rodriguez's\r\n\nargument:  courts  are not  free  to  resentence  at will;  a\r\n\nstatute  or  Rule  35  must authorize  such  an  exercise  of\r\n\njurisdiction.   See United States  v. Fahm, 13  F.3d 447, 453\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1994)  (district  court lacked  inherent power  to\r\n\n\"correct\"  a sentence  other than  as expressly  permitted by\r\n\nRule 35).\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          However,  Rodriguez's  argument  fails because  the\r\n\nlanguage  of 28 U.S.C.    2255 expressly vests  some power in\r\n\nthe district court:\r\n\n          If  the court finds that the judgment was\r\n          rendered  without  jurisdiction, or  that\r\n          the sentence imposed  was not  authorized\r\n          by  law or  otherwise open  to collateral\r\n          attack,  or that  there has  been such  a\r\n          denial    or    infringement    of    the\r\n          constitutional rights of the  prisoner as\r\n          to  render  the  judgment  vulnerable  to\r\n          collateral attack, the court shall vacate\r\n          and  set the  judgment  aside  and  shall\r\n          discharge the prisoner or  resentence him\r\n          or  grant  a  new trial  or  correct  the\r                                                               \r\n          sentence as may appear appropriate.\r                                                         \r\n\n28 U.S.C.   2255 (emphasis added).\r\n\n          This grant of power to \"correct the sentence as may\r\n\nappear appropriate\" resolves the jurisdictional issue against\r\n\nRodriguez.   In  this,  we agree  with  the Fourth  Circuit's\r\n\ndecision in  United States v.  Hillary, 106  F.3d 1170,  1172\r                                                  \r\n\n(4th Cir. 1997)  and the Seventh Circuit's decision in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Binford, 108 F.3d 723, 728-29 (7th Cir. 1997).  \r                             \r\n\n          This  still  leaves  the  question of  when  it  is\r\n\n\"appropriate\" to \"correct the sentence.\"  In United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSmith,  103 F.3d  531 (7th  Cir.  1996), the  Seventh Circuit\r                 \r\n\nruled in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction to correct the\r\n\nremaining drug  trafficking sentence  where a prisoner,  on a\r\n\nmotion  under    2255,  succeeded in  vacating his  mandatory\r\n\nconsecutive five-year   924(c) sentence.  The Seventh Circuit\r\n\nfound it \"appropriate\" to correct the sentence, because \"[i]f\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\na  multicount sentence is a package  . . . then severing part\r\n\nof the total sentence usually will unbundle it.\"  Id. at 534.\r                                                                 \r\n\n          The Seventh  Circuit further noted,  and we  agree,\r\n\nthat  the  question of  the  \"appropriate\"  exercise of  that\r\n\njurisdiction  cannot turn  entirely on  older  conceptions of\r\n\n\"sentencing  packages\" but  must consider  the effect  of the\r\n\nSentencing  Guidelines.  See id.  at 534-35.  \"The Sentencing\r                                            \r\n\nReform  Act  of  1984  revolutionized  the  manner  in  which\r\n\ndistrict  courts   sentence  persons  convicted   of  federal\r\n\ncrimes.\"  Burns v.

Pimienta-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRedondo, 874 F.2d 9 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc), the defendants\r                   \r\n\nreceived consecutive  sentences for convictions on two counts\r\n\nof  drug trafficking.  On  appeal, this court  ruled that the\r\n\ntwo  counts  of  conviction  actually  constituted  a  single\r\n\noffense, reversed  the defendants' convictions on  one of the\r\n\ncounts,  and remanded for resentencing on the second.  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n11-12.  The district court then resentenced the defendants on\r\n\nthe remaining count  to a term as long as  the combined total\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nof the prior, consecutive  sentences on both counts.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n12.   Defendants again  appealed. The en  banc court rejected\r\n\ndefendants' double   jeopardy  and due process  challenges to\r\n\nthe resentencing, holding that:\r\n\n          [a]fter  an  appellate court  unwraps the\r\n          [sentencing] package and  removes one  or\r\n          more  charges  from  its   confines,  the\r\n          sentencing judge, herself, is in the best\r\n          position  to assess  the  effect  of  the\r\n          withdrawal and to redefine  the package's\r\n          size and shape . . . .\r\n\nId. at 14.  In light of the  concurring opinion of then-Judge\r               \r\n\nBreyer  and  Judge  Campbell, Pimienta-Redondo's  \"sentencing\r                                                          \r\n\npackage\" holding  should be confined to  situations where the\r\n\nsame basic course of conduct underlies both the vacated count\r\n\nand the count on  which the conviction is affirmed,  and that\r\n\nbasic conduct  determines the sentence.   Id. at  17 (Breyer,\r                                                         \r\n\nJ., concurring).  \r\n\n          In  this case, the  Guidelines establish  a similar\r\n\nrelationship of interdependence between the vacated count  of\r\n\nconviction,  the affirmed  count of  conviction, and  the new\r\n\nsentence:  Both Rodriguez's conviction under   924(c) and the\r\n\nenhancement imposed in resentencing  him turn on the presence\r\n\nof a weapon  during a drug trafficking  offense.  Rodriguez's\r                                                           \r\n\nconviction  for that  basic course  of conduct  was affirmed.\r\n\nThe Guidelines  require  sentencing judges  to consider  \"all\r\n\nacts  and omissions . . . that occurred during the commission\r\n\nof  the  offense  of  conviction  .   .  .  .\"    U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n1B1.3(a)(1).  Thus,  under both the  Guidelines and our  pre-\r\n\nGuidelines precedent, Rodriguez's sentence may  be considered\r\n\nas a \"sentencing package.\"  \r\n\n          Rodriguez  argues  that,   because  the      924(c)\r\n\nfirearms sentence was consecutive, it is not part of the same\r\n\n\"sentencing package\"  as his  drug trafficking sentence.   He\r\n\nrelies  on  U.S.S.G.    5G1.2,  which  governs sentencing  on\r\n\nmultiple counts of conviction, and provides:\r\n\n          (a) The sentence to be imposed on a count\r\n          for   which   the   statute  mandates   a\r\n          consecutive sentence  shall be determined\r\n          and imposed independently.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.     5G1.2.   That the  firearms  sentence had  to be\r\n\ncalculated independently  does not mean that  the sentence on\r\n\nthe  drug  counts did  not depend  on  the existence  of that\r\n\nsentence;  to  the contrary,  the Guidelines  specify such  a\r\n\nrelationship. See U.S.S.G.   2K2.4, comment. (n.2 &amp; backg'd).\r                             \r\n\nThus,  we  hold that,  where  the  Guidelines contemplate  an\r\n\ninterdependent  relationship between  the  sentence  for  the\r\n\nvacated  conviction  and  the  sentence   for  the  remaining\r\n\nconvictions -- a sentencing package1 -- a district court may,\r\n\non  a  petition under  28 U.S.C.     2255, resentence  on the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  To the extent that the Seventh Circuit's opinions in\r\nSmith and Binford can be read to permit resentencing whenever\r                             \r\nthere is a sentencing package, and to define a \"sentencing\r\npackage\" as \"the bottom line, the total number of years (or\r\nunder the guidelines, months) which effectuates a sentencing\r\nplan,\" Smith, 103 F.3d at 533, we part company and find it\r                        \r\nunnecessary to state so broad a rule. \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nremaining convictions.2  We leave to another day the question\r\n\nof whether there is such authority when the Guidelines do not\r\n\ncontemplate such an interdependent sentencing package.3  \r\n\n          Rodriguez's  two  constitutional  claims   fare  no\r\n\nbetter  than  does his  jurisdictional  claim.   Because  the\r\n\nconsideration of  acquitted conduct in fashioning  a sentence\r\n\ndoes not,  absent special  circumstances, violate  either the\r\n\nDue Process or the Double Jeopardy Clause,  see United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

To  the extent\r\n\nthat  there are  valid  due process  concerns about  possible\r\n\nvindictiveness  on resentencing, the  safeguards announced by\r\n\nthe Supreme Court in  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395  U.S. 711\r                                                          \r\n\n(1969), and  applied by  this court in  Pimienta-Redondo, 874\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  at 12-14, adequately  address this  problem.

There may be occasions where the authority to resentence\r\nworks in a defendant's favor.  There may be occasions where\r\nthe trial judge believes the interrelationship requires a\r\nreduction in the remaining sentence.  \r\n\n3.  The Sentencing Commission may wish to address this topic.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ncase, no claim of vindictiveness has been, or could be, made.\r\n\n          There  is another  theory  that Rodriguez  advances\r\n\nunder the Due Process Clause.  Relying on Breest v. Helgemoe,\r                                                                        \r\n\n579  F.2d  95 (1st  Cir.  1978),  he argues  that  he was  \"a\r\n\nsubstantial  period of time\" -- more than three years -- into\r\n\nhis  sentence  when  he  was  resentenced,  and  that  it  is\r\n\n\"fundamentally unfair, and thus  violative of due process for\r\n\na  court to alter  even an  illegal sentence  in a  way which\r\n\nfrustrates a prisoner's expectations by postponing  his . . .\r\n\nrelease  date far beyond that  originally set.\"   Id. at 101.\r                                                                 \r\n\nHere, Rodriguez's  new release date  is still more  than four\r\n\nyears   earlier  than   his   original   release  date;   the\r\n\npsychological unfairness  described in Breest is  thus not an\r                                                         \r\n\nissue here.  We acknowledge that, on other facts, due process\r\n\nconcerns could be raised.4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  We have said that there may be limits on the right to\r\ncorrect an erroneous sentence in cases \"with extreme facts: \r\na long delay, actual release of the defendant from custody\r\nbased on the shorter sentence, singling out of the defendant\r\nfor a belated increase apparently because of his commission\r\nof another offense for which parole revocation would have\r\nbeen available, and other troubling characteristics.\"  United\r                                                                         \r\nStates v.

Delay may, in future\r\ncases, be less of an issue because of the strict time limits\r\nthat 28 U.S.C.   2255 now imposes on the filing of petitions.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          We  think  that,  given  the  language  of     2255\r\n\ndiscussed earlier  and the  fact that Rodriguez  is still  in\r\n\ncustody,  he could  have no  settled expectation  of finality\r\n\nwith  respect to a portion of his total sentence which, under\r\n\nthe   Guidelines,  is     part   of  a   sentencing  package.\r\n\nAccordingly,  there is  no violation  of the  Double Jeopardy\r\n\nClause here.  This case does not involve a petitioner who had\r\n\nalready   fully   discharged  his   sentence  and   then  was\r\n\nresentenced, see  United States v.  Silvers, 90 F.3d  95, 101\r                                                       \r\n\n(4th Cir. 1996),  and we  intimate nothing  about the  double\r\n\njeopardy consequences of such a situation.5  Cf. Hillary, 106\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d at 1173.\r\n\n          Affirmed. \r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  This scenario is not farfetched.  Sometimes a case takes\r\nsuch time to wend its way through the court system that the\r\nprisoner is released by the time it is resolved.  And,\r\nbecause convictions carry collateral consequences even after\r\nincarceration has ended, appeals may be brought after release\r\nin an effort to avoid those consequences.  See Ball v. United\r                                                                         \r\nStates, 470 U.S. 856, 864-65 (1985).\r                  \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n",

It concerns the power of a district court to resentence on the counts of conviction remaining after the sentence on another count has been vacated on a petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isidro Rodriguez was originally convicted in 1993 on four cocaine trafficking counts, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a), for which he received a sentence of sixty-three months, and on one count of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), for which he received a mandatory, consecutive sentence of sixty months.  Those convictions were affirmed on appeal.  See United States v. Rodriguez, 29 F.3d 619 (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 6, 1995, the Supreme Court decided Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).  Bailey clarified the definition of the term \"use\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), changing the law in this and many other circuits.  Id. Relying on Bailey, Rodriguez filed a pro se motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, seeking to vacate his conviction on the &#167; 924(c) firearms count.  The government conceded that Rodriguez's conviction on that count could not stand after Bailey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 1, 1996, the district court ordered that Rodriguez's conviction and sentence on the &#167; 924(c) count be vacated, thereby eliminating the mandatory, consecutive five-year sentence.  Rodriguez remains in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons as he has not finished serving his sentence for the drug trafficking counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appointed counsel to represent Rodriguez and directed the parties to address the issue of whether Rodriguez could be resentenced on the drug counts.  The court also ordered a revised presentence report (\"PSR\").  After briefing and argument, the district court ruled that Rodriguez's sentence on the firearms count was part of a sentencing calculus based on the relationship between the various counts.  The court concluded that it had jurisdiction, under &#167; 2255 and First Circuit precedent, to resentence Rodriguez on the drug trafficking counts.  The district court accepted the factual conclusions and Guidelines application of the revised PSR, including the PSR's recommendation of a two-level increase for possession of a dangerous weapon during a drug offense.  This yielded a total offense level of 28, and a corresponding sentencing range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months.  The district court resentenced Rodriguez to seventy-eight months on the drug trafficking counts.  That is less than his original total sentence on all counts of 123 months, but more than his original sentence of sixty-three months for the drug counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez argues that the district court simply lacked jurisdiction to resentence him and, further, that doing so violated his right not to be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense and his right to due process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez's argument is complicated for him by the fact that, under the Sentencing Guidelines, there was an explicit interaction between the sentence he was originally given on the drug trafficking counts and the sentence he received on the firearms count.  The Guidelines direct a sentencing judge to increase the sentence for a drug trafficking offense by two levels where the offense involves the possession of a dangerous weapon, including a firearm.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).  However, to avoid double counting, the Guidelines do not permit such an enhancement of the drug sentence if the defendant has also been convicted under certain statutes, including 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), which provide a mandatory minimum penalty for weapons-related conduct.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4 (comment. n. 2 &amp; backg'd).  For example, if the jury had acquitted Rodriguez of the firearms offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), but the judge had nonetheless found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Rodriguez possessed a firearm during the drug crimes, the judge should have, under the Guidelines, increased the sentence for the drug offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judge apparently thought that this resentencing was similar to that hypothetical case and so enhanced the sentence for the drug offenses.  This is, of course, an approach abundant with common sense.  It also fits with the notion that, where there are multiple convictions, the various sentences form a package meant to work together and if part of the package of convictions is undone, the trial judge ought to be free to reconsider how all the pieces should fit together, in order to do justice and to meet the requirements of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But such a common sense approach to the problem must fairly meet Rodriguez's objections that Congress did not grant jurisdiction to resentence and that such an approach, writ broadly, poses far from hypothetical dangers to the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant.  Rodriguez's assertion is that to increase a sentence as a consequence of a defendant's successful challenge to one count of conviction penalizes the exercise of the right to collaterally attack a conviction.  Such a sentencing enhancement deprives the prisoner of his settled expectations about the length of his sentence, and violates the rule, embedded in our jurisprudence, that a defendant only be sentenced for the crimes of which he is convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez starts with an argument that federal trial courts have only such jurisdiction as Congress has granted and that there is no grant of jurisdiction to revise, on collateral attack, a sentence that has already become final.  Rodriguez argues that Congress has expressly limited a court's ability to modify an already imposed sentence to the three situations outlined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c).  Two of the circumstances described in that section are inapplicable here, and so, he contends, the district court may only resentence him to the extent \"expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal (in contrast to the &#167; 2255 review here), this court has permitted resentencing for a drug trafficking conviction where defendant's &#167; 924(c) conviction was set aside, post-Bailey:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Since it is conceivable that our disposition of the [firearms] count might affect the sentencing calculus in regard to the [drug trafficking] count, we honor counsels' joint request and remand to the district court for possible reconsideration of the sentence originally imposed on the drug trafficking count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 218 (1st Cir.1995).  At least seven other circuits have similarly determined that, when a conviction under &#167; 924(c) is reversed on appeal in light of Bailey, it is appropriate to remand to the district court for resentencing on the remaining convictions.  See United States v. Jackson, 103 F.3d 561, 569 (7th Cir.1996)(citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez concedes that such resentencing on remand after direct appeal may be appropriate because 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106 permits the appellate court to \"affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment ... brought before it for review\" and to \"remand the cause and ... require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106.  But that statutory language is inapplicable here, Rodriguez argues, because the drug trafficking convictions in this case have already become final after appeal;  thus, &#167; 2106's broad grant of remedial power to the appellate court cannot be read to empower the district court on a &#167; 2255 motion.  Rodriguez further argues that his &#167; 2255 motion only sought review of his &#167; 924(c) sentence and convictions, and that his drug trafficking sentence is therefore not properly \"before\" any court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the basic tenet of Rodriguez's argument:  courts are not free to resentence at will;  a statute or Rule 35 must authorize such an exercise of jurisdiction.  See United States v. Fahm, 13 F.3d 447, 453 (1st Cir.1994) (district court lacked inherent power to \"correct\" a sentence other than as expressly permitted by Rule 35).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Rodriguez's argument fails because the language of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 expressly vests some power in the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This grant of power to \"correct the sentence as may appear appropriate\" resolves the jurisdictional issue against Rodriguez.  In this, we agree with the Fourth Circuit's decision in United States v. Hillary, 106 F.3d 1170, 1172 (4th Cir.1997) and the Seventh Circuit's decision in United States v. Binford, 108 F.3d 723, 728-29 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This still leaves the question of when it is \"appropriate\" to \"correct the sentence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Smith, 103 F.3d 531 (7th Cir.1996), the Seventh Circuit ruled in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction to correct the remaining drug trafficking sentence where a prisoner, on a motion under &#167; 2255, succeeded in vacating his mandatory consecutive five-year &#167; 924(c) sentence.  The Seventh Circuit found it \"appropriate\" to correct the sentence, because \"[i]f a multicount sentence is a package ... then severing part of the total sentence usually will unbundle it.\"  Id. at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit further noted, and we agree, that the question of the \"appropriate\" exercise of that jurisdiction cannot turn entirely on older conceptions of \"sentencing packages\" but must consider the effect of the Sentencing Guidelines.  See id. at 534-35.  \"The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 revolutionized the manner in which district courts sentence persons convicted of federal crimes.\"  Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 132, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2184, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991).  We also agree with the Seventh Circuit's conclusion that, while the Guidelines have altered the idea of the sentencing package, they have not eliminated the concept.  Smith, 103 F.3d. at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pre-Guidelines case, this court both adopted the concept of the sentencing package and suggested some limits to its applicability.  In United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d 9 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc), the defendants received consecutive sentences for convictions on two counts of drug trafficking.  On appeal, this court ruled that the two counts of conviction actually constituted a single offense, reversed the defendants' convictions on one of the counts, and remanded for resentencing on the second.  Id. at 11-12.   The district court then resentenced the defendants on the remaining count to a term as long as the combined total of the prior, consecutive sentences on both counts.  Id. at 12.   Defendants again appealed.  The en banc court rejected defendants' double jeopardy and due process challenges to the resentencing, holding that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[a]fter an appellate court unwraps the [sentencing] package and removes one or more charges from its confines, the sentencing judge, herself, is in the best position to assess the effect of the withdrawal and to redefine the package's size and shape....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 14.   In light of the concurring opinion of then-Judge Breyer and Judge Campbell, Pimienta-Redondo 's \"sentencing package\" holding should be confined to situations where the same basic course of conduct underlies both the vacated count and the count on which the conviction is affirmed, and that basic conduct determines the sentence.  Id. at 17 (Breyer, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Guidelines establish a similar relationship of interdependence between the vacated count of conviction, the affirmed count of conviction, and the new sentence:  Both Rodriguez's conviction under &#167; 924(c) and the enhancement imposed in resentencing him turn on the presence of a weapon during a drug trafficking offense.   Rodriguez's conviction for that basic course of conduct was affirmed.  The Guidelines require sentencing judges to consider \"all acts and omissions ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction....\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1).  Thus, under both the Guidelines and our pre-Guidelines precedent, Rodriguez's sentence may be considered as a \"sentencing package.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez argues that, because the &#167; 924(c) firearms sentence was consecutive, it is not part of the same \"sentencing package\" as his drug trafficking sentence.  He relies on U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2, which governs sentencing on multiple counts of conviction, and provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(a) The sentence to be imposed on a count for which the statute mandates a consecutive sentence shall be determined and imposed independently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2.  That the firearms sentence had to be calculated independently does not mean that the sentence on the drug counts did not depend on the existence of that sentence;  to the contrary, the Guidelines specify such a relationship.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (n.2 &amp; backg'd).  Thus, we hold that, where the Guidelines contemplate an interdependent relationship between the sentence for the vacated conviction and the sentence for the remaining convictions--a sentencing package<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>--a district court may, on a petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, resentence on the remaining convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We leave to another day the question of whether there is such authority when the Guidelines do not contemplate such an interdependent sentencing package.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez's two constitutional claims fare no better than does his jurisdictional claim.  Because the consideration of acquitted conduct in fashioning a sentence does not, absent special circumstances, violate either the Due Process or the Double Jeopardy Clause, see United States v. Watts, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 117 S.Ct. 633, 636-37, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997), the fact that the district court considered the conduct underlying the vacated conviction in enhancing the sentence for the drug offense does not in itself violate the Constitution.  To the extent that there are valid due process concerns about possible vindictiveness on resentencing, the safeguards announced by the Supreme Court in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), and applied by this court in Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d at 12-14, adequately address this problem.  See also United States v. Twitty, 104 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Clark, 84 F.3d 506 (1st Cir.)  (outlining contours of Pearce presumption of vindictiveness), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 272, 136 L.Ed.2d 195 (1996).  On the facts of this case, no claim of vindictiveness has been, or could be, made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is another theory that Rodriguez advances under the Due Process Clause.  Relying on Breest v. Helgemoe, 579 F.2d 95 (1st Cir.1978), he argues that he was \"a substantial period of time\"--more than three years--into his sentence when he was resentenced, and that it is \"fundamentally unfair, and thus violative of due process for a court to alter even an illegal sentence in a way which frustrates a prisoner's expectations by postponing his ... release date far beyond that originally set.\"  Id. at 101.   Here, Rodriguez's new release date is still more than four years earlier than his original release date;  the psychological unfairness described in Breest is thus not an issue here.  We acknowledge that, on other facts, due process concerns could be raised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that, given the language of &#167; 2255 discussed earlier and the fact that Rodriguez is still in custody, he could have no settled expectation of finality with respect to a portion of his total sentence which, under the Guidelines, is part of a sentencing package.  Accordingly, there is no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause here.  This case does not involve a petitioner who had already fully discharged his sentence and then was resentenced, see United States v. Silvers, 90 F.3d 95, 101 (4th Cir.1996), and we intimate nothing about the double jeopardy consequences of such a situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Cf.

Goldman, 41 F.3d 785, 789 (1st Cir.1994);  see also DeWitt v. Ventetoulo, 6 F.3d 32, 34 (1st Cir.1993)(noting that there is \"no single touchstone\" for determining if delay in resentencing is inconsistent with the Due Process Clause and listing considerations including the lapse of time, the reasonableness of defendant's expectations, prejudice, and diligence exercised by the state).  Delay may, in future cases, be less of an issue because of the strict time limits that 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 now imposes on the filing of petitions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This scenario is not farfetched.  Sometimes a case takes such time to wend its way through the court system that the prisoner is released by the time it is resolved.  And, because convictions carry collateral consequences even after incarceration has ended, appeals may be brought after release in an effort to avoid those consequences.  See Ball v. United States, 470 U.S. 856, 864-65, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 1673-74, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

It concerns the power of a district court to resentence on the counts of conviction remaining after the sentence on another count has been vacated on a petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isidro Rodriguez was originally convicted in 1993 on four cocaine trafficking counts, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a), for which he received a sentence of sixty-three months, and on one count of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), for which he received a mandatory, consecutive sentence of sixty months.  Those convictions were affirmed on appeal.  See United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></span> (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 6, 1995, the Supreme Court decided Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span> (1995).  Bailey clarified the definition of the term \"use\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), changing the law in this and many other circuits.  Id. Relying on Bailey, Rodriguez filed a pro se motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, seeking to vacate his conviction on the &#167; 924(c) firearms count.  The government conceded that Rodriguez's conviction on that count could not stand after Bailey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 1, 1996, the district court ordered that Rodriguez's conviction and sentence on the &#167; 924(c) count be vacated, thereby eliminating the mandatory, consecutive five-year sentence.  Rodriguez remains in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons as he has not finished serving his sentence for the drug trafficking counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appointed counsel to represent Rodriguez and directed the parties to address the issue of whether Rodriguez could be resentenced on the drug counts.  The court also ordered a revised presentence report (\"PSR\").  After briefing and argument, the district court ruled that Rodriguez's sentence on the firearms count was part of a sentencing calculus based on the relationship between the various counts.  The court concluded that it had jurisdiction, under &#167; 2255 and First Circuit precedent, to resentence Rodriguez on the drug trafficking counts.  The district court accepted the factual conclusions and Guidelines application of the revised PSR, including the PSR's recommendation of a two-level increase for possession of a dangerous weapon during a drug offense.  This yielded a total offense level of 28, and a corresponding sentencing range of seventy-eight to ninety-seven months.  The district court resentenced Rodriguez to seventy-eight months on the drug trafficking counts.  That is less than his original total sentence on all counts of 123 months, but more than his original sentence of sixty-three months for the drug counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez argues that the district court simply lacked jurisdiction to resentence him and, further, that doing so violated his right not to be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense and his right to due process of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez's argument is complicated for him by the fact that, under the Sentencing Guidelines, there was an explicit interaction between the sentence he was originally given on the drug trafficking counts and the sentence he received on the firearms count.  The Guidelines direct a sentencing judge to increase the sentence for a drug trafficking offense by two levels where the offense involves the possession of a dangerous weapon, including a firearm.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).  However, to avoid double counting, the Guidelines do not permit such an enhancement of the drug sentence if the defendant has also been convicted under certain statutes, including 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), which provide a mandatory minimum penalty for weapons-related conduct.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4 (comment. n. 2 &amp; backg'd).  For example, if the jury had acquitted Rodriguez of the firearms offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), but the judge had nonetheless found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Rodriguez possessed a firearm during the drug crimes, the judge should have, under the Guidelines, increased the sentence for the drug offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judge apparently thought that this resentencing was similar to that hypothetical case and so enhanced the sentence for the drug offenses.  This is, of course, an approach abundant with common sense.  It also fits with the notion that, where there are multiple convictions, the various sentences form a package meant to work together and if part of the package of convictions is undone, the trial judge ought to be free to reconsider how all the pieces should fit together, in order to do justice and to meet the requirements of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But such a common sense approach to the problem must fairly meet Rodriguez's objections that Congress did not grant jurisdiction to resentence and that such an approach, writ broadly, poses far from hypothetical dangers to the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant.  Rodriguez's assertion is that to increase a sentence as a consequence of a defendant's successful challenge to one count of conviction penalizes the exercise of the right to collaterally attack a conviction.  Such a sentencing enhancement deprives the prisoner of his settled expectations about the length of his sentence, and violates the rule, embedded in our jurisprudence, that a defendant only be sentenced for the crimes of which he is convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez starts with an argument that federal trial courts have only such jurisdiction as Congress has granted and that there is no grant of jurisdiction to revise, on collateral attack, a sentence that has already become final.  Rodriguez argues that Congress has expressly limited a court's ability to modify an already imposed sentence to the three situations outlined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c).  Two of the circumstances described in that section are inapplicable here, and so, he contends, the district court may only resentence him to the extent \"expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal (in contrast to the &#167; 2255 review here), this court has permitted resentencing for a drug trafficking conviction where defendant's &#167; 924(c) conviction was set aside, post-Bailey:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Since it is conceivable that our disposition of the [firearms] count might affect the sentencing calculus in regard to the [drug trafficking] count, we honor counsels' joint request and remand to the district court for possible reconsideration of the sentence originally imposed on the drug trafficking count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

At least seven other circuits have similarly determined that, when a conviction under &#167; 924(c) is reversed on appeal in light of Bailey, it is appropriate to remand to the district court for resentencing on the remaining convictions.

But that statutory language is inapplicable here, Rodriguez argues, because the drug trafficking convictions in this case have already become final after appeal;  thus, &#167; 2106's broad grant of remedial power to the appellate court cannot be read to empower the district court on a &#167; 2255 motion.  Rodriguez further argues that his &#167; 2255 motion only sought review of his &#167; 924(c) sentence and convictions, and that his drug trafficking sentence is therefore not properly \"before\" any court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the basic tenet of Rodriguez's argument:  courts are not free to resentence at will;  a statute or Rule 35 must authorize such an exercise of jurisdiction.

The Seventh Circuit found it \"appropriate\" to correct the sentence, because \"[i]f a multicount sentence is a package ... then severing part of the total sentence usually will unbundle it.\"  Id. at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit further noted, and we agree, that the question of the \"appropriate\" exercise of that jurisdiction cannot turn entirely on older conceptions of \"sentencing packages\" but must consider the effect of the Sentencing Guidelines.  See id. at 534-35.  \"The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 revolutionized the manner in which district courts sentence persons convicted of federal crimes.\"  Burns v.

We also agree with the Seventh Circuit's conclusion that, while the Guidelines have altered the idea of the sentencing package, they have not eliminated the concept.  Smith, 103 F.3d. at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pre-Guidelines case, this court both adopted the concept of the sentencing package and suggested some limits to its applicability.  In United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522862\"><a href=\"/opinion/522862/united-states-v-juan-pimienta-redondo-united-states-of-america-v-alfredo/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989) (en banc), the defendants received consecutive sentences for convictions on two counts of drug trafficking.  On appeal, this court ruled that the two counts of conviction actually constituted a single offense, reversed the defendants' convictions on one of the counts, and remanded for resentencing on the second.  Id. at 11-12.   The district court then resentenced the defendants on the remaining count to a term as long as the combined total of the prior, consecutive sentences on both counts.  Id. at 12.   Defendants again appealed.  The en banc court rejected defendants' double jeopardy and due process challenges to the resentencing, holding that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[a]fter an appellate court unwraps the [sentencing] package and removes one or more charges from its confines, the sentencing judge, herself, is in the best position to assess the effect of the withdrawal and to redefine the package's size and shape....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 14.   In light of the concurring opinion of then-Judge Breyer and Judge Campbell, Pimienta-Redondo 's \"sentencing package\" holding should be confined to situations where the same basic course of conduct underlies both the vacated count and the count on which the conviction is affirmed, and that basic conduct determines the sentence.  Id. at 17 (Breyer, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Guidelines establish a similar relationship of interdependence between the vacated count of conviction, the affirmed count of conviction, and the new sentence:  Both Rodriguez's conviction under &#167; 924(c) and the enhancement imposed in resentencing him turn on the presence of a weapon during a drug trafficking offense.   Rodriguez's conviction for that basic course of conduct was affirmed.  The Guidelines require sentencing judges to consider \"all acts and omissions ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction....\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1).  Thus, under both the Guidelines and our pre-Guidelines precedent, Rodriguez's sentence may be considered as a \"sentencing package.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez argues that, because the &#167; 924(c) firearms sentence was consecutive, it is not part of the same \"sentencing package\" as his drug trafficking sentence.  He relies on U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2, which governs sentencing on multiple counts of conviction, and provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(a) The sentence to be imposed on a count for which the statute mandates a consecutive sentence shall be determined and imposed independently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2.  That the firearms sentence had to be calculated independently does not mean that the sentence on the drug counts did not depend on the existence of that sentence;  to the contrary, the Guidelines specify such a relationship.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (n.2 &amp; backg'd).  Thus, we hold that, where the Guidelines contemplate an interdependent relationship between the sentence for the vacated conviction and the sentence for the remaining convictions--a sentencing package<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>--a district court may, on a petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, resentence on the remaining convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We leave to another day the question of whether there is such authority when the Guidelines do not contemplate such an interdependent sentencing package.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez's two constitutional claims fare no better than does his jurisdictional claim.  Because the consideration of acquitted conduct in fashioning a sentence does not, absent special circumstances, violate either the Due Process or the Double Jeopardy Clause, see United States v. Watts, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span> (1997), the fact that the district court considered the conduct underlying the vacated conviction in enhancing the sentence for the drug offense does not in itself violate the Constitution.  To the extent that there are valid due process concerns about possible vindictiveness on resentencing, the safeguards announced by the Supreme Court in North Carolina v. Pearce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Relying on Breest v. Helgemoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"357897\"><a href=\"/opinion/357897/robert-breest-v-raymond-helgemoe-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1978), he argues that he was \"a substantial period of time\"--more than three years--into his sentence when he was resentenced, and that it is \"fundamentally unfair, and thus violative of due process for a court to alter even an illegal sentence in a way which frustrates a prisoner's expectations by postponing his ... release date far beyond that originally set.\"  Id. at 101.   Here, Rodriguez's new release date is still more than four years earlier than his original release date;  the psychological unfairness described in Breest is thus not an issue here.  We acknowledge that, on other facts, due process concerns could be raised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that, given the language of &#167; 2255 discussed earlier and the fact that Rodriguez is still in custody, he could have no settled expectation of finality with respect to a portion of his total sentence which, under the Guidelines, is part of a sentencing package.  Accordingly, there is no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause here.  This case does not involve a petitioner who had already fully discharged his sentence and then was resentenced, see United States v. Silvers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722425\"><a href=\"/opinion/722425/united-states-v-steven-a-silvers-two-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 101 (4th Cir.1996), and we intimate nothing about the double jeopardy consequences of such a situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Cf.

Delay may, in future cases, be less of an issue because of the strict time limits that 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 now imposes on the filing of petitions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This scenario is not farfetched.  Sometimes a case takes such time to wend its way through the court system that the prisoner is released by the time it is resolved.
