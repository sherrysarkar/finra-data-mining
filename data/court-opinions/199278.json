Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Melba N. Rivera-Camacho on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza Toro,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Robert J. Triba, Chief Counsel,\nSocial Security Administration, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         February 15, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam. Claimant Esperanza Morales appeals from\n\nthe judgment of the district court.                This judgment affirmed\n\nthe   denial    by     the    Commissioner        of   Social   Security     of\n\nclaimant's application for disability benefits.                       We affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment for the following reasons.\n\n            The findings of fact of the administrative law\n\njudge (ALJ) \"are conclusive when supported by substantial\n\nevidence, 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), but are not conclusive when\n\nderived by ignoring evidence, misapplying the law, or judging\n\nmatters entrusted to experts.\"                Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d\n\n31, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam).                   It also is important\n\nto keep in mind that resolution of conflicts in the evidence\n\nand the ultimate determination of disability are for the ALJ,\n\nnot the courts.         See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and\n\nHuman Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).                     Based on\n\nthe   following,       it    is    apparent   that     the   record    contains\n\nconflicting evidence and that a sufficient amount of this\n\nevidence supports the ALJ's conclusion that claimant retained\n\nthe residual functional capacity (RFC) to engage in her past,\n\nsedentary      work.         See    20   C.F.R.    §    404.1567(a)     (1997)\n\n(sedentary work requires the ability (1) to lift no more than\n\n10 pounds at a time, and (2) to occasionally lift items like\n\fsmall tools; the capacity to sit also is required, along with\n\nthe capacity to occasionally walk and stand).\n\n            First, of course, is the RFC assessment completed\n\nby the non-examining physician which indicates that claimant\n\nfrequently can lift and carry 25 pounds and is able to sit,\n\nstand, and walk for about six hours each, in an eight-hour\n\nwork day.        As for claimant's heart condition, the record\n\nreveals   that     she   has   good    cardiac   function   and   a   fair\n\ntolerance for exercise.         The ALJ, in his decision, also read\n\none of the heart studies as concluding that claimant could\n\nperform sedentary work and claimant does not dispute the\n\nALJ's reading of this report.           Further, Dr. Marti noted that\n\nclaimant experienced chest pain on \"light,\" not sedentary,\n\nexertion and that, in any event, the pain was relieved with\n\nnitroglycerin tabs.\n\n            In     relation      to     claimant's    musculoskeletal\n\ncondition, the most striking evidence, aside from the non-\n\nexamining RFC assessment, is the conclusion of Dr. Cintron,\n\none of the examining consultants, that claimant essentially\n\nis not disabled at all.         Indeed, claimant showed no atrophy\n\nand exhibited a full range of motion in her arms, neck, and\n\nback.   There also is the \"objective\" medical evidence – the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fx-rays – which showed only spondylotic changes and mild\n\nosteopenia; there were no bulging or ruptured discs.\n\n           We also reject claimant's argument that the ALJ did\n\nnot give controlling weight to the opinions of Drs. Marti and\n\nDiaz,   claimant's   treating   physicians.       See    20    C.F.R.   §\n\n404.1527(d)(2) (1997).     Here, the ALJ, in deciding not to\n\ngive such weight to the RFC assessments of Drs. Marti and\n\nDiaz, stated that the assessments were not corroborated by\n\nclinical studies or findings and were refuted by the rest of\n\nthe   record   evidence.   Given      the    results    of    the   tests\n\nconcerning claimant's heart and spine, this seems an adequate\n\nreason.   That is, the tests are            not consistent with the\n\nconclusion of these doctors that claimant could not perform\n\neven sedentary work. Further, the diagnosis of carpal tunnel\n\nsyndrome made by Dr. Diaz is not confirmed by any tests and\n\nthe opinions of both treating sources that claimant was\n\nlimited in the use of her hands conflicts with the reports\n\nof both of the consultative physicians, who failed to note\n\nany problems with claimant's hands.\n\n           In regard to her mental impairment, claimant's\n\nprimary argument is that her condition meets, or at least\n\nequals, a listed impairment. See 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart\n\nP., App. 1.    In particular, claimant refers to § 12.05, the\n\n\n                                -4-\n\flisting for mental retardation and autism.               According to §\n\n12.05,   \"[m]ental     retardation    refers   to    a    significantly\n\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in\n\nadaptive    behavior      initially     manifested         during   the\n\ndevelopmental period (before age 22).\"\n\n           The problem with claimant's argument is that there\n\nsimply is no evidence in the record that claimant had any\n\n\"deficits in adaptive behavior initially manifested . . .\n\nbefore age 22.\"    Indeed, claimant herself reported to Dr. de\n\nJesus that, prior to 1992, she had been physically and\n\nemotionally healthy.      Further, claimant stated that she had\n\nobtained fair grades through the sixth grade and had left\n\nschool due to a skin condition.         Thus, claimant has failed\n\nto establish that she fits within the basic definition of\n\nmental retardation set out in § 12.05.              Finally, although\n\nclaimant averred that she \"equaled\" this listing, she does\n\nnot explain how.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
