On September 14,  1995, United States\r                                \r\r\n\nmarshals  removed  appellant Christopher  Hightower,  a Rhode\r\n\nIsland state prisoner, from the Menard Correctional Center in\r\n\nIllinois and transported him to Rhode Island for bench trials\r\n\nin civil  actions Nos.  93-0286T,  94-0364T.   On October  2,\r\n\n1995, the district court  dismissed both cases with prejudice\r\n\nafter Hightower  failed to  present any evidence.   Hightower\r\n\nappeals both dismissals.    \r\n\n          We treat the district court's  dismissals as issued\r\n\npursuant  to Rule 41(b),  and we find no  error.1  See, e.g.,\r                                                            1           \r\n\nZagano  v. Fordham University, 900 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir.) (\"It\r                                         \r\n\nis  beyond dispute that a  district court may  dismiss a case\r\n\nunder Rule  41(b) when  the plaintiff  refuses to  go forward\r\n\nwith a  properly scheduled  trial.\"), cert. denied,  498 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n899 (1990).  In civil action No. 93-0286T, Hightower had more\r\n\nthan  ample time to conduct discovery  and prepare for trial.\r\n\nAlthough the  discovery period  in civil action  No. 94-0364T\r\n\nwas  relatively   brief,  Hightower  does   not  state   what\r\n\nadditional discovery was necessary  to prepare for trial much\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Appellant suggests without  developed argumentation  that\r               1\r\nthe district court might have relied on Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c)\r\nas authority for the  dismissals.  We need not  consider this\r\npossibility   since  it  would  not  alter  our  disposition.\r\nAppellant also  suggests that  the dismissal of  civil action\r\nNo. 93-0286T was based,  in the alternative, on Fed.  R. Civ.\r\nP. 12(b)(6) and  Sandin v.  Conner, 115 S.  Ct. 2293  (1995).\r                                              \r\nSince the dismissal can  be upheld under Rule 41(b),  we need\r\nnot resolve  whether the  complaint in civil  action No.  93-\r\n0286T states a claim.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nless adequately explain why he was  unable to accomplish it.2\r                                                                        2\r\n\nUnder  the circumstances,  we  cannot say  that the  district\r\n\ncourt  abused  its  discretion  by  insisting  that Hightower\r\n\nproceed to trial, and then dismissing the case when Hightower\r\n\nfailed to present any evidence.  See Capo v. United States, 7\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 283,  284  (1st  Cir.  1993) (stating  that  Rule  41(b)\r\n\ndismissals  are reviewed  for  abuse  of discretion);  Amarin\r                                                                         \r\n\nPlastics,  Inc. v. Maryland Cup Corp., 946 F.2d 147, 151 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1991) (observing  that the  district court  is accorded\r\n\nbroad discretion to grant or deny continuances).\r\n\n          Contrary to Hightower's suggestion, we do not think\r\n\nhis pending motions for a  continuance can excuse his failure\r\n\nto  be prepared for trial.  Rule  21(a) of the Local Rules of\r\n\nthe District  of Rhode Island  warns litigants that  \"a trial\r\n\ndate  will not be vacated nor a continuance granted except in\r\n\nthe  most extraordinary  circumstances,\" and  Hightower could\r\n\nnot rely on the possibility that the  court would rule in his\r\n\nfavor.   To hold otherwise,  would be to  permit litigants to\r\n\nmanipulate trial dates.  \r\n\n          Hightower  also complains  that he  was transported\r\n\nfrom  Illinois  to Rhode  Island  without  any of  his  legal\r\n\ndocuments.  We are  unmoved by this complaint in  the absence\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2Contrary to Hightower's suggestion, Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)\r               2\r\nis  inoperative in the District of Rhode Island insofar as it\r\nrestricts the  commencement of discovery.   See General Order\r                                                           \r\nof the District of Rhode Island dated May 9, 1994.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof  some explanation of what these documents are and why they\r\n\nwere necessary.    Hightower also  fails  to state,  and  the\r\n\nrecord before us fails to show, that he brought the matter to\r\n\nthe  district  court's   attention  and  explained   why  the\r\n\ndocuments were essential.   We add that  Hightower could have\r\n\nproceeded to offer his own testimony as  evidence.  If he had\r\n\ndone  so, and if the record had contained some description of\r\n\nthe documents left in  Illinois, we would be in a position to\r\n\nassess whether Hightower suffered  any prejudice.  As it  is,\r\n\nthere is no basis for a finding of error.  \r\n\n          Finally, we  add that  Local Rule 9  authorizes the\r\n\nplacement of cases on a continuous trial calendar.  Hightower\r\n\nhas not identified what witnesses he wished to call or stated\r\n\nwhether he attempted to subpoena them once it became apparent\r\n\nthat  the cases  were  proceeding towards  trial.   Under the\r\n\ncircumstances,  we are  unpersuaded  that he  was \"forced  to\r\n\ntrial without  any witnesses.\"  We  have carefully considered\r\n\nHightower's remaining arguments and reject them either on the\r\n\nground that they are  meritless or are waived for  failure to\r\n\nraise in the court below.      \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
