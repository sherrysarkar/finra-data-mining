He argues on appeal\r\n\nthat   the  district   court  violated   his  statutory   and\r\n\nconstitutional  rights  to a  speedy  trial, as  well  as his\r\n\nconstitutional right to present witnesses in his own defense.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          Santiago  was arrested on October 20, 1994 pursuant\r\n\nto a warrant issued after a criminal complaint had been filed\r\n\nagainst  him  on  the  previous  day.    He  has  since  been\r\n\nincarcerated.\r\n\n          Criminal complaints  and arrest warrants  were also\r\n\nissued on October 20,  1994 against two minors, Antonio  Jose\r\n\nEsquilin-Garcia  (\"Esquilin\")  and Pedro  Antonio  Ramos-Rosa\r\n\n(\"Ramos\"), alleged to  have participated in the  same offense\r\n\nas Santiago.  Both were arrested on November 11, 1994.\r\n\n          Because  Esquilin  and  Ramos   were  minors,  only\r\n\nSantiago was charged in an indictment returned on November 2,\r\n\n1994.  At his arraignment  on November 9, 1994, Santiago pled\r\n\nnot guilty to both counts of the indictment.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          On  November 22, 1994,  Santiago filed a  motion to\r\n\ncontinue his trial, which had  been scheduled for January 12,\r\n\n1995.  As  a reason for  the continuance, Santiago's  counsel\r\n\nstated that  he (counsel) would  be on trial  at the time  in\r\n\nanother case.  The district court granted the  continuance on\r\n\nDecember 1, 1994,  finding that Santiago's interest  in being\r\n\nrepresented by competent counsel  outweighed his interests in\r\n\na speedy  trial and ordering  counsel for Santiago  to notify\r\n\nthe court when the other trial had ended.\r\n\n          On  February 2,  1995, Santiago's  counsel notified\r\n\nthe district  court that his  other trial was  over, allowing\r\n\nthe setting  of a  new trial  date.   On March  1, 1995,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court ordered  a pretrial  conference  on March  6,\r\n\n1995, and set Santiago's trial for March 13, 1995.\r\n\n          On  March  10,  1995, the  government  requested  a\r\n\ncontinuance of the March 13 trial date, stating that Esquilin\r\n\nand  Ramos  were both  awaiting  a  hearing  on a  motion  to\r\n\ntransfer to adult status.  If the transfers were allowed, the\r\n\ngovernment proposed to try them along with Santiago.  Without\r\n\nobjection,  the  district  court allowed  the  continuance on\r\n\nMarch 13,  1995.   The court found  the ends of  justice were\r\n\nserved by continuing  the trial, and that the  ability to try\r\n\ntogether all persons  implicated in this case  outweighed the\r\n\ninterests in a speedy trial.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          On  October 10,  1995, the  district court  ordered\r\n\nthat both Esquilin and Ramos  be transferred to adult status.\r\n\nOn October 18,  1995, the grand  jury returned a  superseding\r\n\nindictment, charging the two transferred minors and  Santiago\r\n\nwith the  same offenses  charged in  the original  indictment\r\n\nagainst Santiago alone.  \r\n\n          On December 4, 1995, Ramos entered a plea of guilty\r\n\nas  to  counts  one and  two  of  the  superseding indictment\r\n\npursuant to a Plea and Cooperation Agreement.  On January 22,\r\n\n1996, Esquilin did  the same in respect  to count one  of the\r\n\nsuperseding indictment.  Santiago's trial was set for January\r\n\n23, 1996.\r\n\n          On January  18, 1996,  Santiago filed  a motion  to\r\n\ndismiss  the  superseding  indictment for  violation  of  his\r\n\nconstitutional and statutory  rights to a speedy trial.  Five\r\n\ndays later, following  argument, the district court  ruled to\r\n\ndeny Santiago's motion to dismiss.\r\n\n          Trial began, as scheduled, on January 23, 1995.  On\r\n\nthe  fifth day  of trial,  the  defense called  Wanda Caceres\r\n\n(\"Caceres\"),  Santiago's stepmother,  to  the witness  stand.\r\n\nBefore she  could testify, the court required  the defense to\r\n\nmake   a  proffer  of   her  expected  testimony.     Counsel\r\n\nrepresented that Caceres would testify about her post-offense\r\n\nconversations  with the defendants  and about her  efforts to\r\n\npurchase airline tickets for them to travel  to the mainland.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nAfter  the proffer, the  district court warned  Caceres about\r\n\nher right  to refuse to  testify, because of  the possibility\r\n\nthat she might incriminate herself.  The court also appointed\r\n\nan attorney to advise Caceres,  who was unrepresented to that\r\n\npoint.\r\n\n          After Caceres s  lawyer explained  \"her rights  and\r\n\nthe possible or probable consequences of testifying,\" Caceres\r\n\ndecided  not to  testify.    Later that  same  day, the  jury\r\n\nreturned a verdict, finding Santiago guilty on counts one and\r\n\ntwo of the superseding indictment.  \r\n\n          On  May  23,  1996,  the  district  court sentenced\r\n\nSantiago   to   life   imprisonment   on   count   one   and,\r\n\nconsecutively, to  sixty months'  imprisonment on count  two.\r\n\nSantiago appealed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\nA.

Supp. at 381.\r                         \r\n\n          Santiago  argues that the  district court  erred in\r\n\ndenying his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment.  He\r\n\nsays that the delay in his being brought to trial added up to\r\n\ntwice the number of statutorily allowable days.  In response,\r\n\nthe government  asserts that  only forty-nine  non-excludable\r\n\ndays passed before Santiago was brought to trial.  \r\n\n          We find no error in the district court's refusal to\r\n\ndismiss the superseding  indictment.  This court  reviews the\r\n\ndisposition  of a  STA issue  for clear  error as  to factual\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfindings and de novo as to legal rulings.

We\r                         \r\n\nconclude  that fewer than seventy non-excludable days went by\r\n\nbefore Santiago was brought to trial.\r\n\n          a)   November  4, 1994 to March 1, 1995 (Santiago's\r                                                                         \r\n               motion for a continuance of trial)\r                                                             \r\n          The original indictment was returned on November 2,\r\n\n1994.  Santiago first appeared  before a judicial officer  of\r\n\nthe district  court on  November 4,  1994.   STA  calculation\r\n\nbegins with the latter  of these two dates.  See  18 U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n3161(c)(1) (1985).\r\n\n          November  4,  1994  is  itself  excludable  because\r\n\nSantiago appeared before the district court on that day.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n18 U.S.C.    3161(h)(1)  (1985) (\"proceedings concerning  the\r\n\ndefendant\").  That day is also excludable for another reason,\r\n\nto  wit, the government's  motion to detain  Santiago without\r\n\nbail pending the  detention hearing, which the  court granted\r\n\nthat  same day.    See  18  U.S.C.     3161(h)(1)(F)  (1985).\r                                  \r\n\nSection 3161(h)(1)(F) excludes any \"delay resulting from  any\r\n\npretrial  motion, from the  filing of the  motion through the\r\n\nconclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of,\r\n\nsuch motion.\"  Id.  November 9, 1994 is excludable because of\r                              \r\n\nSantiago's  arraignment and  detention hearing  on that  day.\r\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(1) (1985).\r               \r\n\n          Santiago contends that the period from November 10,\r\n\n1994 up to and including November 21, 1994 is non-excludable.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nThe government agrees.  We  therefore find a total of sixteen\r\n\nnon-excludable days up to this point.\r\n\n          On  November  22,  1994,  Santiago  filed a  motion\r\n\nnotifying the district court of his counsel's  unavailability\r\n\non January  12, 1995, the  scheduled trial  date, because  of\r\n\nanother trial.   Santiago requested an indefinite continuance\r\n\nof the trial as set for January 12, 1995.  The  court granted\r\n\nthis  motion ten  days later,  on December 1,  1994, ordering\r\n\ncounsel to  notify the court  when the other trial  was over.\r\n\nThe parties agree  that the ten days the court took to decide\r\n\nthe  motion were excludable  from the STA's  seventy-day time\r\n\nlimit.  See 18 U.S.C.    3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  They likewise\r                       \r\n\nagree  that December  2,  1994  was  excludable,  a  pretrial\r\n\nconference  being  held  on  that  day.    See 18   U.S.C.   \r                                                          \r\n\n3161(h)(1) (1985).\r\n\n          Santiago asserts that the six days from December 3,\r\n\n1994 to  December 8, 1994 are non-excludable.  The government\r\n\ncontends  that  the  indefinite  continuance  of  the  trial,\r\n\ngranted at  defendant's request  on December  1, 1994,  makes\r\n\nthese days excludable.\r\n\n          The STA excludes any period of delay resulting from\r\n\nthe court's granting of a  continuance if the continuance was\r\n\ngranted on  the basis  of findings that  the ends  of justice\r\n\nserved  outweigh the speedy trial  interest.  See 18 U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n3161(h)(8)(A)  (1985).1  An  ends of justice  continuance was\r\n\ngranted  here.     Santiago  contends,   however,  that   the\r\n\nexcludable  time  attributable  to  the  continuance must  be\r\n\nlimited to the  period of time between January  12, 1995, the\r\n\noriginal  trial date, and February 2,  1995, the date defense\r\n\ncounsel notified  the court  of his  availability for  trial.\r\n\nThe government maintains  that the entire three  month period\r\n\nof  time starting  on December  1, 1994,  the date  the court\r\n\ncontinued the original  trial date,  and ending  on March  1,\r\n\n1995, the day the court set  a new trial date, is  excludable\r\n\nfrom the STA's seventy-day time limit.\r\n\n          We  agree  with  the government.    The  \"period of\r\n\ndelay\"  resulting from the  continuance began on  December 1,\r\n\n1994, when the January 12,  1995, trial date was canceled and\r\n\nthe  trial put  on hold  until further  order. The  period of\r\n\ndelay  remained in effect  from then  through March  1, 1995,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.   Section 3161(h)(8)(A)  provides, in  pertinent part,  as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n          (h)  The  following  periods  of  delay  shall   be\r\n     excluded in  computing the  time . . . within  which the\r\n     trial . . . must commence:\r\n\n               (8)(A) Any  period of  delay resulting from  a\r\n     continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at\r\n     the request  of the defendant  or his counsel or  at the\r\n     request of the attorney for the Government, if the judge\r\n     granted  such continuance on  the basis of  his findings\r\n     that the  ends of justice  served by taking  such action\r\n     outweigh  the  best  interest  of  the  public  and  the\r\n     defendant in a speedy trial.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(8)(A) (1985).  \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nwhen,  after   having  been  earlier  advised   of  counsel's\r\n\navailability, the court set a new trial date.\r\n\n     There is  no way to  regard the period from  the court's\r\n\nDecember 1 ruling to the original January 12 trial date as if\r\n\nno continuance  were then in  effect.  The  continuance ruled\r\n\nout all possibility of a trial while it lasted, relieving the\r\n\nparties of  the need to prepare  for trial on  January 12, as\r\n\npreviously scheduled, or at any  time from December 1 until a\r\n\nnew trial date was set.\r\n\n          Contending  that a continuance  of trial  ends when\r\n\nthe reason for it ends, Santiago argues that the twenty-seven\r\n\nday period beginning on February  2, 1995 and ending on March\r\n\n1,  1995,  during  which  the  court  was  aware  of  defense\r\n\ncounsel's availability but had not  yet set a new trial date,\r\n\ncannot  be  excludable.   To  exclude  that  period, Santiago\r\n\nasserts, citing to United States v. Rush, 738  F.2d 497, 505-\r                                                    \r\n\n06  (1st   Cir.  1984),  would  give  rise  to  an  automatic\r\n\nadditional  period of exclusion after every \"ends of justice\"\r\n\ncontinuance  between the notice that the event triggering the\r\n\ncontinuance of trial has ended  and the court's order setting\r\n\na  new  trial  date.    Santiago  argues  that  his counsel's\r\n\nFebruary 2, 1995 notice of  availability left nothing for the\r\n\ndistrict court to do but set a new trial date, a routine act.\r\n\n          We  do not accept Santiago's argument.  The \"period\r\n\nof delay\" caused by the ends of  justice continuance included\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nthe time, following  counsel's notice of readiness,  that the\r\n\njudge reasonably required to schedule  a new trial date.  The\r\n\nmere   announcement   of  counsel's   availability   did  not\r\n\nautomatically  terminate   the  continuance  of   the  trial.\r\n\nSetting  a new  date required  consideration  of the  court's\r\n\ncalendar; an available window had to be found.  The court may\r\n\nnot  have  been  able  to  determine  as  soon  as  counsel s\r\n\navailability was known when its other obligations would allow\r\n\nthe scheduling of a trial.  The  court took less than a month\r\n\nto schedule a  new trial date, which was  not an unreasonable\r\n\ndelay.\r\n\n          We  add  that the  twenty-seven  days that  elapsed\r\n\nbefore  a new trial date was set  can be viewed as separately\r\n\nexcludable  under the  provisions of    3161(h)(1)(F),  which\r\n\nexcludes the  time  pending  disposition of  a  motion.    By\r\n\nnotifying  the court of  his availability for  trial, defense\r\n\ncounsel  may be said to have  impliedly moved for a new trial\r\n\ndate.  The court acted on the implied motion on March 1, 1995\r\n\nby setting a new trial date of March 13, 1995.   Motions that\r\n\ndo not require a hearing  may toll the seventy-day time limit\r\n\nfor up to thirty days.   See Henderson v. United States,  476\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S.  321,  29   (1986)  (noting  that  the   phrase  \"prompt\r\n\ndisposition\"  in   3161(h)(1)(F) so limits the amount of time\r\n\nthat can be  excluded).  As  already noted, the  twenty-seven\r\n\ndays  taken  by  the  court  to  determine  a  new  date  was\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nreasonable enough.   We conclude that the entire  period from\r\n\nDecember 1,  1994 through  March 1,  1995 was  excludable for\r\n\npurposes of the STA, leaving us still with a total of sixteen\r\n\nnon-excludable days at this point in time.\r\n\n          b)   March   2,  1995  to  October  18,  1995  (The\r                                                                         \r\n               government's  motion  for   a  continuance  of\r                                                                         \r\n               trial)\r                                 \r\n\n          The new March 13 trial date did not stand for long.\r\n\nOn  March  10,   1995,  the  government  moved   to  continue\r\n\nSantiago's trial in order to allow it to obtain permission to\r\n\ntry  the two  juveniles, Ramos  and  Esquilin, as  adults, in\r\n\nwhich event they  would be eligible to be  tried jointly with\r\n\nSantiago.  Finding that the \"ends of justice\" would be served\r\n\nby continuing  the trial  pending resolution  of Ramos's  and\r\n\nEsquilin's  adult  status,  the district  court  allowed  the\r\n\ngovernment's motion  on March  13, 1995.   The parties  agree\r\n\nthat the period of time from March 2, 1995, the day after the\r\n\ndistrict court  set the March  13 trial date, until  March 9,\r\n\n1995,  the  day before  the  government filed  its  motion to\r\n\ncontinue the new  trial date, was non-excludable.   They also\r\n\nagree  that the  days between  March  10, 1995,  the day  the\r\n\ngovernment filed its motion to continue the trial, and  March\r\n\n13, 1995, the day the district court granted the government's\r\n\nmotion to continue the trial, were excludable.

The\r\n\nMarch  13  continuance was  open-ended, although  as Santiago\r\n\nacknowledges,   that,  in  and  of itself,  did  not make  it\r\n\ninvalid.

Much of  that delay, he\r\n\ncontends, was  attributable to government  foot-dragging and,\r\n\ntherefore,  lacked an element of defendant s involvement that\r\n\nhas led  us to exclude  open-ended continuances in  the past.\r\n\nSee  Lattany, 982 F.2d  at 883 (holding that  the length of a\r                        \r\n\ncontinuance was not unreasonable  because of defendant's part\r\n\nin extending the delay).  Santiago maintains  that the docket\r\n\nentries  for  the  transfer  proceedings2  are suggestive  of\r\n\ngovernmental bad faith and needless  delay.  He points to the\r\n\npostponement  of a  March 21,  1995  evidentiary hearing  for\r\n\nRamos  after the  government said  that it  had not  received\r\n\nnotice of it.  Santiago contends that this delay, in addition\r\n\nto other  questionable delays,  indicate that  the government\r\n\nwas not acting expeditiously in  spite of knowing that he was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.   Many of the records relating to the transfer proceedings\r\ndo not appear in the record before us.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nstill awaiting  trial.   And, finally, Santiago  says he  was\r\n\nmisled into believing that the transfer proceedings would end\r\n\nmomentarily. \r\n\n          We find  little support for  Santiago's charge that\r\n\nthe transfer  proceedings  were  protracted  by  governmental\r\n\nindifference and impropriety.   Their duration does  not seem\r\n\nextreme  in   the  circumstances,  and  the   continuance  of\r\n\nSantiago s trial  until it could be determined whether to try\r\n\nthe  minor   codefendants  with   Santiago  was   reasonable,\r\n\nespecially  where Santiago raised  no objection at  the time.\r\n\nCf. United  States v. Parker,  404 F.2d 1193, 1196  (9th Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1968)  (noting  the  substantial  public  interest  in  joint\r\n\ntrials).\r\n\n          The two  juveniles'  natural  resistance  to  being\r\n\ntried  as adults affords an  obvious explanation for the time\r\n\nconsumed by the transfer proceedings.  The seriousness of the\r\n\ncharges  provided good  reason  for  them  to  do  everything\r\n\npossible to retain  their juvenile  status.   That the  adult\r\n\nclassification  issue was not simple is suggested by the fact\r\n\nthat, although the district judge ultimately transferred both\r\n\nminors to adult  status, the magistrate judge  presiding over\r\n\nthe transfer proceedings recommended the transfer of only one\r\n\nof them.   The  limited record that  we have  reflects delays\r\n\narising  from, among other  things, difficulties in arranging\r\n\nfor  psychological evaluations of  the two juveniles.   At no\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\ntime within this period did Santiago seek either to terminate\r\n\nthe  continuance of  his trial  or to  expedite the  transfer\r\n\nproceedings.\r\n\n          We conclude  that the continuance  for the transfer\r\n\nproceedings  was   not  unreasonable  or   excessively  long.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  exclude  the period  between  March  14 and\r\n\nOctober   18,  1995,  pursuant  to     3161(h)(8)(A).

See 18  U.S.C.     3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7)\r                                    \r\n\n(1985).\r\n\n          Santiago  argues  that,   with  the  exception   of\r\n\nNovember 27, 1995, the period of time from November 17, 1995,\r\n\nthe  day after  the court  acted  on the  two motions,  until\r\n\nDecember  3,  1995, the  day  before Ramos's  change  of plea\r\n\nhearing,  is non-excludable.   He concedes that  November 27,\r\n\n1995 is excludable  because of the arraignment  and detention\r\n\nhearings of Esquilin and Ramos on that date.  See 18 U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7) (1985).  The government, however, would\r\n\nexclude the entire  period from November 17  through December\r\n\n4,  arguing   that  Ramos's   change  of   plea  motion   was\r\n\ncontinuously under advisement  until allowed at a  hearing on\r\n\nDecember 4, 1995.  We agree with the government, as discussed\r\n\nbelow,  and  exclude that  period  of  time  from  the  STA's\r\n\nseventy-day time limit.\r\n\n          Santiago also disputes any exclusion of  the period\r\n\nof time from  December 5, 1995, the day  after Ramos's change\r\n\nof plea hearing, through January 17, 1996, the day before the\r\n\nfiling  of  Santiago's  motion  to  dismiss  the  superseding\r\n\nindictment.   Santiago  contends that  Esquilin's motion  for\r\n\nchange of plea, filed on December 1, 1995, was not excludable\r\n\nuntil at least December 26,  1995, when the court set January\r\n\n19, 1996 as  the date for Esquilin's change  of plea hearing.\r\n\nThis is so, he says,  because Esquilin's motion required  \"no\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ndisposition\" until  December 26,  (apparently because  it was\r\n\nnot yet scheduled for hearing), and because a contrary ruling\r\n\nwould  allow  district  judges  to  toll  the  STA  clock  by\r\n\nintentionally delaying their orders scheduling change of plea\r\n\nhearings.   The  short answer  to this  argument is  that the\r\n\nexclusion  provided  by      3161(h)(1)(F)  applies   without\r\n\nqualification  \"from the  filing of  the  motion through  the\r\n\nconclusion of  the hearing on . . . such motion,\" 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n3161(h)(1)(F) (1985); see  United States v. Jenkins,  92 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n430, 440  (6th Cir. 1996);  United States v.

As in the  case of\r\n\nRamos's  similar   motion,  Santiago   would  have   us  deny\r\n\nexcludability on the ground that  Jenkins does not stand  for\r                                                     \r\n\nthe proposition that  the entire period from the  filing of a\r\n\nmotion for  a change of plea until the change of plea hearing\r\n\nis   excludable.    The  holding  in  Jenkins,  according  to\r                                                         \r\n\nSantiago, dealt with a motion that did not require a hearing,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.   Santiago  points  out  that  the  district   court  also\r\nexcluded the period of time starting on October 18, 1995, the\r\nfiling  date of  the superseding  indictment,  and ending  on\r\nDecember 12,  1995, because  of \"ongoing  plea negotiations.\"\r\nAccording to Santiago, this exclusion of time is  contrary to\r\nboth the relevant facts and the applicable law.  We need not,\r\nhowever, consider the  appropriateness of this theory,  as we\r\ndo not make use of it in our STA calculation and instead rely\r\non other grounds for excluding most of this period of time.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nto  wit, a  motion to  use a  jury questionnaire.5   Santiago\r\n\ncontends that the hearing referred to in both   3161(h)(1)(F)\r\n\nand the Jenkins case is  one that is necessary to decide  the\r                           \r\n\nmerits of the motion, and that such was not the case here.\r\n\n          We  agree with the government that  all of the days\r\n\nbetween the date a codefendant files a motion for a change of\r\n\nplea and  the date of the  change of plea  hearing itself are\r\n\nexcludable from  the STA's  seventy-day time  limit.   See 18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.     3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7)  (1985); accord  Jenkins, 92\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 440; see also Henderson, 476 U.S. at 326-27; Sposito,\r                                                                        \r\n\n106 F.3d at 1044. \r\n\n          A  change of plea hearing is essential to establish\r\n\nthe  knowing and voluntary  nature of the  defendant's guilty\r\n\nplea, and to determine the sufficiency of its  factual basis.\r\n\nUntil  these factors are established,  the court may not rule\r\n\ndefinitively on  whether  or not  to  accept the  motion  for\r\n\nchange of plea.\r\n\n          Santiago argues that the district court in  Thurlow\r                                                                         \r\n\nsets  forth a  better reasoned  view  than the  one we  take.\r\n\nCiting to    3161(h)(8)(C),  the Thurlow  court ruled  that a\r                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  At  oral argument, Santiago's attorney  acknowledged that\r\nthere is  what he  called \"a brief,  passing comment\"  in the\r\nJenkins  opinion  that goes  into the  question of  whether a\r                   \r\nchange of plea notice is \"a motion requiring a hearing\" under\r\nthe STA.   Still, he dismissed it  as being \"bad law\"  and as\r\nnot  having  in  consideration the  rationale  of  cases like\r\nUnited States  v. Thurlow,  710 F. Supp.  380 (D.  Me. 1989),\r                                     \r\nwhich is more in harmony with the intent behind the STA.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ndelay caused by the \"general congestion of the courts\" is not\r\n\na sufficient basis  for the exclusion of time  from the STA's\r\n\nseventy-day time limit.  Thurlow,  710 F. Supp. at 383.   The\r                                            \r\n\ncourt thus concluded that an  exclusion of time under the STA\r\n\ncould not be granted for the period of time starting with the\r\n\ndefendant's  notice and  ending  with  the  court's  hearing,\r\n\nbecause  the delay was  due solely to  the court's scheduling\r\n\nrequirements.  See id.\r                                  \r\n\n          We remain unpersuaded.   A  defendant's request  to\r\n\nchange  his plea  clearly constitutes  a  pretrial motion,  a\r\n\nmotion  which automatically  triggers  an exclusion  of time.\r\n\nSee  18  U.S.C.     3161(h)(1)(F)  (1985).    The  weight  of\r               \r\n\nauthority is to this effect.  In Sposito, Jenkins, Henderson,\r                                                                        \r\n\nand  other cases,  courts  have agreed  that the  entire time\r\n\nbetween the  filing of a  pretrial motion and the  hearing on\r\n\nthat motion  is excludable  from the  STA's seventy-day  time\r\n\nlimit.   See, e.g., Henderson,  476 U.S. at  326-27; Sposito,\r                                                                        \r\n\n106 F.3d at 1044;  Jenkins, 92 F.3d at 440.   Hence, the days\r                                      \r\n\nbetween  December 1, 1995, the date Esquilin filed his motion\r\n\nfor  change  of plea,  and  January  22,  1996, the  date  of\r\n\nEsquilin's actual change of plea hearing, are all excludable.\r\n\n          On January 18,  1996, Santiago filed his  motion to\r\n\ndismiss  the  superseding  indictment for  lack  of  a speedy\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ntrial.  The  district court denied the motion  on January 23,\r\n\n1996.6    Both   parties  agree  that  these   six  days  are\r\n\nexcludable.   See 18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(F)  (1985).  January\r                             \r\n\n23,  1996 was the first  day of jury  trial, bringing the STA\r\n\nclock  to a  stop  in the  instant  case.   See  18 U.S.C.   \r                                                           \r\n\n3161(c)(1) (1985).  \r\n\n          We  conclude  that only  forty-nine  non-excludable\r\n\ndays ran off  the STA clock before the  commencement of trial\r\n\nand  that,  therefore, no  violation of  Santiago's statutory\r\n\nright to a speedy trial occurred.\r\n\n     2. The Constitutional Right\r                                            \r\n\n          Santiago  insists  that  the  delay  in  his  being\r\n\nbrought  to  trial  violated his  constitutional  right  to a\r\n\nspeedy trial.  We find no merit in this contention.  \r\n\n          The   Sixth   Amendment   to   the  United   States\r\n\nConstitution  provides,  in pertinent  part,  that  \"[i]n all\r\n\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a\r\n\nspeedy and public  trial.\"  U.S.  Const. amend. VI  (emphasis\r                  \r\n\nadded).    This  right attaches  upon  arrest  or indictment,\r\n\nwhichever occurs first.  See  United States v. MacDonald, 456\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 1, 6-7  (1981); United States v.

During trial,  the district court ruled  that Santiago's\r\nmotion  to dismiss  had  been \"untimely\",  since it  had been\r\nfiled just  prior to  trial.  We  accept Santiago's  argument\r\nthat untimeliness  would not,  on this  record, constitute  a\r\nvalid independent ground for denying the motion to dismiss.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n(1st Cir.  1993); United States  v.

For Sixth Amendment  purposes, Santiago is\r\n\nentitled to a computation of  time from October 20, 1994, the\r\n\ndate of his arrest.\r\n\n          That there was no violation of the STA in this case\r\n\nwould  not  necessarily  preclude  a  court  from  finding  a\r\n\nviolation of  Santiago's Sixth  Amendment right  to a  speedy\r\n\ntrial.  See United States v. Koller, 956 F.2d 1408, 1413 (7th\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1992).

For\r\n          example, the delay  that can be tolerated\r\n          for an ordinary street crime is less than\r\n          for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\r\n\nBarker,  407 U.S.  at 530-31;  see also  Koller, 956  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n1413.  The Supreme Court has said that \"the lower courts have\r\n\ngenerally   found    postaccusation   delay    'presumptively\r\n\nprejudicial' at least as it approaches one year.\"  Doggett v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  States, 505  U.S.  647,  652  n.1  (1992)  (citations\r                          \r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nomitted); see also  United States v.

We shall assume,  under the foregoing,\r\n\nthat the fifteen month delay in this case was  \"presumptively\r\n\nprejudicial\" so as to trigger further inquiry as to Santiago,\r\n\nsee, e.g.,  Koller, 956 F.2d  at 1414 (holding that  an eight\r                              \r\n\nand  one-half month  delay  was  enough  to  warrant  further\r\n\ninquiry); Colombo, 852 F.2d at 24 (holding that a twenty-four\r                             \r\n\nmonth  period   was  long   enough  to     be   presumptively\r\n\nprejudicial);  King,  909 F.  Supp.  at 372  (holding  that a\r                               \r\n\nthirty-one month delay  was sufficient to trigger  the Barker\r                                                                         \r\n\ntest).   Still,  we hold  that the  cumulative effect  of the\r\n\npretrial  delay, viewed  under all the  factors set  forth in\r\n\nBarker, falls  far short  of establishing  a Sixth  Amendment\r                  \r\n\nviolation.\r\n\n          As  noted,  the length  of  the delay  is  both the\r\n\ntrigger for  the Barker  analysis and one  of the  factors in\r                                   \r\n\nthat  analysis.   See  Colombo, 852  F.2d  at  24.   Once  an\r                                          \r\n\nexamination of  the  Sixth Amendment claim is  triggered, the\r\n\nweight  given in  the analysis  to  the length  of the  delay\r\n\ndepends upon the  extent to which the delay  exceeds the bare\r\n\nminimum considered presumptively  prejudicial.  See  Doggett,\r                                                                        \r\n\n505 U.S. at 652; King, 909 F. Supp. at 373.   Santiago waited\r                                 \r\n\nover fifteen  months for the  commencement of  trial in  this\r\n\ncase, a case more complicated than \"an ordinary street crime\"\r\n\nbut  less so  than \"a  serious,  complex conspiracy  charge.\"\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nBarker, 407 U.S. at 531.   Arguably, therefore, the period of\r                  \r\n\nthe delay was long enough to tip the scales slightly in favor\r\n\nof Santiago's instant claim.\r\n\n          The second factor, the reason(s) for the delay, has\r\n\nbeen called,  \"the focal inquiry.\"   United States  v. Sears,\r                                                                         \r\n\nRoebuck &amp;  Co., 877 F.2d  734, 739 (9th Cir.  1989) (citation\r                          \r\n\nomitted).  As with the first factor,  \"[h]ere, too, different\r\n\nweights  should be assigned  to different reasons.\"   Barker,\r                                                                        \r\n\n407 U.S. at 531.   Santiago argues that the chief contributor\r\n\nto  the  delay was  the  government's  lack  of diligence  in\r\n\nadvancing the  transfer proceedings, and  that the government\r\n\nused this  period of time  to further its case  by debriefing\r\n\nminors  Esquilin  and  Ramos, both  of  whom  were eventually\r\n\ncalled  to provide  testimony against  him.   We find  in the\r\n\nrecord  below, however, scant  indication that the  length of\r\n\nthe transfer proceedings was attributable to the government's\r\n\nmisconduct or negligence.   See Henson, 945 F.2d  at 437 n.7;\r                                                  \r\n\nColombo, 852 F.2d  at 25.   The rest of  the delay in  trying\r                   \r\n\nSantiago   resulted  mainly  from   his  own  motion   for  a\r\n\ncontinuance  of the trial  and his codefendants'  motions for\r\n\nchanges of  pleas.  Santiago never sought  relief from delays\r\n\noccasioned by his codefendants by requesting a severance.  We\r\n\nconclude that  the various delays  were each justified  by \"a\r\n\nvalid reason.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531.\r                                  \r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\n          The third factor, the  defendant's assertion of his\r\n\nspeedy trial right, \"is entitled to strong evidentiary weight\r\n\nin determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the\r\n\nright.\"   Barker, 407 U.S.  at 531-32; see also  Colombo, 852\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d   at 26.

See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nVachon,  869  F.2d  653,  657  (1st  Cir. 1989)  (finding  no\r                  \r\n\nviolation  of any  constitutional right  in a case  where the\r\n\ndefendant did not raise the constitutional speedy trial issue\r\n\nuntil  two days  before  trial).   The  record  in this  case\r\n\nsuggests  that  Santiago  only got  around  to  demanding his\r\n\nspeedy trial right when \"it 'became a possible means by which\r\n\nto obtain dismissal of the  charges against [him].'\"  Henson,\r                                                                        \r\n\n945 F.2d at  439 (quoting Colombo, 852 F.2d at 26).

We shall  assume\r                                \r\n\nthat  many  of  those   disadvantages  were  experienced   by\r\n\nSantiago,  who  was  subjected  to  over  fifteen  months  of\r\n\npretrial  imprisonment without  bail.   However, the  fifteen\r\n\nmonths of pretrial  incarceration by itself was  insufficient\r\n\nto  establish a  constitutional  level  of  prejudice.

Whoever, having  knowledge of  the\r\n          actual commission  of a  felony, conceals\r\n          and does  not  as soon  as possible  make\r\n          known  the same  to some  judge or  other\r\n          person  in  civil or  military  authority\r\n          under  the United  States, shall  be fine\r\n          [sic] under this title  or imprisoned not\r\n          more  than three years or both.  It seems\r\n          to  me that it  is my duty  as a judicial\r\n          officer to advise you, to warn  you, that\r\n          if  you  testify  pursuant  to  what  Mr.\r\n          Arroyo said -- and that's your decision -\r\n          -  you  will  be  incriminating  yourself\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\n          under  oath in a  record, and you  may be\r\n          exposed to 15  years in prison up  to the\r\n          maximum and  also three  years but  [sic]\r\n          misprision  of a  felony  which might  be\r\n          served  concurrently.     But  with  your\r\n          testimony  on the  record,  that will  be\r\n          enough  to take  it to  a  grand jury  to\r\n          obtain an indictment against you, and you\r\n          will be a  defendant in this court.   And\r\n          under the sentencing  guidelines you will\r\n          most probably have to do time, serve time\r\n          in  jail.   And there  is  no parole,  no\r\n          probation.\r\n\n               . . . .\r\n\n               So  I want to warn you again for the\r\n          last time so that if you do this you will\r\n          do this knowingly and willfully and after\r\n          having been  advised about  your --  your\r\n          right  not   to  be   incriminated  [sic]\r\n          against yourself,  but of course  that is\r\n          your decision.  My duty is to advise you,\r\n          to forewarn you about it.  If you want to\r\n          talk to your  lawyer, I will give  you an\r\n          opportunity to talk to him.\"\r\n\n               . . . .\r\n\n               But  --  let me  put  on the  record\r\n          again it is  your own decision.   I'm not\r\n          coercing you  into not  testifying.   I'm\r\n          telling you  may  [sic]  testify  if  you\r\n          wish.   If  you  wish  to testify  that's\r\n          fine.   You  just  go ahead  and testify.\r\n          I'm simply  telling you  the consequences\r\n          that  might ensue,  and  I underline  the\r\n          word \"might,\" not that they \"shall.\"\r\n\n          After  giving this warning,  the court appointed an\r\n\nassistant federal public defender to advise Caceres regarding\r\n\nher right not to incriminate herself.  Caceres consulted with\r\n\nthis lawyer and then decided not to testify for Santiago.\r\n\n          Santiago insists that, although  the court had wide\r\n\ndiscretion to warn a witness of the constitutional right  not\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nto  testify, it went  too far in  this instance.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Arthur, 949 F.2d  211, 215-16 (6th Cir. 1991). (\"An\r                            \r\n\nabuse  of  that  discretion  can  occur,  however,  when  the\r\n\ndistrict court actively  encourages a witness not  to testify\r\n\nor badgers a witness into remaining silent.\") \r\n\n          Santiago argues that Caceres's testimony would have\r\n\nsupported the  defense theory that  he was not a  knowing and\r\n\nwilling participant in  the criminal venture, but  rather was\r\n\n\"merely present\"  at the  scene of the  crime.   The witness,\r\n\naccording   to   Santiago,    was   privy   to   post-offense\r\n\nconversations  between the  codefendants,  and was  entrusted\r\n\nwith the  purchase of airline  tickets for them to  leave the\r\n\nisland.  Caceres's testimony, Santiago says, would have shown\r\n\nthat  both Esquilin  and  Ramos had  admitted  that they  had\r\n\nparticipated  in the offense, and had indicated that Santiago\r\n\nwas not a participant.\r\n\n          In  Webb v.  Texas,  409 U.S.  95,  98 (1972)  (per\r                                        \r\n\ncuriam), the Supreme Court said, respecting a judge's warning\r\n\nto a witness not to perjure himself, that: \r\n\n          in light  of the great  disparity between\r\n          the  posture of  the presiding  judge and\r\n          that of a witness in these circumstances,\r\n          the  unnecessarily strong  terms used  by\r\n          the  judge could  well have  exerted such\r\n          duress  on  the   witness'  mind  as   to\r\n          preclude  him  from  making  a  free  and\r\n          voluntary  choice   whether  or   not  to\r\n          testify.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\n          Santiago likens the judge's  comments here to those\r\n\nin Webb, pointing to  the fact that Caceres had come to court\r                   \r\n\nto testify on  the defendant's behalf, and declined  to do so\r\n\nonly  after the  judge's  lengthy and  allegedly intimidating\r\n\nwarning.  The district court, Santiago concludes, should have\r\n\nput the more  immediate interests of  the defendant on  trial\r\n\nand those of the general  public in the fullest disclosure of\r\n\nthe   relevant  evidence   before  the   protection  of   the\r\n\nvolunteering witness in this case.\r\n\n          It  is  true  that the  court's  admonition  to the\r\n\nwitness  here was  relatively  detailed and  strongly stated.\r\n\nHowever, the court was careful to emphasize that the  witness\r\n\ncould testify if she  wished, and we do not believe that what\r\n\nwas  said came  even close  to exerting  \"such duress  on the\r\n\nwitness's mind  as to preclude  [her] from making a  free and\r\n\nvoluntary choice whether or not to testify.\"  Id.\r                                                             \r\n\n          In Webb, the trial judge apparently  suspected that\r                             \r\n\na prison inmate called  as defendant's sole witness  was bent\r\n\non perjury.   The judge admonished  him that if he  lied, the\r\n\ncourt would \"personally see that  your case goes to the grand\r\n\njury and you will be  indicted for perjury and the likelihood\r\n\n[sic] is that you would get convicted  of perjury and that it\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nwould be stacked on to what you already got.\"7  Id. at 95-96.\r                                                               \r\n\nNo such threat, or threat of any type, was made here.\r\n\n          Rather the court sought to advise  this uncounseled\r\n\nwitness   of  her   constitutional   right  to   avoid  self-\r\n\nincrimination, having learned  from defense counsel  that she\r\n\nproposed  to  give  testimony of  an  obviously incriminating\r\n\nnature.  A  further difference between this case  and Webb is\r                                                                      \r\n\nthat,  here, the court  ultimately provided the  witness with\r\n\ncounsel with whom  she conferred privately before  making her\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.   The  trial  judge  admonished  the  defense  witness  as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n     Now you have been called  down as a witness in this\r\n     case by the  Defendant.  It is the  Court's duty to\r\n     admonish you that  you don't have to  testify, that\r\n     anything you say can and will  be used against you.\r\n     If  you take the witness stand  and lie under oath,\r\n     the Court will  personally see that your  case goes\r\n     to  the grand  jury and  you will  be  indicted for\r\n     perjury  and the likelihood [sic] is that you would\r\n     get  convicted  of  perjury and  that  it  would be\r\n     stacked onto what you have already got, so that  is\r\n     the matter  you have got  to make up your  mind on.\r\n     If you  get on  the witness stand  and lied,  it is\r\n     probably going to  mean several years and  at least\r\n     more  time that you are going to have to serve.  It\r\n     will  also be held  against yo in  the penitentiary\r\n     when  you're up for parole  and the Court wants you\r\n     to thoroughly understand the chances you're  taking\r\n     by getting on that witness  stand under oath.   You\r\n     may tell the truth and if yo do, that is all right,\r\n     but if  you lie you can get into real trouble.  The\r\n     court  wants  you to  know  that.   You  don't  owe\r\n     anybody anything to   testify and  it must be  done\r\n     freely  and  voluntarily  and  with  the   thorough\r\n     understanding  that  you know  the  hazard  you are\r\n     taking.\r\n\nWebb, 409 U.S. at 95-96 (internal quotation marks omitted). \r                \r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\ndecision whether to testify.  The provision of counsel helped\r\n\nassure that Caceres's  decision was made voluntarily,  in her\r\n\nown  interest,  rather  than being  the  product  of judicial\r\n\ncoercion.8   The  court  took pains  here  to emphasize  that\r\n\nCaceres could testify if she wished.  The Webb judge's sparse\r                                                          \r\n\ncomments  along similar  lines were  weakly  stated and  were\r\n\novershadowed  by the court's  threats to proceed  against the\r\n\nwitness for perjury if he took the stand.\r\n\n          Santiago  also  relies  upon  the  Sixth  Circuit's\r\n\nArthur decision.   Unlike  Webb, Arthur  involved a  judicial\r                                                   \r\n\nwarning  to a  witness  about  Fifth  Amendment  rights.  The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.   After  Caceres received  advise  from Assistant  Federal\r\nPublic Defender Carlos  Vazquez, the following  exchange took\r\nplace:\r\n\n     \"MR.  VAZQUEZ: Your Honor, we have  talked both with Mr.\r\n     Arroyo and the witness in this case.  We have once again\r\n     explained to her her rights and the possible or probable\r\n     consequences of testifying or not testifying.  And after\r\n     this discussion this  witness has opted not  to continue\r\n     testifying in this case.\r\n\n     THE COURT: She  will not testify?   She hasn't testified\r\n     at all.\r\n\n     MR. VAZQUEZ: Then she will not testify. \r\n\n     THE COURT: Very  well.  Let  me ask  you, did you  heard\r\n     [sic] counsel, what he said?  \r\n\n     WANDA CACERES: Yes.\r\n\n     THE COURT: And what is your decision?\r\n\n     WANDA CACERES: Not to testify.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  Very well.   You're excused.   You  may step\r\n     down.\"  \r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\nwitness,  however, had  his own  attorney  and stated  to the\r\n\ndistrict court,  after being advised  of his rights,  that he\r\n\nwanted to testify  in order to clear the  defendant.  Arthur,\r                                                                        \r\n\n949  F.2d  at 214-15.    Instead  of acquiescing,  the  court\r\n\ncontinued to warn the witness of the adverse  consequences of\r\n\ntestifying, finally saying,  \"I think it's  not in your  best\r\n\ninterest to  testify  because anything  you say  may be  held\r\n\nagainst  you  in  another prosecution  against  you  for bank\r\n\nrobbery, could and  would be used  against you.\"  Id.   After\r                                                                 \r\n\nthat, the witness changed his mind about testifying.  \r\n\n          The Sixth Circuit, citing Webb, held that it was an\r                                                    \r\n\nabuse of  discretion for  a  judge to  repeatedly inform  the\r\n\ncounseled  witness,  after  the witness  had  stated  that he\r\n\nwanted to testify following an initial warning, of  his right\r\n\nto  remain  silent  and  that  to  testify  was  against  his\r\n\ninterest.  Id. at 216.\r                          \r\n\n          In the  present case,  there was  no repetition  of\r\n\nwarnings  after  an  informed announcement  of  an  intent to\r\n\ntestify, nor did  the court keep insisting on  a decision not\r\n\nto  testify, as  was done in  Arthur.   To the  contrary, the\r                                                \r\n\ndistrict judge made the following statement:\r\n\n               But  I -- let  me put on  the record\r\n          again it is  your own decision.   I'm not\r\n          coercing you  into not  testifying.   I'm\r\n          telling  you may testify if you wish.  If\r\n          you wish  to  testify that's  fine.   You\r\n          just go  ahead and  testify.   I'm simply\r\n          telling you  the consequences  that might\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\n          ensure, and I underline the word 'might,'\r\n          not that they 'shall.'\r\n\n          We  conclude that Caceres was not \"badgered\" by the\r\n\ncourt  into declining  to  testify.    Rather,  the  district\r\n\njudge's  warnings were  meant to  strengthen  rather than  to\r\n\nweaken the voluntariness of Caceres's choice by informing her\r\n\nof the  risks inherent in  her proposed testimony and  of her\r\n\nconstitutional right not to testify.  \r\n\n          In  doing this,  the judge might  understandably be\r\n\nconcerned  lest   the  uncounseled  Caceres   be  manipulated\r\n\nunfairly  by  defendant,  to   her  own  great  disadvantage.\r\n\nProviding Caceres with access to a public defender before she\r\n\ntook the stand further  assured that her decision whether  or\r\n\nnot to  testify would be  an informed  and voluntary one.   A\r\n\njudge  is entitled  to make  sure  a witness  understands her\r\n\nFifth Amendment rights.   While different trial  judges might\r\n\nhandle the  matter differently, we see no  impropriety in the\r\n\ncourt's   conduct,  and  no  duress  precluding  a  free  and\r\n\nvoluntary  choice.   To  the contrary,  the  court sought  to\r\n\nfacilitate the  ability of  the witness  to make an  informed\r\n\nchoice free from coercion by the defendant or anyone else.\r\n\n          We conclude  there was no error in the character of\r\n\nthe warnings given  to Caceres by the district  court in this\r\n\ncase.   While the judge's  language was forceful, he  made it\r\n\nclear that  she was free to  testify and we may  presume that\r\n\nher provided counsel confirmed that right.  We conclude  that\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nSantiago's  due process right to present witnesses in his own\r\n\ndefense was not  compromised by Caceres's voluntary  decision\r\n\nnot to take the stand,  and that the court's handling of  the\r\n\nmatter was within its discretion.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n",

On March 1, 1995, the district court ordered a pretrial conference on March 6, 1995, and set Santiago's trial for March 13, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 10, 1995, the government requested a continuance of the March 13 trial date, stating that Esquilin and Ramos were both awaiting a hearing on a motion to transfer to adult status.  If the transfers were allowed, the government proposed to try them along with Santiago.  Without objection, the district court allowed the continuance on March 13, 1995.  The court found the ends of justice were served by continuing the trial, and that the ability to try together all persons implicated in this case outweighed the interests in a speedy trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1995, the district court ordered that both Esquilin and Ramos be transferred to adult status.  On October 18, 1995, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment, charging the two transferred minors and Santiago with the same offenses charged in the original indictment against Santiago alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 1995, Ramos entered a plea of guilty as to counts one and two of the superseding indictment pursuant to a Plea and Cooperation Agreement.  On January 22, 1996, Esquilin did the same in respect to count one of the superseding indictment.  Santiago's trial was set for January 23, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 18, 1996, Santiago filed a motion to dismiss the superseding indictment for violation of his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial.  Five days later, following argument, the district court ruled to deny Santiago's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began, as scheduled, on January 23, 1995.  On the fifth day of trial, the defense called Wanda Caceres (\"Caceres\"), Santiago's stepmother, to the witness stand.  Before she could testify, the court required the defense to make a proffer of her expected testimony.  Counsel represented that Caceres would testify about her post-offense conversations with the defendants and about her efforts to purchase airline tickets for them to travel to the mainland.  After the proffer, the district court warned Caceres about her right to refuse to testify, because of the possibility that she might incriminate herself.  The court also appointed an attorney to advise Caceres, who was unrepresented to that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Caceres's lawyer explained \"her rights and the possible or probable consequences of testifying,\" Caceres decided not to testify.  Later that same day, the jury returned a verdict, finding Santiago guilty on counts one and two of the superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 1996, the district court sentenced Santiago to life imprisonment on count one and, consecutively, to sixty months' imprisonment on count two.

The Statutory Right</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Speedy Trial Act (\"STA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161 et seq.  (1985), is designed \"to protect a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy ... trial, and to serve the public interest in bringing prompt criminal proceedings.\"  United States v. Saltzman, 984 F.2d 1087, 1090 (10th Cir.1993) (citing United States v. Noone, 913 F.2d 20, 28 (1st Cir.1990)).  The STA provides that the government must bring a criminal defendant to trial no more than seventy days after the later of the filing date of the information or indictment or the date on which the criminal defendant first appears before a judicial officer of the court in which the charge is pending.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1) (1985);  see also United States v. Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d 520, 525 (1st Cir.1988).  In calculating the seventy days the STA excludes certain time periods.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)-(9) (1985);  see also United States v. Sposito, 106 F.3d 1042, 1043 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Thurlow, 710 F.Supp. 380, 381 (D.Me.1989).  If a criminal defendant is not brought to trial within the seventy-day time limit required by &#167; 3161(c)(1), as extended by operation of &#167; 3161(h)(1)-(9), the penalty provisions of the STA mandate that \"the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2) (1985);  see also Sposito, 106 F.3d at 1043;  Thurlow, 710 F.Supp. at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment.  He says that the delay in his being brought to trial added up to twice the number of statutorily allowable days.  In response, the government asserts that only forty-nine non-excludable days passed before Santiago was brought to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the district court's refusal to dismiss the superseding indictment.  This court reviews the disposition of a STA issue for clear error as to factual findings and de novo as to legal rulings.  See United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1162 (1st Cir.1995).  We conclude that fewer than seventy non-excludable days went by before Santiago was brought to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>a) November 4, 1994 to March 1, 1995 (Santiago's motion for</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>a continuance of trial)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original indictment was returned on November 2, 1994.  Santiago first appeared before a judicial officer of the district court on November 4, 1994.  STA calculation begins with the latter of these two dates.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">November 4, 1994 is itself excludable because Santiago appeared before the district court on that day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985) (\"proceedings concerning the defendant\").  That day is also excludable for another reason, to wit, the government's motion to detain Santiago without bail pending the detention hearing, which the court granted that same day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  Section 3161(h)(1)(F) excludes any \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\"  Id. November 9, 1994 is excludable because of Santiago's arraignment and detention hearing on that day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago contends that the period from November 10, 1994 up to and including November 21, 1994 is non-excludable.  The government agrees.  We therefore find a total of sixteen non-excludable days up to this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1994, Santiago filed a motion notifying the district court of his counsel's unavailability on January 12, 1995, the scheduled trial date, because of another trial.  Santiago requested an indefinite continuance of the trial as set for January 12, 1995.  The court granted this motion ten days later, on December 1, 1994, ordering counsel to notify the court when the other trial was over.  The parties agree that the ten days the court took to decide the motion were excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  They likewise agree that December 2, 1994 was excludable, a pretrial conference being held on that day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago asserts that the six days from December 3, 1994 to December 8, 1994 are non-excludable.  The government contends that the indefinite continuance of the trial, granted at defendant's request on December 1, 1994, makes these days excludable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STA excludes any period of delay resulting from the court's granting of a continuance if the continuance was granted on the basis of findings that the ends of justice served outweigh the speedy trial interest.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A) (1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  An ends of justice continuance was granted here.  Santiago contends, however, that the excludable time attributable to the continuance must be limited to the period of time between January 12, 1995, the original trial date, and February 2, 1995, the date defense counsel notified the court of his availability for trial.  The government maintains that the entire three month period of time starting on December 1, 1994, the date the court continued the original trial date, and ending on March 1, 1995, the day the court set a new trial date, is excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government.  The \"period of delay\" resulting from the continuance began on December 1, 1994, when the January 12, 1995, trial date was canceled and the trial put on hold until further order.  The period of delay remained in effect from then through March 1, 1995, when, after having been earlier advised of counsel's availability, the court set a new trial date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no way to regard the period from the court's December 1 ruling to the original January 12 trial date as if no continuance were then in effect.  The continuance ruled out all possibility of a trial while it lasted, relieving the parties of the need to prepare for trial on January 12, as previously scheduled, or at any time from December 1 until a new trial date was set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contending that a continuance of trial ends when the reason for it ends, Santiago argues that the twenty-seven day period beginning on February 2, 1995 and ending on March 1, 1995, during which the court was aware of defense counsel's availability but had not yet set a new trial date, cannot be excludable.  To exclude that period, Santiago asserts, citing to United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 505-06 (1st Cir.1984), would give rise to an automatic additional period of exclusion after every \"ends of justice\" continuance between the notice that the event triggering the continuance of trial has ended and the court's order setting a new trial date.  Santiago argues that his counsel's February 2, 1995 notice of availability left nothing for the district court to do but set a new trial date, a routine act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not accept Santiago's argument.  The \"period of delay\" caused by the ends of justice continuance included the time, following counsel's notice of readiness, that the judge reasonably required to schedule a new trial date.  The mere announcement of counsel's availability did not automatically terminate the continuance of the trial.  Setting a new date required consideration of the court's calendar;  an available window had to be found.  The court may not have been able to determine as soon as counsel's availability was known when its other obligations would allow the scheduling of a trial.  The court took less than a month to schedule a new trial date, which was not an unreasonable delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that the twenty-seven days that elapsed before a new trial date was set can be viewed as separately excludable under the provisions of &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), which excludes the time pending disposition of a motion.  By notifying the court of his availability for trial, defense counsel may be said to have impliedly moved for a new trial date.  The court acted on the implied motion on March 1, 1995 by setting a new trial date of March 13, 1995.  Motions that do not require a hearing may toll the seventy-day time limit for up to thirty days.  See Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 329, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 1876, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986) (noting that the phrase \"prompt disposition\" in &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) so limits the amount of time that can be excluded).  As already noted, the twenty-seven days taken by the court to determine a new date was reasonable enough.  We conclude that the entire period from December 1, 1994 through March 1, 1995 was excludable for purposes of the STA, leaving us still with a total of sixteen non-excludable days at this point in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>b) March 2, 1995 to October 18, 1995 (The government's</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>motion for a continuance of trial)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new March 13 trial date did not stand for long.  On March 10, 1995, the government moved to continue Santiago's trial in order to allow it to obtain permission to try the two juveniles, Ramos and Esquilin, as adults, in which event they would be eligible to be tried jointly with Santiago.  Finding that the \"ends of justice\" would be served by continuing the trial pending resolution of Ramos's and Esquilin's adult status, the district court allowed the government's motion on March 13, 1995.  The parties agree that the period of time from March 2, 1995, the day after the district court set the March 13 trial date, until March 9, 1995, the day before the government filed its motion to continue the new trial date, was non-excludable.  They also agree that the days between March 10, 1995, the day the government filed its motion to continue the trial, and March 13, 1995, the day the district court granted the government's motion to continue the trial, were excludable.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  The addition of the eight non-excludable days yields a new total of twenty-four non-excludable days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>c) March 14, 1995 to October 18, 1995</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree sharply over exclusion of the 219-day period beginning on March 14, 1995, the day after the district court granted the government's motion to continue the trial, until October 18, 1995, the day a superseding indictment against all three defendants was returned.  The March 13 continuance was open-ended, although as Santiago acknowledges, that, in and of itself, did not make it invalid.  Open-ended continuances are not prohibited per se.  See United States v. Spring, 80 F.3d 1450, 1457-58 (10th Cir.1996);  United States v. Jones, 56 F.3d 581, 585-86 &amp; n. 10 (5th Cir.1995);  United States v. Lattany, 982 F.2d 866, 868 (3d Cir.1992);  Rush, 738 F.2d at 508.   But see United States v. Jordan, 915 F.2d 563, 565-66 (9th Cir.1990) (\"The Speedy Trial Act ... requires that an 'ends of justice' continuance be specifically limited in time....\").  This court has said, \"it is generally preferable to limit a continuance to a definite period for the sake of clarity and certainty;  but at the same time it is inevitable that in some cases ... a court is forced to order an (h)(8) continuance without knowing exactly how long the reasons supporting the continuance will remain valid.\"  Rush, 738 F.2d at 508.   An open-ended continuance may, therefore, bring to bear a factor of \"reasonableness.\"   See Lattany, 982 F.2d at 868 (\"[O]pen-ended continuances to serve the ends of justice are not prohibited if they are reasonable in length.\");  Rush, 738 F.2d at 508 (\"It may well be that some sort of reasonableness limitation is appropriate to prevent continuances from delaying trials unfairly and circumventing the dismissal sanctions in the Speedy Trial Act....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances, including the previous delays, the 219 day delay was clearly unreasonable.  Much of that delay, he contends, was attributable to government foot-dragging and, therefore, lacked an element of defendant's involvement that has led us to exclude open-ended continuances in the past.  See Lattany, 982 F.2d at 883 (holding that the length of a continuance was not unreasonable because of defendant's part in extending the delay).  Santiago maintains that the docket entries for the transfer proceedings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> are suggestive of governmental bad faith and needless delay.  He points to the postponement of a March 21, 1995 evidentiary hearing for Ramos after the government said that it had not received notice of it.  Santiago contends that this delay, in addition to other questionable delays, indicate that the government was not acting expeditiously in spite of knowing that he was still awaiting trial.  And, finally, Santiago says he was misled into believing that the transfer proceedings would end momentarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find little support for Santiago's charge that the transfer proceedings were protracted by governmental indifference and impropriety.  Their duration does not seem extreme in the circumstances, and the continuance of Santiago's trial until it could be determined whether to try the minor codefendants with Santiago was reasonable, especially where Santiago raised no objection at the time.  Cf. Parker v. United States, 404 F.2d 1193, 1196 (9th Cir.1968) (noting the substantial public interest in joint trials).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two juveniles' natural resistance to being tried as adults affords an obvious explanation for the time consumed by the transfer proceedings.  The seriousness of the charges provided good reason for them to do everything possible to retain their juvenile status.  That the adult classification issue was not simple is suggested by the fact that, although the district judge ultimately transferred both minors to adult status, the magistrate judge presiding over the transfer proceedings recommended the transfer of only one of them.  The limited record that we have reflects delays arising from, among other things, difficulties in arranging for psychological evaluations of the two juveniles.  At no time within this period did Santiago seek either to terminate the continuance of his trial or to expedite the transfer proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the continuance for the transfer proceedings was not unreasonable or excessively long.  Accordingly, we exclude the period between March 14 and October 18, 1995, pursuant to &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A).  This exclusion keeps the STA count at twenty-four non-excludable days at this point in the calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>d) October 19, 1995 to January 23, 1996 (Esquilin's motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>for a change of plea)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The October 18, 1995 superseding indictment, which included Ramos and Esquilin as defendants along with Santiago, did not restart Santiago's STA's clock because it was based on the original charges.  See United States v. Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 231, 240, 106 S.Ct. 555, 560, 88 L.Ed.2d 537 (1985) (Blackmun, J., concurring);  United States v. Karsseboom, 881 F.2d 604, 606-07 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that, with the exception of October 25, 1995, the days between October 19, 1995, the day after the filing of the superseding indictment, and November 13, 1995, the day before the filing of the government's motion as to Ramos to seal documents, were non-excludable.  October 25, 1995 was excludable because it was the day that Santiago was arraigned under the superseding indictment.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985).  Adding these twenty-five non-excludable days gives a new total of forty-nine non-excludable days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the superseding indictment pertained to all three, any defendant's motion resulting in excludable time tolled the STA clock for his codefendants.  See United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 27-28 (1st Cir.1994);  Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d at 526 (\"A pretrial motion resulting in excludable time for one defendant also stops the Speedy Trial clock for all codefendants.\"  (citations omitted));  Rush, 738 F.2d at 503 (\"Every circuit court that has considered [&#167; 3161(h)(7) ] has held in essence that 'an exclusion applicable to one defendant applies to all codefendants.' \"  (citations omitted)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Accordingly, November 14, 1995, the date the government filed its motion to seal documents as to Ramos;  November 15, 1995, the date Ramos filed his motion for a change of plea;  and November 16, 1995, the date the court granted the motion to seal as to Ramos and scheduled his change of plea hearing, are all excludable from Santiago's STA computation.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that, with the exception of November 27, 1995, the period of time from November 17, 1995, the day after the court acted on the two motions, until December 3, 1995, the day before Ramos's change of plea hearing, is non-excludable.  He concedes that November 27, 1995 is excludable because of the arraignment and detention hearings of Esquilin and Ramos on that date.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7) (1985).  The government, however, would exclude the entire period from November 17 through December 4, arguing that Ramos's change of plea motion was continuously under advisement until allowed at a hearing on December 4, 1995.  We agree with the government, as discussed below, and exclude that period of time from the STA's seventy-day time limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also disputes any exclusion of the period of time from December 5, 1995, the day after Ramos's change of plea hearing, through January 17, 1996, the day before the filing of Santiago's motion to dismiss the superseding indictment.  Santiago contends that Esquilin's motion for change of plea, filed on December 1, 1995, was not excludable until at least December 26, 1995, when the court set January 19, 1996 as the date for Esquilin's change of plea hearing.  This is so, he says, because Esquilin's motion required \"no disposition\" until December 26, (apparently because it was not yet scheduled for hearing), and because a contrary ruling would allow district judges to toll the STA clock by intentionally delaying their orders scheduling change of plea hearings.  The short answer to this argument is that the exclusion provided by &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) applies without qualification \"from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on ... such motion,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985);  see United States v. Jenkins, 92 F.3d 430, 440 (6th Cir.1996);  United States v. Mentz, 840 F.2d 315, 327 n. 25 (6th Cir.1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also questions the excludability of the post-December 26 period during which Esquilin's change of plea motion continued under advisement.  As in the case of Ramos's similar motion, Santiago would have us deny excludability on the ground that Jenkins does not stand for the proposition that the entire period from the filing of a motion for a change of plea until the change of plea hearing is excludable.  The holding in Jenkins, according to Santiago, dealt with a motion that did not require a hearing, to wit, a motion to use a jury questionnaire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Santiago contends that the hearing referred to in both &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) and the Jenkins case is one that is necessary to decide the merits of the motion, and that such was not the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that all of the days between the date a codefendant files a motion for a change of plea and the date of the change of plea hearing itself are excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7) (1985);  accord Jenkins, 92 F.3d at 440;  see also Henderson, 476 U.S. at 326-27, 106 S.Ct. at 1874-75;  Sposito, 106 F.3d at 1044.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A change of plea hearing is essential to establish the knowing and voluntary nature of the defendant's guilty plea, and to determine the sufficiency of its factual basis.  Until these factors are established, the court may not rule definitively on whether or not to accept the motion for change of plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that the district court in Thurlow sets forth a better reasoned view than the one we take.  Citing to &#167; 3161(h)(8)(C), the Thurlow court ruled that a delay caused by the \"general congestion of the courts\" is not a sufficient basis for the exclusion of time from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  Thurlow, 710 F.Supp. at 383.   The court thus concluded that an exclusion of time under the STA could not be granted for the period of time starting with the defendant's notice and ending with the court's hearing, because the delay was due solely to the court's scheduling requirements.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remain unpersuaded.  A defendant's request to change his plea clearly constitutes a pretrial motion, a motion which automatically triggers an exclusion of time.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  The weight of authority is to this effect.  In Sposito, Jenkins, Henderson, and other cases, courts have agreed that the entire time between the filing of a pretrial motion and the hearing on that motion is excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  See, e.g., Henderson, 476 U.S. at 326-27, 106 S.Ct. at 1874-75;  Sposito, 106 F.3d at 1044;  Jenkins, 92 F.3d at 440.   Hence, the days between December 1, 1995, the date Esquilin filed his motion for change of plea, and January 22, 1996, the date of Esquilin's actual change of plea hearing, are all excludable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 18, 1996, Santiago filed his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment for lack of a speedy trial.  The district court denied the motion on January 23, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Both parties agree that these six days are excludable.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  January 23, 1996 was the first day of jury trial, bringing the STA clock to a stop in the instant case.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that only forty-nine non-excludable days ran off the STA clock before the commencement of trial and that, therefore, no violation of Santiago's statutory right to a speedy trial occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Constitutional Right</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago insists that the delay in his being brought to trial violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial.  We find no merit in this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  VI (emphasis added).  This right attaches upon arrest or indictment, whichever occurs first.  See United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6-7, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 1500-02, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1982);  United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1061 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Colombo, 852 F.2d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1988).  For Sixth Amendment purposes, Santiago is entitled to a computation of time from October 20, 1994, the date of his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That there was no violation of the STA in this case would not necessarily preclude a court from finding a violation of Santiago's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.  See United States v. Koller, 956 F.2d 1408, 1413 (7th Cir.1992).  Section 3173 of the STA states that \"[n]o provision of this chapter shall be interpreted as a bar to any claim of denial of speedy trial as required by amendment VI of the Constitution.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3173 (1985);  see also United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1049 (1st Cir.1983).  \"It would be, however, 'an unusual case in which the time limits of the [STA] have been met but the [S]ixth [A]mendment right to speedy trial has been violated.' \"  Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1049 (quoting United States v. Nance, 666 F.2d 353, 360 (9th Cir.1982)).  This court reviews a district court's speedy trial determination under the Sixth Amendment for abuse of discretion.  See Colombo, 852 F.2d at 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530-33, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2191-94, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), the Supreme Court established a four-part balancing test to be used in determining whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been violated.  See, e.g., Mala, 7 F.3d at 1061.   A court should consider:  (1) the length of the delay;  (2) the reason(s) for the delay;  (3) the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right;  and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay.  See, e.g., id.  (citing to Barker, 407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2191-92).  \"None of these factors is 'either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial.  Rather, they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.' \"  United States v. Henson, 945 F.2d 430, 437 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 533, 92 S.Ct. at 2193).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first factor, the length of the delay, was identified by the Supreme Court as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>to some extent a triggering mechanism.  Until there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance.  Nevertheless, because of the imprecision of the right to speedy trial, the length of delay that will provoke such an inquiry is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case.  For example, the delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barker, 407 U.S. at 530-31, 92 S.Ct. at 2191-92;  see also Koller, 956 F.2d at 1413.   The Supreme Court has said that \"the lower courts have generally found postaccusation delay 'presumptively prejudicial' at least as it approaches one year.\"  Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 652 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 2691 n. 1, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992) (citations omitted);  see also United States v. King, 909 F.Supp. 369, 372 (E.D.Va.1995).  We shall assume, under the foregoing, that the fifteen month delay in this case was \"presumptively prejudicial\" so as to trigger further inquiry as to Santiago, see, e.g., Koller, 956 F.2d at 1414 (holding that an eight and one-half month delay was enough to warrant further inquiry);  Colombo, 852 F.2d at 24 (holding that a twenty-four month period was long enough to be presumptively prejudicial);  King, 909 F.Supp. at 372 (holding that a thirty-one month delay was sufficient to trigger the Barker test).  Still, we hold that the cumulative effect of the pretrial delay, viewed under all the factors set forth in Barker, falls far short of establishing a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the length of the delay is both the trigger for the Barker analysis and one of the factors in that analysis.  See Colombo, 852 F.2d at 24.   Once an examination of the Sixth Amendment claim is triggered, the weight given in the analysis to the length of the delay depends upon the extent to which the delay exceeds the bare minimum considered presumptively prejudicial.  See Doggett, 505 U.S. at 652, 112 S.Ct. at 2690-91;  King, 909 F.Supp. at 373.   Santiago waited over fifteen months for the commencement of trial in this case, a case more complicated than \"an ordinary street crime\" but less so than \"a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.   Arguably, therefore, the period of the delay was long enough to tip the scales slightly in favor of Santiago's instant claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor, the reason(s) for the delay, has been called, \"the focal inquiry.\"  United States v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 877 F.2d 734, 739 (9th Cir.1989) (citation omitted).  As with the first factor, \"[h]ere, too, different weights should be assigned to different reasons.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.   Santiago argues that the chief contributor to the delay was the government's lack of diligence in advancing the transfer proceedings, and that the government used this period of time to further its case by debriefing minors Esquilin and Ramos, both of whom were eventually called to provide testimony against him.  We find in the record below, however, scant indication that the length of the transfer proceedings was attributable to the government's misconduct or negligence.  See Henson, 945 F.2d at 437 n. 7;  Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25.   The rest of the delay in trying Santiago resulted mainly from his own motion for a continuance of the trial and his codefendants' motions for changes of pleas.  Santiago never sought relief from delays occasioned by his codefendants by requesting a severance.  We conclude that the various delays were each justified by \"a valid reason.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor, the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right, \"is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531-32, 92 S.Ct. at 2192-93;  see also Colombo, 852 F.2d at 26.   The failure to assert the right, the Barker Court noted, \"will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193;  see also Colombo 852 F.2d at 26.   A defendant should give some indication, prior to his assertion of a speedy trial violation, that he wishes to proceed to trial.  See Henson, 945 F.2d at 438-39;  Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 877 F.2d at 740;  Colombo, 852 F.2d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago did not demand a speedy trial at any time prior to his motion to dismiss, which he filed immediately prior to the commencement of his trial.  See United States v. Vachon, 869 F.2d 653, 657 (1st Cir.1989) (finding no violation of any constitutional right in a case where the defendant did not raise the constitutional speedy trial issue until two days before trial).  The record in this case suggests that Santiago only got around to demanding his speedy trial right when \"it 'became a possible means by which to obtain dismissal of the charges against [him].' \"  Henson, 945 F.2d at 439 (quoting Colombo, 852 F.2d at 26).   Hence in respect to the third factor, Santiago's failure to request a speedy trial earlier than he did weighs against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth, and final, factor--the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay--\"should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect.  Th[e] Court has identified three such interests:  (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration;  (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused;  and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193 (footnote omitted);  see also Koller, 956 F.2d at 1414.   The Barker Court went on to discuss the disadvantages of lengthy pretrial incarceration for the accused who cannot obtain his release.  See Barker, 407 U.S. at 532-33, 92 S.Ct. at 2193-94.   We shall assume that many of those disadvantages were experienced by Santiago, who was subjected to over fifteen months of pretrial imprisonment without bail.  However, the fifteen months of pretrial incarceration by itself was insufficient to establish a constitutional level of prejudice.  Cf. Barker, 407 U.S. at 534, 92 S.Ct. at 2194 (finding that the prejudice was minimal in a case in which the defendant spent ten months in jail before trial);  Koller, 956 F.2d at 1414 (\"Koller did spend the entire eight and one-half months of delay in jail, but in Barker the Court found that ten months of incarceration prior to trial was not sufficient to raise to the level of prejudice.\"  (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect to Santiago's anxiety and concern in awaiting trial, we do not weigh this heavily, especially where Santiago took no early action to expedite his trial, either by demanding an earlier trial or by seeking a severance from the minor codefendants.  \"While 'this type of prejudice is not to be brushed off lightly,' considerable anxiety normally attends the initiation and pendency of criminal charges;  hence only 'undue pressures' are considered.\"  Henson, 945 F.2d at 438 (citing Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25 (stressing that \"the standard here is minimization, not necessarily elimination of the natural consequences of an indictment\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Among the three interests safeguarded by the right to speedy trial as guaranteed under the [S]ixth [A]mendment, 'the most serious is [protection against impairment of the defense] because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.' \"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193 (citations omitted).  There is no indication here that the period of pretrial delay interfered in any way with Santiago's ability to present evidence or obtain the testimony of witnesses, or that it had any impact on the fairness of his trial.  See Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25-26.   Accordingly, this paramount interest in no way favors Santiago's claim of constitutional impairment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, applying Barker 's balancing test, that Santiago's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>B.

See Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967) (\"Just as an accused has the right to confront the prosecution's witnesses for the purpose of challenging their testimony, he has the right to present his own witnesses to establish a defense.  This right is a fundamental element of due process of law.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 1996, Santiago called his stepmother Wanda Caceres to the witness stand.  Before she could take the stand, however, the district court warned her of her right to refuse to testify because of the possibility that she might incriminate herself.  The court stated, inter alia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>--Caceres, I want to advise you--and listen to me carefully because this may have serious--I would say severe consequences for you.

It says:  Whoever, knowing that an offense against the U.S. has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment is an accessory after the fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And listen to this carefully, listen to the penalty.  I'm going to read to you the pertinent provision.  In this case the maximum possible penalty is life for the defendant, life imprisonment, and the ... statute says that whoever is an accessory after the fact exposes himself or herself as follows:  If the principal is punishable by life imprisonment or death, the accessory--that means you--shall be imprisoned not more than 15 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So that's one of the offenses that you will be committing if you testify--if--I mean that can be charged against you by incriminating yourself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there's another offense.  A mis--there's--there's a misprision of a felony, and I'm going to read it to you.  Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fine [sic] under this title or imprisoned not more than three years or both.  It seems to me that it is my duty as a judicial officer to advise you, to warn you, that if you testify pursuant to what Mr. Arroyo said--and that's your decision--you will be incriminating yourself under oath in a record, and you may be exposed to 15 years in prison up to the maximum and also three years but [sic] misprision of a felony which might be served concurrently.  But with your testimony on the record, that will be enough to take it to a grand jury to obtain an indictment against you, and you will be a defendant in this court.  And under the sentencing guidelines you will most probably have to do time, serve time in jail.  And there is no parole, no probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I want to warn you again for the last time so that if you do this you will do this knowingly and willfully and after having been advised about your--your right not to be incriminated [sic] against yourself, but of course that is your decision.

See United States v. Arthur, 949 F.2d 211, 215-16 (6th Cir.1991).  (\"An abuse of that discretion can occur, however, when the district court actively encourages a witness not to testify or badgers a witness into remaining silent.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that Caceres's testimony would have supported the defense theory that he was not a knowing and willing participant in the criminal venture, but rather was \"merely present\" at the scene of the crime.  The witness, according to Santiago, was privy to post-offense conversations between the codefendants, and was entrusted with the purchase of airline tickets for them to leave the island.  Caceres's testimony, Santiago says, would have shown that both Esquilin and Ramos had admitted that they had participated in the offense, and had indicated that Santiago was not a participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Webb v. Texas, 409 U.S. 95, 98, 93 S.Ct. 351, 353-54, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972) (per curiam), the Supreme Court said, respecting a judge's warning to a witness not to perjure himself, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>in light of the great disparity between the posture of the presiding judge and that of a witness in these circumstances, the unnecessarily strong terms used by the judge could well have exerted such duress on the witness' mind as to preclude him from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago likens the judge's comments here to those in Webb, pointing to the fact that Caceres had come to court to testify on the defendant's behalf, and declined to do so only after the judge's lengthy and allegedly intimidating warning.  The district court, Santiago concludes, should have put the more immediate interests of the defendant on trial and those of the general public in the fullest disclosure of the relevant evidence before the protection of the volunteering witness in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the court's admonition to the witness here was relatively detailed and strongly stated.  However, the court was careful to emphasize that the witness could testify if she wished, and we do not believe that what was said came even close to exerting \"such duress on the witness's mind as to preclude [her] from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Webb, the trial judge apparently suspected that a prison inmate called as defendant's sole witness was bent on perjury.  The judge admonished him that if he lied, the court would \"personally see that your case goes to the grand jury and you will be indicted for perjury and the likelihood [sic] is that you would get convicted of perjury and that it would be stacked on to what you already got.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Id. at 95-96, 93 S.Ct. at 352-53.   No such threat, or threat of any type, was made here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather the court sought to advise this uncounseled witness of her constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination, having learned from defense counsel that she proposed to give testimony of an obviously incriminating nature.  A further difference between this case and Webb is that, here, the court ultimately provided the witness with counsel with whom she conferred privately before making her decision whether to testify.  The provision of counsel helped assure that Caceres's decision was made voluntarily, in her own interest, rather than being the product of judicial coercion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The court took pains here to emphasize that Caceres could testify if she wished.  The Webb judge's sparse comments along similar lines were weakly stated and were overshadowed by the court's threats to proceed against the witness for perjury if he took the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also relies upon the Sixth Circuit's Arthur decision.  Unlike Webb, Arthur involved a judicial warning to a witness about Fifth Amendment rights.  The witness, however, had his own attorney and stated to the district court, after being advised of his rights, that he wanted to testify in order to clear the defendant.  Arthur, 949 F.2d at 214-15.   Instead of acquiescing, the court continued to warn the witness of the adverse consequences of testifying, finally saying, \"I think it's not in your best interest to testify because anything you say may be held against you in another prosecution against you for bank robbery, could and would be used against you.\"  Id. After that, the witness changed his mind about testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Circuit, citing Webb, held that it was an abuse of discretion for a judge to repeatedly inform the counseled witness, after the witness had stated that he wanted to testify following an initial warning, of his right to remain silent and that to testify was against his interest.  Id. at 216.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, there was no repetition of warnings after an informed announcement of an intent to testify, nor did the court keep insisting on a decision not to testify, as was done in Arthur.   To the contrary, the district judge made the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But I--let me put on the record again it is your own decision.  I'm not coercing you into not testifying.  I'm telling you may testify if you wish.  If you wish to testify that's fine.  You just go ahead and testify.  I'm simply telling you the consequences that might ensure, and I underline the word 'might,' not that they 'shall.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Caceres was not \"badgered\" by the court into declining to testify.  Rather, the district judge's warnings were meant to strengthen rather than to weaken the voluntariness of Caceres's choice by informing her of the risks inherent in her proposed testimony and of her constitutional right not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In doing this, the judge might understandably be concerned lest the uncounseled Caceres be manipulated unfairly by defendant, to her own great disadvantage.  Providing Caceres with access to a public defender before she took the stand further assured that her decision whether or not to testify would be an informed and voluntary one.  A judge is entitled to make sure a witness understands her Fifth Amendment rights.  While different trial judges might handle the matter differently, we see no impropriety in the court's conduct, and no duress precluding a free and voluntary choice.  To the contrary, the court sought to facilitate the ability of the witness to make an informed choice free from coercion by the defendant or anyone else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude there was no error in the character of the warnings given to Caceres by the district court in this case.  While the judge's language was forceful, he made it clear that she was free to testify and we may presume that her provided counsel confirmed that right.  We conclude that Santiago's due process right to present witnesses in his own defense was not compromised by Caceres's voluntary decision not to take the stand, and that the court's handling of the matter was within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3161(h)(8)(A) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n        <p>(h) The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time ... within which the trial ... must commence:</p>\n        <p>(8)(A) Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or his counsel or at the request of the attorney for the Government, if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A) (1985).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Many of the records relating to the transfer proceedings do not appear in the record before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Section 3161(h)(7) states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n        <p>(h) The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time ... within which the trial ... must commence:</p>\n        <p>(7) A reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(7) (1985).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Santiago points out that the district court also excluded the period of time starting on October 18, 1995, the filing date of the superseding indictment, and ending on December 12, 1995, because of \"ongoing plea negotiations.\"   According to Santiago, this exclusion of time is contrary to both the relevant facts and the applicable law.

As a reason for the continuance, Santiago's counsel stated that he (counsel) would be on trial at the time in another case.  The district court granted the continuance on December 1, 1994, finding that Santiago's interest in being represented by competent counsel outweighed his interests in a speedy trial and ordering counsel for Santiago to notify the court when the other trial had ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 1995, Santiago's counsel notified the district court that his other trial was over, allowing the setting of a new trial date.

If the transfers were allowed, the government proposed to try them along with Santiago.  Without objection, the district court allowed the continuance on March 13, 1995.  The court found the ends of justice were served by continuing the trial, and that the ability to try together all persons implicated in this case outweighed the interests in a speedy trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1995, the district court ordered that both Esquilin and Ramos be transferred to adult status.

On the fifth day of trial, the defense called Wanda Caceres (\"Caceres\"), Santiago's stepmother, to the witness stand.  Before she could testify, the court required the defense to make a proffer of her expected testimony.  Counsel represented that Caceres would testify about her post-offense conversations with the defendants and about her efforts to purchase airline tickets for them to travel to the mainland.  After the proffer, the district court warned Caceres about her right to refuse to testify, because of the possibility that she might incriminate herself.

We conclude that fewer than seventy non-excludable days went by before Santiago was brought to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>a) November 4, 1994 to March 1, 1995 (Santiago's motion for</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>a continuance of trial)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original indictment was returned on November 2, 1994.  Santiago first appeared before a judicial officer of the district court on November 4, 1994.  STA calculation begins with the latter of these two dates.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">November 4, 1994 is itself excludable because Santiago appeared before the district court on that day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985) (\"proceedings concerning the defendant\").  That day is also excludable for another reason, to wit, the government's motion to detain Santiago without bail pending the detention hearing, which the court granted that same day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  Section 3161(h)(1)(F) excludes any \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\"  Id. November 9, 1994 is excludable because of Santiago's arraignment and detention hearing on that day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago contends that the period from November 10, 1994 up to and including November 21, 1994 is non-excludable.  The government agrees.  We therefore find a total of sixteen non-excludable days up to this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1994, Santiago filed a motion notifying the district court of his counsel's unavailability on January 12, 1995, the scheduled trial date, because of another trial.  Santiago requested an indefinite continuance of the trial as set for January 12, 1995.  The court granted this motion ten days later, on December 1, 1994, ordering counsel to notify the court when the other trial was over.  The parties agree that the ten days the court took to decide the motion were excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  They likewise agree that December 2, 1994 was excludable, a pretrial conference being held on that day.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago asserts that the six days from December 3, 1994 to December 8, 1994 are non-excludable.  The government contends that the indefinite continuance of the trial, granted at defendant's request on December 1, 1994, makes these days excludable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STA excludes any period of delay resulting from the court's granting of a continuance if the continuance was granted on the basis of findings that the ends of justice served outweigh the speedy trial interest.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A) (1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  An ends of justice continuance was granted here.  Santiago contends, however, that the excludable time attributable to the continuance must be limited to the period of time between January 12, 1995, the original trial date, and February 2, 1995, the date defense counsel notified the court of his availability for trial.  The government maintains that the entire three month period of time starting on December 1, 1994, the date the court continued the original trial date, and ending on March 1, 1995, the day the court set a new trial date, is excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government.  The \"period of delay\" resulting from the continuance began on December 1, 1994, when the January 12, 1995, trial date was canceled and the trial put on hold until further order.  The period of delay remained in effect from then through March 1, 1995, when, after having been earlier advised of counsel's availability, the court set a new trial date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no way to regard the period from the court's December 1 ruling to the original January 12 trial date as if no continuance were then in effect.  The continuance ruled out all possibility of a trial while it lasted, relieving the parties of the need to prepare for trial on January 12, as previously scheduled, or at any time from December 1 until a new trial date was set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contending that a continuance of trial ends when the reason for it ends, Santiago argues that the twenty-seven day period beginning on February 2, 1995 and ending on March 1, 1995, during which the court was aware of defense counsel's availability but had not yet set a new trial date, cannot be excludable.  To exclude that period, Santiago asserts, citing to United States v. Rush, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438673\"><a href=\"/opinion/438673/united-states-v-donald-nixon-rush-larry-joseph-lancelotti-gregory-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 505-06 (1st Cir.1984), would give rise to an automatic additional period of exclusion after every \"ends of justice\" continuance between the notice that the event triggering the continuance of trial has ended and the court's order setting a new trial date.  Santiago argues that his counsel's February 2, 1995 notice of availability left nothing for the district court to do but set a new trial date, a routine act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not accept Santiago's argument.  The \"period of delay\" caused by the ends of justice continuance included the time, following counsel's notice of readiness, that the judge reasonably required to schedule a new trial date.  The mere announcement of counsel's availability did not automatically terminate the continuance of the trial.  Setting a new date required consideration of the court's calendar;  an available window had to be found.  The court may not have been able to determine as soon as counsel's availability was known when its other obligations would allow the scheduling of a trial.  The court took less than a month to schedule a new trial date, which was not an unreasonable delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that the twenty-seven days that elapsed before a new trial date was set can be viewed as separately excludable under the provisions of &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), which excludes the time pending disposition of a motion.  By notifying the court of his availability for trial, defense counsel may be said to have impliedly moved for a new trial date.  The court acted on the implied motion on March 1, 1995 by setting a new trial date of March 13, 1995.  Motions that do not require a hearing may toll the seventy-day time limit for up to thirty days.  See Henderson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 329, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As already noted, the twenty-seven days taken by the court to determine a new date was reasonable enough.  We conclude that the entire period from December 1, 1994 through March 1, 1995 was excludable for purposes of the STA, leaving us still with a total of sixteen non-excludable days at this point in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>b) March 2, 1995 to October 18, 1995 (The government's</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>motion for a continuance of trial)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new March 13 trial date did not stand for long.  On March 10, 1995, the government moved to continue Santiago's trial in order to allow it to obtain permission to try the two juveniles, Ramos and Esquilin, as adults, in which event they would be eligible to be tried jointly with Santiago.  Finding that the \"ends of justice\" would be served by continuing the trial pending resolution of Ramos's and Esquilin's adult status, the district court allowed the government's motion on March 13, 1995.  The parties agree that the period of time from March 2, 1995, the day after the district court set the March 13 trial date, until March 9, 1995, the day before the government filed its motion to continue the new trial date, was non-excludable.  They also agree that the days between March 10, 1995, the day the government filed its motion to continue the trial, and March 13, 1995, the day the district court granted the government's motion to continue the trial, were excludable.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  The addition of the eight non-excludable days yields a new total of twenty-four non-excludable days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>c) March 14, 1995 to October 18, 1995</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree sharply over exclusion of the 219-day period beginning on March 14, 1995, the day after the district court granted the government's motion to continue the trial, until October 18, 1995, the day a superseding indictment against all three defendants was returned.  The March 13 continuance was open-ended, although as Santiago acknowledges, that, in and of itself, did not make it invalid.  Open-ended continuances are not prohibited per se.  See United States v. Spring, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715844\"><a href=\"/opinion/715844/united-states-v-bruce-derek-spring-aka-bruce-derek-walls/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span>, 1457-58 (10th Cir.1996);  United States v.

But see United States v.

This court has said, \"it is generally preferable to limit a continuance to a definite period for the sake of clarity and certainty;  but at the same time it is inevitable that in some cases ... a court is forced to order an (h)(8) continuance without knowing exactly how long the reasons supporting the continuance will remain valid.\"  Rush, 738 F.2d at 508.   An open-ended continuance may, therefore, bring to bear a factor of \"reasonableness.\"   See Lattany, 982 F.2d at 868 (\"[O]pen-ended continuances to serve the ends of justice are not prohibited if they are reasonable in length.\");  Rush, 738 F.2d at 508 (\"It may well be that some sort of reasonableness limitation is appropriate to prevent continuances from delaying trials unfairly and circumventing the dismissal sanctions in the Speedy Trial Act....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances, including the previous delays, the 219 day delay was clearly unreasonable.  Much of that delay, he contends, was attributable to government foot-dragging and, therefore, lacked an element of defendant's involvement that has led us to exclude open-ended continuances in the past.  See Lattany, 982 F.2d at 883 (holding that the length of a continuance was not unreasonable because of defendant's part in extending the delay).  Santiago maintains that the docket entries for the transfer proceedings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> are suggestive of governmental bad faith and needless delay.  He points to the postponement of a March 21, 1995 evidentiary hearing for Ramos after the government said that it had not received notice of it.  Santiago contends that this delay, in addition to other questionable delays, indicate that the government was not acting expeditiously in spite of knowing that he was still awaiting trial.  And, finally, Santiago says he was misled into believing that the transfer proceedings would end momentarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find little support for Santiago's charge that the transfer proceedings were protracted by governmental indifference and impropriety.  Their duration does not seem extreme in the circumstances, and the continuance of Santiago's trial until it could be determined whether to try the minor codefendants with Santiago was reasonable, especially where Santiago raised no objection at the time.  Cf. Parker v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"282794\"><a href=\"/opinion/282794/william-k-parker-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1193</span></a></span>, 1196 (9th Cir.1968) (noting the substantial public interest in joint trials).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two juveniles' natural resistance to being tried as adults affords an obvious explanation for the time consumed by the transfer proceedings.  The seriousness of the charges provided good reason for them to do everything possible to retain their juvenile status.  That the adult classification issue was not simple is suggested by the fact that, although the district judge ultimately transferred both minors to adult status, the magistrate judge presiding over the transfer proceedings recommended the transfer of only one of them.  The limited record that we have reflects delays arising from, among other things, difficulties in arranging for psychological evaluations of the two juveniles.  At no time within this period did Santiago seek either to terminate the continuance of his trial or to expedite the transfer proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the continuance for the transfer proceedings was not unreasonable or excessively long.  Accordingly, we exclude the period between March 14 and October 18, 1995, pursuant to &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A).  This exclusion keeps the STA count at twenty-four non-excludable days at this point in the calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>d) October 19, 1995 to January 23, 1996 (Esquilin's motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>for a change of plea)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The October 18, 1995 superseding indictment, which included Ramos and Esquilin as defendants along with Santiago, did not restart Santiago's STA's clock because it was based on the original charges.

October 25, 1995 was excludable because it was the day that Santiago was arraigned under the superseding indictment.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1) (1985).  Adding these twenty-five non-excludable days gives a new total of forty-nine non-excludable days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the superseding indictment pertained to all three, any defendant's motion resulting in excludable time tolled the STA clock for his codefendants.  See United States v.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that, with the exception of November 27, 1995, the period of time from November 17, 1995, the day after the court acted on the two motions, until December 3, 1995, the day before Ramos's change of plea hearing, is non-excludable.  He concedes that November 27, 1995 is excludable because of the arraignment and detention hearings of Esquilin and Ramos on that date.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7) (1985).  The government, however, would exclude the entire period from November 17 through December 4, arguing that Ramos's change of plea motion was continuously under advisement until allowed at a hearing on December 4, 1995.  We agree with the government, as discussed below, and exclude that period of time from the STA's seventy-day time limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also disputes any exclusion of the period of time from December 5, 1995, the day after Ramos's change of plea hearing, through January 17, 1996, the day before the filing of Santiago's motion to dismiss the superseding indictment.  Santiago contends that Esquilin's motion for change of plea, filed on December 1, 1995, was not excludable until at least December 26, 1995, when the court set January 19, 1996 as the date for Esquilin's change of plea hearing.  This is so, he says, because Esquilin's motion required \"no disposition\" until December 26, (apparently because it was not yet scheduled for hearing), and because a contrary ruling would allow district judges to toll the STA clock by intentionally delaying their orders scheduling change of plea hearings.  The short answer to this argument is that the exclusion provided by &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) applies without qualification \"from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on ... such motion,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985);  see United States v.

As in the case of Ramos's similar motion, Santiago would have us deny excludability on the ground that Jenkins does not stand for the proposition that the entire period from the filing of a motion for a change of plea until the change of plea hearing is excludable.  The holding in Jenkins, according to Santiago, dealt with a motion that did not require a hearing, to wit, a motion to use a jury questionnaire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Santiago contends that the hearing referred to in both &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) and the Jenkins case is one that is necessary to decide the merits of the motion, and that such was not the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that all of the days between the date a codefendant files a motion for a change of plea and the date of the change of plea hearing itself are excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), (h)(7) (1985);  accord Jenkins, 92 F.3d at 440;  see also Henderson, 476 U.S. at 326-27, 106 S.Ct. at 1874-75;  Sposito, 106 F.3d at 1044.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A change of plea hearing is essential to establish the knowing and voluntary nature of the defendant's guilty plea, and to determine the sufficiency of its factual basis.  Until these factors are established, the court may not rule definitively on whether or not to accept the motion for change of plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that the district court in Thurlow sets forth a better reasoned view than the one we take.  Citing to &#167; 3161(h)(8)(C), the Thurlow court ruled that a delay caused by the \"general congestion of the courts\" is not a sufficient basis for the exclusion of time from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  Thurlow, 710 F.Supp. at 383.   The court thus concluded that an exclusion of time under the STA could not be granted for the period of time starting with the defendant's notice and ending with the court's hearing, because the delay was due solely to the court's scheduling requirements.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remain unpersuaded.  A defendant's request to change his plea clearly constitutes a pretrial motion, a motion which automatically triggers an exclusion of time.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  The weight of authority is to this effect.  In Sposito, Jenkins, Henderson, and other cases, courts have agreed that the entire time between the filing of a pretrial motion and the hearing on that motion is excludable from the STA's seventy-day time limit.  See, e.g., Henderson, 476 U.S. at 326-27, 106 S.Ct. at 1874-75;  Sposito, 106 F.3d at 1044;  Jenkins, 92 F.3d at 440.   Hence, the days between December 1, 1995, the date Esquilin filed his motion for change of plea, and January 22, 1996, the date of Esquilin's actual change of plea hearing, are all excludable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 18, 1996, Santiago filed his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment for lack of a speedy trial.  The district court denied the motion on January 23, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Both parties agree that these six days are excludable.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) (1985).  January 23, 1996 was the first day of jury trial, bringing the STA clock to a stop in the instant case.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1) (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that only forty-nine non-excludable days ran off the STA clock before the commencement of trial and that, therefore, no violation of Santiago's statutory right to a speedy trial occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

See, e.g., Mala, 7 F.3d at 1061.   A court should consider:  (1) the length of the delay;  (2) the reason(s) for the delay;  (3) the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right;  and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay.  See, e.g., id.

We shall assume, under the foregoing, that the fifteen month delay in this case was \"presumptively prejudicial\" so as to trigger further inquiry as to Santiago, see, e.g., Koller, 956 F.2d at 1414 (holding that an eight and one-half month delay was enough to warrant further inquiry);  Colombo, 852 F.2d at 24 (holding that a twenty-four month period was long enough to be presumptively prejudicial);  King, 909 F.Supp. at 372 (holding that a thirty-one month delay was sufficient to trigger the Barker test).  Still, we hold that the cumulative effect of the pretrial delay, viewed under all the factors set forth in Barker, falls far short of establishing a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the length of the delay is both the trigger for the Barker analysis and one of the factors in that analysis.  See Colombo, 852 F.2d at 24.   Once an examination of the Sixth Amendment claim is triggered, the weight given in the analysis to the length of the delay depends upon the extent to which the delay exceeds the bare minimum considered presumptively prejudicial.  See Doggett, 505 U.S. at 652, 112 S.Ct. at 2690-91;  King, 909 F.Supp. at 373.   Santiago waited over fifteen months for the commencement of trial in this case, a case more complicated than \"an ordinary street crime\" but less so than \"a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.   Arguably, therefore, the period of the delay was long enough to tip the scales slightly in favor of Santiago's instant claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor, the reason(s) for the delay, has been called, \"the focal inquiry.\"  United States v.

As with the first factor, \"[h]ere, too, different weights should be assigned to different reasons.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.   Santiago argues that the chief contributor to the delay was the government's lack of diligence in advancing the transfer proceedings, and that the government used this period of time to further its case by debriefing minors Esquilin and Ramos, both of whom were eventually called to provide testimony against him.  We find in the record below, however, scant indication that the length of the transfer proceedings was attributable to the government's misconduct or negligence.  See Henson, 945 F.2d at 437 n. 7;  Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25.   The rest of the delay in trying Santiago resulted mainly from his own motion for a continuance of the trial and his codefendants' motions for changes of pleas.  Santiago never sought relief from delays occasioned by his codefendants by requesting a severance.  We conclude that the various delays were each justified by \"a valid reason.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor, the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right, \"is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531-32, 92 S.Ct. at 2192-93;  see also Colombo, 852 F.2d at 26.   The failure to assert the right, the Barker Court noted, \"will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193;  see also Colombo 852 F.2d at 26.

Hence in respect to the third factor, Santiago's failure to request a speedy trial earlier than he did weighs against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth, and final, factor--the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay--\"should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect.  Th[e] Court has identified three such interests:  (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration;  (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused;  and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193 (footnote omitted);  see also Koller, 956 F.2d at 1414.   The Barker Court went on to discuss the disadvantages of lengthy pretrial incarceration for the accused who cannot obtain his release.  See Barker, 407 U.S. at 532-33, 92 S.Ct. at 2193-94.   We shall assume that many of those disadvantages were experienced by Santiago, who was subjected to over fifteen months of pretrial imprisonment without bail.  However, the fifteen months of pretrial incarceration by itself was insufficient to establish a constitutional level of prejudice.  Cf. Barker, 407 U.S. at 534, 92 S.Ct. at 2194 (finding that the prejudice was minimal in a case in which the defendant spent ten months in jail before trial);  Koller, 956 F.2d at 1414 (\"Koller did spend the entire eight and one-half months of delay in jail, but in Barker the Court found that ten months of incarceration prior to trial was not sufficient to raise to the level of prejudice.\"  (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect to Santiago's anxiety and concern in awaiting trial, we do not weigh this heavily, especially where Santiago took no early action to expedite his trial, either by demanding an earlier trial or by seeking a severance from the minor codefendants.  \"While 'this type of prejudice is not to be brushed off lightly,' considerable anxiety normally attends the initiation and pendency of criminal charges;  hence only 'undue pressures' are considered.\"  Henson, 945 F.2d at 438 (citing Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25 (stressing that \"the standard here is minimization, not necessarily elimination of the natural consequences of an indictment\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Among the three interests safeguarded by the right to speedy trial as guaranteed under the [S]ixth [A]mendment, 'the most serious is [protection against impairment of the defense] because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.' \"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193 (citations omitted).  There is no indication here that the period of pretrial delay interfered in any way with Santiago's ability to present evidence or obtain the testimony of witnesses, or that it had any impact on the fairness of his trial.  See Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25-26.

It seems to me that it is my duty as a judicial officer to advise you, to warn you, that if you testify pursuant to what Mr. Arroyo said--and that's your decision--you will be incriminating yourself under oath in a record, and you may be exposed to 15 years in prison up to the maximum and also three years but [sic] misprision of a felony which might be served concurrently.  But with your testimony on the record, that will be enough to take it to a grand jury to obtain an indictment against you, and you will be a defendant in this court.  And under the sentencing guidelines you will most probably have to do time, serve time in jail.  And there is no parole, no probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I want to warn you again for the last time so that if you do this you will do this knowingly and willfully and after having been advised about your--your right not to be incriminated [sic] against yourself, but of course that is your decision.  My duty is to advise you, to forewarn you about it.  If you want to talk to your lawyer, I will give you an opportunity to talk to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But--let me put on the record again it is your own decision.  I'm not coercing you into not testifying.  I'm telling you may [sic] testify if you wish.  If you wish to testify that's fine.  You just go ahead and testify.  I'm simply telling you the consequences that might ensue, and I underline the word \"might,\" not that they \"shall.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After giving this warning, the court appointed an assistant federal public defender to advise Caceres regarding her right not to incriminate herself.  Caceres consulted with this lawyer and then decided not to testify for Santiago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago insists that, although the court had wide discretion to warn a witness of the constitutional right not to testify, it went too far in this instance.  See United States v. Arthur, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572201\"><a href=\"/opinion/572201/united-states-v-danny-wade-arthur-90-6080-and-terry-keith-arthur/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 215-16 (6th Cir.1991).  (\"An abuse of that discretion can occur, however, when the district court actively encourages a witness not to testify or badgers a witness into remaining silent.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago argues that Caceres's testimony would have supported the defense theory that he was not a knowing and willing participant in the criminal venture, but rather was \"merely present\" at the scene of the crime.  The witness, according to Santiago, was privy to post-offense conversations between the codefendants, and was entrusted with the purchase of airline tickets for them to leave the island.  Caceres's testimony, Santiago says, would have shown that both Esquilin and Ramos had admitted that they had participated in the offense, and had indicated that Santiago was not a participant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Webb v. Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108634\"><a href=\"/opinion/108634/webb-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108634\"><a href=\"/opinion/108634/webb-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 353-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108634\"><a href=\"/opinion/108634/webb-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span> (1972) (per curiam), the Supreme Court said, respecting a judge's warning to a witness not to perjure himself, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>in light of the great disparity between the posture of the presiding judge and that of a witness in these circumstances, the unnecessarily strong terms used by the judge could well have exerted such duress on the witness' mind as to preclude him from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago likens the judge's comments here to those in Webb, pointing to the fact that Caceres had come to court to testify on the defendant's behalf, and declined to do so only after the judge's lengthy and allegedly intimidating warning.  The district court, Santiago concludes, should have put the more immediate interests of the defendant on trial and those of the general public in the fullest disclosure of the relevant evidence before the protection of the volunteering witness in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the court's admonition to the witness here was relatively detailed and strongly stated.  However, the court was careful to emphasize that the witness could testify if she wished, and we do not believe that what was said came even close to exerting \"such duress on the witness's mind as to preclude [her] from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Webb, the trial judge apparently suspected that a prison inmate called as defendant's sole witness was bent on perjury.  The judge admonished him that if he lied, the court would \"personally see that your case goes to the grand jury and you will be indicted for perjury and the likelihood [sic] is that you would get convicted of perjury and that it would be stacked on to what you already got.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Id. at 95-96, 93 S.Ct. at 352-53.   No such threat, or threat of any type, was made here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather the court sought to advise this uncounseled witness of her constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination, having learned from defense counsel that she proposed to give testimony of an obviously incriminating nature.  A further difference between this case and Webb is that, here, the court ultimately provided the witness with counsel with whom she conferred privately before making her decision whether to testify.  The provision of counsel helped assure that Caceres's decision was made voluntarily, in her own interest, rather than being the product of judicial coercion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The court took pains here to emphasize that Caceres could testify if she wished.  The Webb judge's sparse comments along similar lines were weakly stated and were overshadowed by the court's threats to proceed against the witness for perjury if he took the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago also relies upon the Sixth Circuit's Arthur decision.  Unlike Webb, Arthur involved a judicial warning to a witness about Fifth Amendment rights.  The witness, however, had his own attorney and stated to the district court, after being advised of his rights, that he wanted to testify in order to clear the defendant.  Arthur, 949 F.2d at 214-15.   Instead of acquiescing, the court continued to warn the witness of the adverse consequences of testifying, finally saying, \"I think it's not in your best interest to testify because anything you say may be held against you in another prosecution against you for bank robbery, could and would be used against you.\"  Id. After that, the witness changed his mind about testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Circuit, citing Webb, held that it was an abuse of discretion for a judge to repeatedly inform the counseled witness, after the witness had stated that he wanted to testify following an initial warning, of his right to remain silent and that to testify was against his interest.  Id. at 216.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, there was no repetition of warnings after an informed announcement of an intent to testify, nor did the court keep insisting on a decision not to testify, as was done in Arthur.   To the contrary, the district judge made the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But I--let me put on the record again it is your own decision.  I'm not coercing you into not testifying.  I'm telling you may testify if you wish.  If you wish to testify that's fine.  You just go ahead and testify.  I'm simply telling you the consequences that might ensure, and I underline the word 'might,' not that they 'shall.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Caceres was not \"badgered\" by the court into declining to testify.  Rather, the district judge's warnings were meant to strengthen rather than to weaken the voluntariness of Caceres's choice by informing her of the risks inherent in her proposed testimony and of her constitutional right not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In doing this, the judge might understandably be concerned lest the uncounseled Caceres be manipulated unfairly by defendant, to her own great disadvantage.  Providing Caceres with access to a public defender before she took the stand further assured that her decision whether or not to testify would be an informed and voluntary one.  A judge is entitled to make sure a witness understands her Fifth Amendment rights.  While different trial judges might handle the matter differently, we see no impropriety in the court's conduct, and no duress precluding a free and voluntary choice.  To the contrary, the court sought to facilitate the ability of the witness to make an informed choice free from coercion by the defendant or anyone else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude there was no error in the character of the warnings given to Caceres by the district court in this case.  While the judge's language was forceful, he made it clear that she was free to testify and we may presume that her provided counsel confirmed that right.  We conclude that Santiago's due process right to present witnesses in his own defense was not compromised by Caceres's voluntary decision not to take the stand, and that the court's handling of the matter was within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3161(h)(8)(A) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n        <p>(h) The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time ... within which the trial ... must commence:</p>\n        <p>(8)(A) Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or his counsel or at the request of the attorney for the Government, if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A) (1985).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Many of the records relating to the transfer proceedings do not appear in the record before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Section 3161(h)(7) states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n        <p>(h) The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time ... within which the trial ... must commence:</p>\n        <p>(7) A reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(7) (1985).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Santiago points out that the district court also excluded the period of time starting on October 18, 1995, the filing date of the superseding indictment, and ending on December 12, 1995, because of \"ongoing plea negotiations.\"   According to Santiago, this exclusion of time is contrary to both the relevant facts and the applicable law.

Still, he dismissed it as being \"bad law\" and as not having in consideration the rationale of cases like United States v. Thurlow, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We accept Santiago's argument that untimeliness would not, on this record, constitute a valid independent ground for denying the motion to dismiss</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The trial judge admonished the defense witness as follows:</p>\n        <p>Now you have been called down as a witness in this case by the Defendant.  It is the Court's duty to admonish you that you don't have to testify, that anything you say can and will be used against you.  If you take the witness stand and lie under oath, the Court will personally see that your case goes to the grand jury and you will be indicted for perjury and the likelihood [sic] is that you would get convicted of perjury and that it would be stacked onto what you have already got, so that is the matter you have got to make up your mind on.  If you get on the witness stand and lied, it is probably going to mean several years and at least more time that you are going to have to serve.  It will also be held against you in the penitentiary when you're up for parole and the Court wants you to thoroughly understand the chances you're taking by getting on that witness stand under oath.  You may tell the truth and if you do, that is all right, but if you lie you can get into real trouble.  The court wants you to know that.  You don't owe anybody anything to testify and it must be done freely and voluntarily and with the thorough understanding that you know the hazard you are taking.</p>\n        <p>Webb, 409 U.S. at 95-96, 93 S.Ct. at 352-53 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> After Caceres received advise from Assistant Federal Public Defender Carlos Vazquez, the following exchange took place:</p>\n        <p>\"MR.
