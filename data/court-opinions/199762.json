Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Alejandro Vega on brief pro se.\n     James B. Farmer, United States Attorney, and Dina Michael\nChaitowitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        January 3, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. Petitioner Alejandro Vega appeals from\n\na district court judgment dismissing his 28 U.S.C. § 2255\n\npetition as a \"second or successive\" one under AEDPA.               See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255 (¶ 8) (requiring that second or successive\n\npetition by certified by appellate court as satisfying one\n\nof two gatekeeping criteria).         According to petitioner, his\n\n\"first\" petition was in fact a motion for reduction of\n\nsentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) which the district court,\n\nacting without his consent, had recharacterized as a § 2255\n\npetition.    If so, that filing would likely \"not count as a\n\n'first'   habeas       petition   sufficient   to     trigger   AEDPA's\n\ngatekeeping requirements.\"          Raineri v. United States, 233\n\nF.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            As   the     district    court   found,    however,   this\n\nassertion is factually mistaken.          The record reveals that a\n\n§ 3582(c) motion was filed on May 16, 1997 and was denied in\n\na margin order dated June 3, 1997.           Petitioner then filed a\n\nseparate pleading on November 24, 1997 which was formally\n\nstyled as a § 2255 petition and was treated as such.                The\n\ncourt disposed of that matter in an order dated February 17,\n\n1998.     The existence of this earlier § 2255 proceeding\n\nrenders the instant petition second or successive.\n\n         The judgment is affirmed. Alternatively, to the\nextent the notice of appeal can be construed as a request\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffor leave to file a second or successive petition, that\nrequest is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated\nin the first paragraph of this court's November 20, 2000\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                           -3-\n\f",
