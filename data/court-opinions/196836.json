Cali now  appeals the  fifteen-month\r\n\nsentence  of imprisonment  he received,  contending that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  enhanced the  prison  term  mandated by  the\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") because of the erroneous\r\n\nview  that U.S.S.G.     3B1.1 permits  a  base offense  level\r\n\nadjustment  for mere management of assets or property.   Cali\r\n\nalso  maintains that the district court's alternative holding\r\n\nthat  upward departure  was appropriate  because  his conduct\r\n\nfell outside section 3B1.1's heartland was clearly erroneous.\r\n\nWe agree that mere management of assets is insufficient for a\r\n\nbase offense  level adjustment under section  3B1.1, but find\r\n\nthat the district court's alternative determination cures any\r\n\ndefect in its holding.  Accordingly, we affirm.

Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 20  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1996); United States  v. Grandmaison, 77  F.3d 555, 557  (1st\r                                                \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nCir.  1996).  On October  15, 1993, Philip  Cali was arrested\r\n\npursuant   to  count  sixty-nine   of  a   seventy-one  count\r\n\nindictment charging him with conducting, financing, managing,\r\n\nsupervising, directing, and owning all or part of an  illegal\r\n\ngambling business which involved five or more persons between\r\n\nOctober 1986 and December 1992.  The  result of an eight year\r\n\nMassachusetts  State  Police  (\"State Police\")  investigation\r\n\ninto  large-scale  racketeering conspiracies,  the indictment\r\n\nnamed  nine  individuals,  four  of whom  --  Joseph  Yerardi\r\n\n(\"Yerardi\"), William Maguire (\"Maguire\"), Anthony Grabiec Jr.\r\n\n(\"Grabiec\"), and Salvatore M. DeAngelis (\"DeAngelis\") -- were\r\n\ncharged in count sixty-nine  with Cali.  Cali, who  is sixty-\r\n\nfive and  has a  criminal history which  includes convictions\r\n\nfor gambling-related  activities, was  not charged in  any of\r\n\nthe indictment's other counts.\r\n\n          During   the   course    of   their    racketeering\r\n\ninvestigation, the  State  Police obtained  authorization  to\r\n\nintercept  phone  conversations  over  a  cellular  telephone\r\n\nutilized  by  Yerardi  from  June  to  August  1991.    Their\r\n\nsurveillance of the telephone  revealed that Yerardi presided\r\n\nover  extensive loansharking  and gambling  businesses.   The\r\n\ngambling  business,  which  operated  under the  auspices  of\r\n\nBoston's Winter  Hill Gang and generated  funds for Yerardi's\r\n\nloansharking business, included  over twenty-five  bookmaking\r\n\nagents, two principal  offices, and had a gross daily revenue\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nof $2,000.00.  Though Yerardi headed the gambling enterprise,\r\n\nMaguire  was  its  principal  supervisor  and the  individual\r\n\nresponsible for collecting money owed to the organization and\r\n\npaying out money owed to agents and bettors.\r\n\n          Transcripts  of numerous calls  between Yerardi and\r\n\nCali  intercepted by the State Police  revealed that Cali and\r\n\nDeAngelis played  the same  role in the  gambling enterprise,\r\n\nthough  they  operated out  of  different  locations. Yerardi\r\n\nstationed Cali, who frequently  placed bets with the business\r\n\nand  was often one of  its debtors, at  one of the business's\r\n\nprincipal  bookmaking  offices  to  receive  calls  from  the\r\n\nvarious  agents.   The agents,  who identified  themselves by\r\n\ncode only and received a percentage of the business's profits\r\n\nas  compensation,  communicated  information  about  sporting\r\n\nevent  bets  to  Cali.    After  taking  and  recording  that\r\n\ninformation,  Cali transmitted it  directly to  Yerardi, with\r\n\nwhom he was in daily telephone contact.   The majority of the\r\n\ncalls intercepted by the State Police were made by Yerardi to\r\n\nCali at the bookmaking office.\r\n\n          Cali  often  reviewed  betting  results   with  and\r\n\nreported agents' makeup figures --  those monies that have to\r\n\nbe worked off before any money can be paid out  -- to Yerardi\r\n\nduring these  telephone conversations.   He also  assisted in\r\n\ncharting bets  for the gambling business.   Charting involves\r\n\ntracking  daily  bets  made  by  agents  and  monitoring  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nbusiness's   projected  risk of  loss on  individual sporting\r\n\nevents.   Though Cali  answered directly to  Yerardi and  was\r\n\nresponsible  for completing  charting  analyses, there  is no\r\n\nevidence  that he  received  a percentage  of the  business's\r\n\nprofit or played any role in setting policy regarding odds or\r\n\nbet placement.\r\n\n          On June 1, 1995,  Cali pled guilty to participating\r\n\nin  the  operation  of  an illegal  gambling  business.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  scheduled  a  sentencing  hearing and  prior\r\n\nthereto received a  PSI from the  Probation Department.   The\r\n\nPSI prepared by  the Probation Department, to which  both the\r\n\ngovernment  and  Cali  registered objections,  recommended  a\r\n\ntotal  adjusted  guideline  offense   level  of  ten.    This\r\n\nrecommendation  reflects a  two  level decrease  in the  base\r\n\noffense for  acceptance of  responsibility.  See  U.S.S.G.   \r                                                            \r\n\n2E3.1(a); 3E1.1.  The PSI concluded, based on the information\r\n\nprovided by the government and the defendant's description of\r\n\nhis duties that an  adjustment for role in the  offense would\r\n\nnot be warranted.  \r\n\n          The  Probation  Department   assigned  Cali   three\r\n\ncriminal history  points for prior gambling  convictions and,\r\n\nas a result, placed him in Criminal History Category II.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court,  however,  later  found  that the  Probation\r\n\nDepartment  had erroneously  assigned  Cali criminal  history\r\n\npoints for  offenses committed while working  for Yerardi and\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nidentified the appropriate  criminal history  category as  I.\r\n\nPlacement in Criminal History Category I, at a total adjusted\r\n\noffense level of ten, results in a sentencing range of six to\r\n\ntwelve months.               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                    THE SENTENCING HEARING\r                                THE SENTENCING HEARING\r                                                      \r\n\n          At  the  sentencing  hearing,    Cali  requested  a\r\n\ndownward departure on the  grounds that both he and  his wife\r\n\nsuffered,  inter  alia,  from  serious heart  conditions  and\r                                  \r\n\nlargely  supported  themselves   on  Social  Security  income\r\n\nbenefits that would  be unavailable  to them  for any  period\r\n\nthat  Cali was  incarcerated.   The  government disputed  the\r\n\ncontention that Cali was entitled  to departure on this basis\r\n\nand objected  to the  two-point adjustment for  acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility  recommended  by  the   Probation  Department.\r\n\nAdditionally, the government objected to the PSI's failure to\r\n\nadd four levels under  section 3B1.1(a) for supervisory role,\r\n\narguing  that  an  enhancement  was  warranted  because  Cali\r\n\nmanaged  people and  assets within that  guideline's meaning.\r\n\nThe government also argued that the Criminal History Category\r\n\nI  assignment Cali  received did  not adequately  reflect the\r\n\nseriousness of his past criminal history.  \r\n\n          The   district  court  denied  the  objections  and\r\n\nrequests  made by both Cali  and the government.   It refused\r\n\nCali's  request for  a  health-related departure,  concluding\r\n\nthat the factors cited by the defense did not, \"separately or\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ntogether,  justify  departure.\"     It   also  rejected   the\r\n\ngovernment's  objection  to  the  two-point   adjustment  for\r\n\nacceptance   of  responsibility   recommended  by   the  PSI.\r\n\nFinally, the court found that the severity of Cali's criminal\r\n\nhistory  was  not  underrepresented by  the  amended criminal\r\n\nhistory calculation and denied the government's request for a\r\n\nfour-level adjustment under section 3B1.1(a).  \r\n\n          Nevertheless, the court  found that Cali's role  in\r\n\nYerardi's gambling  enterprise warranted some  enhancement in\r\n\nhis  sentence and  concluded, over  Cali's objection,  that a\r\n\nthree level  increase in  the offense level  was appropriate.\r\n\nIt found that section 3B1.1(b)  and Application Note 2's role\r\n\nin the  offense provisions  permitted  him to  make a  direct\r\n\nadjustment  to Cali's  base  offense level,  but added  that,\r\n\nshould  this  Court determine  that  section  3B1.1 does  not\r\n\npermit  such  an  adjustment,   it  would  employ  an  upward\r\n\ndeparture, under United States v.  Rivera, 994 F.2d 942  (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1993), to impose a sentence outside the range prescribed\r\n\nby the Guidelines to  reach the same final sentence.   Either\r\n\ncalculus  results  in  a  total  adjusted  offense  level  of\r\n\nthirteen, which  corresponds to a sentencing  range of twelve\r\n\nto eighteen months.\r\n\n          Accordingly, the court sentenced Cali to a fifteen-\r\n\nmonth  term  of  imprisonment  and two  years  of  supervised\r\n\nrelease.  It  assessed Cali $50.00,  as required by  statute,\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nand  imposed a fine of $3,000.00, without interest.  In light\r\n\nof   Cali's  medical   problems,  the   court  also   made  a\r\n\nrecommendation that Cali be placed in a facility, as close to\r\n\nMassachusetts as possible,  where adequate medical  treatment\r\n\nwould be available to him.            \r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \r\n\n          Appellate review of a district  court's application\r\n\nof  the Guidelines is a  two-part process.

In  support of  this,  he\r\n\nmaintains that the district  court erroneously concluded that\r\n\nsection 3B1.1(b) permits a  base offense level enhancement in\r\n\nthe absence  of a finding  that a defendant  organized, lead,\r\n\nmanaged, or supervised one or more participants in an illegal\r\n\nenterprise    involving    five    or   more    participants.\r\n\nAdditionally,  Cali  argues   that  the  court's  alternative\r\n\nholding -- that  an upward departure  was appropriate in  the\r\n\nevent  section  3B1.1  precluded adjustment  --  was  clearly\r\n\nerroneous  because  his  conduct falls  squarely  within  the\r\n\nheartland  of 18  U.S.C.     1955 offenses.      We begin  by\r\n\nreviewing the claim  that, absent a finding  that a defendant\r\n\nmanaged  individuals,   U.S.S.G.     3B1.1(b)   precludes  an\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nenhancement  in  the  base  offense  level  and  discuss  the\r\n\nrequirements for a   3B1.1 upward departure thereafter.\r\n\n     U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Adjustments\r                 U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Adjustments\r                                                                    \r\n\n          U.S.S.G.   3B1.1 punishes defendants in large-scale\r\n\ncriminal    enterprises    according   to    their   relative\r\n\nresponsibility,  meting  out  the most  severe  sentences  to\r\n\nindividuals  who hold  leadership  or  management  positions.\r\n\nTejada-Beltran,  50 F.3d at  111; United States  v.

The district court used this\r                    \r\n\nguideline  to  elevate Cali's  sentence  on  the theory  that\r\n\nsection 3B1.1(b) permits an enhancement in a defendant's base\r\n\noffense level for both  management of individuals and assets.\r\n\nCali assigns  error, contending  that an enhancement  in base\r\n\noffense  level  can  only be  based  on  a  finding that  the\r\n\ndefendant managed other individuals.  The government concedes\r\n\nthis  point,  but  maintains  that Cali's  argument  is  moot\r\n\nbecause the district court found that Cali's responsibilities\r\n\nin Yerardi's gambling business included managing individuals,\r\n\nas well as assets.\r\n\n          To make sense of these positions, we briefly review\r\n\nsection 3B1.1 and its history.  Section 3B1.1 provides:\r\n\n          Based  on  the  defendant's role  in  the\r\n          offense,  increase  the offense  level as\r\n          follows:\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          (a)  If the defendant was an organizer or\r\n          leader  of  a   criminal  activity   that\r\n          involved five or more participants or was\r\n          otherwise   extensive,   increase  by   4\r\n          levels.\r\n          (b)  If  the defendant  was a  manager or\r\n          supervisor  (but  not  an   organizer  or\r\n          leader)   and   the   criminal   activity\r\n          involved five or more participants or was\r\n          otherwise   extensive,   increase  by   3\r\n          levels.\r\n          (c)  If the defendant  was an  organizer,\r\n          leader,  manager,  or  supervisor in  any\r\n          criminal activity other than described in\r\n          (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.\r\n\nPrior to 1993, courts were split as to whether a finding that\r\n\na  criminal-enterprise  defendant managed  individuals  was a\r\n\nprerequisite  to   a  section   3B1.1   base  offense   level\r\n\nadjustment.   See United States  v. McFarlane, 64  F.3d 1235,\r                                                         \r\n\n1237 (8th Cir. 1995).   This Circuit took the view  that \"the\r\n\ndefendant  must have  exercised some  degree of  control over\r\n\nothers involved in  the commission of  the offense or  . .  .\r\n\nmust  have been  responsible  for organizing  others for  the\r\n\npurpose of carrying out the crime.\"  United States v.

Grady, 972 F.2d 889 (8th Cir. 1992).\r                    \r\n\n          On  November  1,  1993, the  Sentencing  Commission\r\n\n(\"Commission\")  weighed into this debate by issuing Amendment\r\n\n500, which amended section  3B1.1 to include Application Note\r\n\n2.  That application note provides:  \r\n\n          To qualify for  an adjustment under  this\r\n          section,  defendant  must  have been  the\r\n          organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\r\n          of one  or more  other participants.   An\r\n          upward   departure   may  be   warranted,\r\n          however, in  the case of a  defendant who\r\n          did  not  organize,   lead,  manage,   or\r\n          supervise  another  participant, but  who\r\n          nevertheless     exercised     management\r\n          responsibility over the property, assets,\r\n          or activities of a criminal organization.\r\n\nThus, Amendment 500 offered something to courts on both sides\r\n\nof the  section 3B1.1 debate.   It  made it clear,  in accord\r\n\nwith  the position we embraced  in Fuller, 897  F.2d at 1220,\r                                                     \r\n\nthat section  3B1.1  adjustments are  unavailable unless  the\r\n\nrecord  shows   that  the  defendant  managed   one  or  more\r\n\nindividuals, but  also states that a finding that a defendant\r\n\nmanaged assets instead  of individuals could  be a basis  for\r\n\nupward departure.  Ironically, this attempt to define section\r\n\n3B1.1's contours and operation created the dispute which lies\r\n\nat the heart of this appeal.  \r\n\n          Application  Note  2  explains  that  section 3B1.1\r\n\nadjustments   and   departures   require  different   factual\r\n\nfindings,  but does not clarify how, if at all, these devices\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndiffer in  terms of the sentencing  calculation they mandate.\r\n\nAt  the sentencing  hearing, Cali  argued that  section 3B1.1\r\n\nadjustments involve  enhancements in the  base offense level,\r\n\nwhereas  section 3B1.1 departures involve enhancements in the\r\n\ntotal adjusted offense level and must adhere to the framework\r\n\nfor  Guidelines departures  established  by  this Circuit  in\r\n\nRivera,  994 F.2d  at 942.   The  district court  agreed that\r                  \r\n\nsection  3B1.1   adjustments   effectuate  increases   in   a\r\n\ndefendant's base  offense level.  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCapers, 61 F.3d 1100, 1109 (4th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, No.\r                                                                    \r\n\n95-7022, 1995 WL 752222  (U.S. May 20, 1996); Fones,  51 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat  669-70;  McFarlane,  64 F.3d  at  1239-40.    It was  not\r                                  \r\n\npersuaded,  however, that  the Commission  intended to  limit\r\n\nsection  3B1.1 departures  to changes  in the  total adjusted\r\n\noffense level:\r\n\n          THE COURT:  My primary view of the matter\r\n          . . . is that the appropriate way to read\r\n          these  guidelines  is   that  that   word\r\n          \"departure\" in Application Note 2 was not\r\n          being  used in  the technical sense  of a\r\n          kind  of departure that  is controlled by\r\n          Rivera, by  the decision-making structure\r                            \r\n          controlled  by  Rivera.     Instead  it's\r                                            \r\n          talking about a calculation of  the total\r\n          offense level. \r\n\nThe court reasoned that had the Commission  intended the term\r\n\n\"departure\"  to  have the  same meaning  in  the role  in the\r\n\noffense context as  it does elsewhere  in the Guidelines,  it\r\n\nwould  have  discussed  role  in the  offense  departures  in\r\n\nChapter 5,  Part K,  of the  Guidelines, which  is explicitly\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ndevoted  to departures, and not  in Chapter 3,  Part B, which\r\n\nprimarily  deals with  base offense  level adjustments.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S.S.G. Chap. 3, Part B, Introductory Commentary (\"This part\r\n\nprovides adjustments to the offense level based upon the role\r\n\nthe  defendant  played in  committing  the  offense.\").   The\r\n\ndistrict  court,  therefore,  held that  both  section  3B1.1\r\n\nadjustments and departures affect base offense level. \r\n\n          This  was  error.    We  cannot  agree,  given  the\r\n\ncircumstances  surrounding  the Commission's  promulgation of\r\n\nApplication  Note 2, that the sentence-calculation difference\r\n\nbetween  section 3B1.1 adjustments  and departures \"is  . . .\r\n\ninconsequential.\"   See McFarlane, 64  F.3d at 1239.   Simply\r                                             \r\n\nbecause  role-in-the-offense  departures  are   discussed  in\r\n\nChapter  3, Part  B, instead  of Chapter  5, Part  K, is  not\r\n\npersuasive  evidence  of an  intent  to  treat section  3B1.1\r\n\nadjustments and departures the same for  sentence calculation\r\n\npurposes.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at  948 (\"Specific individual\r                                 \r\n\nguidelines may also encourage departures.\").  The language of\r\n\nApplication  Note 2 persuades us that the two devices are, in\r\n\nfact, different: section 3B1.1  adjustments are mandatory and\r\n\nsubject to  the tripartite  test set  out by  that guideline,\r\n\nwhereas  departures  made  pursuant  to  that  guideline  are\r\n\ndiscretionary.   As  the Eighth  Circuit explained  in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. McFarlane, 64 F.3d 1235, 1239 (8th Cir. 1995):\r                               \r\n\n          If  the sentencing court concludes that a\r\n          defendant has managed  or supervised  one\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          or  more  participants   in  a   criminal\r\n          enterprise involving five  or more  total\r\n          participants, an adjustment is mandated -\r\n          -  the court must enhance the defendant's\r\n          sentence  by three  levels.   If,  on the\r\n          other   hand,    the   sentencing   court\r\n          concludes that the  defendant has  merely\r\n          exercised  a  managerial  role  over  the\r\n          property,  assets,  or  activities  of  a\r\n          criminal  enterprise  involving  five  or\r\n          more participants, the court is possessed\r\n          of   a   certain  degree   of  discretion\r\n          regarding   the    enhancement   of   the\r\n          defendant's  sentence   --  \"[a]n  upward\r\n          departure may be warranted.\"  \r\n\n          We hold that section 3B1.1(b) and  Application Note\r\n\n2  preclude \"management responsibility over property, assets,\r\n\nor   activities  as  the  basis\"  for  an  enhancement  to  a\r\n\ndefendant's  base  offense  level.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nGreenfield, 44 F.3d 1141,  1146 (2d Cir. 1995).   Because the\r                      \r\n\ngovernment contends that the  factual predicate for a section\r\n\n3B1.1(b)  adjustment   exists  in   this  case,  we   do  not\r\n\nimmediately decide  the  question of  whether  section  3B1.1\r\n\ndepartures  must  be  analyzed  under  the  Rivera framework.\r                                                              \r\n\nInstead, we  focus on whether  the district court  found that\r\n\nCali managed one or more individuals in a criminal enterprise\r\n\ninvolving  five or more participants and, if so, whether that\r\n\nfinding was  clearly erroneous.  See  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 110.  \r\n\n          Section  3B1.1(b)  only  applies  where  the record\r\n\nshows  that a defendant operated as  a \"manager or supervisor\r\n\nand the criminal activity  involved five or more participants\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nor was otherwise  extensive.\"  U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(b).

See Joyce, 70  F.3d at\r                                                            \r\n\n682  (government  must  prove  role   in  the  offense  by  a\r\n\npreponderance of the  evidence and  may do so  by relying  on\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence).  Our review of the record, however,\r\n\nreveals that  the court's findings  on this  issue were  less\r\n\nthan  clear: there is a  discrepancy between the findings the\r\n\ndistrict  court  made from  the  bench  at Cali's  sentencing\r\n\nhearing  and  those  it  offered in  its  subsequent  written\r\n\njudgment.  \r\n\n          Transcripts of the sentencing hearing  suggest that\r\n\nthe court  did conclude that  Cali managed people  and assets\r\n\nfor Yerardi's gambling business:\r\n\n          THE  COURT:  I  find that the defendant's\r\n          role was more than  simply that of record\r\n          keeper.  He was that, as described in one\r\n          part   of   the  testimony   that's  been\r\n          referred to as  the trial of  the Grabiec\r\n          case, but  that was not the  limit of his\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          participation.  And it is my finding that\r\n          he was  also coordinating the  efforts of\r\n          others  and  the  reports  of  others and\r\n          putting   that   together  and   advising\r\n          Yerardi about managerial decisions in the\r\n          operation of this ongoing enterprise over\r\n          a substantial length of time.\r\n               Those findings, in my view, under an\r\n          appropriate    interpretation   of    the\r\n          guidelines  support a  three-point upward\r\n          adjustment  in  the  calculation  of  the\r\n          total offense  level so as  to raise that\r\n          total  offense level by three points from\r\n          the   way  it   was  calculated   by  the\r\n          presentence investigation report and thus\r\n          move it up to 13. \r\n\nBut the written judgment summarizing the court's findings and\r\n\ndecisions regarding the  adjustments and departures requested\r\n\nby the  government  and  Cali does  not  cite  management  or\r\n\nsupervision  of individuals as  part of  Cali's offense.

Furthermore, the  need to\r\n\nresolve the conflict in  the district court's 3B1.1 decisions\r\n\nby  remanding  for clarification  or  to  decide whether  the\r\n\nrecord  could  even  support  a  finding  that  Cali  managed\r\n\nindividuals  -- an  issue  about which  we have  considerable\r\n\ndoubt  --  is  obviated  by the  existence  of  the secondary\r\n\nholding.   It provides an alternative basis for upholding the\r\n\nfifteen-month  sentence  Cali received.    We  do not  decide\r\n\nwhether a  sufficient factual predicate existed  to find that\r\n\nthe defendant was  a manager of other  individuals within the\r\n\nmeaning  of  section  3B1.1.    We  proceed,  instead,  to  a\r\n\ndiscussion of the district court's upward departure holding.\r\n\n      U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Departures\r                  U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Departures\r                                                                    \r\n\n          As an alternative to its upward adjustment holding,\r\n\nthe  district  court  held  that the  asset  management  Cali\r\n\nconducted  during  his   involvement  in  Yerardi's  gambling\r\n\nbusiness  justified a  three-level  upward  departure,  under\r\n\nsection  3B1.1(b), to  impose a  sentence corresponding  to a\r\n\ntotal adjusted offense level of thirteen.  The district court\r\n\nfound that Cali operated as more than a bookie or mere record\r\n\nkeeper  and  that  the   threats  of  violence  which  marked\r\n\nYerardi's  gambling and  loansharking businesses  took Cali's\r\n\nconduct outside  the  heartland  of  other  section  3B1.1(b)\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\noffenses.   Cali assigns error.   He argues,  first, that the\r\n\nfacts of his case do not support a conclusion that he managed\r\n\nassets  and,  second,  that  the record,  to  the  extent  it\r\n\nreflects asset  management at all, does not  suggest that his\r\n\nconduct  falls outside  the  heartland  of  section  3B1.1(b)\r\n\noffenses.

Cali maintains  that the\r                  \r\n\nstarting  point  for  our  review  of  the  district  court's\r\n\ndeparture  decision  must  be  an inquiry  into  whether  his\r\n\nconduct  was  more  egregious  than  that  of  other  section\r\n\n3B1.1(b)  offenders.    The   government  disputes  this  and\r\n\ncontends  that such  an investigation  is unnecessary  in the\r\n\nrole-in-the-offense   context    because   section   3B1.1(b)\r\n\ndepartures are encouraged.  We agree with the government.  \r\n\n          Section  3B1.1 departures are clearly encouraged by\r\n\nthe Commission.  The  language of Application Note 2  -- that\r\n\n\"upward departure  may be warranted  . . .  in the case  of a\r\n\ndefendant who . .  . exercised management responsibility over\r\n\nthe   property,  assets,   or   activities   of  a   criminal\r\n\norganization\"  --  endorses   management  of   assets  as   a\r\n\npermissible basis for upward departure.  This endorsement and\r\n\nour  determination that  section  3B1.1 does  not incorporate\r\n\nasset  management  as  a sentencing  factor  lead  us  to the\r\n\nconclusion that  the district court was  authorized to depart\r\n\nwithout first engaging in the analysis Cali urges.  Where the\r\n\nCommission  has explicitly  identified certain  activities or\r\n\nconduct  as a factor not adequately taken into account in its\r\n\nformulation of a particular guideline and that guideline does\r\n\nnot  incorporate that factor at all, we can be confident that\r\n\nthe  departure undertaken  was not  unreasonable.

The record reveals  that\r\n\nthe  information Cali recorded  and analyzed was  an asset or\r\n\npossession of  great value to  the gambling enterprise.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWebster's II New Riverside  University Dictionary 131 (1994).\r                                                             \r\n\nIt  also shows that Cali  fielded calls from  and placed bets\r\n\nfor various agents, as  a bookie might do, but  also directly\r\n\nreviewed betting  and makeup figures with  the individual who\r\n\npresided  over   the   gambling  enterprise,   Yerardi,   and\r\n\nparticipated   in   \"charting\"   --   i.e.,   assessing   the\r\n\norganization's risk of  loss.  Compare  Parmelee, 42 F.3d  at\r                                                            \r\n\n395  (control of plane inherent in role of pilot for criminal\r\n\nenterprise).  Though Yerardi seems to have made the decisions\r\n\nabout  when and whom to  chart, the record  suggests that the\r\n\nresponsibility  for  keeping   the  organization's   records,\r\n\ncalculating the business's risk of loss on particular events,\r\n\nand assisting Yerardi in assessing the organization's overall\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nfinancial  health  primarily   rested  with   Cali  and   his\r\n\ncounterpart, DeAngelis.  The transcripts of calls intercepted\r\n\nby  the  State  Police,  in  particular,  suggest  that  Cali\r\n\nexercised  discretion  or  control  over  the  organization's\r\n\ninformation  and   that  Yerardi  heavily  relied  on  Cali's\r\n\nexpertise and special knowledge of the business's operations.\r\n\nWe, therefore,  do not think the  district court's conclusion\r\n\nthat Cali  managed assets or enjoyed  executive status within\r\n\nthe gambling enterprise implausible.  \r\n\n          Nor do we think  the extent of the  departure taken\r\n\nby the  district court  unreasonable.

The  three-level  upward  departure  taken  from  the\r\n\nsentence tabulated  under the Guidelines represents  a three-\r\n\nmonth  increase  in  the  maximum sentence  Cali  could  have\r\n\nreceived and an even smaller increase in the actual time Cali\r\n\nwill serve in prison.  Because of this, the reasons given for\r\n\nthe upward departure, and the deference due  the special feel\r\n\nthe district  court developed for this case in presiding over\r\n\nthe  legal proceedings  for Cali's  co-conspirators,  we find\r\n\nthat  the upward  departure  the district  court imposed  was\r\n\nreasonable.

Cali now appeals the fifteen-month sentence of imprisonment he received, contending that the district court enhanced the prison term mandated by the Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") because of the erroneous view that U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 permits a base offense level adjustment for mere management of assets or property.  Cali also maintains that the district court's alternative holding that upward departure was appropriate because his conduct fell outside section 3B1.1's heartland was clearly erroneous.  We agree that mere management of assets is insufficient for a base offense level adjustment under section 3B1.1, but find that the district court's alternative determination cures any defect in its holding.  Accordingly, we affirm.  Jurisdiction stems from 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the facts as set forth in the unobjected-to portions of the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\") and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.  See, e.g., United States v. Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 20 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 557 (1st Cir.1996).  On October 15, 1993, Philip Cali was arrested pursuant to count sixty-nine of a seventy-one count indictment charging him with conducting, financing, managing, supervising, directing, and owning all or part of an illegal gambling business which involved five or more persons between October 1986 and December 1992.  The result of an eight year Massachusetts State Police (\"State Police\") investigation into large-scale racketeering conspiracies, the indictment named nine individuals, four of whom--Joseph Yerardi (\"Yerardi\"), William Maguire (\"Maguire\"), Anthony Grabiec Jr.  (\"Grabiec\"), and Salvatore M. DeAngelis (\"DeAngelis\")--were charged in count sixty-nine with Cali.  Cali, who is sixty-five and has a criminal history which includes convictions for gambling-related activities, was not charged in any of the indictment's other counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of their racketeering investigation, the State Police obtained authorization to intercept phone conversations over a cellular telephone utilized by Yerardi from June to August 1991.  Their surveillance of the telephone revealed that Yerardi presided over extensive loansharking and gambling businesses.  The gambling business, which operated under the auspices of Boston's Winter Hill Gang and generated funds for Yerardi's loansharking business, included over twenty-five bookmaking agents, two principal offices, and had a gross daily revenue of $2,000.00.  Though Yerardi headed the gambling enterprise, Maguire was its principal supervisor and the individual responsible for collecting money owed to the organization and paying out money owed to agents and bettors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcripts of numerous calls between Yerardi and Cali intercepted by the State Police revealed that Cali and DeAngelis played the same role in the gambling enterprise, though they operated out of different locations.  Yerardi stationed Cali, who frequently placed bets with the business and was often one of its debtors, at one of the business's principal bookmaking offices to receive calls from the various agents.  The agents, who identified themselves by code only and received a percentage of the business's profits as compensation, communicated information about sporting event bets to Cali.  After taking and recording that information, Cali transmitted it directly to Yerardi, with whom he was in daily telephone contact.  The majority of the calls intercepted by the State Police were made by Yerardi to Cali at the bookmaking office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cali often reviewed betting results with and reported agents' makeup figures--those monies that have to be worked off before any money can be paid out--to Yerardi during these telephone conversations.  He also assisted in charting bets for the gambling business.  Charting involves tracking daily bets made by agents and monitoring the business's projected risk of loss on individual sporting events.  Though Cali answered directly to Yerardi and was responsible for completing charting analyses, there is no evidence that he received a percentage of the business's profit or played any role in setting policy regarding odds or bet placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1995, Cali pled guilty to participating in the operation of an illegal gambling business.  The district court scheduled a sentencing hearing and prior thereto received a PSI from the Probation Department.  The PSI prepared by the Probation Department, to which both the government and Cali registered objections, recommended a total adjusted guideline offense level of ten.  This recommendation reflects a two level decrease in the base offense for acceptance of responsibility.  See U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2E3.1(a);  3E1.1.  The PSI concluded, based on the information provided by the government and the defendant's description of his duties that an adjustment for role in the offense would not be warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department assigned Cali three criminal history points for prior gambling convictions and, as a result, placed him in Criminal History Category II.  The district court, however, later found that the Probation Department had erroneously assigned Cali criminal history points for offenses committed while working for Yerardi and identified the appropriate criminal history category as I.  Placement in Criminal History Category I, at a total adjusted offense level of ten, results in a sentencing range of six to twelve months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>THE SENTENCING HEARING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, Cali requested a downward departure on the grounds that both he and his wife suffered, inter alia, from serious heart conditions and largely supported themselves on Social Security income benefits that would be unavailable to them for any period that Cali was incarcerated.  The government disputed the contention that Cali was entitled to departure on this basis and objected to the two-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility recommended by the Probation Department.  Additionally, the government objected to the PSI's failure to add four levels under section 3B1.1(a) for supervisory role, arguing that an enhancement was warranted because Cali managed people and assets within that guideline's meaning.  The government also argued that the Criminal History Category I assignment Cali received did not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the objections and requests made by both Cali and the government.  It refused Cali's request for a health-related departure, concluding that the factors cited by the defense did not, \"separately or together, justify departure.\"   It also rejected the government's objection to the two-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility recommended by the PSI.  Finally, the court found that the severity of Cali's criminal history was not underrepresented by the amended criminal history calculation and denied the government's request for a four-level adjustment under section 3B1.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the court found that Cali's role in Yerardi's gambling enterprise warranted some enhancement in his sentence and concluded, over Cali's objection, that a three level increase in the offense level was appropriate.  It found that section 3B1.1(b) and Application Note 2's role in the offense provisions permitted him to make a direct adjustment to Cali's base offense level, but added that, should this Court determine that section 3B1.1 does not permit such an adjustment, it would employ an upward departure, under United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942 (1st Cir.1993), to impose a sentence outside the range prescribed by the Guidelines to reach the same final sentence.  Either calculus results in a total adjusted offense level of thirteen, which corresponds to a sentencing range of twelve to eighteen months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court sentenced Cali to a fifteen-month term of imprisonment and two years of supervised release.  It assessed Cali $50.00, as required by statute, and imposed a fine of $3,000.00, without interest.  In light of Cali's medical problems, the court also made a recommendation that Cali be placed in a facility, as close to Massachusetts as possible, where adequate medical treatment would be available to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of a district court's application of the Guidelines is a two-part process.  United States v. Joyce, 70 F.3d 679, 681 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1556, 134 L.Ed.2d 657 (1996).  We first determine the applicability of the guideline to a particular case de novo.  United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992).  After determining the guideline's scope and meaning, we review the district court's factual determinations for clear error, \"giv[ing] due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  Joyce, 70 F.3d at 681;  see also Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2043, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996);  McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 535;  St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 701.   Because \"[t]he determination of a defendant's role in an offense is fact-specific,\" Joyce, 70 F.3d at 682, we will only disturb the district court's findings regarding Cali's role in Yerardi's gambling enterprise if they are clearly erroneous or based on a mistake of law.  See United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 653 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 413 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 110-11 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The small, but nevertheless real, difference between a twelve and fifteen month prison term is ultimately what is at stake in this appeal.  Cali contends that he is entitled to a reduction in his fifteen-month sentence because twelve months is the maximum prison term he should have received under the Guidelines.  In support of this, he maintains that the district court erroneously concluded that section 3B1.1(b) permits a base offense level enhancement in the absence of a finding that a defendant organized, lead, managed, or supervised one or more participants in an illegal enterprise involving five or more participants.  Additionally, Cali argues that the court's alternative holding--that an upward departure was appropriate in the event section 3B1.1 precluded adjustment--was clearly erroneous because his conduct falls squarely within the heartland of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955 offenses.  We begin by reviewing the claim that, absent a finding that a defendant managed individuals, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) precludes an enhancement in the base offense level and discuss the requirements for a &#167; 3B1.1 upward departure thereafter.U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Adjustments</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 punishes defendants in large-scale criminal enterprises according to their relative responsibility, meting out the most severe sentences to individuals who hold leadership or management positions.  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 111;  United States v. Fones, 51 F.3d 663, 665 (7th Cir.1995);  United States v. Parmelee, 42 F.3d 387, 395 (7th Cir.1994), cert. denied sub nom.  Brozek-Lukaszuk, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 63, 133 L.Ed.2d 25 (1995).  The district court used this guideline to elevate Cali's sentence on the theory that section 3B1.1(b) permits an enhancement in a defendant's base offense level for both management of individuals and assets.  Cali assigns error, contending that an enhancement in base offense level can only be based on a finding that the defendant managed other individuals.  The government concedes this point, but maintains that Cali's argument is moot because the district court found that Cali's responsibilities in Yerardi's gambling business included managing individuals, as well as assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make sense of these positions, we briefly review section 3B1.1 and its history.  Section 3B1.1 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Based on the defendant's role in the offense, increase the offense level as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>(a) If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 4 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(b) If the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(c) If the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to 1993, courts were split as to whether a finding that a criminal-enterprise defendant managed individuals was a prerequisite to a section 3B1.1 base offense level adjustment.  See United States v. McFarlane, 64 F.3d 1235, 1237 (8th Cir.1995).  This Circuit took the view that \"the defendant must have exercised some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the offense or ... must have been responsible for organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.\"  United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1220 (1st Cir.1990);  see also United States v. Fuentes, 954 F.2d 151, 153 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 977, 112 S.Ct. 2950, 119 L.Ed.2d 573 (1992);  United States v. Mares-Molina, 913 F.2d 770, 773 (9th Cir.1990).  Other courts concluded that \"a defendant who did not supervise people [could] be considered a manager or supervisor within the meaning of &#167; 3B1.1(b).\"  United States v. Chambers, 985 F.2d 1263, 1267 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 834, 114 S.Ct. 107, 126 L.Ed.2d 73 (1993);  see also United States v. Grady, 972 F.2d 889 (8th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1993, the Sentencing Commission (\"Commission\") weighed into this debate by issuing Amendment 500, which amended section 3B1.1 to include Application Note 2.  That application note provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>To qualify for an adjustment under this section, defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.  An upward departure may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Amendment 500 offered something to courts on both sides of the section 3B1.1 debate.  It made it clear, in accord with the position we embraced in Fuller, 897 F.2d at 1220, that section 3B1.1 adjustments are unavailable unless the record shows that the defendant managed one or more individuals, but also states that a finding that a defendant managed assets instead of individuals could be a basis for upward departure.  Ironically, this attempt to define section 3B1.1's contours and operation created the dispute which lies at the heart of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application Note 2 explains that section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures require different factual findings, but does not clarify how, if at all, these devices differ in terms of the sentencing calculation they mandate.  At the sentencing hearing, Cali argued that section 3B1.1 adjustments involve enhancements in the base offense level, whereas section 3B1.1 departures involve enhancements in the total adjusted offense level and must adhere to the framework for Guidelines departures established by this Circuit in Rivera, 994 F.2d at 942.   The district court agreed that section 3B1.1 adjustments effectuate increases in a defendant's base offense level.  See, e.g., United States v. Capers, 61 F.3d 1100, 1109 (4th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1830, 134 L.Ed.2d 935 (1996);  Fones, 51 F.3d at 669-70;  McFarlane, 64 F.3d at 1239-40.   It was not persuaded, however, that the Commission intended to limit section 3B1.1 departures to changes in the total adjusted offense level:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  My primary view of the matter ... is that the appropriate way to read these guidelines is that that word \"departure\" in Application Note 2 was not being used in the technical sense of a kind of departure that is controlled by Rivera, by the decision-making structure controlled by Rivera.   Instead it's talking about a calculation of the total offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court reasoned that had the Commission intended the term \"departure\" to have the same meaning in the role in the offense context as it does elsewhere in the Guidelines, it would have discussed role in the offense departures in Chapter 5, Part K, of the Guidelines, which is explicitly devoted to departures, and not in Chapter 3, Part B, which primarily deals with base offense level adjustments.  See U.S.S.G. Chap. 3, Part B, Introductory Commentary (\"This part provides adjustments to the offense level based upon the role the defendant played in committing the offense.\").  The district court, therefore, held that both section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures affect base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was error.  We cannot agree, given the circumstances surrounding the Commission's promulgation of Application Note 2, that the sentence-calculation difference between section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures \"is ... inconsequential.\"   See McFarlane, 64 F.3d at 1239.   Simply because role-in-the-offense departures are discussed in Chapter 3, Part B, instead of Chapter 5, Part K, is not persuasive evidence of an intent to treat section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures the same for sentence calculation purposes.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948 (\"Specific individual guidelines may also encourage departures.\").  The language of Application Note 2 persuades us that the two devices are, in fact, different:  section 3B1.1 adjustments are mandatory and subject to the tripartite test set out by that guideline, whereas departures made pursuant to that guideline are discretionary.  As the Eighth Circuit explained in United States v. McFarlane, 64 F.3d 1235, 1239 (8th Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>If the sentencing court concludes that a defendant has managed or supervised one or more participants in a criminal enterprise involving five or more total participants, an adjustment is mandated--the court must enhance the defendant's sentence by three levels.  If, on the other hand, the sentencing court concludes that the defendant has merely exercised a managerial role over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal enterprise involving five or more participants, the court is possessed of a certain degree of discretion regarding the enhancement of the defendant's sentence--\"[a]n upward departure may be warranted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that section 3B1.1(b) and Application Note 2 preclude \"management responsibility over property, assets, or activities as the basis\" for an enhancement to a defendant's base offense level.  See United States v. Greenfield, 44 F.3d 1141, 1146 (2d Cir.1995).  Because the government contends that the factual predicate for a section 3B1.1(b) adjustment exists in this case, we do not immediately decide the question of whether section 3B1.1 departures must be analyzed under the Rivera framework.  Instead, we focus on whether the district court found that Cali managed one or more individuals in a criminal enterprise involving five or more participants and, if so, whether that finding was clearly erroneous.  See Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.1(b) only applies where the record shows that a defendant operated as a \"manager or supervisor and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b).  Though the Guidelines provide a list of seven factors--which is neither exhaustive nor imbued with \"talismanic significance\"--to assist courts in determining whether a defendant acted as a leader or organizer within the meaning of section 3B1.1(a), United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255, 1260 (1st Cir.1994);  see also Joyce, 70 F.3d at 683;  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 111;  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, Application Note 4, they do not define \"[t]he terms 'manager' and 'supervisor'.\"  Joyce, 70 F.3d at 682.   In the past, we have required some \"degree of control or organizational authority over others\" to support a section 3B1.1(b) adjustment.  Fuller, 897 F.2d at 1220.   Immediate or direct control over subordinates or partners, while certainly an important factor to consider, is not, however, a prerequisite to finding a defendant deserving of added culpability or punishment.  See Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 654;  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 112;  United States v. Payne, 63 F.3d 1200, 1212 (2d Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1056, 134 L.Ed.2d 201 (1996);  Greenfield, 44 F.3d at 1146-47.  \"Managerial status [generally] attach[es] if there is evidence that a defendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at least one other person.\"  United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 616 (1st Cir.1993);  see also United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1240 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied sub nom.  Martinez v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1164, 130 L.Ed.2d 1120 (1995);  see also United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the court clearly found that Cali served as a manager or supervisor in the gambling enterprise and that this finding was adequately supported by the transcripts of the conversations between Yerardi and Cali intercepted by the State Police, Cali's acceptance of responsibility statement, and affidavits provided by State Trooper Tutungian.  See Joyce, 70 F.3d at 682 (government must prove role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence and may do so by relying on circumstantial evidence).  Our review of the record, however, reveals that the court's findings on this issue were less than clear:  there is a discrepancy between the findings the district court made from the bench at Cali's sentencing hearing and those it offered in its subsequent written judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcripts of the sentencing hearing suggest that the court did conclude that Cali managed people and assets for Yerardi's gambling business:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I find that the defendant's role was more than simply that of record keeper.  He was that, as described in one part of the testimony that's been referred to as the trial of the Grabiec case, but that was not the limit of his participation.  And it is my finding that he was also coordinating the efforts of others and the reports of others and putting that together and advising Yerardi about managerial decisions in the operation of this ongoing enterprise over a substantial length of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those findings, in my view, under an appropriate interpretation of the guidelines support a three-point upward adjustment in the calculation of the total offense level so as to raise that total offense level by three points from the way it was calculated by the presentence investigation report and thus move it up to 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the written judgment summarizing the court's findings and decisions regarding the adjustments and departures requested by the government and Cali does not cite management or supervision of individuals as part of Cali's offense.  It omits the reference to individuals and refers only to Cali's alleged management of assets:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Government objection to failure of PSI to add four levels under &#167; 3B1.1(a) for alleged supervisory role is rejected, but I find (over defendant's objection) that an upward adjustment of 3 levels is appropriate under &#167; 3B1.1(b) and Application Note 2, because the defendant exercised a degree of management responsibility over property and assets, under the direction of the principal organizer and leader.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government invites us to ignore this discrepancy and to focus instead on the district court's oral explanation of its sentencing decisionmaking.  Ordinarily, we would accept such an invitation.  \"Where ... [a] district court's oral expression of its sentencing rationale varies materially from its subsequent written expression of that rationale, appellate courts have tended to honor the former at the expense of the latter.\"  United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 42 n. 5 (1st Cir.1995);  see also United States v. Tramp, 30 F.3d 1035, 1037 (8th Cir.1994);  United States v. Hicks, 997 F.2d 594, 597 (9th Cir.1993);  United States v. Roberts, 933 F.2d 517, 519 n. 1 (7th Cir.1991)(citing cases);  United States v. Khoury, 901 F.2d 975, 977 (11th Cir.1990).  We decline, however, to do so in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the written judgment and the district court's alternative holding--that Cali's management of assets warranted an upward departure from the sentence prescribed under the Guidelines--both focus on management of assets and do not mention management of individuals at all, we think it would be imprudent to adhere to the oral pronouncement made in this case.  Furthermore, the need to resolve the conflict in the district court's 3B1.1 decisions by remanding for clarification or to decide whether the record could even support a finding that Cali managed individuals--an issue about which we have considerable doubt--is obviated by the existence of the secondary holding.  It provides an alternative basis for upholding the fifteen-month sentence Cali received.  We do not decide whether a sufficient factual predicate existed to find that the defendant was a manager of other individuals within the meaning of section 3B1.1.  We proceed, instead, to a discussion of the district court's upward departure holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Departures</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to its upward adjustment holding, the district court held that the asset management Cali conducted during his involvement in Yerardi's gambling business justified a three-level upward departure, under section 3B1.1(b), to impose a sentence corresponding to a total adjusted offense level of thirteen.  The district court found that Cali operated as more than a bookie or mere record keeper and that the threats of violence which marked Yerardi's gambling and loansharking businesses took Cali's conduct outside the heartland of other section 3B1.1(b) offenses.  Cali assigns error.  He argues, first, that the facts of his case do not support a conclusion that he managed assets and, second, that the record, to the extent it reflects asset management at all, does not suggest that his conduct falls outside the heartland of section 3B1.1(b) offenses.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 947.   The government contends that Rivera 's heartland analysis does not apply and urges us to accept the district court's findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing these arguments, we discuss the rules pertaining to departures from sentences prescribed by the Guidelines.  Prior to the Court's recent decision in Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), appellate courts were expected to engage in a three-part departure analysis.  See United States v. Campbell, 61 F.3d 976, 984 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1556, 134 L.Ed.2d 657 (1996);  Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 404;  United States v. Jackson, 30 F.3d 199, 202 (1st Cir.1994).  We first conducted plenary review of whether the circumstances of the case were, in principle, of a kind that the Guidelines permitted the district court to consider, \"with 'full awareness of, and respect for the trier's superior \"feel\" for the case'....\"  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951-52 (quoting United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 50 (1st Cir.1989));  see also United States v. Bennett, 60 F.3d 902, 904 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Pelkey, 29 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir.1994).  We then reviewed the district court's departure-related findings of fact for clear error.  Pelkey, 29 F.3d at 14.   Finally, we assessed the reasonableness of the departure taken.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koon effectively merges the first and second stages of our departure analysis into one, and instructs that our review of the legal conclusions and factual determinations underlying the district court's departure decision be conducted under a unitary abuse-of-discretion standard.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2044.  \"That a departure decision, in an occasional case, may call for a legal determination does not mean, as a consequence, that parts of the review must be labeled de novo while other parts are labeled an abuse of discretion.\"  Id. at --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2044-45.   Thus, the analysis we must conduct in evaluating departure decisions entails reviewing, under an abuse of discretion standard, the district court's determination that the case presents features that make it sufficiently unusual to take it out of the applicable guideline's heartland.  See id. at --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046.   Abuse of discretion review necessarily \"includes review to determine that the [district court's exercise of] discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\"  Id. at --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2045.   Additionally, our analysis, like our pre-Koon review process, requires us to assess the reasonableness of the departure taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions to depart from sentences prescribed by the Guidelines are generally only permitted in cases in which unusual or atypical circumstances justify individualizing a sentence more than the relatively narrow strictures that the Guidelines permit.  United States v. Calderon, 935 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Koon, --- U.S. at ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2043, 2051 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b).  In general, departure decisions fall into one of three categories:  forbidden, discouraged, and encouraged.  Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 560.  \"Forbidden departures are those based, inter alia, on race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, or socioeconomic status.\"  Id.; Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948-49;  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5H1.10, 5H1.12.  \"The Sentencing Commission ... has expressly precluded departure on these grounds, even where they make a case atypical or extraordinary.\"  Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 560.  \"Discouraged departures involve factors which were considered by the Commission--such as age, family ties and responsibilities, employment record, good works, or physical condition--but which present themselves to an extraordinary degree in a particular case.\"  Id.  \"Encouraged departures, in contrast, involve considerations not previously taken into account by the Commission.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The departure analysis \"varies depending on the category in which the feature [or activity] justifying departure falls.\"  United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1323 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied sub nom.  Bonasia v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).  Cali maintains that the starting point for our review of the district court's departure decision must be an inquiry into whether his conduct was more egregious than that of other section 3B1.1(b) offenders.  The government disputes this and contends that such an investigation is unnecessary in the role-in-the-offense context because section 3B1.1(b) departures are encouraged.  We agree with the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.1 departures are clearly encouraged by the Commission.  The language of Application Note 2--that \"upward departure may be warranted ... in the case of a defendant who ... exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization\"--endorses management of assets as a permissible basis for upward departure.  This endorsement and our determination that section 3B1.1 does not incorporate asset management as a sentencing factor lead us to the conclusion that the district court was authorized to depart without first engaging in the analysis Cali urges.  Where the Commission has explicitly identified certain activities or conduct as a factor not adequately taken into account in its formulation of a particular guideline and that guideline does not incorporate that factor at all, we can be confident that the departure undertaken was not unreasonable.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2043;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948;  see also United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 952-53 (1st Cir.1995)(reviewing encouraged U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1 upward departure);  Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 406 (reviewing encouraged U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 downward departure);  United States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir.1994)(reviewing encouraged U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.8 upward departure).  Resort to the \"heartland\" analysis generally reserved for discouraged departures is, therefore, unnecessary.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2043;  McFarlane, 64 F.3d at 1240;  United States v. Mendez-Colon, 15 F.3d 188, 190-91 (1st Cir.1994)(Breyer, C.J.);   compare DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1323 (describing process for comparing cases involving discouraged reasons for departure).  Management of a large-scale criminal enterprise's assets is conduct which, under Application Note 2 to section 3B1.1 and hence as a matter of law, places a defendant outside the heartland of offenses by individuals who participate in large-scale criminal enterprises but who do not manage assets.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the relevant circumstances of Cali's case constitute an encouraged basis for departure under the Guidelines, we proceed to the next stage in our analysis.  Cali asserts that the district court erroneously found that he managed gambling assets.  While Cali paints a persuasive picture of his role in Yerardi's gambling business, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.  \"[W]hen there are two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's adoption of one such view cannot be clearly erroneous.\"  St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 706;  see also Munoz, 36 F.3d at 1240;  United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir.1993);  Savoie, 985 F.2d at 616.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented evidence which was a solid basis for the district court to conclude that Cali managed assets and was more than a mere \"bookie\" or \"telephone operator\" in Yerardi's business.  The record reveals that the information Cali recorded and analyzed was an asset or possession of great value to the gambling enterprise.  See Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 131 (1994).  It also shows that Cali fielded calls from and placed bets for various agents, as a bookie might do, but also directly reviewed betting and makeup figures with the individual who presided over the gambling enterprise, Yerardi, and participated in \"charting\"--i.e., assessing the organization's risk of loss.  Compare Parmelee, 42 F.3d at 395 (control of plane inherent in role of pilot for criminal enterprise).  Though Yerardi seems to have made the decisions about when and whom to chart, the record suggests that the responsibility for keeping the organization's records, calculating the business's risk of loss on particular events, and assisting Yerardi in assessing the organization's overall financial health primarily rested with Cali and his counterpart, DeAngelis.  The transcripts of calls intercepted by the State Police, in particular, suggest that Cali exercised discretion or control over the organization's information and that Yerardi heavily relied on Cali's expertise and special knowledge of the business's operations.  We, therefore, do not think the district court's conclusion that Cali managed assets or enjoyed executive status within the gambling enterprise implausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think the extent of the departure taken by the district court unreasonable.  Quinones, 26 F.3d at 219.   The three-level upward departure taken from the sentence tabulated under the Guidelines represents a three-month increase in the maximum sentence Cali could have received and an even smaller increase in the actual time Cali will serve in prison.  Because of this, the reasons given for the upward departure, and the deference due the special feel the district court developed for this case in presiding over the legal proceedings for Cali's co-conspirators, we find that the upward departure the district court imposed was reasonable.  See Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 409 (judgment call for decision regarding extent of departure is ultimately the district court's).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, Cali's fifteen-month sentence of imprisonment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Cali now appeals the fifteen-month sentence of imprisonment he received, contending that the district court enhanced the prison term mandated by the Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") because of the erroneous view that U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 permits a base offense level adjustment for mere management of assets or property.  Cali also maintains that the district court's alternative holding that upward departure was appropriate because his conduct fell outside section 3B1.1's heartland was clearly erroneous.  We agree that mere management of assets is insufficient for a base offense level adjustment under section 3B1.1, but find that the district court's alternative determination cures any defect in its holding.  Accordingly, we affirm.  Jurisdiction stems from 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the facts as set forth in the unobjected-to portions of the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\") and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.  See, e.g., United States v. Peppe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196672\"><a href=\"/opinion/196672/united-states-v-peppe/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Grandmaison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196611\"><a href=\"/opinion/196611/united-states-v-grandmaison/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 557 (1st Cir.1996).  On October 15, 1993, Philip Cali was arrested pursuant to count sixty-nine of a seventy-one count indictment charging him with conducting, financing, managing, supervising, directing, and owning all or part of an illegal gambling business which involved five or more persons between October 1986 and December 1992.  The result of an eight year Massachusetts State Police (\"State Police\") investigation into large-scale racketeering conspiracies, the indictment named nine individuals, four of whom--Joseph Yerardi (\"Yerardi\"), William Maguire (\"Maguire\"), Anthony Grabiec Jr.  (\"Grabiec\"), and Salvatore M. DeAngelis (\"DeAngelis\")--were charged in count sixty-nine with Cali.  Cali, who is sixty-five and has a criminal history which includes convictions for gambling-related activities, was not charged in any of the indictment's other counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of their racketeering investigation, the State Police obtained authorization to intercept phone conversations over a cellular telephone utilized by Yerardi from June to August 1991.  Their surveillance of the telephone revealed that Yerardi presided over extensive loansharking and gambling businesses.  The gambling business, which operated under the auspices of Boston's Winter Hill Gang and generated funds for Yerardi's loansharking business, included over twenty-five bookmaking agents, two principal offices, and had a gross daily revenue of $2,000.00.  Though Yerardi headed the gambling enterprise, Maguire was its principal supervisor and the individual responsible for collecting money owed to the organization and paying out money owed to agents and bettors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcripts of numerous calls between Yerardi and Cali intercepted by the State Police revealed that Cali and DeAngelis played the same role in the gambling enterprise, though they operated out of different locations.  Yerardi stationed Cali, who frequently placed bets with the business and was often one of its debtors, at one of the business's principal bookmaking offices to receive calls from the various agents.  The agents, who identified themselves by code only and received a percentage of the business's profits as compensation, communicated information about sporting event bets to Cali.  After taking and recording that information, Cali transmitted it directly to Yerardi, with whom he was in daily telephone contact.  The majority of the calls intercepted by the State Police were made by Yerardi to Cali at the bookmaking office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cali often reviewed betting results with and reported agents' makeup figures--those monies that have to be worked off before any money can be paid out--to Yerardi during these telephone conversations.  He also assisted in charting bets for the gambling business.  Charting involves tracking daily bets made by agents and monitoring the business's projected risk of loss on individual sporting events.  Though Cali answered directly to Yerardi and was responsible for completing charting analyses, there is no evidence that he received a percentage of the business's profit or played any role in setting policy regarding odds or bet placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1995, Cali pled guilty to participating in the operation of an illegal gambling business.  The district court scheduled a sentencing hearing and prior thereto received a PSI from the Probation Department.  The PSI prepared by the Probation Department, to which both the government and Cali registered objections, recommended a total adjusted guideline offense level of ten.  This recommendation reflects a two level decrease in the base offense for acceptance of responsibility.  See U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2E3.1(a);  3E1.1.  The PSI concluded, based on the information provided by the government and the defendant's description of his duties that an adjustment for role in the offense would not be warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department assigned Cali three criminal history points for prior gambling convictions and, as a result, placed him in Criminal History Category II.  The district court, however, later found that the Probation Department had erroneously assigned Cali criminal history points for offenses committed while working for Yerardi and identified the appropriate criminal history category as I.  Placement in Criminal History Category I, at a total adjusted offense level of ten, results in a sentencing range of six to twelve months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>THE SENTENCING HEARING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, Cali requested a downward departure on the grounds that both he and his wife suffered, inter alia, from serious heart conditions and largely supported themselves on Social Security income benefits that would be unavailable to them for any period that Cali was incarcerated.  The government disputed the contention that Cali was entitled to departure on this basis and objected to the two-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility recommended by the Probation Department.  Additionally, the government objected to the PSI's failure to add four levels under section 3B1.1(a) for supervisory role, arguing that an enhancement was warranted because Cali managed people and assets within that guideline's meaning.  The government also argued that the Criminal History Category I assignment Cali received did not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the objections and requests made by both Cali and the government.  It refused Cali's request for a health-related departure, concluding that the factors cited by the defense did not, \"separately or together, justify departure.\"   It also rejected the government's objection to the two-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility recommended by the PSI.  Finally, the court found that the severity of Cali's criminal history was not underrepresented by the amended criminal history calculation and denied the government's request for a four-level adjustment under section 3B1.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the court found that Cali's role in Yerardi's gambling enterprise warranted some enhancement in his sentence and concluded, over Cali's objection, that a three level increase in the offense level was appropriate.  It found that section 3B1.1(b) and Application Note 2's role in the offense provisions permitted him to make a direct adjustment to Cali's base offense level, but added that, should this Court determine that section 3B1.1 does not permit such an adjustment, it would employ an upward departure, under United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993), to impose a sentence outside the range prescribed by the Guidelines to reach the same final sentence.  Either calculus results in a total adjusted offense level of thirteen, which corresponds to a sentencing range of twelve to eighteen months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court sentenced Cali to a fifteen-month term of imprisonment and two years of supervised release.  It assessed Cali $50.00, as required by statute, and imposed a fine of $3,000.00, without interest.  In light of Cali's medical problems, the court also made a recommendation that Cali be placed in a facility, as close to Massachusetts as possible, where adequate medical treatment would be available to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of a district court's application of the Guidelines is a two-part process.

Because \"[t]he determination of a defendant's role in an offense is fact-specific,\" Joyce, 70 F.3d at 682, we will only disturb the district court's findings regarding Cali's role in Yerardi's gambling enterprise if they are clearly erroneous or based on a mistake of law.

Cali contends that he is entitled to a reduction in his fifteen-month sentence because twelve months is the maximum prison term he should have received under the Guidelines.  In support of this, he maintains that the district court erroneously concluded that section 3B1.1(b) permits a base offense level enhancement in the absence of a finding that a defendant organized, lead, managed, or supervised one or more participants in an illegal enterprise involving five or more participants.  Additionally, Cali argues that the court's alternative holding--that an upward departure was appropriate in the event section 3B1.1 precluded adjustment--was clearly erroneous because his conduct falls squarely within the heartland of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955 offenses.  We begin by reviewing the claim that, absent a finding that a defendant managed individuals, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) precludes an enhancement in the base offense level and discuss the requirements for a &#167; 3B1.1 upward departure thereafter.U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Adjustments</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 punishes defendants in large-scale criminal enterprises according to their relative responsibility, meting out the most severe sentences to individuals who hold leadership or management positions.

The district court used this guideline to elevate Cali's sentence on the theory that section 3B1.1(b) permits an enhancement in a defendant's base offense level for both management of individuals and assets.  Cali assigns error, contending that an enhancement in base offense level can only be based on a finding that the defendant managed other individuals.  The government concedes this point, but maintains that Cali's argument is moot because the district court found that Cali's responsibilities in Yerardi's gambling business included managing individuals, as well as assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make sense of these positions, we briefly review section 3B1.1 and its history.

That application note provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>To qualify for an adjustment under this section, defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.  An upward departure may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Amendment 500 offered something to courts on both sides of the section 3B1.1 debate.  It made it clear, in accord with the position we embraced in Fuller, 897 F.2d at 1220, that section 3B1.1 adjustments are unavailable unless the record shows that the defendant managed one or more individuals, but also states that a finding that a defendant managed assets instead of individuals could be a basis for upward departure.  Ironically, this attempt to define section 3B1.1's contours and operation created the dispute which lies at the heart of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application Note 2 explains that section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures require different factual findings, but does not clarify how, if at all, these devices differ in terms of the sentencing calculation they mandate.  At the sentencing hearing, Cali argued that section 3B1.1 adjustments involve enhancements in the base offense level, whereas section 3B1.1 departures involve enhancements in the total adjusted offense level and must adhere to the framework for Guidelines departures established by this Circuit in Rivera, 994 F.2d at 942.   The district court agreed that section 3B1.1 adjustments effectuate increases in a defendant's base offense level.  See, e.g., United States v. Capers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701271\"><a href=\"/opinion/701271/united-states-v-anthony-j-capers-united-states-of-america-v-lisa-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span>, 1109 (4th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></span> (1996);  Fones, 51 F.3d at 669-70;  McFarlane, 64 F.3d at 1239-40.   It was not persuaded, however, that the Commission intended to limit section 3B1.1 departures to changes in the total adjusted offense level:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  My primary view of the matter ... is that the appropriate way to read these guidelines is that that word \"departure\" in Application Note 2 was not being used in the technical sense of a kind of departure that is controlled by Rivera, by the decision-making structure controlled by Rivera.   Instead it's talking about a calculation of the total offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court reasoned that had the Commission intended the term \"departure\" to have the same meaning in the role in the offense context as it does elsewhere in the Guidelines, it would have discussed role in the offense departures in Chapter 5, Part K, of the Guidelines, which is explicitly devoted to departures, and not in Chapter 3, Part B, which primarily deals with base offense level adjustments.  See U.S.S.G. Chap. 3, Part B, Introductory Commentary (\"This part provides adjustments to the offense level based upon the role the defendant played in committing the offense.\").  The district court, therefore, held that both section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures affect base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was error.  We cannot agree, given the circumstances surrounding the Commission's promulgation of Application Note 2, that the sentence-calculation difference between section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures \"is ... inconsequential.\"   See McFarlane, 64 F.3d at 1239.   Simply because role-in-the-offense departures are discussed in Chapter 3, Part B, instead of Chapter 5, Part K, is not persuasive evidence of an intent to treat section 3B1.1 adjustments and departures the same for sentence calculation purposes.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948 (\"Specific individual guidelines may also encourage departures.\").  The language of Application Note 2 persuades us that the two devices are, in fact, different:  section 3B1.1 adjustments are mandatory and subject to the tripartite test set out by that guideline, whereas departures made pursuant to that guideline are discretionary.  As the Eighth Circuit explained in United States v. McFarlane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703209\"><a href=\"/opinion/703209/united-states-v-koby-kirk-mcfarlane-sr/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></a></span>, 1239 (8th Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>If the sentencing court concludes that a defendant has managed or supervised one or more participants in a criminal enterprise involving five or more total participants, an adjustment is mandated--the court must enhance the defendant's sentence by three levels.  If, on the other hand, the sentencing court concludes that the defendant has merely exercised a managerial role over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal enterprise involving five or more participants, the court is possessed of a certain degree of discretion regarding the enhancement of the defendant's sentence--\"[a]n upward departure may be warranted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that section 3B1.1(b) and Application Note 2 preclude \"management responsibility over property, assets, or activities as the basis\" for an enhancement to a defendant's base offense level.  See United States v. Greenfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686729\"><a href=\"/opinion/686729/united-states-v-gerald-harvey-greenfield-also-known-as-david-f-mills/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span>, 1146 (2d Cir.1995).  Because the government contends that the factual predicate for a section 3B1.1(b) adjustment exists in this case, we do not immediately decide the question of whether section 3B1.1 departures must be analyzed under the Rivera framework.  Instead, we focus on whether the district court found that Cali managed one or more individuals in a criminal enterprise involving five or more participants and, if so, whether that finding was clearly erroneous.  See Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.1(b) only applies where the record shows that a defendant operated as a \"manager or supervisor and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b).  Though the Guidelines provide a list of seven factors--which is neither exhaustive nor imbued with \"talismanic significance\"--to assist courts in determining whether a defendant acted as a leader or organizer within the meaning of section 3B1.1(a), United States v.

In the past, we have required some \"degree of control or organizational authority over others\" to support a section 3B1.1(b) adjustment.  Fuller, 897 F.2d at 1220.   Immediate or direct control over subordinates or partners, while certainly an important factor to consider, is not, however, a prerequisite to finding a defendant deserving of added culpability or punishment.

See Joyce, 70 F.3d at 682 (government must prove role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence and may do so by relying on circumstantial evidence).  Our review of the record, however, reveals that the court's findings on this issue were less than clear:  there is a discrepancy between the findings the district court made from the bench at Cali's sentencing hearing and those it offered in its subsequent written judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcripts of the sentencing hearing suggest that the court did conclude that Cali managed people and assets for Yerardi's gambling business:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I find that the defendant's role was more than simply that of record keeper.  He was that, as described in one part of the testimony that's been referred to as the trial of the Grabiec case, but that was not the limit of his participation.  And it is my finding that he was also coordinating the efforts of others and the reports of others and putting that together and advising Yerardi about managerial decisions in the operation of this ongoing enterprise over a substantial length of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those findings, in my view, under an appropriate interpretation of the guidelines support a three-point upward adjustment in the calculation of the total offense level so as to raise that total offense level by three points from the way it was calculated by the presentence investigation report and thus move it up to 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the written judgment summarizing the court's findings and decisions regarding the adjustments and departures requested by the government and Cali does not cite management or supervision of individuals as part of Cali's offense.

Furthermore, the need to resolve the conflict in the district court's 3B1.1 decisions by remanding for clarification or to decide whether the record could even support a finding that Cali managed individuals--an issue about which we have considerable doubt--is obviated by the existence of the secondary holding.  It provides an alternative basis for upholding the fifteen-month sentence Cali received.  We do not decide whether a sufficient factual predicate existed to find that the defendant was a manager of other individuals within the meaning of section 3B1.1.  We proceed, instead, to a discussion of the district court's upward departure holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(b) Role in the Offense Departures</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to its upward adjustment holding, the district court held that the asset management Cali conducted during his involvement in Yerardi's gambling business justified a three-level upward departure, under section 3B1.1(b), to impose a sentence corresponding to a total adjusted offense level of thirteen.  The district court found that Cali operated as more than a bookie or mere record keeper and that the threats of violence which marked Yerardi's gambling and loansharking businesses took Cali's conduct outside the heartland of other section 3B1.1(b) offenses.  Cali assigns error.  He argues, first, that the facts of his case do not support a conclusion that he managed assets and, second, that the record, to the extent it reflects asset management at all, does not suggest that his conduct falls outside the heartland of section 3B1.1(b) offenses.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 947.

See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2044.  \"That a departure decision, in an occasional case, may call for a legal determination does not mean, as a consequence, that parts of the review must be labeled de novo while other parts are labeled an abuse of discretion.\"  Id. at --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2044-45.   Thus, the analysis we must conduct in evaluating departure decisions entails reviewing, under an abuse of discretion standard, the district court's determination that the case presents features that make it sufficiently unusual to take it out of the applicable guideline's heartland.  See id. at --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046.   Abuse of discretion review necessarily \"includes review to determine that the [district court's exercise of] discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\"  Id. at --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2045.   Additionally, our analysis, like our pre-Koon review process, requires us to assess the reasonableness of the departure taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions to depart from sentences prescribed by the Guidelines are generally only permitted in cases in which unusual or atypical circumstances justify individualizing a sentence more than the relatively narrow strictures that the Guidelines permit.  United States v. Calderon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562320\"><a href=\"/opinion/562320/united-states-v-nelson-valencia-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Koon, --- U.S. at ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2043, 2051 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b).  In general, departure decisions fall into one of three categories:  forbidden, discouraged, and encouraged.  Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 560.  \"Forbidden departures are those based, inter alia, on race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, or socioeconomic status.\"  Id.; Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948-49;  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5H1.10, 5H1.12.  \"The Sentencing Commission ... has expressly precluded departure on these grounds, even where they make a case atypical or extraordinary.\"  Grandmaison, 77 F.3d at 560.  \"Discouraged departures involve factors which were considered by the Commission--such as age, family ties and responsibilities, employment record, good works, or physical condition--but which present themselves to an extraordinary degree in a particular case.\"  Id.  \"Encouraged departures, in contrast, involve considerations not previously taken into account by the Commission.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The departure analysis \"varies depending on the category in which the feature [or activity] justifying departure falls.\"  United States v. DeMasi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195694\"><a href=\"/opinion/195694/united-states-v-de-masi/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, 1323 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied sub nom.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></span> (1995).  Cali maintains that the starting point for our review of the district court's departure decision must be an inquiry into whether his conduct was more egregious than that of other section 3B1.1(b) offenders.  The government disputes this and contends that such an investigation is unnecessary in the role-in-the-offense context because section 3B1.1(b) departures are encouraged.  We agree with the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.1 departures are clearly encouraged by the Commission.  The language of Application Note 2--that \"upward departure may be warranted ... in the case of a defendant who ... exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization\"--endorses management of assets as a permissible basis for upward departure.  This endorsement and our determination that section 3B1.1 does not incorporate asset management as a sentencing factor lead us to the conclusion that the district court was authorized to depart without first engaging in the analysis Cali urges.  Where the Commission has explicitly identified certain activities or conduct as a factor not adequately taken into account in its formulation of a particular guideline and that guideline does not incorporate that factor at all, we can be confident that the departure undertaken was not unreasonable.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2043;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948;  see also United States v. Diaz-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196470\"><a href=\"/opinion/196470/united-states-v-diaz-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span>, 952-53 (1st Cir.1995)(reviewing encouraged U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1 upward departure);  Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 406 (reviewing encouraged U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 downward departure);  United States v. Quinones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.1994)(reviewing encouraged U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.8 upward departure).  Resort to the \"heartland\" analysis generally reserved for discouraged departures is, therefore, unnecessary.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2043;  McFarlane, 64 F.3d at 1240;  United States v. Mendez-Colon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195155\"><a href=\"/opinion/195155/united-states-v-mendez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 190-91 (1st Cir.1994)(Breyer, C.J.);   compare DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1323 (describing process for comparing cases involving discouraged reasons for departure).  Management of a large-scale criminal enterprise's assets is conduct which, under Application Note 2 to section 3B1.1 and hence as a matter of law, places a defendant outside the heartland of offenses by individuals who participate in large-scale criminal enterprises but who do not manage assets.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 948.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the relevant circumstances of Cali's case constitute an encouraged basis for departure under the Guidelines, we proceed to the next stage in our analysis.  Cali asserts that the district court erroneously found that he managed gambling assets.  While Cali paints a persuasive picture of his role in Yerardi's gambling business, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.  \"[W]hen there are two plausible views of the record, the sentencing court's adoption of one such view cannot be clearly erroneous.\"  St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 706;  see also Munoz, 36 F.3d at 1240;  United States v. Brewster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194846\"><a href=\"/opinion/194846/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1993);  Savoie, 985 F.2d at 616.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented evidence which was a solid basis for the district court to conclude that Cali managed assets and was more than a mere \"bookie\" or \"telephone operator\" in Yerardi's business.  The record reveals that the information Cali recorded and analyzed was an asset or possession of great value to the gambling enterprise.  See Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 131 (1994).  It also shows that Cali fielded calls from and placed bets for various agents, as a bookie might do, but also directly reviewed betting and makeup figures with the individual who presided over the gambling enterprise, Yerardi, and participated in \"charting\"--i.e., assessing the organization's risk of loss.  Compare Parmelee, 42 F.3d at 395 (control of plane inherent in role of pilot for criminal enterprise).  Though Yerardi seems to have made the decisions about when and whom to chart, the record suggests that the responsibility for keeping the organization's records, calculating the business's risk of loss on particular events, and assisting Yerardi in assessing the organization's overall financial health primarily rested with Cali and his counterpart, DeAngelis.  The transcripts of calls intercepted by the State Police, in particular, suggest that Cali exercised discretion or control over the organization's information and that Yerardi heavily relied on Cali's expertise and special knowledge of the business's operations.  We, therefore, do not think the district court's conclusion that Cali managed assets or enjoyed executive status within the gambling enterprise implausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think the extent of the departure taken by the district court unreasonable.  Quinones, 26 F.3d at 219.   The three-level upward departure taken from the sentence tabulated under the Guidelines represents a three-month increase in the maximum sentence Cali could have received and an even smaller increase in the actual time Cali will serve in prison.  Because of this, the reasons given for the upward departure, and the deference due the special feel the district court developed for this case in presiding over the legal proceedings for Cali's co-conspirators, we find that the upward departure the district court imposed was reasonable.  See Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 409 (judgment call for decision regarding extent of departure is ultimately the district court's).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, Cali's fifteen-month sentence of imprisonment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
