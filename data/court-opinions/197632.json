Specifically, Blodgett disputes  that his\r\n\nprior criminal record  reflects the three  predicate offenses\r\n\nnecessary  for an  ACCA enhancement.   Finding  no  error, we\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n               Background and Prior Proceedings\r                           Background and Prior Proceedings\r\n\n          On May 9, 1996, police in Old Orchard Beach, Maine,\r\n\narrested  Blodgett after a  high-speed automobile pursuit and\r\n\nsubsequent  foot chase.   The  police  found Blodgett  hiding\r\n\nunder  a  blanket,   holding  a  loaded  and   half-cocked  9\r\n\nmillimeter  handgun.   The government  charged  Blodgett with\r\n\nfour   weapons  related  counts,  two  pertaining  to  the  9\r\n\nmillimeter  handgun and two pertaining  to a 12 gauge shotgun\r\n\nsubsequently  found  in  Blodgett's car.    A  jury convicted\r\n\nBlodgett on  the counts relating to the 9 millimeter handgun.\r\n\n          The  district court  imposed a 293  month sentence.\r\n\nThe court based  its sentence in part on  its conclusion that\r\n\nBlodgett's  criminal   history  triggered   the  fifteen-year\r\n\nmandatory  minimum sentence provided  in the ACCA.   Although\r\n\nBlodgett had eight  juvenile and  nineteen adult  convictions\r\n\nthat   produced  no  criminal   history  points,   the  court\r\n\ndetermined  that Blodgett  had  five other  convictions which\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nsupplied  the predicate  necessary for  an ACCA  enhancement.\r\n\nBlodgett conceded two  of the five convictions,  but disputed\r\n\nthat  any  of  the  remaining  three,  a  1984  Massachusetts\r\n\nconviction for breaking and entering, a 1983 Maine conviction\r\n\nfor  reckless conduct  with  a dangerous  weapon, and  a 1987\r\n\nMaine  conviction  for  burglary,  should  count  toward  the\r\n\nenhancement.   Blodgett's challenge  to the  district court's\r\n\nACCA enhancement forms the basis of this appeal.\r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r\n\n          \"Whether a  conviction  for a  particular  type  of\r\n\ncrime  qualifies as  a predicate  offense  presents a  purely\r\n\nlegal question, sparking  de novo review.\"   United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWinter,  22  F.3d  15,  18 (1st  Cir.  1994)  (citing  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. DeJesus, 984 F.2d 21,  23 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993)); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1992)).  Our\r                                   \r\n\nde novo review leads us to conclude that at least one  of the\r                   \r\n\nconvictions  Blodgett  challenges,   the  1984  Massachusetts\r\n\nconviction for breaking  and entering, serves as  a predicate\r\n\noffense for purposes  of the ACCA enhancement.   Accordingly,\r\n\nwe affirm.\r\n\n          The  ACCA provides that anyone convicted as a felon\r\n\nin possession  of a firearm  who has three  previous \"violent\r\n\nfelony\" or \"serious drug\" convictions will receive a fifteen-\r\n\nyear mandatory minimum sentence.  18 U.S.C.   924(e)(1).  The\r\n\nACCA defines  \"violent felony\"  as \"any  crime punishable  by\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that reflects any\r\n\nof  several  enumerated  violent  attributes.1   18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(e)(2).   Certain crimes, however, do not  fall within the\r\n\nstatutory definition  of a \"crime  punishable by imprisonment\r\n\nfor  a term  exceeding one  year.\"   Such crimes  include any\r\n\noffense that a  state classifies as  a misdemeanor and  which\r\n\ncarries a maximum penalty of two years or less, see 18 U.S.C.\r                                                               \r\n\n  921(a)(20)(B), and  any offense for which a  person has had\r\n\nhis civil rights restored, unless  that restoration expressly\r\n\nprovides  that the person may not ship, transport, possess or\r\n\nreceive firearms, see 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20).\r                                 \r\n\n          In  1984, Blodgett  was convicted for  breaking and\r\n\nentering  and sentenced  to 18  months in  the state  prison.\r\n\nBlodgett now  claims that the  offense does not  constitute a\r\n\nfelony, and, even if  it does, that he never lost  one of his\r\n\ncivil rights and had the  others restored subsequent to  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Specifically,  a violent felony is a \"crime punishable by\r\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that:\r\n\n               (i) has as an element the  use,\r\n               attempted use or threatened use\r\n               of force against  the person of\r\n               another; or\r\n\n               (ii) is  burglary,  arson,   or\r\n               extortion, involves the  use of\r\n               explosives,     or    otherwise\r\n               involves conduct that  presents\r\n               a  serious  potential  risk  of\r\n               physical injury to another. . .\r\n               . \r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(e)(2).  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nconviction and prior to his  most recent offense.  Neither of\r\n\nBlodgett's arguments is availing.  \r\n\n          Contrary   to   Blodgett's  assertion,   the   1984\r\n\nMassachusetts conviction clearly  falls within the definition\r\n\nof  a \"crime punishable by imprisonment  for a term exceeding\r\n\none year.\"   18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20).  Massachusetts  defines\r\n\n\"felony\" as \"[a] crime punishable by death or imprisonment in\r\n\nthe state  prison. .  . .\"   Mass.  Gen.  Laws ch.  274,    1\r\n\n(noting  that  all  other  crimes  are  misdemeanors).    The\r\n\nbreaking and entering statute that underlies  Blodgett's 1984\r\n\nMassachusetts conviction provides for a maximum punishment of\r\n\ntwenty years  imprisonment.  See  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  266,  \r                                            \r\n\n16.    In  other words,  Massachusetts  classifies Blodgett's\r\n\nconviction as a felony, and, even if it  did not, the maximum\r\n\nsentence Blodgett could have  received removes his conviction\r\n\nfrom the exception of   921(a)(20)(B).   See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nIndelicato, 97 F.3d 627, 628 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996) (considering\r                      \r\n\nthe  maximum  statutorily authorized  punishment  rather than\r\n\nactual sentence for  purposes of 18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20)(B)),\r\n\ncert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1013 (1997).\r                        \r\n\n          Blodgett insists  that even if the  conviction does\r\n\nconstitute a felony, Massachusetts  restored his civil rights\r\n\nwhich precludes the  conviction from counting toward  an ACCA\r\n\nenhancement.  See 18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20).  \"In this circuit,\r                             \r\n\nthe  civil  rights  that  must  be  restored to  trigger  the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nexception are the rights to  vote, hold public office, and to\r\n\nserve on a jury.\"  United  States v. Estrella, 104 F.3d 3,  6\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1997).   We  consider civil  rights  restored for\r\n\npurposes  of   921(a)(20) whether by automatic application of\r\n\nlaw or by  affirmative,  executive act.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCaron, 77 F.3d 1,  4 (1st Cir. 1996)  (en banc).  As  we have\r                 \r\n\nnoted, a convicted  felon in Massachusetts retains  the right\r\n\nto  vote, loses  the  right  to hold  public  office for  the\r\n\nduration of  any sentence, and loses the  right to serve on a\r\n\njury for seven  years after conviction.   See id. at 2.   The\r                                                             \r\n\ngovernment does  not dispute that  Massachusetts has restored\r\n\nBlodgett's core civil rights.\r\n\n          Blodgett, however, is not  home free.   Restoration\r\n\nof civil rights removes the conviction from the realm of ACCA\r\n\npredicate  offenses \"unless  . .  .  such restoration  . .  .\r\n\nexpressly provides that  the person may not  ship, transport,\r\n\npossess, or receive  firearms.\"  18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20).  In\r\n\nUnited States  v. Estrella, 104  F.3d 3, 8 (1st  Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 117 S. Ct. 2494 (1997), we held that the restrictions\r                  \r\n\nMassachusetts  imposes on  a felon's  right  to own  firearms\r\n\ntrigger the \"unless\" clause in   921(a)(20).  Felons desiring\r\n\nto own firearms in Massachusetts must have been released from\r\n\ncustody for  five  years,  and  then must  obtain  a  firearm\r\n\nidentification card.  See id. at 7.  A firearm identification\r                                         \r\n\ncard permits a felon to possess a handgun in his residence or\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nplace of business  and to possess a rifle  anywhere.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nNotably, a  felon may  not possess a  handgun outside  of his\r\n\nresidence or  place of  business, nor sell,  rent or  lease a\r\n\nfirearm to  another person.   See  id.   Estrella, therefore,\r                                                             \r\n\nprecludes Blodgett's argument.  \r\n\n          Blodgett   points   out   that  Estrella determined\r                                                              \r\n\nwhether  such a  Massachusetts conviction  could  serve as  a\r\n\nfelony supporting  a conviction  under the  federal felon  in\r\n\npossession of a  firearm statute.  See 18  U.S.C.   922(g)(1)\r                                                  \r\n\n(providing   criminal  penalties   for  felons   who  possess\r\n\nfirearms).  He  maintains that \"[t]here are  reasons why this\r\n\nCourt  might  choose   to  interpret  Massachusetts   law  as\r\n\npreserving the federal ban on  handgun possession by a felon,\r\n\nand yet not interpret Massachusetts law as allowing  a severe\r\n\nenhancement of defendant's  sentence where defendant's  civil\r\n\nrights  have been  restored.\"   Blodgett  does not  enumerate\r\n\nthese reasons, but generally  seems to argue for a  different\r\n\ninterpretation of Massachusetts law depending on whether  the\r\n\ngovernment  seeks to  use the  conviction  for purposes  of  \r\n\n922(g) or   921(a)(20), and, therefore,   924(e).\r\n\n          In United States  v. Alston, 112  F.3d 32, 37  (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1997), we  rejected the precise argument  Blodgett makes\r\n\nin  this  appeal.   The  defendant  in  Alston challenged the\r                                                          \r\n\ninclusion  of a prior Massachusetts conviction as a predicate\r\n\noffense for ACCA purposes because  his civil rights had  been\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nrestored.   112  F.3d at  37.   We noted  that \"Massachusetts\r\n\nmaterially restricts an ex-felon's right to carry and traffic\r\n\nin firearms regardless of the passage of time,\" id., and that\r                                                               \r\n\nsuch  restrictions  trigger  the  \"unless\"  exception  to    \r\n\n921(a)(20), see id. at 38  (citing Estrella, 104 F.3d  at 8).\r                                                       \r\n\nOn that basis  we affirmed the enhancement of the defendant's\r\n\nsentence  pursuant to  the ACCA.

Estrella, 104  F.3d  3 (1st  Cir.  1997), without  giving\r                        \r\n\nserious  consideration to the difference between Estrella and\r                                                                     \r\n\nthe circumstances attending the present case.  \r\n\n          The defendant  in Estrella appealed  his conviction\r                                                \r\n\nunder the  federal felon-in-possession  statute, 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n922(g)(1),  arguing   that  a   prior  Massachusetts   felony\r\n\nconviction  could not serve  as a predicate  felony under the\r\n\nfederal statute because his civil rights had been restored by\r\n\noperation  of Massachusetts  law.    This  court  held  that,\r\n\nnotwithstanding the retention of a  felon's right to vote and\r\n\nthe restoration  of his rights  to hold public office  and to\r\n\nserve on a  jury, the restrictions Massachusetts imposes on a\r\n\nconvicted  felon's right to own firearms trigger the \"unless\"\r\n\nclause  in  18  U.S.C.     921(a)(20),  which  nullifies  the\r\n\nordinary rule that a civil rights restoration will remove the\r\n\nconviction  from  consideration as  a  predicate offense  for\r\n\npurposes  of the  federal felon-in-possession  statute.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nEstrella, 104 F.3d at 8.   Estrella's holding went no further\r                                               \r\n\nthan the context  of that case:   it merely permitted such  a\r\n\nprior conviction to serve as  a predicate felony to support a\r\n\nfederal  conviction  under the  felon-in-possession  statute.\r\n\nId.  \r               \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          In  the present  case,  the  majority applies  this\r\n\nconclusion  to an  entirely different  context:   to  enhance\r\n\nBlodgett's  sentence  under  the  Armed  Career Criminal  Act\r\n\n(ACCA).   As  the  opinion  notes,  Blodgett  maintains  that\r\n\n\"[t]here are reasons why this Court might choose to interpret\r\n\nMassachusetts  law as preserving  the federal ban  on handgun\r\n\npossession  by a felon,  and yet not  interpret Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw  as allowing a severe enhancement of defendant's sentence\r\n\nwhere defendant's civil rights have been restored.\"  Ante, at\r\n\n7.   Even if Massachusetts'  restrictions on the right  of an\r\n\nindividual, previously  convicted of a  Massachusetts felony,\r\n\nto  own firearms  should have  a bearing  on the  question of\r\n\nwhether to  criminalize federally an  individual's possession\r\n\nof  a firearm,  it is  not at  all clear  that Massachusetts'\r\n\nrestrictions have any effect upon the very different question\r\n\nof whether that  individual's Massachusetts conviction should\r\n\nresult  in an  enhanced sentence  upon conviction of  a later\r\n\nfederal  offense.  Accordingly, before we expand the Estrella\r                                                                         \r\n\nholding  from one  context to  the other,  I think  we should\r\n\ncarefully consider whether such expansion is appropriate, and\r\n\nwe should discuss our reasoning if we decide to go ahead with\r\n\nthe expansion.\r\n\n          I do not  think we did this in  Alston.  The Alston\r                                                                         \r\n\ndecision focused almost exclusively on a completely different\r\n\nissue (whether the prosecution's significant alteration of  a\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ngun  should have precluded  its being received  in evidence).\r\n\nAlston's  expansive  reading  of  Estrella   was  offered  in\r                                                      \r\n\nresponse to  the last of several also-ran  arguments that the\r\n\ncourt dealt with only very  briefly.  We conclusorily applied\r\n\nEstrella, noting simply that: \r                    \r\n\n          In  Estrella,  we   found  these  limited\r                                  \r\n          [Massachusetts] restrictions  trigger the\r\n          above-quoted  'unless'  exception  to the\r\n          provision  relied   upon  by   Alston  as\r\n          restoring his civil rights.   18 U.S.C.  \r\n          921(a)(20).   Estrella was  decided after\r                                            \r\n          Alston's   sentence   and   the  original\r\n          briefing [in  this court], but  his reply\r\n          brief  has no  effective  answer to  that\r\n          decision.\r\n\nAlston,  112 F.3d  at 38.   Thus,  far from  \"reject[ing] the\r                  \r\n\nprecise  argument  Blodgett  makes in  this  appeal,\"  as the\r\n\nmajority  asserts  ante  at 7,  Alston  never  addressed that\r                                                  \r\n\nargument.  The court in  Alston did not even acknowledge that\r                                           \r\n\nit  was applying  the  Estrella  conclusion  to  a  different\r                                           \r\n\ncontext  -- which  is Blodgett's argument  here --  much less\r\n\nprovide any  reasoning for  such an expansion.   Nor  did the\r\n\ndefendant  in Alston brief  the question of  whether Estrella\r                                                                         \r\n\nshould be applied in the sentence enhancement context.\r\n\n          In the present  case, in contrast, as  the majority\r\n\nacknowledges, Blodgett  does at  least raise  the issue  that\r\n\nEstrella on its face does not address the present context.  I\r                    \r\n\ndo not  think we  should assert that  Estrella's holding  has\r                                                          \r\n\nbeen significantly enlarged to  the sentencing context merely\r\n\nby  referring   to  Alston's   conclusion  (without   further\r                                      \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nanalysis)  and stating that we will not \"deviate from Alston\"\r                                                                        \r\n\nhere.  If we  are going to enshrine this expansion into solid\r\n\nprecedent, we should  discuss its consistency with  the plain\r\n\nlanguage  (first) and the context and legislative history (if\r\n\nthe  plain language is not clear)  of the relevant provisions\r\n\nof the enhanced sentencing statute (ACCA).  \r\n\n          Nevertheless,  as  the   majority  notes,  although\r\n\nBlodgett  does direct our attention to the implicit expansion\r\n\nthat  would  inhere in  our  application of  Estrella  to the\r                                                                 \r\n\nenhanced  sentencing context,  he has  not  provided us  with\r\n\ndeveloped argumentation  explaining why such  expansion would\r\n\nbe  inconsistent   with  legislative   intent  or   otherwise\r\n\nviolative  of law.   It  is  a \"settled  appellate rule  that\r\n\nissues  adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\r\n\nsome effort  at developed argumentation,\" are  deemed waived.\r\n\nContinental Cas.

Blodgett, convicted and sentenced on two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), appeals the district court's decision to enhance his sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  Specifically, Blodgett disputes that his prior criminal record reflects the three predicate offenses necessary for an ACCA enhancement.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 1996, police in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, arrested Blodgett after a high-speed automobile pursuit and subsequent foot chase.  The police found Blodgett hiding under a blanket, holding a loaded and half-cocked 9 millimeter handgun.  The government charged Blodgett with four weapons related counts, two pertaining to the 9 millimeter handgun and two pertaining to a 12 gauge shotgun subsequently found in Blodgett's car.  A jury convicted Blodgett on the counts relating to the 9 millimeter handgun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court imposed a 293 month sentence.  The court based its sentence in part on its conclusion that Blodgett's criminal history triggered the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence provided in the ACCA.  Although Blodgett had eight juvenile and nineteen adult convictions that produced no criminal history points, the court determined that Blodgett had five other convictions which supplied the predicate necessary for an ACCA enhancement.  Blodgett conceded two of the five convictions, but disputed that any of the remaining three, a 1984 Massachusetts conviction for breaking and entering, a 1983 Maine conviction for reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon, and a 1987 Maine conviction for burglary, should count toward the enhancement.  Blodgett's challenge to the district court's ACCA enhancement forms the basis of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Whether a conviction for a particular type of crime qualifies as a predicate offense presents a purely legal question, sparking de novo review.\"  United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1994) (citing United States v. DeJesus, 984 F.2d 21, 23 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993));  see United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1992).  Our de novo review leads us to conclude that at least one of the convictions Blodgett challenges, the 1984 Massachusetts conviction for breaking and entering, serves as a predicate offense for purposes of the ACCA enhancement.  Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ACCA provides that anyone convicted as a felon in possession of a firearm who has three previous \"violent felony\" or \"serious drug\" convictions will receive a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).  The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that reflects any of several enumerated violent attributes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2).  Certain crimes, however, do not fall within the statutory definition of a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"   Such crimes include any offense that a state classifies as a misdemeanor and which carries a maximum penalty of two years or less, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20)(B), and any offense for which a person has had his civil rights restored, unless that restoration expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess or receive firearms, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Blodgett was convicted for breaking and entering and sentenced to 18 months in the state prison.  Blodgett now claims that the offense does not constitute a felony, and, even if it does, that he never lost one of his civil rights and had the others restored subsequent to that conviction and prior to his most recent offense.  Neither of Blodgett's arguments is availing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Blodgett's assertion, the 1984 Massachusetts conviction clearly falls within the definition of a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  Massachusetts defines \"felony\" as \"[a] crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison....\"  Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 274, &#167; 1 (noting that all other crimes are misdemeanors).  The breaking and entering statute that underlies Blodgett's 1984 Massachusetts conviction provides for a maximum punishment of twenty years imprisonment.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 16.  In other words, Massachusetts classifies Blodgett's conviction as a felony, and, even if it did not, the maximum sentence Blodgett could have received removes his conviction from the exception of &#167; 921(a)(20)(B).  See United States v. Indelicato, 97 F.3d 627, 628 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996) (considering the maximum statutorily authorized punishment rather than actual sentence for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20)(B)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1013, 136 L.Ed.2d 890 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blodgett insists that even if the conviction does constitute a felony, Massachusetts restored his civil rights which precludes the conviction from counting toward an ACCA enhancement.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  \"In this circuit, the civil rights that must be restored to trigger the exception are the rights to vote, hold public office, and to serve on a jury.\"  United States v. Estrella, 104 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1997).  We consider civil rights restored for purposes of &#167; 921(a)(20) whether by automatic application of law or by affirmative, executive act.  See United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1996) (en banc).  As we have noted, a convicted felon in Massachusetts retains the right to vote, loses the right to hold public office for the duration of any sentence, and loses the right to serve on a jury for seven years after conviction.  See id. at 2. The government does not dispute that Massachusetts has restored Blodgett's core civil rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blodgett, however, is not home free.  Restoration of civil rights removes the conviction from the realm of ACCA predicate offenses \"unless ... such restoration ... expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  In United States v. Estrella, 104 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2494, 138 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997), we held that the restrictions Massachusetts imposes on a felon's right to own firearms trigger the \"unless\" clause in &#167; 921(a)(20).  Felons desiring to own firearms in Massachusetts must have been released from custody for five years, and then must obtain a firearm identification card.  See id. at 7. A firearm identification card permits a felon to possess a handgun in his residence or place of business and to possess a rifle anywhere.  See id.   Notably, a felon may not possess a handgun outside of his residence or place of business, nor sell, rent or lease a firearm to another person.  See id.  Estrella, therefore, precludes Blodgett's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blodgett points out that Estrella determined whether such a Massachusetts conviction could serve as a felony supporting a conviction under the federal felon in possession of a firearm statute.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (providing criminal penalties for felons who possess firearms).  He maintains that \"[t]here are reasons why this Court might choose to interpret Massachusetts law as preserving the federal ban on handgun possession by a felon, and yet not interpret Massachusetts law as allowing a severe enhancement of defendant's sentence where defendant's civil rights have been restored.\"   Blodgett does not enumerate these reasons, but generally seems to argue for a different interpretation of Massachusetts law depending on whether the government seeks to use the conviction for purposes of &#167; 922(g) or &#167; 921(a)(20), and, therefore, &#167; 924(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Alston, 112 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir.1997), we rejected the precise argument Blodgett makes in this appeal.  The defendant in Alston challenged the inclusion of a prior Massachusetts conviction as a predicate offense for ACCA purposes because his civil rights had been restored.  112 F.3d at 37.   We noted that \"Massachusetts materially restricts an ex-felon's right to carry and traffic in firearms regardless of the passage of time,\" id., and that such restrictions trigger the \"unless\" exception to &#167; 921(a)(20), see id. at 38 (citing Estrella, 104 F.3d at 8).   On that basis we affirmed the enhancement of the defendant's sentence pursuant to the ACCA.  See id.;   see also United States v. Palazzi, 115 F.3d 906, 908 (11th Cir.1997) (adopting Estrella 's interpretation of Massachusetts law under the \"unless\" clause of &#167; 921(a)(20) and affirming an ACCA enhancement on that basis).  We see no reason to deviate from Alston in this case.

This court held that, notwithstanding the retention of a felon's right to vote and the restoration of his rights to hold public office and to serve on a jury, the restrictions Massachusetts imposes on a convicted felon's right to own firearms trigger the \"unless\" clause in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20), which nullifies the ordinary rule that a civil rights restoration will remove the conviction from consideration as a predicate offense for purposes of the federal felon-in-possession statute.  See Estrella, 104 F.3d at 8.

Even if Massachusetts' restrictions on the right of an individual, previously convicted of a Massachusetts felony, to own firearms should have a bearing on the question of whether to criminalize federally an individual's possession of a firearm, it is not at all clear that Massachusetts' restrictions have any effect upon the very different question of whether that individual's Massachusetts conviction should result in an enhanced sentence upon conviction of a later federal offense.

I do not think we should assert that Estrella 's holding has been significantly enlarged to the sentencing context merely by referring to Alston 's conclusion (without further analysis) and stating that we will not \"deviate from Alston \" here.

Blodgett, convicted and sentenced on two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), appeals the district court's decision to enhance his sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  Specifically, Blodgett disputes that his prior criminal record reflects the three predicate offenses necessary for an ACCA enhancement.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 1996, police in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, arrested Blodgett after a high-speed automobile pursuit and subsequent foot chase.  The police found Blodgett hiding under a blanket, holding a loaded and half-cocked 9 millimeter handgun.  The government charged Blodgett with four weapons related counts, two pertaining to the 9 millimeter handgun and two pertaining to a 12 gauge shotgun subsequently found in Blodgett's car.  A jury convicted Blodgett on the counts relating to the 9 millimeter handgun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court imposed a 293 month sentence.  The court based its sentence in part on its conclusion that Blodgett's criminal history triggered the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence provided in the ACCA.  Although Blodgett had eight juvenile and nineteen adult convictions that produced no criminal history points, the court determined that Blodgett had five other convictions which supplied the predicate necessary for an ACCA enhancement.  Blodgett conceded two of the five convictions, but disputed that any of the remaining three, a 1984 Massachusetts conviction for breaking and entering, a 1983 Maine conviction for reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon, and a 1987 Maine conviction for burglary, should count toward the enhancement.  Blodgett's challenge to the district court's ACCA enhancement forms the basis of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Whether a conviction for a particular type of crime qualifies as a predicate offense presents a purely legal question, sparking de novo review.\"  United States v.

Our de novo review leads us to conclude that at least one of the convictions Blodgett challenges, the 1984 Massachusetts conviction for breaking and entering, serves as a predicate offense for purposes of the ACCA enhancement.  Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ACCA provides that anyone convicted as a felon in possession of a firearm who has three previous \"violent felony\" or \"serious drug\" convictions will receive a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).  The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that reflects any of several enumerated violent attributes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2).  Certain crimes, however, do not fall within the statutory definition of a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"   Such crimes include any offense that a state classifies as a misdemeanor and which carries a maximum penalty of two years or less, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20)(B), and any offense for which a person has had his civil rights restored, unless that restoration expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess or receive firearms, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Blodgett was convicted for breaking and entering and sentenced to 18 months in the state prison.  Blodgett now claims that the offense does not constitute a felony, and, even if it does, that he never lost one of his civil rights and had the others restored subsequent to that conviction and prior to his most recent offense.  Neither of Blodgett's arguments is availing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Blodgett's assertion, the 1984 Massachusetts conviction clearly falls within the definition of a \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  Massachusetts defines \"felony\" as \"[a] crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison....\"  Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 274, &#167; 1 (noting that all other crimes are misdemeanors).  The breaking and entering statute that underlies Blodgett's 1984 Massachusetts conviction provides for a maximum punishment of twenty years imprisonment.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 16.  In other words, Massachusetts classifies Blodgett's conviction as a felony, and, even if it did not, the maximum sentence Blodgett could have received removes his conviction from the exception of &#167; 921(a)(20)(B).  See United States v. Indelicato, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197022\"><a href=\"/opinion/197022/united-states-v-indelicato/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span>, 628 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996) (considering the maximum statutorily authorized punishment rather than actual sentence for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20)(B)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  \"In this circuit, the civil rights that must be restored to trigger the exception are the rights to vote, hold public office, and to serve on a jury.\"  United States v. Estrella, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197153\"><a href=\"/opinion/197153/united-states-v-estrella/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1997).  We consider civil rights restored for purposes of &#167; 921(a)(20) whether by automatic application of law or by affirmative, executive act.  See United States v. Caron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713036\"><a href=\"/opinion/713036/united-states-v-gerald-r-caron/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1996) (en banc).  As we have noted, a convicted felon in Massachusetts retains the right to vote, loses the right to hold public office for the duration of any sentence, and loses the right to serve on a jury for seven years after conviction.  See id. at 2. The government does not dispute that Massachusetts has restored Blodgett's core civil rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blodgett, however, is not home free.  Restoration of civil rights removes the conviction from the realm of ACCA predicate offenses \"unless ... such restoration ... expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  In United States v. Estrella, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197153\"><a href=\"/opinion/197153/united-states-v-estrella/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span> (1997), we held that the restrictions Massachusetts imposes on a felon's right to own firearms trigger the \"unless\" clause in &#167; 921(a)(20).  Felons desiring to own firearms in Massachusetts must have been released from custody for five years, and then must obtain a firearm identification card.  See id. at 7. A firearm identification card permits a felon to possess a handgun in his residence or place of business and to possess a rifle anywhere.  See id.   Notably, a felon may not possess a handgun outside of his residence or place of business, nor sell, rent or lease a firearm to another person.  See id.  Estrella, therefore, precludes Blodgett's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blodgett points out that Estrella determined whether such a Massachusetts conviction could serve as a felony supporting a conviction under the federal felon in possession of a firearm statute.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (providing criminal penalties for felons who possess firearms).  He maintains that \"[t]here are reasons why this Court might choose to interpret Massachusetts law as preserving the federal ban on handgun possession by a felon, and yet not interpret Massachusetts law as allowing a severe enhancement of defendant's sentence where defendant's civil rights have been restored.\"   Blodgett does not enumerate these reasons, but generally seems to argue for a different interpretation of Massachusetts law depending on whether the government seeks to use the conviction for purposes of &#167; 922(g) or &#167; 921(a)(20), and, therefore, &#167; 924(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

The defendant in Alston challenged the inclusion of a prior Massachusetts conviction as a predicate offense for ACCA purposes because his civil rights had been restored.  112 F.3d at 37.   We noted that \"Massachusetts materially restricts an ex-felon's right to carry and traffic in firearms regardless of the passage of time,\" id., and that such restrictions trigger the \"unless\" exception to &#167; 921(a)(20), see id. at 38 (citing Estrella, 104 F.3d at 8).   On that basis we affirmed the enhancement of the defendant's sentence pursuant to the ACCA.  See id.;   see also United States v.

If we are going to enshrine this expansion into solid precedent, we should discuss its consistency with the plain language (first) and the context and legislative history (if the plain language is not clear) of the relevant provisions of the enhanced sentencing statute (ACCA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, as the majority notes, although Blodgett does direct our attention to the implicit expansion that would inhere in our application of Estrella to the enhanced sentencing context, he has not provided us with developed argumentation explaining why such expansion would be inconsistent with legislative intent or otherwise violative of law.  It is a \"settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\" are deemed waived.  Continental Cas. Co. v.
