Pro    se   appellant       Sophia      Martini\n\nappeals a district court order that denied her motion to\n\ncompel the United States Attorney's Office for the District\n\nof Maine to file a motion to reduce her sentence under Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 35(b).           Having thoroughly reviewed the record\n\nand the parties's briefs on appeal, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's order.\n\n              We agree with the district court's conclusion that\n\nthe government could not be compelled to file a Rule 35(b)\n\nmotion    under      the    circumstances       that     are    present       here.\n\nAppellant has not alleged that the government's decision was\n\nbased    on    an   unconstitutional           motive,    nor    that      it    was\n\nunrelated to a legitimate government                     end.        Accordingly,\n\njudicial      review   is    not   available      under    Wade       v.   United\n\nStates,    504      U.S.   181,    185-86      (1992).         And    while     \"the\n\ngovernment must perform in good faith the discretionary\n\nobligations that it undertakes in a plea agreement\",                            see\n\nUnited States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 187 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nthis principle does not entitle appellant to enforce alleged\n\noral promises that contravene her plea agreement, which\n\nmakes no mention of Rule 35(b) motions and which provides\n\nthat all promises will be \"in writing [and] signed by the\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fparties.\"         The government's refusal to file a Rule 35(b)\n\nmotion      is     not    subject         to    judicial      review       under    these\n\ncircumstances.           Cf. United States v. Sandoval, 204 F.3d 283,\n\n286 (1 st Cir. 2000)(holding government's refusal to file\n\n§5K1.1 motion was not subject to judicial review where plea\n\nagreement made no mention of such motions and defendant did\n\nnot allege a Wade violation); Alegria, 192 F.3d at 186\n\n(holding defendant could not reasonably rely on alleged pre-\n\nplea       oral    promise        that         contravened         plea     agreement's\n\nintegration clause).
