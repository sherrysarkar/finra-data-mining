Peters, with whom Andrs Guillemard-Noble and Nachman,\r\nGuillemard &amp; Rebollo were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                  September 11, 1998\r\n                                               SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.  In an effort to attack\r\nthe mounting problem of solid waste disposal, the Puerto Rico\r\nlegislature in 1996 enacted the Tire Handling Act, also known as\r\nLaw 171.  This act establishes a comprehensive scheme for the\r\nhandling and disposal of used tires.  Among other things, it\r\nrequires tire vendors to accept customers' used tires at no extra\r\ncharge for processing or disposal, prohibits the burning of tires\r\nand depositing of tires in landfills except under certain\r\nconditions, regulates the storage and recycling of tires,\r\nestablishes import fees, sets up a fund for handling scrap tires,\r\ncreates incentives for recycling and developing alternative uses\r\nfor scrap tires, and imposes penalties for noncompliance with its\r\nprovisions.  The legislature identified the disposal of tires as a\r\nparticular problem because of the fire hazard they present, the\r\npublic health hazard they create from disease-carrying mosquitoes\r\nbreeding in water that accumulates inside discarded tires and the\r\nlarge amount of space they occupy, diminishing the useful life of\r\nlandfills.\r\n     Used Tire International, Inc. (\"UTI\") is an importer of\r\nused tires into Puerto Rico.  It brought this action for\r\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against appellant Manuel Daz-\r\nSaldaa as Secretary of the Treasury to bar enforcement of certain\r\nprovisions of Law 171.  Those provisions are:  Article 5(B) which\r\nprohibits the import of tires that do not have a minimum tread\r\ndepth of 3/32\"; Article 5(D) which requires tire importers to file\r\na bond in an amount equivalent to the cost of handling and\r\ndisposing of the imported product and provides for execution of the\r\nbond in the event that 10% of a representative sample of a shipment\r\ndoes not qualify; Article 6 which imposes a charge on all imported\r\ntires; Article 17(A)(1) which provides for distributions from a\r\ntire handling fund, created from the charge imposed on importers of\r\ntires, to recyclers, processors and exporters of tires; and Article\r\n19(A) which imposes a $10.00 fine on persons selling or importing\r\ntires that do not have a minimum tread depth of 3/32.\"  Following\r\na hearing on UTI's request for a preliminary injunction at which\r\nboth sides presented testimony, the district court issued an\r\nopinion and order, granting the injunction against enforcement of\r\nArticles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A) and denying it with respect to\r\nArticles 6 and 17(A)(1).  Puerto Rico appealed the order and UTI\r\ncross-appealed.  The parties have stipulated that we may treat\r\nPuerto Rico's appeal as being from a final adjudication of the\r\ninvalidity of Articles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A).  We have jurisdiction\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1292(a)(1).\r\n                 PUERTO RICO'S APPEAL \r\n     The district court concluded that Articles 5(B) and 19(A)\r\nfacially discriminate against interstate commerce by banning the\r\nimportation of a class of tires that may be legally sold and used\r\nin Puerto Rico.  In reaching that conclusion it rejected the\r\nSecretary's argument that Law 171 is non-discriminatory because the\r\n3/32\" requirement applies equally to importers and sellers of used\r\ntires.  The argument was premised on the first sentence of Article\r\n19(A) which states:\r\n       Every person who sells or imports tires\r\n       . . . that do not have a minimum depth of\r\n       3/32\" . . . shall pay a fine of $10.00 per\r\n       tire.\r\n\nThe court rejected this interpretation of the statute as\r\nimplausible on the strength of the second sentence of Article 19(A)\r\nwhich states:\r\n       This provision shall apply to those who\r\n       fail to comply but have not had their bond\r\n       executed, according to what is pointed out\r\n       in Article 5(D) [which requires all tire\r\n       importers to post a bond].\r\n\nIt read that provision as making the penalty applicable only to\r\nthose who have filed bonds, i.e., importers of used tires.  \r\n     We agree with the district court's interpretation.  The\r\nreference to \"those . . . who have not had their bond executed\" and\r\nthe cross-reference to Article 5(D) dealing with importers of used\r\ntires makes it clear that only those sellers of used tires who are\r\nalso importers are the subject of Article 19(A).  Moreover, as UTI\r\npoints out, it would make little sense for the legislature to\r\npenalize sellers of noncomplying used tires taken in trade-in\r\n(i.e., locally-generated used tires) for to do so would simply\r\naccelerate the time when used tires are discarded as scrap and\r\ndumped in a landfill.  On appeal, the Secretary merely reiterates\r\nthat the penalty applies equally to sellers and to importers but\r\nhas offered \"only rhetoric, and not explanation.\"  See Chemical\r\nWaste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U.S. 334, 343 (1992).  We\r\nconclude, therefore, that Article 19(A) discriminates against\r\nsellers of imported used tires because only they and not sellers of\r\nlocally-generated used tires are subjected to the penalty and,\r\nconsequently,  that Article 5(B) discriminates against importers of\r\nused tires because Law 171 singles them out in barring the import\r\nof tires with less than 3/32\" tread depth.\r\nThe district court, having concluded that Articles 5(B)\r\nand 19(A) are invalid, did not reach the bonding requirement under\r\nArticle 5(D).  That article provides that \"[e]very tire importer\r\nshall file . . .  a bond . . . equivalent to the total cost of the\r\nhandling and disposal of the imported product.  Should more than\r\n10% of a representative sample of a shipment of imported tires\r\nfail[] to meet [the 3/32\" standard] . . . the totality of the bond\r\nshall be executed.\"  Plainly the bonding requirement imposes\r\nburdens, costs and risks on importers of used tires not borne by\r\nsellers of locally-generated used tires and thus provides added\r\nsupport for the conclusion that Articles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A)\r\ntogether facially discriminate against interstate commerce.\r\nThe inexorable increase in the volume of solid wastes and\r\nthe health and environmental consequences attendant on their\r\ndisposal present legislatures and courts with vexing problems.  SeePhiladelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 630 (1978) (Rehnquist,\r\nJ., dissenting).  We may assume that Puerto Rico's purpose in\r\nenacting Law 171 was to serve the best interests of all its\r\ncitizens.  But no matter how laudatory its purpose, \"it may not be\r\naccomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming\r\nfrom outside the [Commonwealth] unless there is some reason, apart\r\nfrom their origin, to treat them differently.\"  Id. at 626-27.  In\r\nPhiladelphia, the Supreme Court struck down a New Jersey statute\r\nthat prohibited the importation of waste originating out of state. \r\nThe crucial question, the Court said, was whether the statute was\r\n\"basically a protectionist measure, or whether it can fairly be\r\nviewed as a law directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects\r\nupon interstate commerce that are only incidental.\"  Id. at 624. \r\nTo answer that question, the Court saw no need to resolve the\r\ndispute between the parties whether the purpose was to serve\r\nparochial economic interests or to save the environment for \"the\r\nevil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as\r\nlegislative ends.\"  Id. at 626.  New Jersey's law, it held, fell\r\nwithin the area that the Commerce Clause puts off limits to state\r\nregulation because it \"imposes on out-of-state commercial interests\r\nthe full burden of conserving the State's remaining landfill\r\nspace.\"  Id. at 628.\r\nPuerto Rico's legislation barring the importation of\r\ncertain used tires is essentially indistinguishable from New\r\nJersey's.  It, too, places the burden of conserving its landfill\r\nspace on those engaged in interstate commerce, the importers of\r\nused tires.  And it is essentially indistinguishable from the\r\nAlabama statute imposing an additional disposal fee on wastes\r\ngenerated outside the state, struck down in Chemical Waste.  Seealso Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of\r\nNatural Resources, 504 U.S. 353 (1992) (striking down statute\r\nbarring disposal of solid waste generated in another county);\r\nTrailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera Vzquez, 977 F.2d 1, 10 (1st\r\nCir. 1992).  The costs associated with the required bond and the\r\npenalty upon the sale of noncomplying imported tires, moreover,\r\nresemble a tariff on goods that may be lawfully sold in the state\r\nbecause they are imported from another state, \"[t]he paradigmatic\r\nexample of a law discriminating against interstate commerce.\"  West\r\nLynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 193 (1994).  Because\r\nthe Secretary has failed to come forward with a showing that\r\nArticles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A) advance a legitimate local purpose\r\nthat cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory\r\nalternatives, see New Energy Co. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278\r\n(1988), they cannot withstand scrutiny under the Commerce Clause.\r\n                   UTI'S CROSS-APPEAL\r\nUTI cross-appeals from the district court's denial of\r\ninjunctive relief against enforcement of Articles 6 and 17.  We\r\nreview the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,\r\n102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996).  The appealing party \"bears the\r\nconsiderable burden of demonstrating that the District Court\r\nflouted\" the four-part test for preliminary injunctive relief. \r\nE.E.O.C. v. Astra USA, Inc., 94 F.3d 738, 743 (1st Cir. 1996). \r\nThat test requires plaintiff to show probability of success on the\r\nmerits as well as irreparable injury, the balance of harm tipping\r\nin plaintiff's favor, and absence of adverse effect on the public\r\ninterest.  See, e.g., Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 114 F.3d 330,\r\n331 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nArticle 6 imposes a charge on each imported tire, whether\r\nnew or used, varying with the dimension of the wheel rim.  The\r\nrevenue received from this charge is placed in an Adequate Disposal\r\nTire Handling Fund, created under Article 17, to subsidize the cost\r\nof processing and recycling used tires.  The district court held\r\nthat Article 6 does not discriminate against interstate commerce\r\nbecause the charge is imposed on all tires entering Puerto Rico, no\r\ntires being manufactured in Puerto Rico.  See Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117, 125 (1978).   UTI argues that\r\nthe charge discriminates because it is not imposed on locally-\r\ngenerated tires.  Those tires, of course, pay the charge when they\r\nenter Puerto Rico as new tires.  The district court found that\r\nthose tires nevertheless enjoy an economic advantage because the\r\ncharge is not passed on in the price of locally-generated used\r\ntires.  Whatever the basis for that finding, we find nothing\r\ndiscriminatory in a one-time charge imposed on the importation of\r\nevery tire, new or used.  The only used tires that may enjoy an\r\nadvantage are those that were imported new or used before Law 171\r\nbecame effective (some of which were presumably imported by UTI). \r\nBut their advantage is temporary and is the result, not of\r\ndiscrimination, but, rather, of the inevitable phasing in of the\r\nnew law.  Because we find that Article 6 \"regulates evenhandedly to\r\neffectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on\r\ninterstate commerce are only incidental,\" Pike v. Bruce Church, 397\r\nU.S. 137, 142 (1970), we affirm the district court's ruling denying\r\ninjunctive relief.\r\nArticle 17(A)(1) provides for the distribution out of the\r\nAdequate Disposal Tire Handling Fund of the revenue derived from\r\nthe import charge.  Out of the revenue collected, handlers of tires\r\nto be processed or recycled in Puerto Rico are to receive a maximum\r\nof 91% of the handling and disposal fee and exporters up to 46%. \r\nUTI contends that this provision facially discriminates against\r\ntire exporters.  The district court found, and it is not disputed,\r\nthat UTI is not a scrap tire exporter and thus not hurt by the law. \r\nAccordingly, it lacks standing to attack this article.  See Lujanv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1994).\r\nUTI seeks to avoid its disability by arguing that Article\r\n17 together with Article 6 create a tax-subsidy program similar to\r\nthat found to be invalid in West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512\r\nU.S. 186 (1994).  West Lynn struck down a Massachusetts milk\r\npricing order which imposed an assessment on all milk sold by\r\ndealers in Massachusetts, two-thirds of which came from out of\r\nstate, and then distributed all of it to Massachusetts dairy\r\nfarmers.  Even though the assessment and the subsidy, separately,\r\ncould be lawfully enacted, together they constituted a scheme under\r\nwhich out-of-state producers were required to subsidize competition\r\nby local high cost dairy farmers, neutralizing advantages possessed\r\nby lower cost out-of-state producers.  Id. at 194.  The Puerto Rico\r\nimport charge is distinguishable because it does not subsidize\r\nlocal dealers at the expense of those engaged in interstate\r\ncommerce.\r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\nWe therefore AFFIRM the district court's order respecting\r\ninjunctive relief.\n",

(\"UTI\") is an importer of used tires into Puerto Rico.  It brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant Manuel DazSaldana as Secretary of the Treasury to bar enforcement of certain provisions of Law 171.  Those provisions are:  Article 5(B) which prohibits the import of tires that do not have a minimum tread depth of 3/32\";  Article 5(D) which requires tire importers to file a bond in an amount equivalent to the cost of handling and disposing of the imported product and provides for execution of the bond in the event that 10% of a representative sample of a shipment does not qualify;  Article 6 which imposes a charge on all imported tires;  Article 17(A)(1) which provides for distributions from a tire handling fund, created from the charge imposed on importers of tires, to recyclers, processors and exporters of tires;  and Article 19(A) which imposes a $10.00 fine on persons selling or importing tires that do not have a minimum tread depth of 3/32.\"   Following a hearing on UTI's request for a preliminary injunction at which both sides presented testimony, the district court issued an opinion and order, granting the injunction against enforcement of Articles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A) and denying it with respect to Articles 6 and 17(A)(1).  Puerto Rico appealed the order and UTI cross-appealed.  The parties have stipulated that we may treat Puerto Rico's appeal as being from a final adjudication of the invalidity of Articles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A).

In reaching that conclusion it rejected the Secretary's argument that Law 171 is non-discriminatory because the 3/32\" requirement applies equally to importers and sellers of used tires.  The argument was premised on the first sentence of Article 19(A) which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Every person who sells or imports tires ... that do not have a minimum depth of 3/32\" ... shall pay a fine of $10.00 per tire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected this interpretation of the statute as implausible on the strength of the second sentence of Article 19(A) which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>This provision shall apply to those who fail to comply but have not had their bond executed, according to what is pointed out in Article 5(D) [which requires all tire importers to post a bond].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It read that provision as making the penalty applicable only to those who have filed bonds, i.e., importers of used tires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's interpretation.  The reference to \"those ... who have not had their bond executed\" and the cross-reference to Article 5(D) dealing with importers of used tires makes it clear that only those sellers of used tires who are also importers are the subject of Article 19(A).  Moreover, as UTI points out, it would make little sense for the legislature to penalize sellers of noncomplying used tires taken in trade-in (i.e., locally-generated used tires) for to do so would simply accelerate the time when used tires are discarded as scrap and dumped in a landfill.

We conclude, therefore, that Article 19(A) discriminates against sellers of imported used tires because only they and not sellers of locally-generated used tires are subjected to the penalty and, consequently, that Article 5(B) discriminates against importers of used tires because Law 171 singles them out in barring the import of tires with less than 3/32\" tread depth.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, having concluded that Articles 5(B) and 19(A) are invalid, did not reach the bonding requirement under Article 5(D).

We review the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1996).  The appealing party \"bears the considerable burden of demonstrating that the District Court flouted\" the four-part test for preliminary injunctive relief.  E.E.O.C. v. Astra USA, Inc., 94 F.3d 738, 743 (1st Cir.1996).  That test requires plaintiff to show probability of success on the merits as well as irreparable injury, the balance of harm tipping in plaintiff's favor, and absence of adverse effect on the public interest.  See, e.g., Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 114 F.3d 330, 331 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article 6 imposes a charge on each imported tire, whether new or used, varying with the dimension of the wheel rim.  The revenue received from this charge is placed in an Adequate Disposal Tire Handling Fund, created under Article 17, to subsidize the cost of processing and recycling used tires.  The district court held that Article 6 does not discriminate against interstate commerce because the charge is imposed on all tires entering Puerto Rico, no tires being manufactured in Puerto Rico.  See Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117, 125, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978).  UTI argues that the charge discriminates because it is not imposed on locally-generated tires.  Those tires, of course, pay the charge when they enter Puerto Rico as new tires.  The district court found that those tires nevertheless enjoy an economic advantage because the charge is not passed on in the price of locally-generated used tires.  Whatever the basis for that finding, we find nothing discriminatory in a one-time charge imposed on the importation of every tire, new or used.  The only used tires that may enjoy an advantage are those that were imported new or used before Law 171 became effective (some of which were presumably imported by UTI).  But their advantage is temporary and is the result, not of discrimination, but, rather, of the inevitable phasing in of the new law.  Because we find that Article 6 \"regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,\" Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970), we affirm the district court's ruling denying injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article 17(A)(1) provides for the distribution out of the Adequate Disposal Tire Handling Fund of the revenue derived from the import charge.  Out of the revenue collected, handlers of tires to be processed or recycled in Puerto Rico are to receive a maximum of 91% of the handling and disposal fee and exporters up to 46%.  UTI contends that this provision facially discriminates against tire exporters.  The district court found, and it is not disputed, that UTI is not a scrap tire exporter and thus not hurt by the law.  Accordingly, it lacks standing to attack this article.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UTI seeks to avoid its disability by arguing that Article 17 together with Article 6 create a tax-subsidy program similar to that found to be invalid in West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 114 S.Ct. 2205, 129 L.Ed.2d 157 (1994).  West Lynn struck down a Massachusetts milk pricing order which imposed an assessment on all milk sold by dealers in Massachusetts, two-thirds of which came from out of state, and then distributed all of it to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  Even though the assessment and the subsidy, separately, could be lawfully enacted, together they constituted a scheme under which out-of-state producers were required to subsidize competition by local high cost dairy farmers, neutralizing advantages possessed by lower cost out-of-state producers.  Id. at 194, 114 S.Ct. 2205.   The Puerto Rico import charge is distinguishable because it does not subsidize local dealers at the expense of those engaged in interstate commerce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore AFFIRM the district court's order respecting injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because no new tires are manufactured in Puerto Rico, all new tires are imported along with used tires.

This act establishes a comprehensive scheme for the handling and disposal of used tires.  Among other things, it requires tire vendors to accept customers' used tires at no extra charge for processing or disposal, prohibits the burning of tires and depositing of tires in landfills except under certain conditions, regulates the storage and recycling of tires, establishes import fees, sets up a fund for handling scrap tires, creates incentives for recycling and developing alternative uses for scrap tires, and imposes penalties for noncompliance with its provisions.  The legislature identified the disposal of tires as a particular problem because of the fire hazard they present, the public health hazard they create from disease-carrying mosquitoes breeding in water that accumulates inside discarded tires and the large amount of space they occupy, diminishing the useful life of landfills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Used Tire International, Inc.  (\"UTI\") is an importer of used tires into Puerto Rico.  It brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant Manuel DazSaldana as Secretary of the Treasury to bar enforcement of certain provisions of Law 171.  Those provisions are:  Article 5(B) which prohibits the import of tires that do not have a minimum tread depth of 3/32\";  Article 5(D) which requires tire importers to file a bond in an amount equivalent to the cost of handling and disposing of the imported product and provides for execution of the bond in the event that 10% of a representative sample of a shipment does not qualify;  Article 6 which imposes a charge on all imported tires;  Article 17(A)(1) which provides for distributions from a tire handling fund, created from the charge imposed on importers of tires, to recyclers, processors and exporters of tires;  and Article 19(A) which imposes a $10.00 fine on persons selling or importing tires that do not have a minimum tread depth of 3/32.\"   Following a hearing on UTI's request for a preliminary injunction at which both sides presented testimony, the district court issued an opinion and order, granting the injunction against enforcement of Articles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A) and denying it with respect to Articles 6 and 17(A)(1).  Puerto Rico appealed the order and UTI cross-appealed.  The parties have stipulated that we may treat Puerto Rico's appeal as being from a final adjudication of the invalidity of Articles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A).  We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1292(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>PUERTO RICO'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Articles 5(B) and 19(A) facially discriminate against interstate commerce by banning the importation of a class of tires that may be legally sold and used in Puerto Rico.  In reaching that conclusion it rejected the Secretary's argument that Law 171 is non-discriminatory because the 3/32\" requirement applies equally to importers and sellers of used tires.  The argument was premised on the first sentence of Article 19(A) which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Every person who sells or imports tires ... that do not have a minimum depth of 3/32\" ... shall pay a fine of $10.00 per tire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected this interpretation of the statute as implausible on the strength of the second sentence of Article 19(A) which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>This provision shall apply to those who fail to comply but have not had their bond executed, according to what is pointed out in Article 5(D) [which requires all tire importers to post a bond].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It read that provision as making the penalty applicable only to those who have filed bonds, i.e., importers of used tires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's interpretation.  The reference to \"those ... who have not had their bond executed\" and the cross-reference to Article 5(D) dealing with importers of used tires makes it clear that only those sellers of used tires who are also importers are the subject of Article 19(A).  Moreover, as UTI points out, it would make little sense for the legislature to penalize sellers of noncomplying used tires taken in trade-in (i.e., locally-generated used tires) for to do so would simply accelerate the time when used tires are discarded as scrap and dumped in a landfill.  On appeal, the Secretary merely reiterates that the penalty applies equally to sellers and to importers but has offered \"only rhetoric, and not explanation.\"   See Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112740\"><a href=\"/opinion/112740/chemical-waste-management-inc-v-hunt/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span>, 343, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112740\"><a href=\"/opinion/112740/chemical-waste-management-inc-v-hunt/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span> (1992).  We conclude, therefore, that Article 19(A) discriminates against sellers of imported used tires because only they and not sellers of locally-generated used tires are subjected to the penalty and, consequently, that Article 5(B) discriminates against importers of used tires because Law 171 singles them out in barring the import of tires with less than 3/32\" tread depth.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, having concluded that Articles 5(B) and 19(A) are invalid, did not reach the bonding requirement under Article 5(D).  That article provides that \"[e]very tire importer shall file ... a bond ... equivalent to the total cost of the handling and disposal of the imported product.  Should more than 10% of a representative sample of a shipment of imported tires fail[ ] to meet [the 3/32\" standard] ... the totality of the bond shall be executed.\"   Plainly the bonding requirement imposes burdens, costs and risks on importers of used tires not borne by sellers of locally-generated used tires and thus provides added support for the conclusion that Articles 5(B), 5(D) and 19(A) together facially discriminate against interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inexorable increase in the volume of solid wastes and the health and environmental consequences attendant on their disposal present legislatures and courts with vexing problems.

The revenue received from this charge is placed in an Adequate Disposal Tire Handling Fund, created under Article 17, to subsidize the cost of processing and recycling used tires.  The district court held that Article 6 does not discriminate against interstate commerce because the charge is imposed on all tires entering Puerto Rico, no tires being manufactured in Puerto Rico.  See Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109896\"><a href=\"/opinion/109896/exxon-corp-v-governor-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 125, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109896\"><a href=\"/opinion/109896/exxon-corp-v-governor-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Those tires, of course, pay the charge when they enter Puerto Rico as new tires.  The district court found that those tires nevertheless enjoy an economic advantage because the charge is not passed on in the price of locally-generated used tires.  Whatever the basis for that finding, we find nothing discriminatory in a one-time charge imposed on the importation of every tire, new or used.  The only used tires that may enjoy an advantage are those that were imported new or used before Law 171 became effective (some of which were presumably imported by UTI).  But their advantage is temporary and is the result, not of discrimination, but, rather, of the inevitable phasing in of the new law.  Because we find that Article 6 \"regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,\" Pike v.

Out of the revenue collected, handlers of tires to be processed or recycled in Puerto Rico are to receive a maximum of 91% of the handling and disposal fee and exporters up to 46%.  UTI contends that this provision facially discriminates against tire exporters.  The district court found, and it is not disputed, that UTI is not a scrap tire exporter and thus not hurt by the law.  Accordingly, it lacks standing to attack this article.  See Lujan v.

West Lynn struck down a Massachusetts milk pricing order which imposed an assessment on all milk sold by dealers in Massachusetts, two-thirds of which came from out of state, and then distributed all of it to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  Even though the assessment and the subsidy, separately, could be lawfully enacted, together they constituted a scheme under which out-of-state producers were required to subsidize competition by local high cost dairy farmers, neutralizing advantages possessed by lower cost out-of-state producers.
