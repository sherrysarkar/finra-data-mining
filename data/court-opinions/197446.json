First, they contend that  they were\r\n\nimproperly precluded from  undertaking jurisdictional  discovery.\r\n\nSecond,  they assert that this  initial error was compounded when\r\n\nthe district  court subsequently dismissed their  action for want\r\n\nof jurisdiction over  the corporate person  of defendant-appellee\r\n\nFlexel International, Ltd. (Flexel).1   Discerning no  reversible\r\n\nerror, we affirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The Sunview Condominium  Complex is located amidst  the\r\n\nserene  pastoral beauty of Derry, New Hampshire.  On December 17,\r\n\n1993,  that   tranquility  went   up  in  smoke,   literally  and\r\n\nfiguratively, when a conflagration erupted at the complex.  Those\r\n\nflames,  in turn,  ignited the  controversy which  underlies this\r\n\nappeal.   Alleging  that radiant  heating panels  manufactured by\r\n\nFlexel's  predecessor in interest, Thermaflex International, Ltd.\r\n\n(Thermaflex),  had  caused  the  blaze, the  Sunview  Condominium\r\n\nAssociation  and its  management  company, Evergreen  Management,\r\n\nInc.  (collectively, Sunview),  brought  this  product  liability\r\n\nclass action to recover damages.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  plaintiffs  originally  sued  both  Flexel and  Aztech\r\nInternational,  Ltd. (Aztech).  Aztech  is now in bankruptcy, and\r\nthe  district court  certified  its order  dismissing the  action\r\nagainst Flexel as  a final judgment under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 54(b).\r\nThus, we treat the appeal as if Flexel were the sole defendant.\r\n\n     2Sunview alleges that Thermaflex (the actual manufacturer of\r\nthe heating panels) transferred its assets to Flexel in mid-1993.\r\nFor the purpose of resolving the jurisdictional issue,  the lower\r\ncourt assumed  arguendo that  Flexel, a Scottish  corporation, is\r                                 \r\nthe  successor in interest to  Thermaflex, an English  firm.  We,\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          The  relevant  chronology  is   as  follows.    Sunview\r\n\ncommenced  its suit  in August  1995.   In February  1996, Flexel\r\n\nmoved  to dismiss  for  want of  personal jurisdiction.   Without\r\n\nhaving  undertaken any  other discovery,  Sunview sought  to take\r\n\ndepositions of Flexel officials in Scotland.   When Flexel turned\r\n\na  cold shoulder, Sunview moved to  compel it to cooperate in the\r\n\ntaking  of the  desired depositions.   Magistrate  Judge Muirhead\r\n\ndenied  Sunview's motion.   See  Sunview  Condo. Ass'n  v. Aztech\r                                                                           \r\n\nInt'l, Ltd., Civ.  No. 95-418-B, slip  op. at 2-6 (D.N.H.  May 1,\r                     \r\n\n1996).\r\n\n          Sunview did not lodge  an objection to the magistrate's\r\n\nruling.  On May 28, 1996, it filed an opposition to the dismissal\r\n\nmotion.  On September  3, the district court, finding  an absence\r\n\nof  minimum contacts, granted the motion to dismiss.  This appeal\r\n\nensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          Although   Sunview's   two   claims   of    error   are\r\n\ninterconnected,  a separate  set of  legal principles  applies in\r\n\neach   instance.     Consequently,  we   treat  the   two  claims\r\n\nsequentially.\r\n\n             A.  Denial of Jurisdictional Discovery.\r                       A.  Denial of Jurisdictional Discovery.\r                                                             \r\n\n          Sunview  argues  heatedly  that  it  should  have  been\r\n\npermitted   to  engage   in  jurisdictional   discovery.     This\r\n\nasseveration has  some superficial appeal.  After all, a diligent\r\n\nplaintiff who sues an out-of-state corporation  and who makes out\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ntoo, proceed on that assumption.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\na colorable case  for the existence  of in personam  jurisdiction\r                                                             \r\n\nmay  well be entitled to a modicum of jurisdictional discovery if\r\n\nthe  corporation  interposes  a  jurisdictional  defense.3    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWhittaker Corp.  v. United  Aircraft Corp.,  482 F.2d 1079,  1086\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1973); Surpitski v. Hughes-Keenan Corp.,  362 F.2d 254,\r                                                           \r\n\n255-56 (1st Cir. 1966) (per curiam).  But that entitlement is not\r\n\nabsolute; in all  events, it  presupposes that  the plaintiff  is\r\n\nreasonably  attentive to the preservation of its rights.  That is\r\n\nnot the situation here.\r\n\n          When   Sunview  could  not  convince  Magistrate  Judge\r\n\nMuirhead  to approve the depositions  that it wished  to take, it\r\n\ndropped  the matter.  Specifically,  it eschewed the  filing of a\r\n\ntimely objection to  the magistrate's order denying its motion to\r\n\ncompel discovery.    This omission  is fatal  to Sunview's  first\r\n\nassignment of error.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          Since  the  motion  to   compel  discovery  involved  a\r\n\nnondispositive matter, the magistrate's order  was effective when\r\n\nmade, and it was therefore immediately appealable to the district\r\n\ncourt.  See 28 U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(A).  To receive  such review, a\r                     \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3This rule  has its limitations.   See,  e.g., Compagnie  De\r                                                                           \r\nBauxites  De Guinee v. L'Union Atlantique S.A., 723 F.2d 357, 362\r                                                        \r\n(3d Cir. 1983)  (indicating that discovery  may be disallowed  if\r\nthe assertion of jurisdiction appears frivolous).  Moreover, even\r\nwhen the rule applies, the plaintiff is  not necessarily entitled\r\nto take  depositions.   Here,  Sunview never  attempted to  learn\r\njurisdictional  facts  through  interrogatories  or  demands  for\r\ndocument production, see Fed. R.  Civ. P. 33, 34, and we  have no\r                                  \r\nway to tell either how effective these less intrusive devices may\r\nhave been or to  what extent Flexel would have  sought protection\r\nfrom them (and if so, whether the magistrate would have permitted\r\ntheir use).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nparty must file objections within ten days from service of a copy\r\n\nof the order.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).  Unless an objection is\r                            \r\n\nfiled within this window of opportunity, a magistrate's  order on\r\n\na nondispositive matter, such as a self-operating order granting,\r\n\ndenying,  or  limiting  pretrial  discovery,  is  not  thereafter\r\n\nreviewable on  appeal.  See  Pagano v. Frank,  983 F.2d  343, 346\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993); see also  Keating v. Secretary of HHS,  848 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n271, 275 (1st Cir.  1988) (per curiam) (explicating same  rule in\r\n\nrespect  to a  party's failure  to file  timeous objections  to a\r\n\nmagistrate's  recommended disposition  of a  dispositive motion).\r\n\nThe Civil Rules are quite explicit on this point:\r\n\n          Within 10 days after being served with a copy\r\n          of the magistrate judge's  order, a party may\r\n          serve and  file objections  to  the order;  a\r\n          party may not  thereafter assign  as error  a\r\n          defect in  the  magistrate judge's  order  to\r\n          which objection was not timely made.\r\n\nFed.  R. Civ.  P.  72(a);  see  also  28  U.S.C.     636(b)(1)(A)\r                                              \r\n\n(empowering  the district  court  to reconsider  and set  aside a\r\n\nmagistrate's  order on a nondispositive  matter when the order is\r\n\nclearly erroneous or contrary to law).\r\n\n          This  court has  applied  the plain  directive of  Rule\r\n\n72(a) straightforwardly and  in accordance with  its tenor.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPagano,  983 F.2d at 346;  Unauthorized Practice of  Law Comm. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGordon, 979 F.2d 11, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam); see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v. Ecker,  923  F.2d 7,  9  (1st Cir.  1991)  (per\r                                 \r\n\ncuriam) (citing  28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1)(A)).   These  cases stand\r\n\nunambiguously  for  the proposition  that,  in  order to  receive\r\n\nreview  of a magistrate's order  on a nondispositive  matter in a\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ncourt of  appeals, the  aggrieved  party first  must have  sought\r\n\ndistrict court review by timely filing an objection to the order.\r\n\n          The instant  case presents no occasion  for a departure\r\n\nfrom this salutary  proposition.  Because Sunview never sought to\r\n\nhave the district court review the magistrate's ruling, the issue\r\n\nof jurisdictional discovery is  by the boards and Sunview  cannot\r\n\nresurrect it in this venue.\r\n\n             B.  Dismissal for Want of Jurisdiction.\r                       B.  Dismissal for Want of Jurisdiction.\r                                                             \r\n\n          Sunview argued below, as it does here, that Thermaflex,\r\n\nFlexel's predecessor in interest,  see supra note 2, purposefully\r                                                      \r\n\navailed  itself  of  the  privilege  of  doing  business  in  New\r\n\nHampshire,  and therefore  subjected itself  (and Flexel,  as its\r\n\nsuccessor)  to  suits in  New Hampshire  arising  out of  its New\r\n\nHampshire-directed activities.    Judge Barbadoro  rejected  this\r\n\nthesis, holding, after an  exhaustive review of the record,  that\r\n\nSunview  had pointed  to  \"insufficient  contact[s] to  establish\r\n\nThermaflex's  purposeful availment of New Hampshire as a place to\r\n\ndo business.\"  Sunview  Condo.

Sunview\r\n\nassigns error to this order.4  We see none.\r\n\n          To wax longiloquent would serve no useful purpose.   We\r\n\nhave  stated before, and today reaffirm, that \"when a lower court\r\n\nproduces  a comprehensive,  well-reasoned decision,  an appellate\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Because Sunview  never  raised the  discovery issue  before\r\nJudge Barbadoro, see supra Part II(A), we pay no heed to its vain\r                                    \r\nattempt to attack  the judge's  order on the  basis of  curtailed\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ncourt should refrain from writing at length to no other end  than\r\n\nto  hear its  own words  resonate.\"   Lawton v.

On December 17, 1993, that tranquility went up in smoke, literally and figuratively, when a conflagration erupted at the complex.  Those flames, in turn, ignited the controversy which underlies this appeal.  Alleging that radiant heating panels manufactured by Flexel's predecessor in interest, Thermaflex International, Ltd.  (Thermaflex), had caused the blaze, the Sunview Condominium Association and its management company, Evergreen Management, Inc.

Sunview commenced its suit in August 1995.  In February 1996, Flexel moved to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.  Without having undertaken any other discovery, Sunview sought to take depositions of Flexel officials in Scotland.  When Flexel turned a cold shoulder, Sunview moved to compel it to cooperate in the taking of the desired depositions. Magistrate Judge Muirhead denied Sunview's motion.  See Sunview Condo.  Ass'n v. Aztech Int'l, Ltd., Civ. No. 95-418-B, slip op. at 2-6 (D.N.H.

This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Sunview's two claims of error are interconnected, a separate set of legal principles applies in each instance.

Denial of Jurisdictional Discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunview argues heatedly that it should have been permitted to engage in jurisdictional discovery.  This asseveration has some superficial appeal.  After all, a diligent plaintiff who sues an out-of-state corporation and who makes out a colorable case for the existence of in personam jurisdiction may well be entitled to a modicum of jurisdictional discovery if the corporation interposes a jurisdictional defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Whittaker Corp. v. United Aircraft Corp., 482 F.2d 1079, 1086 (1st Cir.1973);  Surpitski v. Hughes-Keenan Corp., 362 F.2d 254, 255-56 (1st Cir.1966) (per curiam).  But that entitlement is not absolute;  in all events, it presupposes that the plaintiff is reasonably attentive to the preservation of its rights.  That is not the situation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Sunview could not convince Magistrate Judge Muirhead to approve the depositions that it wished to take, it dropped the matter.  Specifically, it eschewed the filing of a timely objection to the magistrate's order denying its motion to compel discovery.  This omission is fatal to Sunview's first assignment of error.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the motion to compel discovery involved a nondispositive matter, the magistrate's order was effective when made, and it was therefore immediately appealable to the district court.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(A).  To receive such review, a party must file objections within ten days from service of a copy of the order.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a).  Unless an objection is filed within this window of opportunity, a magistrate's order on a nondispositive matter, such as a self-operating order granting, denying, or limiting pretrial discovery, is not thereafter reviewable on appeal.  See Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 346 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Keating v. Secretary of HHS, 848 F.2d 271, 275 (1st Cir.1988) (per curiam) (explicating same rule in respect to a party's failure to file timeous objections to a magistrate's recommended disposition of a dispositive motion).  The Civil Rules are quite explicit on this point:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Within 10 days after being served with a copy of the magistrate judge's order, a party may serve and file objections to the order;  a party may not thereafter assign as error a defect in the magistrate judge's order to which objection was not timely made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a);  see also 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(A) (empowering the district court to reconsider and set aside a magistrate's order on a nondispositive matter when the order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has applied the plain directive of Rule 72(a) straightforwardly and in accordance with its tenor.  See Pagano, 983 F.2d at 346;  Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. v. Gordon, 979 F.2d 11, 13-14 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam);  see also United States v. Ecker, 923 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam) (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(A)).  These cases stand unambiguously for the proposition that, in order to receive review of a magistrate's order on a nondispositive matter in a court of appeals, the aggrieved party first must have sought district court review by timely filing an objection to the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case presents no occasion for a departure from this salutary proposition.  Because Sunview never sought to have the district court review the magistrate's ruling, the issue of jurisdictional discovery is by the boards and Sunview cannot resurrect it in this venue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>B. Dismissal for Want of Jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sunview argued below, as it does here, that Thermaflex, Flexel's predecessor in interest, see supra note 2, purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in New Hampshire, and therefore subjected itself (and Flexel, as its successor) to suits in New Hampshire arising out of its New Hampshire-directed activities.  Judge Barbadoro rejected this thesis, holding, after an exhaustive review of the record, that Sunview had pointed to \"insufficient contact[s] to establish Thermaflex's purposeful availment of New Hampshire as a place to do business.\"  Sunview Condo.  Ass'n v. Aztech Int'l, Ltd., Civ. No. 95-418-B, slip op. at 10 (D.N.H. Sept. 3, 1996).  Sunview assigns error to this order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We see none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To wax longiloquent would serve no useful purpose.  We have stated before, and today reaffirm, that \"when a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"  Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur.  Co. of Am., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.1996);  accord In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1993).  That principle is dispositive here.  Judge Barbadoro's rescript cites the relevant case law, see, e.g., Sawtelle v. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381 (1st Cir.1995);  Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138 (1st Cir.1995);  Ticketmaster-N.Y., Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201 (1st Cir.1994);  Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671 (1st Cir.1992), applies the legal principles derived therefrom to the documented facts in an impeccable manner, and reaches an unarguably correct conclusion.  Hence, we dispense with this aspect of Sunview's appeal for substantially the reasons elucidated in the lower court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

(Aztech).  Aztech is now in bankruptcy, and the district court certified its order dismissing the action against Flexel as a final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).  Thus, we treat the appeal as if Flexel were the sole defendant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sunview alleges that Thermaflex (the actual manufacturer of the heating panels) transferred its assets to Flexel in mid-1993.  For the purpose of resolving the jurisdictional issue, the lower court assumed arguendo that Flexel, a Scottish corporation, is the successor in interest to Thermaflex, an English firm.  We, too, proceed on that assumption</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This rule has its limitations.  See, e.g., Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee v. L'Union Atlantique S.A., 723 F.2d 357, 362 (3d Cir.1983) (indicating that discovery may be disallowed if the assertion of jurisdiction appears frivolous).  Moreover, even when the rule applies, the plaintiff is not necessarily entitled to take depositions.  Here, Sunview never attempted to learn jurisdictional facts through interrogatories or demands for document production, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 33, 34, and we have no way to tell either how effective these less intrusive devices may have been or to what extent Flexel would have sought protection from them (and if so, whether the magistrate would have permitted their use)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because Sunview never raised the discovery issue before Judge Barbadoro, see supra Part II(A), we pay no heed to its vain attempt to attack the judge's order on the basis of curtailed discovery</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Judge Barbadoro rejected this thesis, holding, after an exhaustive review of the record, that Sunview had pointed to \"insufficient contact[s] to establish Thermaflex's purposeful availment of New Hampshire as a place to do business.\"  Sunview Condo.

That principle is dispositive here.  Judge Barbadoro's rescript cites the relevant case law, see, e.g., Sawtelle v.

Given Sunview's procedural default on the discovery front and the paucity of its proffer on the merits of the jurisdictional issue, the judgment below must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs originally sued both Flexel and Aztech International, Ltd.  (Aztech).  Aztech is now in bankruptcy, and the district court certified its order dismissing the action against Flexel as a final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).  Thus, we treat the appeal as if Flexel were the sole defendant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sunview alleges that Thermaflex (the actual manufacturer of the heating panels) transferred its assets to Flexel in mid-1993.  For the purpose of resolving the jurisdictional issue, the lower court assumed arguendo that Flexel, a Scottish corporation, is the successor in interest to Thermaflex, an English firm.  We, too, proceed on that assumption</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This rule has its limitations.

Moreover, even when the rule applies, the plaintiff is not necessarily entitled to take depositions.  Here, Sunview never attempted to learn jurisdictional facts through interrogatories or demands for document production, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 33, 34, and we have no way to tell either how effective these less intrusive devices may have been or to what extent Flexel would have sought protection from them (and if so, whether the magistrate would have permitted their use)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because Sunview never raised the discovery issue before Judge Barbadoro, see supra Part II(A), we pay no heed to its vain attempt to attack the judge's order on the basis of curtailed discovery</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
