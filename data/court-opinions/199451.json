Appellants Eddison and\n\nHansel NuÁez appeal their conviction on two counts of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute and distribution of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. § 846. They contend that the district court\n\nerred in denying: (1) their motion for a new trial based on what they\n\nclaim is newly discovered evidence of trial counsel’s ineffective\n\nassistance; (2) their motion for a downward departure; and (3) their\n\nrequest for a sentence adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.\n\n\n\nI.   MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n\n          Eddison and Hansel, brothers who were born in the Dominican\n\nRepublic but are lawful permanent residents of this country, were\n\noriginally represented by attorneys Carlos Pérez-Olivo and Guillermo\n\nBatille-Olivo, respectively. On January 31, 1997, following a jury\n\ntrial, they were found guilty on both counts. On August 26, 1998, more\n\nthan a year and a half after the verdict but before sentencing,\n\nappellants, represented by new counsel, moved for a new trial pursuant\n\nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. Their motion was based on\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claims. In supporting declarations,\n\nthey alleged that they had not discovered until after trial that their\n\ncounsel had failed to inform them of the government’s interest in a\n\nplea bargain and that counsel had instead actively discouraged, if not\n\nprevented, them from negotiating a plea or cooperation agreement with\n\n\n                                  3\n\fthe government. They alleged that this was due in part to attorney\n\nPérez-Olivo’s conflicting loyalty to another client who might have been\n\nprejudiced by their cooperation with the government. They also alleged\n\nthat counsel misled them by minimizing and misstating the government’s\n\nevidence against them and by failing to advise them about the\n\nconsequences of going to trial and to provide them with guidance\n\nregarding sentencing procedures. The district court denied the motion\n\nwithout prejudice on January 5, 1999.\n\n          Rule 33 requires that a motion for a new trial on grounds\n\nother than newly discovered evidence be filed within seven days after\n\nthe verdict.   Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.    If based on newly discovered\n\nevidence, the motion must be made within three years after the verdict.\n\nId.; see also United States v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561, 566 n.6 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (holding that a defendant whose new trial motion is based on the\n\nalleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel \"may bypass Rule 33's seven-\n\nday time limit only if his claim that his counsel . . . [was\n\nineffective] was based on information unavailable to the defendant at\n\nthe time of trial\").\n\n          \"A motion for new trial based on newly discovered\n\nevidence will not be allowed unless the movant establishes that the\n\nevidence was: (i) unknown or unavailable at the time of trial, (ii)\n\ndespite due diligence, (iii) material, and (iv) likely to result in an\n\nacquittal upon retrial.\" United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 971\n\n\n                                  4\n\f(1st Cir. 1995). Under the fourth requirement, \"the evidence must\n\ncreate an actual probability that an acquittal would have resulted if\n\nthe evidence had been available.\" United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1216, 1220 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          The district court, assuming arguendo that the first two\n\nrequirements were met, concluded that appellants failed to meet the\n\nremaining requirements because their claims of ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel were immaterial and unlikely to result in an acquittal upon\n\nretrial because they had no bearing on the issue of guilt.\n\nAppellants’ claims therefore were not based on newly discovered\n\nevidence for purposes of Rule 33 and were jurisdictionally barred. See\n\nLema, 909 F.2d at 565 (\"[R]ule [33] is jurisdictional, and the district\n\ncourt is without discretion to grant a motion for new trial that is not\n\ntimely filed.\").\n\n          We review the district court's denial of the motion for a new\n\ntrial for \"manifest abuse of discretion.\"          United States v.\n\nMontilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d 1060, 1064 (1st Cir. 1997). Appellants do\n\nnot address the grounds on which the district court denied their\n\nmotion, i.e., that their claims of ineffective assistance are\n\nimmaterial and unlikely to result in an acquittal. Instead they argue\n\nthat given the \"breadth and sophistication of the government’s case\n\nagainst them\" and the heavy punishment they faced, their counsel were\n\nineffective in failing to negotiate a favorable bargain for them in\n\n\n                                  5\n\fexchange for cooperation. While appellants may have a viable claim for\n\npost-conviction relief, see United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929\n\nF.2d 747 (1st Cir. 1991)--an issue on which we express no opinion--they\n\nhave failed to show error in the district court’s denial of their\n\nmotion. Nor, as appellants had not yet been sentenced at the time of\n\ntheir motion, do we find error in the court’s failing to treat the Rule\n\n33 motion as one filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n\n\nII.   DOWNWARD DEPARTURES UNDER § 5K2.0\n\n            In their Rule 33 motion, appellants moved in the alternative\n\nfor a downward departure. They argue that the district court should\n\nhave exercised its discretion to depart under U NITED STATES SENTENCING\n\nGUIDELINES MANUAL (U.S.S.G.) § 5K2.0 (1998) and 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)\n\nbecause of the misconduct of their counsel on which their new trial\n\nmotion was based. The district court considered the various grounds\n\npresented by appellants and found they did not warrant a departure.\n\n            A district court’s refusal to depart downward is not\n\nappealable. See United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1290 (1st\n\nCir. 1992). Where, as here, the district court recognized that it had\n\ndiscretion to depart but decided that the factors cited by appellants\n\ndid not warrant a departure, we are without jurisdiction to review its\n\ndecision.\n\nIII. ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY UNDER § 3E1.1\n\n\n                                    6\n\f          Finally, appellants contend, on the same grounds on which\n\ntheir new trial motion was based, that the district court erred in\n\ndenying them a two-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a) (1998). Acknowledging that defendants who\n\nput the government to its proof at trial are rarely awarded such an\n\nadjustment, they argue that they were prevented from actively\n\ndemonstrating acceptance of responsibility by trial counsel’s\n\nobstruction. They also contend that they made substantial efforts to\n\ncooperate after obtaining new counsel post-trial.\n\n          The adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is applicable\n\nwhen \"the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility\n\nfor his offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a). Only in rare circumstances\n\nwill a defendant who elects to go to trial qualify for this adjustment.\n\nSee United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 37 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a), App. Note 2 (1998) (noting that \"[i]n rare\n\nsituations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of\n\nresponsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his\n\nconstitutional right to trial\"). The burden is on the defendant to\n\ndemonstrate that he or she should have received the reduction. See\n\nUnited States v. Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d 552, 570 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nHere, the district court found no indication in the record of any \"rare\n\ncircumstances\" warranting the adjustment after appellants had put the\n\ngovernment to its burden of proof at trial.        See id.\n\n\n                                  7\n\f          We discern no clear error in the district court’s denial.\n\nBaltas, 236 F.3d 37. Our conclusion is reinforced by the tenor of\n\nappellants’ allocution at sentencing which, rather than reflecting\n\nremorse, was devoted largely to an attack on their former attorneys.\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\f",
