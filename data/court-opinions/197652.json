To the contrary,\r\n\nas we  read  the sentencing  transcript, the  district  court\r\n\ndeparted by two criminal history categories under U.S.S.G.  S\r\n\n4A1.3 and amply explained such departure by reference to  the\r\n\nseriousness  of  defendant's  conduct,  his  vacated  Florida\r\n\nconviction, and his high  risk of recidivism.  We cannot  say\r\n\nthat the departure was unreasonable, and we perceive no abuse\r\n\nof discretion here.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1. \r\n\n                             -2-\r\n",
