Specifically, petitioner\r\n\ncontends that the record does  not conclusively refute his  allegation\r\n\nthat trial counsel failed to perfect his notice of appeal, despite his\r\n\ninstructions that she do  so.  See Bonneau v. United  States, 961 F.2d\r                                                                    \r\n\n17,  23 (1st Cir.  1992).  We  agree.

In\r                     \r\n\naddition,  the court's summary of  counsel's letter (which was written\r\n\nin  Spanish)  suggests that  the  letter  does  not, in  fact,  refute\r\n\npetitioner's claim.  See id. at 131.\r                                    \r\n\n    We  therefore vacate  and remand with instructions  that the court\r\n\n(1)  appoint  counsel for  petitioner  if  he  qualifies for  such  an\r\n\nappointment under  18 U.S.C.   3006A(g); and  (2) hold  an evidentiary\r\n\nhearing as to whether, and when, petitioner instructed counsel to file\r\n\na notice  of appeal,  see U.S.C.    2255.
