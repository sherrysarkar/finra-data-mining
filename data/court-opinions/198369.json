Zachary R. Karol, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nBownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Philip R. Olenick for appellant.\r\n\n   John A. James, Jr. for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 10, 1999\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  Lucy Appleyard, a citizen\r\nof New Hampshire, brought this action to obtain the alleged balance\r\ndue of $367,352.29 on a promissory note executed by the\r\nJ.W. Douglass Corporation (JWD) and guaranteed by defendant\r\nJ.W. Douglass, Jr., a citizen of Massachusetts.  This is the second\r\ntime this case is before us.  On March 6, 1998, in an unpublished\r\nopinion, we upheld the determination of the district court that\r\nLucy Appleyard had standing to bring suit but remanded for a new\r\ndetermination of damages.  The case was tried by agreement of the\r\nparties before a United States Magistrate Judge.  The same\r\nmagistrate judge handled the remand.\r\n                              I\r\nThis opinion is concerned only with the determination of\r\ndamages on remand.  We rehearse the relevant facts.  Appleyard\r\nMotor transported gasoline and other petroleum products.  Its\r\nannual revenue approximated $2.5 million.  Its sole stockholder was\r\nJohn Appleyard, husband of plaintiff.  JWD was also in the trucking\r\nbusiness.  In addition to gasoline and petroleum products it\r\ntransported ready mix concrete and sand and gravel.  JWD's annual\r\nrevenues were approximately $20 million.\r\nSometime before September 16, 1988, the two corporations\r\nentered into negotiations for the sale of Appleyard Motor's\r\nbusiness and assets to JWD.  John Appleyard died on September 16,\r\n1988.\r\nNegotiations between the two companies continued after\r\nJohn Appleyard's death.  On November 23, 1988, Lucy Appleyard, as\r\nthe new president of Appleyard Motor, executed a purchase and sale\r\nagreement with JWD.  Under the agreement Appleyard Motor sold its\r\nbusiness and tangible assets to JWD for $800,000.  JWD paid\r\n$500,000 cash and gave Appleyard Motor a non-negotiable promissory\r\nnote for the balance of $300,000 payable monthly with interest at\r\n10%.  This broke down to thirty-five monthly payments in the amount\r\nof $9,680.16 each.  John W. Douglass, Jr., defendant, personally\r\nguaranteed the note.  JWD made eleven monthly payments directly to\r\nplaintiff for a total of $106,481.76.\r\nThe purchase and sale agreement contained the following\r\nrepresentation:  \"[T]o the best of its knowledge and belief,\r\n[Appleyard Motor] is in full compliance with all laws and\r\nregulations which apply to the conduct of its business, including\r\nall laws and regulations relating to employment.\"\r\nJWD stopped payments on the note as of November, 1989. \r\nIn January of 1990, JWD filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.  On\r\nJanuary 4, 1991, the Massachusetts Secretary of State involuntarily\r\ndissolved Appleyard Motor under chapter 156, section 101 of the\r\nMassachusetts General Laws.  The complaint in this action was filed\r\non January 19, 1995.\r\n                              II  In our first opinion we made holdings and rulings on the\r\ndamages evidence intended as a guide for the magistrate judge on\r\nremand.\r\nWe start with the finding and ruling of the magistrate\r\njudge that are the genesis of the damages issue.  The magistrate\r\njudge found that \"AMT's [Appleyard's] drivers were driving an\r\nexcessive number of hours and that AMT must have known this.  This \r\nconstitutes a false representation or breach of warranty.\"\r\nThere was unrebutted testimony by Gerald Felise, vice\r\npresident and chief financial officer of JWD, along the following\r\nlines.  Felise had extensive experience in the trucking industry. \r\nThe Department of Transportation has a long-standing requirement\r\nmandating that truck drivers keep a record of all hours spent \"on\r\nduty\" and \"off duty.\"  The time records must be kept in what is\r\ncalled a log.  It is the responsibility of the trucking employer to\r\nsee to it that the logs are accurate.  The logs are required to be\r\nkept at the terminal of origin and at the corporate office.  After\r\nhe took over at JWD in 1989, Felise conducted an audit of the\r\nAppleyard Motor site in Methuen, Massachusetts.  He found that\r\nalthough the logs kept by the truck drivers appeared to be in\r\ncompliance with Department of Transportation hour requirements,\r\nthey did not check out with the trip tickets issued at the points\r\nof origin and delivery.  Trip tickets are stamped with the time the\r\ntruck leaves the terminal and another ticket shows the time of\r\ndelivery of the load.  Unlike the logs, the truckers had no control\r\nover the times stamped on trip tickets.  Appleyard Motor had a\r\nlarge percentage of independent truckers hauling for it. \r\nIndependent truckers own their own tractors and lease containers\r\nfurnished by the trucking company.  It is to the financial\r\nadvantage of independent truckers to carry as many loads as\r\npossible, which may mean working more hours than allowed by the\r\nDepartment of Transportation.\r\nBased on Felise's testimony we concluded that the finding\r\nand ruling of the magistrate judge were neither clearly erroneous\r\nnor legal error insofar as they involved an interpretation of\r\nparagraph 7J of the purchase and sale agreement.  This paragraph\r\nstated:\r\n   Seller, to the best of its knowledge and\r\nbelief, is in full compliance with all laws\r\nand regulations which apply to the conduct of\r\nits business, including all laws and\r\nregulations relating to employment.\r\n\nWe next reviewed the relevant part of the magistrate\r\njudge's opinion on damages.  He found first:\r\n   Upon discovering that AMT's [Appleyard\r\nMotor's] drivers had been driving excessive\r\nhours, Gerald Felise, Vice President and Chief\r\nOperating officer of JWD [Douglass Corp.],\r\nissued a directive to the drivers to bring\r\ntheir hours into compliance with the law.  In\r\norder to compensate the drivers for the loss\r\nof driving time, AMT had to raise the rates it\r\ncharged its customers.  This, in turn,\r\nresulted in a loss of customers and a $300,000\r\nannual decline in revenue associated with the\r\nformer AMT operation.\r\n\nWe found no fault with this finding.  It was amply\r\nsupported by the record.  \r\nWe held the findings and rulings that followed to be\r\nclearly erroneous.  The magistrate judge found and ruled:\r\nStarting from an annual revenue base of $2.5\r\nmillion, this amounts to a 12% decline. \r\nAlthough Douglas [sic] presented no evidence\r\nthat purported to address directly the issue\r\nof damages or even to quantify JWD's loss in\r\nprofits as a result of this decline in\r\nrevenue, I infer that, if JWD had known that\r\nannual revenue from the AMT operation would\r\ndecline 12% as a result of JWD having to bring\r\nthat operation into compliance with law, the\r\nfair price JWD would have been willing to pay\r\nfor AMT would have been at least 12% (or\r\n$96,000) below the $800,000 it agreed to pay. \r\nOn this basis, I find that the difference\r\nbetween the value of the assets as represented\r\nor warranted and their actual value was at\r\nleast $96,000.\r\n\nBased upon his finding of a 12% (or $96,000) offset, the\r\nmagistrate judge found that Douglass owed Lucy Appleyard \"a total\r\nof $206,270,\" which included interest.\r\nIn our remand opinion we concluded that there was no\r\nevidentiary basis for the analysis and findings.  We noted first\r\nthat the statement by the magistrate judge that \"Douglas presented\r\nno evidence that purported to address directly the issue of damages\r\nor even to quantify JWD's loss in profits as a result of this\r\ndecline in revenue\" was contrary to the record.  Gerard Felise,\r\nvice president and chief financial officer of JWD, testified\r\ndirectly on this.  His testimony can be summarized as follows.\r\nAppleyard Motor's operations at the Methuen,\r\nMassachusetts, site grossed $2.5 million annually.  Its operating\r\ncost was 87 cents on the dollar; this meant that its profit was 13\r\ncents on the dollar.  This translated into roughly between $200,000\r\nand $400,000 worth of cash flow profits annually.  In order to\r\noperate in compliance with the Department of Transportation's\r\nhourly requirements the rates charged customers were increased by\r\n18%.  The customers refused to pay the additional 18%.  This\r\nresulted in a \"negative revenue stream\" of $300,000, or to put it\r\nanother way, there was a $300,000 annualized decline in revenue\r\nbased on a $2.5 million starting point.  This contributed to an\r\noverall decline in revenue of 40% for JWD.  The result was the\r\nfiling of a chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy by JWD on January 27,\r\n1990.  In answer to a question by the magistrate judge, Felise\r\nstated that the $300,000 loss in annual revenue was due solely to\r\nthe mandatory compliance with the reduced hours required by the\r\nDepartment of Transportation.  The magistrate judge did not\r\nquestion the credibility of Felise; indeed, he relied on his\r\ntestimony in finding a false representation by Appleyard Motor.\r\nThere was also testimony by Michael Pierce, accountant\r\nfor Appleyard Motor, that prior to the sale of its assets its\r\nprofits were $200,000-$300,000 a year.  Thus, it appears from the\r\nevidence that the entire profit margin of Appleyard Motor was wiped\r\nout when the driving hours violation was corrected.\r\nWe further held that there was no evidentiary basis for\r\nthe magistrate judge's finding that if JWD had known that the\r\nannual revenue from the Appleyard Motor operation would decline 12%\r\nbecause customer rates had to be raised 18% to bring the operation\r\ninto compliance with the law, \"the fair price JWD [Douglass] would\r\nhave been willing to pay for AMT [Appleyard] would have been at\r\nleast 12% (or $96,000) below the $800,000 it agreed to pay.\"\r\nWe pointed out that there was no testimony as to what a\r\nwilling seller would have paid a willing buyer under these\r\ncircumstances.  We then stated:\r\nMoreover, the magistrate judge gave no\r\nconsideration to the inescapable fact that a\r\nreduction of $300,000.00 in annual earnings\r\neffectively eliminated Appleyard Motor's\r\nprofits.  We cannot conjecture without\r\nevidence what Douglass Corp. would have paid\r\nif the hour violations had been brought to its\r\nattention prior to the sale.  Douglass may\r\nwell have decided not to purchase Appleyard\r\nMotor.\r\n\nWe further held that it was clearly established that the \r\n\"hours violation resulted directly in an annual loss of revenue to\r\nDouglass Corp. of $300,000,\" and that this violated the offset\r\nprovision in the note and purchase and sale agreement.  The offset\r\nagreement is no longer a factor in the case, however, because\r\ndefendant has expressly waived any sums due under the offset\r\nprovision.  All he seeks is a ruling that he is not liable for any\r\nfurther payments on the note.  Footnote 1, First Opinion.\r\nAt the conclusion of our first opinion we reiterated:  \r\n\nThe district court clearly erred when it\r\ninferred that Douglass Corp. would have paid\r\nonly 12% less for Appleyard Motor in the total\r\nabsence of any evidence to that effect.  This\r\nis especially so in light of the fact that\r\nbringing Appleyard Motor into compliance with\r\nDepartment of Transportation requirements\r\nobliterated the profit margin of the purchased\r\nentity.\r\n\n                             III\r\nOn remand the magistrate judge concluded \r\nthat the evidence in the trial record is\r\ninsufficient to enable a rational  factfinder\r\nto determine with a reasonable degree of\r\ncertainty what damages defendant suffered as a\r\nresult of plaintiff's misrepresentation or\r\nbreach of warranty.  Therefore, I have decided\r\nto reopen the record to permit defendant to\r\npresent additional evidence on the subject.\r\n\nDefendant declined to present any further evidence on the\r\nground that under the law of the case doctrine, the magistrate\r\njudge had a duty to follow our rulings and findings and decide the\r\ncase on the evidence already addressed.  The magistrate judge then\r\nordered the clerk\r\nto enter judgment in favor of plaintiff, Lucy\r\nAppleyard, in the amount of $369,288, being\r\nthe amount of principal, interest, and late\r\ncharges to which plaintiff proved she was\r\nentitled, before any offset for damages\r\nsuffered by JWD as a result of the\r\nmisrepresentation of breach of warranty by\r\nplaintiff's predecessor.\r\n\nThis was $163,018 more than the first judgment.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\nThe magistrate judge agreed with us that there was no\r\nevidence of what a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller\r\nif the buyer had known that the truck driver's records had been\r\nmisrepresented to the extent of causing a reduction in Appleyard's\r\nearnings of $300,000.  Quite inexplicably the magistrate judge then\r\ndiscusses at length how he arrived at the 12% ($96,000) discounted\r\nvalue. \r\nThe magistrate judge rejected our ruling that he had\r\nerred in stating that defendant had \"presented no evidence that\r\npurported to address directly the issue of damages or even to\r\nquantify JWD's loss in profits as a result of the decline in\r\nreview.\"  We pointed out that Gerard Felise, vice president and\r\nchief financial officer of JWD, testified directly on this.  We\r\nalso summarized Felise's testimony.\r\nThe magistrate judge mounts a complex seven-page argument\r\ninvolving fixed and variable costs rejecting the testimony of\r\nFelise.  He concludes this part of his opinion by stating, \"it\r\ncannot be said with reasonable certainty what happened to AMT's\r\nprofits as rates increased and rates declined.\" \r\nWe stated in our first opinion:  \"Moreover, the\r\nmagistrate judge gave no consideration to the inescapable fact that\r\na reduction of $300,000 in annual earnings effectively eliminated\r\nAppleyard Motor's profits.\"  We think this clearly was binding on\r\nthe magistrate judge under the \"law of the case\" doctrine.  The\r\nmagistrate judge thought otherwise:\r\n   This brings me back to the very troubling\r\n\"law of the case\" issue and to my reasons for\r\nrejecting defendant's argument that the First\r\nCircuit's decision mandates a finding that the\r\n$300,000 decline in revenues produced by the\r\n18% rate increase in fact wiped out AMT's\r\nprofits.\r\n\n                              IV\r\nWe next consider \"the law of the case\" doctrine as it\r\napplies to this case.  We recently held that \"[f]or a bar to exist,\r\nan issue must have been 'actually considered and decided by the\r\nappellate court' or . . . be 'necessarily inferred from the\r\ndisposition on appeal.'\"  Field v. Mans, 157 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.\r\n1998); see also Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., 41\r\nF.3d 764, 770 (1st Cir. 1994).  While a future court is not bound\r\nby non-essential dicta, it \"must implement both the letter and\r\nspirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court's\r\nopinion and the circumstances it embraces.\"  United States v.\r\nConnell, 6 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1993).  Our conclusion in our\r\nfirst opinion that Appleyard Motor's profits were \"effectively\r\neliminated\" was based on the testimony of Gerard Felise, vice\r\npresident and chief financial officer of JWD and the testimony of\r\nthe accountant for Appleyard that prior to its sale to JWD,\r\nAppleyard Motor's profits were $200,000-$300,000 a year.  The\r\nmagistrate judge did not question the credibility of either of\r\nthese witnesses.  The law of the case established that all profits\r\nwere eliminated.\r\nGiven the law of the case, the undisputed evidence, and\r\nthe conclusion that the value of the business was the sum of its\r\nequipment value and goodwill, we disagree with the magistrate's\r\ndetermination that there was insufficient evidence to decide the\r\ncase.  It follows that we disagree with the magistrate judge's\r\nruling that the record was \"insufficient to enable a rational\r\nfactfinder to determine with a reasonable degree of certainty what\r\ndamages defendant suffered as a result of plaintiff's\r\nmisrepresentation or breach of warranty.\"  Moreover, after reading\r\nthe magistrate judge's opinion carefully, we have difficulty\r\nunderstanding how defendant could have proven to the magistrate\r\njudge's satisfaction that JWD had suffered any damages by reason of\r\nthe false representation.\r\nWe, therefore, rule that it was error for the magistrate\r\njudge to, in effect, penalize defendant for not producing\r\nadditional evidence.\r\nThis means that we reject plaintiff's argument that\r\ndefendant waived his right to proceed on the merits when he elected\r\nnot to provide additional evidence after he was invited to do so. \r\nThe magistrate judge did not in fact rule that defendant had waived\r\nhis claim.  After summarizing the reasons why he could not decide\r\nthe damages without additional evidence, he stated:\r\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the\r\nDecision on Remand, and in light of\r\ndefendant's decision not to present additional\r\nevidence regarding damages, the clerk is\r\nhereby ORDERED to enter judgment in favor of\r\nplaintiff, Lucy Appleyard, in the amount of\r\n$369,288, being the amount of principal,\r\ninterest, and late charges to which plaintiff\r\nproved she was entitled, before any offset for\r\ndamages suffered by JWD as a result of the\r\nmisrepresentation or breach of warranty by\r\nplaintiff's predecessor.\r\n\nBecause of the magistrate judge's refusal to follow our\r\nclear holdings and rulings, we rule that defendant had the right to\r\nappeal the judgment of the magistrate judge and proceed on the\r\nrecord before the court.\r\nThe final issue is:  in light of our rulings and findings\r\non the applicability of the \"law of the case\" doctrine, how should\r\nwe proceed.  We are reluctant to remand the case again to another\r\njudge for another determination of damages.  There are certain\r\ncircumstances where remand can be dispensed with, such as where the\r\nrecord permits only one rational answer or where repeated efforts\r\nat factfinding have resulted in confused or unsupportable findings. \r\nSee, e.g., Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., 72 F.3d\r\n190, 198 (1st Cir. 1995) (in lieu of remand, sorting through record\r\nto distinguish findings as to which deference is due and tainted\r\nfindings as to which deference is not owed); Williams v. Poulos, 11\r\nF.3d 271, 280 (1st Cir. 1993) (describing conditions under which\r\n\"court of appeals [itself] can, and often should,\" fix an error). \r\nThis is such a situation.  There is evidence in the record\r\nsufficiently clear and uncontested to allow us to make the\r\nnecessary findings to terminate the case at the appellate level.\r\nThe following facts are uncontroverted.  Appleyard Motor\r\nand JWD executed a purchase and sale agreement on November 23,\r\n1988.  Under its terms JWD purchased the business and tangible\r\nassets of Appleyard for $800,000.  Five hundred thousand dollars of\r\nthe purchase price was paid in cash.  The balance of $300,000 was\r\nto be made in thirty-five monthly payments.  A total of $106,481.76\r\nwas paid on the note.  JWD had paid a total of $606,481.76 to\r\nAppleyard before it stopped payments on the note as of November\r\n1989.  In January of 1990 JWD filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy\r\npetition.\r\nThe magistrate judge found in his first opinion, based\r\nupon the testimony of Gerard Felise, that the false representation \r\n\"resulted in a loss of customers and a $300,000 annual decline in\r\nrevenue associated with the former AMT operation.\"  See infra at 5. \r\nThis finding was clearly correct.  The evidence is that Felise took\r\nover the operation of both companies in 1989. \r\nWe make the following rulings:  Because of the raise in\r\nrates put into effect by Felise, JWD received $300,000 less in\r\nrevenue from its Appleyard operation.  This was due to the fact\r\nthat when the rates were raised in 1989 to meet federal work-hour\r\nrequirements, Appleyard lost customers.  Appleyard's annual profits\r\nhad ranged between $200,000 to $300,000 a year.  After the rates\r\nhad been raised but rejected by its customer, Appleyard could no\r\nlonger operate at a profit.  After JWD filed for bankruptcy in\r\nJanuary of 1990, Appleyard also ceased to exist as an operating\r\nbusiness.  The false representation by Appleyard caused the demise\r\nof both businesses.\r\nBased on these undisputed facts, we conclude that\r\ndefendant has no obligation to make any further payments to\r\nplaintiff.  Defendant has expressly waived any sums that might be\r\ndue under the offset provision of the purchase and sale agreement. \r\nThis means, of course, that he cannot attempt to collect any money\r\nthat might theoretically be due from plaintiff either individually \r\nor as a former officer of Appleyard Motors.\r\nThe judgment below is reversed and remanded with\r\ndirections to the district court to enter judgment in favor of\r\ndefendant, John W. Douglass, Jr.\r\nNo costs to either party on appeal.\r\n",

Lucy Appleyard, a citizen\r\nof New Hampshire, brought this action to obtain the alleged balance\r\ndue of $367,352.29 on a promissory note executed by the\r\nJ.W. Douglass Corporation (JWD) and guaranteed by defendant\r\nJ.W. Douglass, Jr., a citizen of Massachusetts.  This is the second\r\ntime this case is before us.  On March 6, 1998, in an unpublished\r\nopinion, we upheld the determination of the district court that\r\nLucy Appleyard had standing to bring suit but remanded for a new\r\ndetermination of damages.  The case was tried by agreement of the\r\nparties before a United States Magistrate Judge.

JWD was also in the trucking\r\nbusiness.  In addition to gasoline and petroleum products it\r\ntransported ready mix concrete and sand and gravel.

John Appleyard died on September 16,\r\n1988.\r\nNegotiations between the two companies continued after\r\nJohn Appleyard's death.  On November 23, 1988, Lucy Appleyard, as\r\nthe new president of Appleyard Motor, executed a purchase and sale\r\nagreement with JWD.  Under the agreement Appleyard Motor sold its\r\nbusiness and tangible assets to JWD for $800,000.  JWD paid\r\n$500,000 cash and gave Appleyard Motor a non-negotiable promissory\r\nnote for the balance of $300,000 payable monthly with interest at\r\n10%.  This broke down to thirty-five monthly payments in the amount\r\nof $9,680.16 each.  John W. Douglass, Jr., defendant, personally\r\nguaranteed the note.  JWD made eleven monthly payments directly to\r\nplaintiff for a total of $106,481.76.\r\nThe purchase and sale agreement contained the following\r\nrepresentation:  \"[T]o the best of its knowledge and belief,\r\n[Appleyard Motor] is in full compliance with all laws and\r\nregulations which apply to the conduct of its business, including\r\nall laws and regulations relating to employment.\"\r\nJWD stopped payments on the note as of November, 1989. \r\nIn January of 1990, JWD filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.  On\r\nJanuary 4, 1991, the Massachusetts Secretary of State involuntarily\r\ndissolved Appleyard Motor under chapter 156, section 101 of the\r\nMassachusetts General Laws.  The complaint in this action was filed\r\non January 19, 1995.\r\n                              II  In our first opinion we made holdings and rulings on the\r\ndamages evidence intended as a guide for the magistrate judge on\r\nremand.\r\nWe start with the finding and ruling of the magistrate\r\njudge that are the genesis of the damages issue.  The magistrate\r\njudge found that \"AMT's [Appleyard's] drivers were driving an\r\nexcessive number of hours and that AMT must have known this.  This \r\nconstitutes a false representation or breach of warranty.\"\r\nThere was unrebutted testimony by Gerald Felise, vice\r\npresident and chief financial officer of JWD, along the following\r\nlines.  Felise had extensive experience in the trucking industry. \r\nThe Department of Transportation has a long-standing requirement\r\nmandating that truck drivers keep a record of all hours spent \"on\r\nduty\" and \"off duty.\"  The time records must be kept in what is\r\ncalled a log.  It is the responsibility of the trucking employer to\r\nsee to it that the logs are accurate.  The logs are required to be\r\nkept at the terminal of origin and at the corporate office.  After\r\nhe took over at JWD in 1989, Felise conducted an audit of the\r\nAppleyard Motor site in Methuen, Massachusetts.  He found that\r\nalthough the logs kept by the truck drivers appeared to be in\r\ncompliance with Department of Transportation hour requirements,\r\nthey did not check out with the trip tickets issued at the points\r\nof origin and delivery.  Trip tickets are stamped with the time the\r\ntruck leaves the terminal and another ticket shows the time of\r\ndelivery of the load.  Unlike the logs, the truckers had no control\r\nover the times stamped on trip tickets.  Appleyard Motor had a\r\nlarge percentage of independent truckers hauling for it. \r\nIndependent truckers own their own tractors and lease containers\r\nfurnished by the trucking company.  It is to the financial\r\nadvantage of independent truckers to carry as many loads as\r\npossible, which may mean working more hours than allowed by the\r\nDepartment of Transportation.\r\nBased on Felise's testimony we concluded that the finding\r\nand ruling of the magistrate judge were neither clearly erroneous\r\nnor legal error insofar as they involved an interpretation of\r\nparagraph 7J of the purchase and sale agreement.  This paragraph\r\nstated:\r\n   Seller, to the best of its knowledge and\r\nbelief, is in full compliance with all laws\r\nand regulations which apply to the conduct of\r\nits business, including all laws and\r\nregulations relating to employment.\r\n\nWe next reviewed the relevant part of the magistrate\r\njudge's opinion on damages.  He found first:\r\n   Upon discovering that AMT's [Appleyard\r\nMotor's] drivers had been driving excessive\r\nhours, Gerald Felise, Vice President and Chief\r\nOperating officer of JWD [Douglass Corp.],\r\nissued a directive to the drivers to bring\r\ntheir hours into compliance with the law.  In\r\norder to compensate the drivers for the loss\r\nof driving time, AMT had to raise the rates it\r\ncharged its customers.  This, in turn,\r\nresulted in a loss of customers and a $300,000\r\nannual decline in revenue associated with the\r\nformer AMT operation.\r\n\nWe found no fault with this finding.  It was amply\r\nsupported by the record.  \r\nWe held the findings and rulings that followed to be\r\nclearly erroneous.  The magistrate judge found and ruled:\r\nStarting from an annual revenue base of $2.5\r\nmillion, this amounts to a 12% decline. \r\nAlthough Douglas [sic] presented no evidence\r\nthat purported to address directly the issue\r\nof damages or even to quantify JWD's loss in\r\nprofits as a result of this decline in\r\nrevenue, I infer that, if JWD had known that\r\nannual revenue from the AMT operation would\r\ndecline 12% as a result of JWD having to bring\r\nthat operation into compliance with law, the\r\nfair price JWD would have been willing to pay\r\nfor AMT would have been at least 12% (or\r\n$96,000) below the $800,000 it agreed to pay. \r\nOn this basis, I find that the difference\r\nbetween the value of the assets as represented\r\nor warranted and their actual value was at\r\nleast $96,000.\r\n\nBased upon his finding of a 12% (or $96,000) offset, the\r\nmagistrate judge found that Douglass owed Lucy Appleyard \"a total\r\nof $206,270,\" which included interest.\r\nIn our remand opinion we concluded that there was no\r\nevidentiary basis for the analysis and findings.  We noted first\r\nthat the statement by the magistrate judge that \"Douglas presented\r\nno evidence that purported to address directly the issue of damages\r\nor even to quantify JWD's loss in profits as a result of this\r\ndecline in revenue\" was contrary to the record.  Gerard Felise,\r\nvice president and chief financial officer of JWD, testified\r\ndirectly on this.  His testimony can be summarized as follows.\r\nAppleyard Motor's operations at the Methuen,\r\nMassachusetts, site grossed $2.5 million annually.  Its operating\r\ncost was 87 cents on the dollar; this meant that its profit was 13\r\ncents on the dollar.  This translated into roughly between $200,000\r\nand $400,000 worth of cash flow profits annually.  In order to\r\noperate in compliance with the Department of Transportation's\r\nhourly requirements the rates charged customers were increased by\r\n18%.  The customers refused to pay the additional 18%.  This\r\nresulted in a \"negative revenue stream\" of $300,000, or to put it\r\nanother way, there was a $300,000 annualized decline in revenue\r\nbased on a $2.5 million starting point.  This contributed to an\r\noverall decline in revenue of 40% for JWD.  The result was the\r\nfiling of a chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy by JWD on January 27,\r\n1990.  In answer to a question by the magistrate judge, Felise\r\nstated that the $300,000 loss in annual revenue was due solely to\r\nthe mandatory compliance with the reduced hours required by the\r\nDepartment of Transportation.  The magistrate judge did not\r\nquestion the credibility of Felise; indeed, he relied on his\r\ntestimony in finding a false representation by Appleyard Motor.\r\nThere was also testimony by Michael Pierce, accountant\r\nfor Appleyard Motor, that prior to the sale of its assets its\r\nprofits were $200,000-$300,000 a year.  Thus, it appears from the\r\nevidence that the entire profit margin of Appleyard Motor was wiped\r\nout when the driving hours violation was corrected.\r\nWe further held that there was no evidentiary basis for\r\nthe magistrate judge's finding that if JWD had known that the\r\nannual revenue from the Appleyard Motor operation would decline 12%\r\nbecause customer rates had to be raised 18% to bring the operation\r\ninto compliance with the law, \"the fair price JWD [Douglass] would\r\nhave been willing to pay for AMT [Appleyard] would have been at\r\nleast 12% (or $96,000) below the $800,000 it agreed to pay.\"\r\nWe pointed out that there was no testimony as to what a\r\nwilling seller would have paid a willing buyer under these\r\ncircumstances.  We then stated:\r\nMoreover, the magistrate judge gave no\r\nconsideration to the inescapable fact that a\r\nreduction of $300,000.00 in annual earnings\r\neffectively eliminated Appleyard Motor's\r\nprofits.  We cannot conjecture without\r\nevidence what Douglass Corp. would have paid\r\nif the hour violations had been brought to its\r\nattention prior to the sale.  Douglass may\r\nwell have decided not to purchase Appleyard\r\nMotor.\r\n\nWe further held that it was clearly established that the \r\n\"hours violation resulted directly in an annual loss of revenue to\r\nDouglass Corp. of $300,000,\" and that this violated the offset\r\nprovision in the note and purchase and sale agreement.  The offset\r\nagreement is no longer a factor in the case, however, because\r\ndefendant has expressly waived any sums due under the offset\r\nprovision.  All he seeks is a ruling that he is not liable for any\r\nfurther payments on the note.  Footnote 1, First Opinion.\r\nAt the conclusion of our first opinion we reiterated:  \r\n\nThe district court clearly erred when it\r\ninferred that Douglass Corp. would have paid\r\nonly 12% less for Appleyard Motor in the total\r\nabsence of any evidence to that effect.  This\r\nis especially so in light of the fact that\r\nbringing Appleyard Motor into compliance with\r\nDepartment of Transportation requirements\r\nobliterated the profit margin of the purchased\r\nentity.\r\n\n                             III\r\nOn remand the magistrate judge concluded \r\nthat the evidence in the trial record is\r\ninsufficient to enable a rational  factfinder\r\nto determine with a reasonable degree of\r\ncertainty what damages defendant suffered as a\r\nresult of plaintiff's misrepresentation or\r\nbreach of warranty.  Therefore, I have decided\r\nto reopen the record to permit defendant to\r\npresent additional evidence on the subject.\r\n\nDefendant declined to present any further evidence on the\r\nground that under the law of the case doctrine, the magistrate\r\njudge had a duty to follow our rulings and findings and decide the\r\ncase on the evidence already addressed.  The magistrate judge then\r\nordered the clerk\r\nto enter judgment in favor of plaintiff, Lucy\r\nAppleyard, in the amount of $369,288, being\r\nthe amount of principal, interest, and late\r\ncharges to which plaintiff proved she was\r\nentitled, before any offset for damages\r\nsuffered by JWD as a result of the\r\nmisrepresentation of breach of warranty by\r\nplaintiff's predecessor.\r\n\nThis was $163,018 more than the first judgment.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\nThe magistrate judge agreed with us that there was no\r\nevidence of what a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller\r\nif the buyer had known that the truck driver's records had been\r\nmisrepresented to the extent of causing a reduction in Appleyard's\r\nearnings of $300,000.  Quite inexplicably the magistrate judge then\r\ndiscusses at length how he arrived at the 12% ($96,000) discounted\r\nvalue. \r\nThe magistrate judge rejected our ruling that he had\r\nerred in stating that defendant had \"presented no evidence that\r\npurported to address directly the issue of damages or even to\r\nquantify JWD's loss in profits as a result of the decline in\r\nreview.\"  We pointed out that Gerard Felise, vice president and\r\nchief financial officer of JWD, testified directly on this.  We\r\nalso summarized Felise's testimony.\r\nThe magistrate judge mounts a complex seven-page argument\r\ninvolving fixed and variable costs rejecting the testimony of\r\nFelise.  He concludes this part of his opinion by stating, \"it\r\ncannot be said with reasonable certainty what happened to AMT's\r\nprofits as rates increased and rates declined.\" \r\nWe stated in our first opinion:  \"Moreover, the\r\nmagistrate judge gave no consideration to the inescapable fact that\r\na reduction of $300,000 in annual earnings effectively eliminated\r\nAppleyard Motor's profits.\"  We think this clearly was binding on\r\nthe magistrate judge under the \"law of the case\" doctrine.  The\r\nmagistrate judge thought otherwise:\r\n   This brings me back to the very troubling\r\n\"law of the case\" issue and to my reasons for\r\nrejecting defendant's argument that the First\r\nCircuit's decision mandates a finding that the\r\n$300,000 decline in revenues produced by the\r\n18% rate increase in fact wiped out AMT's\r\nprofits.\r\n\n                              IV\r\nWe next consider \"the law of the case\" doctrine as it\r\napplies to this case.  We recently held that \"[f]or a bar to exist,\r\nan issue must have been 'actually considered and decided by the\r\nappellate court' or . . . be 'necessarily inferred from the\r\ndisposition on appeal.'\"  Field v. Mans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198162\"><a href=\"/opinion/198162/field-v-mans/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir.\r\n1998); see also Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683508\"><a href=\"/opinion/683508/commercial-union-insurance-company-v-walbrook-insurance-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 770 (1st Cir. 1994).  While a future court is not bound\r\nby non-essential dicta, it \"must implement both the letter and\r\nspirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court's\r\nopinion and the circumstances it embraces.\"  United States v.\r\nConnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194971\"><a href=\"/opinion/194971/united-states-v-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (1st Cir. 1993).  Our conclusion in our\r\nfirst opinion that Appleyard Motor's profits were \"effectively\r\neliminated\" was based on the testimony of Gerard Felise, vice\r\npresident and chief financial officer of JWD and the testimony of\r\nthe accountant for Appleyard that prior to its sale to JWD,\r\nAppleyard Motor's profits were $200,000-$300,000 a year.  The\r\nmagistrate judge did not question the credibility of either of\r\nthese witnesses.  The law of the case established that all profits\r\nwere eliminated.\r\nGiven the law of the case, the undisputed evidence, and\r\nthe conclusion that the value of the business was the sum of its\r\nequipment value and goodwill, we disagree with the magistrate's\r\ndetermination that there was insufficient evidence to decide the\r\ncase.  It follows that we disagree with the magistrate judge's\r\nruling that the record was \"insufficient to enable a rational\r\nfactfinder to determine with a reasonable degree of certainty what\r\ndamages defendant suffered as a result of plaintiff's\r\nmisrepresentation or breach of warranty.\"  Moreover, after reading\r\nthe magistrate judge's opinion carefully, we have difficulty\r\nunderstanding how defendant could have proven to the magistrate\r\njudge's satisfaction that JWD had suffered any damages by reason of\r\nthe false representation.\r\nWe, therefore, rule that it was error for the magistrate\r\njudge to, in effect, penalize defendant for not producing\r\nadditional evidence.\r\nThis means that we reject plaintiff's argument that\r\ndefendant waived his right to proceed on the merits when he elected\r\nnot to provide additional evidence after he was invited to do so. \r\nThe magistrate judge did not in fact rule that defendant had waived\r\nhis claim.  After summarizing the reasons why he could not decide\r\nthe damages without additional evidence, he stated:\r\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the\r\nDecision on Remand, and in light of\r\ndefendant's decision not to present additional\r\nevidence regarding damages, the clerk is\r\nhereby ORDERED to enter judgment in favor of\r\nplaintiff, Lucy Appleyard, in the amount of\r\n$369,288, being the amount of principal,\r\ninterest, and late charges to which plaintiff\r\nproved she was entitled, before any offset for\r\ndamages suffered by JWD as a result of the\r\nmisrepresentation or breach of warranty by\r\nplaintiff's predecessor.\r\n\nBecause of the magistrate judge's refusal to follow our\r\nclear holdings and rulings, we rule that defendant had the right to\r\nappeal the judgment of the magistrate judge and proceed on the\r\nrecord before the court.\r\nThe final issue is:  in light of our rulings and findings\r\non the applicability of the \"law of the case\" doctrine, how should\r\nwe proceed.  We are reluctant to remand the case again to another\r\njudge for another determination of damages.  There are certain\r\ncircumstances where remand can be dispensed with, such as where the\r\nrecord permits only one rational answer or where repeated efforts\r\nat factfinding have resulted in confused or unsupportable findings. \r\nSee, e.g., Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196480\"><a href=\"/opinion/196480/knapp-shoes-inc-v-sylvania-shoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (1st Cir. 1995) (in lieu of remand, sorting through record\r\nto distinguish findings as to which deference is due and tainted\r\nfindings as to which deference is not owed); Williams v. Poulos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195087\"><a href=\"/opinion/195087/williams-v-poulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (1st Cir. 1993) (describing conditions under which\r\n\"court of appeals [itself] can, and often should,\" fix an error). \r\nThis is such a situation.  There is evidence in the record\r\nsufficiently clear and uncontested to allow us to make the\r\nnecessary findings to terminate the case at the appellate level.\r\nThe following facts are uncontroverted.  Appleyard Motor\r\nand JWD executed a purchase and sale agreement on November 23,\r\n1988.  Under its terms JWD purchased the business and tangible\r\nassets of Appleyard for $800,000.  Five hundred thousand dollars of\r\nthe purchase price was paid in cash.  The balance of $300,000 was\r\nto be made in thirty-five monthly payments.  A total of $106,481.76\r\nwas paid on the note.  JWD had paid a total of $606,481.76 to\r\nAppleyard before it stopped payments on the note as of November\r\n1989.  In January of 1990 JWD filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy\r\npetition.\r\nThe magistrate judge found in his first opinion, based\r\nupon the testimony of Gerard Felise, that the false representation \r\n\"resulted in a loss of customers and a $300,000 annual decline in\r\nrevenue associated with the former AMT operation.\"  See infra at 5. \r\nThis finding was clearly correct.  The evidence is that Felise took\r\nover the operation of both companies in 1989. \r\nWe make the following rulings:  Because of the raise in\r\nrates put into effect by Felise, JWD received $300,000 less in\r\nrevenue from its Appleyard operation.  This was due to the fact\r\nthat when the rates were raised in 1989 to meet federal work-hour\r\nrequirements, Appleyard lost customers.  Appleyard's annual profits\r\nhad ranged between $200,000 to $300,000 a year.  After the rates\r\nhad been raised but rejected by its customer, Appleyard could no\r\nlonger operate at a profit.  After JWD filed for bankruptcy in\r\nJanuary of 1990, Appleyard also ceased to exist as an operating\r\nbusiness.  The false representation by Appleyard caused the demise\r\nof both businesses.\r\nBased on these undisputed facts, we conclude that\r\ndefendant has no obligation to make any further payments to\r\nplaintiff.  Defendant has expressly waived any sums that might be\r\ndue under the offset provision of the purchase and sale agreement. \r\nThis means, of course, that he cannot attempt to collect any money\r\nthat might theoretically be due from plaintiff either individually \r\nor as a former officer of Appleyard Motors.\r\nThe judgment below is reversed and remanded with\r\ndirections to the district court to enter judgment in favor of\r\ndefendant, John W. Douglass, Jr.\r\nNo costs to either party on appeal.\r\n</pre>",
