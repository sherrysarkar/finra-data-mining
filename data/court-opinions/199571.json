Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Edward C. Roy, Jr., Esq. and Roy & Cook on brief for\nappellant.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart and Terrence P.

Darby appeals from the\n\nsentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised\n\nrelease.     The single issue he raises is that the sentencing\n\ncourt     erred    in   applying     the    United   States      Sentencing\n\nGuidelines by not reducing his “offense level” for his\n\nacceptance of responsibility for the supervised release\n\nviolations.\n\n            This    court      has   not    definitively    stated    what\n\nstandard of review applies to its review of revocation\n\nsentences. See United States v. Ramirez-Rivera, 241 F.3d 37,\n\n40 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001).           However, it has noted that all the\n\ncourts of appeal “agree upon a deferential standard of\n\nappellate    review.”       Id.      To    the   extent   that    there   is\n\nvariation among the circuit courts in the standards applied,\n\nit is between an abuse of discretion standard and something\n\nmore deferential, such as a “plainly unreasonable” standard.\n\nSee id.    For purposes of this appeal, we leave the standard-\n\nof-review issue unresolved and apply the less deferential\n\n“abuse of discretion” standard.\n\n            “Violations of probation and supervised release are\n\nnot subject to the adjustments of offense level for which\n\nprovision    is    made   in      chapter    three   of   the    Sentencing\n\nGuidelines. See ch. 7, pt. A.              Indeed, an entirely separate\n\f‘Revocation Table,’ rather than the generally applicable\n\n‘Sentencing Table,’ is provided for violations of probation\n\nand supervised release, and the Revocation Table does not\n\nemploy offense levels. See U.S.S.G. § 7 B1.4, p.s.”                          United\n\nStates v. Grasso, 6 F.3d 87, 88 (2d Cir. 1993).                          Therefore,\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\nDarby    a    reduction        in     offense      level    for    acceptance      of\n\nresponsibility.\n\n              Darby’s brief also suggests that the district court\n\nmay have mistakenly believed that it lacked discretion to\n\ndepart downward from the range of imprisonment dictated by\n\nthe Revocation Table in chapter seven of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.            The record does not support that argument,\n\nhowever.          If the court had wanted to depart, but felt\n\nconstrained by the imprisonment range, then it would have\n\nimposed a sentence at the bottom of that range: 8 months.\n\nInstead, it imposed an 11-month sentence, in the middle of\n\nthe 8-to-14-month range.                   Nothing that the district court\n\nsaid    during        the    sentencing       hearings      suggested      that    it\n\nbelieved it lacked authority to depart below that range.\n\nInstead, the court emphasized that it was influenced in its\n\nchoice       of   a    sentence       by    the    need     to   drive    home    the\n\nseriousness           of    Darby’s    drug       problem    and   his    repeated\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fviolations of the law related thereto. The court expressly\n\nfound that the magistrate judge had taken Darby’s acceptance\n\nof responsibility into account in arriving at a sentence\n\nrecommendation.\n\n         The district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\nDarby’s sentence is affirmed.
