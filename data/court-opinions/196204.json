The presence of so opulent\r\n\na vehicle in so  bucolic a setting piqued the  taxman's interest.\r\n\nHe initiated  an investigation  that led,  in  succession, to  an\r\n\naudit,  an indictment, a trial,  and a conviction  for income tax\r\n\nevasion pursuant to  a jury  verdict.1  The  district court  then\r\n\ntrumped the jury's verdict,  granting the defendants' motions for\r\n\njudgments of acquittal.  See United States v. Olbres, Cr. No. 93-\r                                                              \r\n\n27-1-2-M (D.N.H. Sept. 30,  1994) (D. Ct. Op.).2   The government\r\n\nappeals.  We reinstate the convictions.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We    start    by    relating   certain    (essentially\r\n\nuncontradicted) facts that serve  to put the appeal into  initial\r\n\nperspective.   In 1974, the Olbreses   he an industrial designer,\r\n\nshe a schoolteacher destined to become a self-taught bookkeeper  \r\n\nlaunched a proprietorship, Design Consultants (DC),  to conceive,\r\n\nconstruct, and erect exhibit  booths for trade shows.   At first,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The statute of conviction provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          Any  person  who  willfully  attempts  in any\r\n          manner to evade or  defeat any tax imposed by\r\n          [the  Internal Revenue  Code] or  the payment\r\n          thereof shall, in addition to other penalties\r\n          provided by law, be guilty of a felony . . .\r\n\n26 U.S.C.   7201 (1988).\r\n\n     2Although  the   district  court's  thoughtful   opinion  is\r\nunpublished, the  interested  reader can  locate  it at  1994  WL\r\n543520.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthe proprietors comprised  the entire work  force.  The  business\r\n\ngrew  steadily,  and  by 1987  DC  employed  23  persons and  had\r\n\nrevenues in excess of $1,900,000.  Despite the  phenomenal growth\r\n\nof the business,  Shirley Olbres continued  to handle the  books,\r\n\ntoiling  part-time,  mostly  at  home.    Her  working  materials\r\n\nconsisted of an invoice log (in which she recorded bills sent and\r\n\npayments  received), and three journals reflecting, respectively,\r\n\ncash receipts, cash disbursements, and petty cash.\r\n\n          Beginning in 1976, the defendants retained the services\r\n\nof an accountant,  Wilson Dennett.   Dennett compiled income  tax\r\n\nreturns and financial statements, but did not perform bookkeeping\r\n\nor kindred services.  He prepared the tax returns in reliance  on\r\n\ninformation  supplied by  the defendants.   For  the tax  year at\r\n\nissue on this appeal   1987   Shirley Olbres drafted a summary of\r\n\nthe defendants' books and records for Dennett's use.  She and her\r\n\nhusband  then met with Dennett to answer questions.  When Dennett\r\n\ncompleted the  return,  the defendants  came  to his  office  and\r\n\nsigned it.\r\n\n          The  defendants maintained various bank accounts during\r\n\n1987.  These  included business checking and  savings accounts at\r\n\nIndian  Head Bank  (IHB).   Defendants  deposited  most of  their\r\n\nbusiness  receipts  into  the   business  checking  account,  but\r\n\noccasionally  deposited  business  receipts  into   the  business\r\n\nsavings  account.   While    Shirley  Olbres  recorded  all  sums\r\n\ndeposited into the business checking account in the cash receipts\r\n\njournal,  she did  not make  comparable entries  showing deposits\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nmade  to  the business  savings account.    During the  same time\r\n\nframe,  the defendants  also  maintained payroll  and petty  cash\r\n\naccounts at a  second bank,  and a rent-receipts  account in  the\r\n\nname of Seabrook Properties at yet a third financial institution.\r\n\n          The IRS started its investigation into the  defendants'\r\n\ntax  returns in  1989.   Revenue Agent  Leonard Kaply  pulled the\r\n\nlaboring oar.  He determined, inter alia, that the defendants had\r                                                  \r\n\nsubstantially underreported  their income on their  joint federal\r\n\nincome tax returns  for the years  1986 through 1988.   For 1987,\r\n\nKaply's audit indicated that the defendants had failed to  report\r\n\nnearly  $750,000 in  income  from three  sources:   (1)  business\r\n\nreceipts deposited directly into the business savings account and\r\n\nnot recorded in  the cash  receipts journal; (2)  rebates from  a\r\n\ntransportation company that had contracted with DC  to move trade\r\n\nshow booths from  place to  place;3 and (3)  certain income  from\r\n\nrental property.  In the course of the audit, the defendants gave\r\n\nAgent  Kaply  the cash  receipts  journal,  but  claimed to  have\r\n\nmisplaced  the invoice  log  and the  passbook  for the  business\r\n\nsavings  account (either of which would have revealed much of the\r\n\nunreported income).  It was only when the IRS issued a summons to\r\n\nIHB that  it discovered the  business savings  account, with  its\r\n\ntrove of unreported funds.\r\n\n          The IRS concluded that  the defendants willfully failed\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3For  no easily  explicable reason,  these rebates  had been\r\ndeposited into the Seabrook  Properties account, omitted from the\r\nsummary  prepared  by Mrs.  Olbres  for  Dennett's  use, and  not\r\nmentioned in the defendants' ensuing dialogue with Dennett.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nto  report substantial amounts of income on their 1986, 1987, and\r\n\n1988 federal tax returns ($150,954 in 1986, $748,991 in 1987, and\r\n\n$175,432 in  1988).  The defendants  conceded the underreporting,\r\n\nbut denied  criminal responsibility, saying that  they lacked any\r\n\nintent  to defraud.4  A federal grand jury returned a three-count\r\n\nindictment charging the  defendants with willfully  attempting to\r\n\nevade income tax for those three years.  The case was tried  to a\r\n\njury.  The defendants moved for judgments of acquittal at the end\r\n\nof the government's case,  and again when both sides  had rested.\r\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).  The district court  denied the first\r             \r\n\nset of motions and reserved decision on the second set.  See Fed.\r                                                                      \r\n\nR. Crim. P. 29(b).  On January 24, 1994, the jury reached a split\r\n\ndecision:   it found the defendants not  guilty on count 1 (1986)\r\n\nand count 3 (1988), but guilty on count 2 (1987).\r\n\n          After  a gestation  period of  nearly nine  months, the\r\n\ndistrict court, acting  in pursuance  of the  earlier Rule  29(b)\r\n\nreservation,  granted  the defendants'  motions for  judgments of\r\n\nacquittal  on count  2.   The government  then filed  this timely\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          Our  analysis of  this case  is partitioned  into three\r\n\nsegments.  First,  we limn the  standard of  review.  Second,  we\r\n\nexamine  the  elements  of  the  offense  of conviction  and  the\r\n\nsufficiency  of the evidence.  Third, we  explain why we find the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The defendants placed much of the onus on their accountant,\r\nDennett,  who died prior  to the trial.   For the  most part, his\r\nknowledge of the facts died with him. \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ndistrict court's analysis unpersuasive.\r\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\r                               A.  Standard of Review.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Expressing the standard for  judicial review of a claim\r\n\nof   evidentiary  insufficiency   in   a  criminal   case  is   a\r\n\nstraightforward exercise.   If  the evidence presented,  taken in\r\n\nthe light most flattering  to the prosecution, together with  all\r\n\nreasonable inferences favorable to it, permits a rational jury to\r\n\nfind each  essential  element  of  the  crime  charged  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt, then  the evidence is legally  sufficient.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443  U.S. 307, 319 (1979); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGifford,  17  F.3d 462,  467 (1st  Cir.  1994); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCastro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 979 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113\r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct. 2935 (1993).   In evaluating sufficiency, both  direct and\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence  are accorded weight.   See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1994).  So long as\r                            \r\n\nthe  evidence,  taken  as   a  whole,  warrants  a   judgment  of\r\n\nconviction, \"it need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial\r\n\nto a finding of innocence.\"  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467.\r                                              \r\n\n          When, as now, a criminal defendant mounts a sufficiency\r\n\nchallenge, all the evidence, direct  and circumstantial, is to be\r\n\nviewed from the government's  coign of vantage.  Thus,  the trial\r\n\njudge  must resolve  all  evidentiary  conflicts and  credibility\r\n\nquestions  in the  prosecution's favor;  and, moreover,  as among\r\n\ncompeting  inferences, two  or more  of which are  plausible, the\r\n\njudge must choose the inference that  best fits the prosecution's\r\n\ntheory of guilt.  See  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d  967, 974\r                                                        \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995);  United States  v.

See United States v. Kirvan, 997 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n963, 967 (1st  Cir. 1993).  Like the trial  court, \"we scrutinize\r\n\nthe  evidence in  the  light most  compatible  with the  verdict,\r\n\nresolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then\r\n\nreach a judgment about  whether a rational jury could  find guilt\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 974.\r                                             \r\n\n                 B.

Pomponio,  429 U.S. 10,  12 (1976)  (per\r                                           \r\n\ncuriam) (citations  omitted).  The  trial focused on  this narrow\r\n\nissue.  The government contended that the defendants deliberately\r\n\nunderstated their 1987 income, while the defendants   who claimed\r\n\nto have signed  the return  without reading it    contended  that\r\n\nthey  were guilty only of  inadvertence, aggravated by the hiring\r\n\nof a maladroit accountant.\r\n\n          In a  tax evasion case  in which the  defendants assert\r\n\nthat  blind reliance  on their  accountant, not  criminal intent,\r\n\ncaused an underreporting,  the critical datum is not  whether the\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ndefendants  ordered the  accountant to  falsify the  return, but,\r\n\nrather, whether the  defendants knew when they  signed the return\r\n\nthat it understated their income.  See Rothrock, 806 F.2d at 321.\r                                                         \r\n\nSo here:   if the evidence  introduced at trial, taken  in a pro-\r                                                                           \r\n\ngovernment light, permitted the jury to infer that the defendants\r                          \r\n\n(a) were aware of the contents of their return, and (b) knew that\r\n\ntheir  reportable  income   significantly  exceeded  the   income\r\n\nreflected therein,  then the  jury lawfully could  find that  the\r\n\ndefendants  acted willfully,  and,  hence, violated  26 U.S.C.   \r\n\n7201.   See,  e.g., United  States v.  Gaines, 690 F.2d  849, 855\r                                                       \r\n\n(11th Cir. 1982).   We turn  to this  two-part inquiry, and  then\r\n\nbuttress the results with additional evidence of willfulness.\r\n\n          1.   Knowledge of the Return's Contents.  This facet of\r                    1.   Knowledge of the Return's Contents.\r                                                           \r\n\nthe inquiry  need not occupy us for long.  A jury may permissibly\r\n\ninfer  that a taxpayer read his return and knew its contents from\r\n\nthe bare fact that he signed it.  See United States v. Drape, 668\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 22,  26  (1st  Cir.  1982)  (holding  that  the  defendant's\r\n\nsignature  on  his  return  sufficed to  establish  knowledge  of\r\n\nincorrect contents); United States v. Romanow, 505 F.2d 813,  814\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1974) (dismissing taxpayer's  denial that he  had read\r\n\ntax  form,  and stating  that  \"it  is clear  that  a jury  could\r\n\ndisbelieve  him and conclude from  nothing more than the presence\r\n\nof  his uncontested  signature  that he  had  in fact  read\"  the\r\n\ndocument).\r\n\n          Here,  moreover,   the   jury  had   before  it   other\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence  indicating that the  defendants knew the\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ncontents of their return.   Dennett's wife, who worked  with him,\r\n\ntestified that when Dennett prepared  a tax return for signature,\r\n\nthe  return was bundled  into a  packet with  a cover  sheet that\r\n\nsummarized its contents.   The bottom portion of the  cover sheet\r\n\ncontained  the  bill  for  the  tax  preparation services.    The\r\n\ndefendants testified that it  was their habit to go  to Dennett's\r\n\noffice, sign  the completed return, and  pay the bill.   The jury\r\n\ncould  reasonably  infer   that,  in  order  to  have   paid  the\r\n\naccountant's bill, the  defendants must have read  the portion of\r\n\nthe cover sheet that detailed the return's contents.\r\n\n          2.    Knowledge  of   the  Understatement.    The  most\r                    2.    Knowledge  of   the  Understatement.\r                                                             \r\n\ncompelling  proof  that  the  defendants  knew  that  the  figure\r\n\nreported on  their 1987  return  substantially understated  their\r\n\ntrue  income is the product of simple arithmetic.  Tama Mitchell,\r\n\na government  witness, analyzed  the defendants' 1987  return and\r\n\nfound that the disposable  funds available to them in  that year,\r\n\nbased  on  the  information  contained in  the  return,  totalled\r\n\n$24,695.   Mitchell  further testified  that the  defendants made\r\n\nexpenditures  of more  than $620,656  during the  year.5   In the\r\n\nsame period, their overall savings  increased by $334,003.  After\r\n\nsubtracting net  deposits of  loan proceeds, Mitchell's  analysis\r\n\ndemonstrated  that  the  defendants'  combined  expenditures  and\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Mitchell's computations did not include all the defendants'\r\nannual expenditures,  but established a baseline by concentrating\r\non  major  cash purchases  during the  year,  e.g., an  outlay of\r                                                            \r\n$158,000 in June to purchase a Rolls Royce  Corniche convertible;\r\nan outlay  of $32,450 in August to purchase a Range Rover; and an\r\ninfusion of roughly $140,000 to a brokerage account.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\naccretions to  savings in  1987  exceeded the  cash available  to\r\n\nthem, according to their tax return, by $580,989.\r\n\n          To be sure, the  evidence pertaining to the defendants'\r\n\nlavish spending is circumstantial  and suggestive, not direct and\r\n\nirrefutable.      Yet,   the   arithmetic   furnishes   a  sturdy\r\n\ninfrastructure  capable of supporting a reasonable inference that\r\n\nthe  defendants  must  have been  aware  that  their 1987  return\r\n\nsubstantially underreported  their income.  See  O'Brien, 14 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 706-07 (holding  that, despite an absence  of direct evidence,\r\n\ncircumstantial  evidence adequately supported jury's inference of\r\n\nguilty knowledge  in fraud  case); Castro-Lara,  970 F.2d  at 981\r                                                        \r\n\n(explaining that  \"circumstantial evidence, in and  of itself, is\r\n\noften  enough to ground a  conviction\"); United States v.

Even if one were to accept the defendants' self-serving\r\n\nhypothesis that the accountant's incompetence sparked the  myriad\r\n\nmisstatements  embedded  in  the  return, the  jury  could  still\r\n\nreasonably  infer that,  when the  defendants signed  the return,\r\n\nthey must have  gained an  awareness that the  numbers could  not\r\n\npossibly be accurate.  See Gaines, 690 F.2d at 855 (holding  that\r                                           \r\n\nglaring  inaccuracies  in   figures  can  support  a   reasonable\r\n\ninference  of knowledge); see also Drape, 668 F.2d at 26 (\"Intent\r                                                  \r\n\nmay  be established  where a  taxpayer  `chooses to  keep himself\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nuninformed  as  to   the  full  extent   that  [the  return]   is\r\n\ninsufficient.'\") (quoting Katz  v. United States, 321  F.2d 7, 10\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 903 (1963)).\r                                  \r\n\n          The  proposition that the  defendants knew their return\r\n\nunderstated their  income derives support from  other evidence as\r\n\nwell.    For  example,  during  1986,  Anthony  Olbres  (who  had\r\n\nunrestricted access  to DC's  books and records)  provided fiscal\r\n\nand marketing  information to  Dennett so that  the latter  could\r\n\nprepare a  financial statement  in connection with  a prospective\r\n\nsale of the  business.  When  completed, the financial  statement\r\n\nprojected  1987  revenues  in  the amount  of  $1,976,000.    The\r\n\nprojection proved  to  be  prophetic    DC's  actual  1987  gross\r\n\nreceipts totalled $2,014,059    but the defendants reported gross\r\n\nreceipts  on  the  1987  tax  return  in  a  far  smaller  amount\r\n\n($1,265,069).   Based on this  progression of events,  a rational\r\n\njury  could plausibly  infer that  Anthony Olbres  had sufficient\r\n\nknowledge  of  DC's  financial  matters  to  recognize  the  huge\r\n\ndiscrepancy between projected revenues and reported revenues, and\r\n\nto appreciate the significance  of the gap.6  Likewise,  the jury\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The   district  court   suggested   that  Anthony   Olbres'\r\nparticipation in  the preparation of the  1987 projections tended\r\nto be  exculpatory rather  than incriminatory, because  it showed\r\nthat the defendants reposed great confidence in their accountant.\r\nSee  D.  Ct. Op.  at  31.    Though  such  an  inference  may  be\r             \r\npermissible, it is not  compelled; and, given the method  of Rule\r\n29, it is the  jury's choice between alternative inferences,  not\r\nthe trial judge's  choice, that  must control.   See O'Brien,  14\r                                                                      \r\nF.3d  at  707 (warning  that judges  must  not \"usurp  the jury's\r\nprovince\"  of choosing  between  alternative inferences);  United\r                                                                           \r\nStates  v.

Other Evidence  of Willfulness.  In this  case, the\r                    3.

For one thing, the defendants themselves from time\r\n\nto time  bypassed their  business checking account  and deposited\r\n\nsubstantial amounts of money (including approximately $145,000 in\r\n\npayments  from  a  single  customer,   Digital  Equipment  Corp.)\r\n\ndirectly into  their business  savings account.   They  knew that\r\n\nthese payments constituted income, yet they neither recorded them\r\n\nin the cash receipts  journal nor reported them on their 1987 tax\r\n\nreturn.  To  make matters  worse, the two  source materials  that\r\n\nmost  easily could  have identified  the unreported income    the\r\n\ninvoice log and the  passbook for the business savings  account  \r\n\nwere    withheld   from   the    defendants'   accountant;   and,\r\n\ncoincidentally,   the   same   source    materials   conveniently\r\n\ndisappeared  during  the  IRS   audit.7    While  the  defendants\r\n\nmaintained other  books and records  from which the  existence of\r\n\nthese funds could perhaps be gleaned, see D. Ct. Op. at 31, it is\r                                                   \r\n\nreadily  evident that  a jury  plausibly could  infer  from these\r\n\nfacts that  the defendants  clumsily attempted to  conceal income\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7Joyce  Wildes, a  Dennett employee  assigned to  review the\r\ndefendants'  taxes,  testified that  she  was  not provided  with\r\neither  the log or the  passbook, and Agent  Kaply discovered the\r\nexistence  of  the business  savings  account  only by  obtaining\r\ninformation directly from IHB.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nfrom both their tax preparer and their government.\r\n\n          Of course, the defendants'  counter-argument   that the\r\n\nevidence indicates  nothing more  than that they  were remarkably\r\n\nslipshod  in  their  business  practices     is  also  plausible.\r\n\nWithal, the option to choose between these inferences belonged to\r\n\nthe jury,  not the judge, see United States v. Guerrero-Guerrero,\r                                                                          \r\n\n776 F.2d  1071, 1075 (1st Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1029\r                                                            \r\n\n(1986),   and  the  jury  had  a  perfect  right  to  reject  the\r\n\ndefendants' counter-argument and draw  the inference urged by the\r\n\ngovernment.   See  O'Brien,  14 F.3d  at  707; United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nQuejada-Zurique, 708 F.2d 857, 859  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 464\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 855 (1983).  After all, \"if the evidence can be construed in\r\n\nvarious reasonable  alternatives, the jury is  entitled to freely\r\n\nchoose from among them.\"   United States v. Smith, 680 F.2d  255,\r                                                           \r\n\n259 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1110 (1983).\r                                           \r\n\n          The evidence  anent the defendants' income  from rental\r\n\nproperty  also bolstered  the inference  of willfulness.   During\r\n\n1987, the defendants owned various  properties and rented them to\r\n\ntenants.   In 1987, Johnson Matthey Catalog  Company (J/M) rented\r\n\nspace from the defendants  in Seabrook, New Hampshire, at  a rate\r\n\nof  $48,000 per  annum.   J/M  sent a  $4,000 rent  check to  the\r\n\ndefendants' home every month.  Shirley Olbres deposited each rent\r\n\ncheck,  when  received,  into the  Seabrook  Properties  account.\r\n\nAlthough J/M  paid the full  $48,000 during 1987,  the defendants\r\n\ninformed Dennett that  they had garnered  only $30,000 in  rental\r\n\nincome  from  all their  real estate.    Thus, their  1987 return\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nfailed to include $18,000 from the avails of the J/M tenancy, and\r\n\nalso failed to  include $3,890  in rental income  referable to  a\r\n\nproperty known as \"the barn.\"  It is beyond serious question that\r\n\nthe  defendants'  action in  pegging  the J/M  lease  proceeds at\r\n\n$30,000  in the summary  they gave  to their  accountant, coupled\r\n\nwith their failure  to list  any rental income  referable to  the\r                                          \r\n\nbarn, could ground the requisite inference of criminal intent.\r\n\n          We think,  too, that the defendants'  failure to report\r\n\nsums  received   as  rebates   from  Mayflower   Transit  Company\r\n\n(Mayflower) gives rise to a founded inference of willfulness.  DC\r\n\nretained  Mayflower to  ferry exhibit  booths to  and from  trade\r\n\nshows.    The  contract   between  the  parties  stipulated  that\r\n\nMayflower  would  furnish   transportation  services  to   DC  at\r\n\ncustomary  tariff  rates,  but  then  remit  20% of  the  amounts\r\n\nactually  paid.  The rebate would be calculated monthly, based on\r\n\npayments from DC  to Mayflower.   Pursuant  to this  arrangement,\r\n\nMayflower  remitted $96,671 in 1987, but, for some reason, failed\r\n\nto  issue a 1099 form memorializing the payments.  The defendants\r\n\ndid  not report any of this money  as income on their 1987 return\r\n\n(despite the fact that  they deducted 100% of the  tariff charges\r\n\nthat they paid in the first instance).\r\n\n          Shirley  Olbres deposited  each  of  the eleven  rebate\r\n\nchecks that DC received  from Mayflower during the year  into the\r\n\nSeabrook  Properties  account even  though  that  account had  no\r\n\ndirect  connection  with  DC or  its  business.    At trial,  she\r\n\ntestified  that she  did not  know  that the  rebates constituted\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nincome.  Her husband, however, admitted that he was aware of  the\r\n\nrebates' taxable character.   We believe that, on this  record, a\r\n\nrational jury  could infer that  the concealment  of the  rebates\r\n\nresulted not from  ignorance or inadvertence but from a conscious\r\n\ndecision  on the defendants'  part to take  criminal advantage of\r\n\nMayflower's failure to issue the required 1099 form.\r\n\n          4.    Recapitulation.   To  sum  up,  the record,  read\r                    4.    Recapitulation.\r                                        \r\n\nfavorably to the  verdict, supports the following findings:   (1)\r\n\nthe  defendants signed  the 1987  tax return;  (2) they  knew the\r\n\ncontents of the return at the time they signed it,  and they knew\r\n\nthat it significantly understated  their taxable income; (3) they\r\n\nknew their  business had made  substantially more money  than the\r\n\nreturn  reflected; (4) they had  received revenues during the tax\r\n\nyear  which they knew were taxable, such as business receipts and\r\n\ntransportation rebates, yet they neither deposited those revenues\r\n\nin the business  checking account nor  recorded their receipt  in\r\n\nthe  usual manner, but,  instead, diverted the  revenues to other\r\n\nbank accounts;  (5) they deliberately understated  the amounts of\r\n\nrental income received when transmitting data to their accountant\r\n\npreliminary to the accountant's  preparation of their tax return;\r\n\nand (6) they withheld materials from the accountant  (and, later,\r\n\nfrom  the IRS auditor) that  would have pointed  to the existence\r\n\nand  extent  of  the  undeclared  income.    Notwithstanding  the\r\n\ndefendants' denials and  regardless of  the exculpatory  evidence\r\n\nthat lurked in the record, these findings enabled a rational jury\r\n\nto  conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants were\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nguilty of income tax evasion for the year 1987.\r\n\n                  C.

Nevertheless,  the court entered judgment notwithstanding\r\n\nthe  verdict  on  the ground  that  the  proof did  not  permit a\r\n\nfinding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants willfully\r\n\nfiled a  false tax return.   To the court's way  of thinking, the\r\n\ndefendants   had   articulated   a   \"hypothesis   of   innocence\r\n\n(negligence, incompetence, inattention,  and reasonable  reliance\r\n\non  the family's  long-time certified  public accountant)  . .  .\r\n\n[that was]  sufficiently reasonable and  sufficiently strong  and\r\n\nsufficiently credible that  a rational trier  of fact . .  . must\r\n\nnecessarily entertain  a reasonable doubt about defendants' guilt\r\n\n. . . .\"  Id. at 37-38.\r                       \r\n\n          Our independent review of  the record convinces us that\r\n\nthe court,  while giving lip service to the \"viewpoint\" principle\r\n\n(which holds that the evidence must be viewed, for the purpose of\r\n\nan  acquittal  motion,  in  the  light  most  flattering  to  the\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\ngovernment), subverted  the principle by isolating  each piece of\r\n\nevidence and  determining whether that evidence,  standing alone,\r\n\ngave  rise to a powerful enough inference of willfulness to allay\r\n\nany  reasonable  doubt about  the  defendants'  guilt.    In  the\r\n\nbargain, the  court appears  to have misunderstood  the interplay\r\n\nbetween  the  viewpoint   principle  and  the   reasonable  doubt\r\n\nstandard.\r\n\n          The   lower  court's  handling   of  the  rent-receipts\r\n\nevidence illustrates our concerns.   In discussing this evidence,\r\n\nthe  court   acknowledged  that  an  inference   adverse  to  the\r\n\ndefendants  could rationally  be drawn,  but concluded  that this\r\n\ninference was  not \"of  sufficient persuasive value  to establish\r\n\n[the  defendants']  knowing  intent  to  evade  taxes,  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt.\"    D.  Ct.  Op. at  33.    But  few,  if any,\r\n\ncircumstantial   evidence  cases   can  survive   this  sort   of\r\n\nbalkanization.  For  purposes of Rule  29, a broader  perspective\r\n\nmust  be employed to gauge  the prosecution's mettle.   Under the\r\n\nviewpoint principle, a jury charged with determining an accused's\r\n\nguilt  or innocence  is entitled  to consider  the evidence  as a\r\n\nseamless whole.  Jurors are \"not required to examine the evidence\r\n\nin isolation, for `individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in\r\n\nthemselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.  The sum\r\n\nof an  evidentiary  presentation may  well  be greater  than  its\r\n\nconstituent parts.'\"  United  States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d  707, 711\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992)  (quoting Bourjaily  v.

Thus,  while   the  judge\r\n\nacknowledged that the jury could rationally infer criminal intent\r\n\nin connection with Shirley Olbres' handling of the transportation\r\n\nrebates,8  he posited  that  Mrs. Olbres,  as an  \"unschooled lay\r\n\nperson,\" might  well have  misconstrued the rebates  as something\r\n\nother  than income.   D.  Ct. Op.  at 34.   By umpiring  the duel\r\n\nbetween two  competing inferences and declaring the winner on the\r\n\nbasis  of which inference appeared  more robust in  his eyes, the\r\n\njudge invaded the jury's province.\r\n\n          On a motion for judgment of acquittal   unlike, say, on\r\n\na motion for  a new trial9   it  is for the jury, not  the court,\r\n\nto  choose  between  conflicting  inferences.   In  Jackson,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\nSupreme  Court  stated  that a  court  \"faced  with  a record  of\r\n\nhistorical   facts  that  supports  conflicting  inferences  must\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The district court conceded that the evidence could sustain\r\nan inference  that Shirley  Olbres knew  the  rebate checks  were\r\ntaxable  income,  but  attempted  to hide  them,  thereby  taking\r\nadvantage of Mayflower's  failure to report  the payments to  the\r\nIRS on the required form.

Under this  directive, the judge's failure to  defer to the\r\n\npermissible inference of willfulness  arising out of, inter alia,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthe defendants'  failure to report the  rebate checks constitutes\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          There is  still another aspect of  the district court's\r\n\nmethodology  that  bears  correction.     In  finding  the  proof\r\n\ninsufficient to  convict, the  court  cited, and  relied upon,  a\r\n\nstatement to the  effect \"that  if a hypothesis  of innocence  is\r\n\nsufficiently   reasonable  and   sufficiently   strong,  then   a\r\n\nreasonable trier of fact  must necessarily entertain a reasonable\r                                        \r\n\ndoubt.\"  United States v.

Even  apart from a citation error,10  this stripped-down\r\n\nformulation,  without more, comprises  a misleading  statement of\r\n\nthe  law.   Its principal  vice is  that it  is incomplete.   The\r\n\nquoted  text fails  to reflect  a core  element of  the viewpoint\r\n\nprinciple:  the necessity of drawing inferences hospitable to the\r\n\ngovernment's theory of  the case before  judging the strength  of\r                                                 \r\n\nany proffered hypothesis of innocence.

The  district  court\r\n\nneglected this focus.   It took the snapshot head-on  (as a judge\r\n\nwould do if  presiding over  a bench trial).   Consequently,  the\r\n\ncourt acknowledged that inferences of willfulness could plausibly\r\n\nbe drawn from  much of  the evidence, but,  instead of  crediting\r\n\nthose inferences and then confronting the question of evidentiary\r\n\nsufficiency, the court  simply placed the inculpatory  inferences\r\n\non  an  equal footing  with  various  exculpatory inferences  and\r\n\nproceeded  to weigh this  mixed bag.   In other words,  the court\r\n\nneither  deferred to  the jury's  presumed choice  of alternative\r\n\ninferences, see  Jackson,  443 U.S.  at  326, nor  evaluated  the\r                                  \r\n\npotency of  the defendants' hypothesis  of innocence in  light of\r                                                                           \r\n\nthose  presumed  choices.

The presence of so opulent a vehicle in so bucolic a setting piqued the taxman's interest.  He initiated an investigation that led, in succession, to an audit, an indictment, a trial, and a conviction for income tax evasion pursuant to a jury verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court then trumped the jury's verdict, granting the defendants' motions for judgments of acquittal.  See United States v. Olbres, 881 F.Supp. 703 (D.N.H.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The government appeals.  We reinstate the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by relating certain (essentially uncontradicted) facts that serve to put the appeal into initial perspective.  In 1974, the Olbreses--he an industrial designer, she a schoolteacher destined to become a self-taught bookkeeper--launched a proprietorship, Design Consultants (DC), to conceive, construct, and erect exhibit booths for trade shows.  At first, the proprietors comprised the entire work force.  The business grew steadily, and by 1987 DC employed 23 persons and had revenues in excess of $1,900,000.  Despite the phenomenal growth of the business, Shirley Olbres continued to handle the books, toiling part-time, mostly at home.  Her working materials consisted of an invoice log (in which she recorded bills sent and payments received), and three journals reflecting, respectively, cash receipts, cash disbursements, and petty cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1976, the defendants retained the services of an accountant, Wilson Dennett.  Dennett compiled income tax returns and financial statements, but did not perform bookkeeping or kindred services.  He prepared the tax returns in reliance on information supplied by the defendants.  For the tax year at issue on this appeal--1987--Shirley Olbres drafted a summary of the defendants' books and records for Dennett's use.  She and her husband then met with Dennett to answer questions.  When Dennett completed the return, the defendants came to his office and signed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants maintained various bank accounts during 1987.  These included business checking and savings accounts at Indian Head Bank (IHB).  Defendants deposited most of their business receipts into the business checking account, but occasionally deposited business receipts into the business savings account.  While Shirley Olbres recorded all sums deposited into the business checking account in the cash receipts journal, she did not make comparable entries showing deposits made to the business savings account.  During the same time frame, the defendants also maintained payroll and petty cash accounts at a second bank, and a rent-receipts account in the name of Seabrook Properties at yet a third financial institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS started its investigation into the defendants' tax returns in 1989.  Revenue Agent Leonard Kaply pulled the laboring oar.  He determined, inter alia, that the defendants had substantially underreported their income on their joint federal income tax returns for the years 1986 through 1988.  For 1987, Kaply's audit indicated that the defendants had failed to report nearly $750,000 in income from three sources:  (1) business receipts deposited directly into the business savings account and not recorded in the cash receipts journal;  (2) rebates from a transportation company that had contracted with DC to move trade show booths from place to place;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  and (3) certain income from rental property.  In the course of the audit, the defendants gave Agent Kaply the cash receipts journal, but claimed to have misplaced the invoice log and the passbook for the business savings account (either of which would have revealed much of the unreported income).  It was only when the IRS issued a summons to IHB that it discovered the business savings account, with its trove of unreported funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS concluded that the defendants willfully failed to report substantial amounts of income on their 1986, 1987, and 1988 federal tax returns ($150,954 in 1986, $748,991 in 1987, and $175,432 in 1988).  The defendants conceded the underreporting, but denied criminal responsibility, saying that they lacked any intent to defraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment charging the defendants with willfully attempting to evade income tax for those three years.  The case was tried to a jury.  The defendants moved for judgments of acquittal at the end of the government's case, and again when both sides had rested.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).  The district court denied the first set of motions and reserved decision on the second set.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b).  On January 24, 1994, the jury reached a split decision:  it found the defendants not guilty on count 1 (1986) and count 3 (1988), but guilty on count 2 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a gestation period of nearly nine months, the district court, acting in pursuance of the earlier Rule 29(b) reservation, granted the defendants' motions for judgments of acquittal on count 2.  The government then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this case is partitioned into three segments.  First, we limn the standard of review.  Second, we examine the elements of the offense of conviction and the sufficiency of the evidence.  Third, we explain why we find the district court's analysis unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>A. Standard of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Expressing the standard for judicial review of a claim of evidentiary insufficiency in a criminal case is a straightforward exercise.  If the evidence presented, taken in the light most flattering to the prosecution, together with all reasonable inferences favorable to it, permits a rational jury to find each essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, then the evidence is legally sufficient.  See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979);  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 979 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993).  In evaluating sufficiency, both direct and circumstantial evidence are accorded weight.  See, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994).  So long as the evidence, taken as a whole, warrants a judgment of conviction, \"it need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a finding of innocence.\"  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, a criminal defendant mounts a sufficiency challenge, all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, is to be viewed from the government's coign of vantage.  Thus, the trial judge must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and credibility questions in the prosecution's favor;  and, moreover, as among competing inferences, two or more of which are plausible, the judge must choose the inference that best fits the prosecution's theory of guilt.  See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d 318, 320 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting of a motion for judgment of acquittal is subject to de novo review.  See United States v. Kirvan, 997 F.2d 963, 967 (1st Cir.1993).  Like the trial court, \"we scrutinize the evidence in the light most compatible with the verdict, resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach a judgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 974.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, our assignment is simplified.  Because the defendants do not dispute that they signed the 1987 tax return and that they substantially understated their income in the process, the question of guilt reduces to whether the underreporting occurred willfully, that is, whether it constituted \"a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty,\" United States v. Pomponio, 429 U.S. 10, 12, 97 S.Ct. 22, 23-24, 50 L.Ed.2d 12 (1976) (per curiam) (citations omitted).  The trial focused on this narrow issue.  The government contended that the defendants deliberately understated their 1987 income, while the defendants--who claimed to have signed the return without reading it--contended that they were guilty only of inadvertence, aggravated by the hiring of a maladroit accountant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a tax evasion case in which the defendants assert that blind reliance on their accountant, not criminal intent, caused an underreporting, the critical datum is not whether the defendants ordered the accountant to falsify the return, but, rather, whether the defendants knew when they signed the return that it understated their income.  See Rothrock, 806 F.2d at 321.   So here:  if the evidence introduced at trial, taken in a pro-government light, permitted the jury to infer that the defendants (a) were aware of the contents of their return, and (b) knew that their reportable income significantly exceeded the income reflected therein, then the jury lawfully could find that the defendants acted willfully, and, hence, violated 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7201.  See, e.g., United States v. Gaines, 690 F.2d 849, 855 (11th Cir.1982).  We turn to this two-part inquiry, and then buttress the results with additional evidence of willfulness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Knowledge of the Return's Contents.   This facet of the inquiry need not occupy us for long.  A jury may permissibly infer that a taxpayer read his return and knew its contents from the bare fact that he signed it.  See United States v. Drape, 668 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1982) (holding that the defendant's signature on his return sufficed to establish knowledge of incorrect contents);  United States v. Romanow, 505 F.2d 813, 814 (1st Cir.1974) (dismissing taxpayer's denial that he had read tax form, and stating that \"it is clear that a jury could disbelieve him and conclude from nothing more than the presence of his uncontested signature that he had in fact read\" the document).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the jury had before it other circumstantial evidence indicating that the defendants knew the contents of their return.  Dennett's wife, who worked with him, testified that when Dennett prepared a tax return for signature, the return was bundled into a packet with a cover sheet that summarized its contents.  The bottom portion of the cover sheet contained the bill for the tax preparation services.  The defendants testified that it was their habit to go to Dennett's office, sign the completed return, and pay the bill.  The jury could reasonably infer that, in order to have paid the accountant's bill, the defendants must have read the portion of the cover sheet that detailed the return's contents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Knowledge of the Understatement.   The most compelling proof that the defendants knew that the figure reported on their 1987 return substantially understated their true income is the product of simple arithmetic.  Tama Mitchell, a government witness, analyzed the defendants' 1987 return and found that the disposable funds available to them in that year, based on the information contained in the return, totalled $24,695.  Mitchell further testified that the defendants made expenditures of more than $620,656 during the year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In the same period, their overall savings increased by $334,003.  After subtracting net deposits of loan proceeds, Mitchell's analysis demonstrated that the defendants' combined expenditures and accretions to savings in 1987 exceeded the cash available to them, according to their tax return, by $580,989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the evidence pertaining to the defendants' lavish spending is circumstantial and suggestive, not direct and irrefutable.  Yet, the arithmetic furnishes a sturdy infrastructure capable of supporting a reasonable inference that the defendants must have been aware that their 1987 return substantially underreported their income.  See O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706-07 (holding that, despite an absence of direct evidence, circumstantial evidence adequately supported jury's inference of guilty knowledge in fraud case);  Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 981 (explaining that \"circumstantial evidence, in and of itself, is often enough to ground a conviction\");  United States v. Hurley, 957 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.)  (stating that, in proving tax evasion, \"the government [does] not need to show direct evidence of tax motivation\" so long as the jury has a sufficient circumstantial basis for inferring willfulness), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 60, 121 L.Ed.2d 28 (1992).  Even if one were to accept the defendants' self-serving hypothesis that the accountant's incompetence sparked the myriad misstatements embedded in the return, the jury could still reasonably infer that, when the defendants signed the return, they must have gained an awareness that the numbers could not possibly be accurate.  See Gaines, 690 F.2d at 855 (holding that glaring inaccuracies in figures can support a reasonable inference of knowledge);  see also Drape, 668 F.2d at 26 (\"Intent may be established where a taxpayer 'chooses to keep himself uninformed as to the full extent that [the return] is insufficient.' \")  (quoting Katz v. United States, 321 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 903, 84 S.Ct. 193, 11 L.Ed.2d 144 (1963)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposition that the defendants knew their return understated their income derives support from other evidence as well.  For example, during 1986, Anthony Olbres (who had unrestricted access to DC's books and records) provided fiscal and marketing information to Dennett so that the latter could prepare a financial statement in connection with a prospective sale of the business.  When completed, the financial statement projected 1987 revenues in the amount of $1,976,000.  The projection proved to be prophetic--DC's actual 1987 gross receipts totalled $2,014,059--but the defendants reported gross receipts on the 1987 tax return in a far smaller amount ($1,265,069).  Based on this progression of events, a rational jury could plausibly infer that Anthony Olbres had sufficient knowledge of DC's financial matters to recognize the huge discrepancy between projected revenues and reported revenues, and to appreciate the significance of the gap.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Likewise, the jury could infer from Shirley Olbres' position as DC's bookkeeper that she, too, must have recognized the massive understatement of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Other Evidence of Willfulness.   In this case, the jury heard other evidence capable of supporting a permissible inference that the defendants acted willfully in underreporting their income.  For one thing, the defendants themselves from time to time bypassed their business checking account and deposited substantial amounts of money (including approximately $145,000 in payments from a single customer, Digital Equipment Corp.) directly into their business savings account.  They knew that these payments constituted income, yet they neither recorded them in the cash receipts journal nor reported them on their 1987 tax return.  To make matters worse, the two source materials that most easily could have identified the unreported income--the invoice log and the passbook for the business savings account--were withheld from the defendants' accountant;  and, coincidentally, the same source materials conveniently disappeared during the IRS audit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  While the defendants maintained other books and records from which the existence of these funds could perhaps be gleaned, see Olbres, 881 F.Supp. at 715, it is readily evident that a jury plausibly could infer from these facts that the defendants clumsily attempted to conceal income from both their tax preparer and their government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the defendants' counter-argument--that the evidence indicates nothing more than that they were remarkably slipshod in their business practices--is also plausible.  Withal, the option to choose between these inferences belonged to the jury, not the judge, see United States v. Guerrero-Guerrero, 776 F.2d 1071, 1075 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1029, 106 S.Ct. 1233, 89 L.Ed.2d 342 (1986), and the jury had a perfect right to reject the defendants' counter-argument and draw the inference urged by the government.  See O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 707;  United States v. Quejada-Zurique, 708 F.2d 857, 859 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 855, 104 S.Ct. 173, 78 L.Ed.2d 156 (1983).  After all, \"if the evidence can be construed in various reasonable alternatives, the jury is entitled to freely choose from among them.\"  United States v. Smith, 680 F.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1110, 103 S.Ct. 738, 74 L.Ed.2d 960 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence anent the defendants' income from rental property also bolstered the inference of willfulness.  During 1987, the defendants owned various properties and rented them to tenants.  In 1987, Johnson Matthey Catalog Company (J/M) rented space from the defendants in Seabrook, New Hampshire, at a rate of $48,000 per annum.  J/M sent a $4,000 rent check to the defendants' home every month.  Shirley Olbres deposited each rent check, when received, into the Seabrook Properties account.  Although J/M paid the full $48,000 during 1987, the defendants informed Dennett that they had garnered only $30,000 in rental income from all their real estate.  Thus, their 1987 return failed to include $18,000 from the avails of the J/M tenancy, and also failed to include $3,890 in rental income referable to a property known as \"the barn.\"   It is beyond serious question that the defendants' action in pegging the J/M lease proceeds at $30,000 in the summary they gave to their accountant, coupled with their failure to list any rental income referable to the barn, could ground the requisite inference of criminal intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the defendants' failure to report sums received as rebates from Mayflower Transit Company (Mayflower) gives rise to a founded inference of willfulness.  DC retained Mayflower to ferry exhibit booths to and from trade shows.  The contract between the parties stipulated that Mayflower would furnish transportation services to DC at customary tariff rates, but then remit 20% of the amounts actually paid.  The rebate would be calculated monthly, based on payments from DC to Mayflower.  Pursuant to this arrangement, Mayflower remitted $96,671 in 1987, but, for some reason, failed to issue a 1099 form memorializing the payments.  The defendants did not report any of this money as income on their 1987 return (despite the fact that they deducted 100% of the tariff charges that they paid in the first instance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shirley Olbres deposited each of the eleven rebate checks that DC received from Mayflower during the year into the Seabrook Properties account even though that account had no direct connection with DC or its business.  At trial, she testified that she did not know that the rebates constituted income.  Her husband, however, admitted that he was aware of the rebates' taxable character.  We believe that, on this record, a rational jury could infer that the concealment of the rebates resulted not from ignorance or inadvertence but from a conscious decision on the defendants' part to take criminal advantage of Mayflower's failure to issue the required 1099 form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Recapitulation.   To sum up, the record, read favorably to the verdict, supports the following findings:  (1) the defendants signed the 1987 tax return;  (2) they knew the contents of the return at the time they signed it, and they knew that it significantly understated their taxable income;  (3) they knew their business had made substantially more money than the return reflected;  (4) they had received revenues during the tax year which they knew were taxable, such as business receipts and transportation rebates, yet they neither deposited those revenues in the business checking account nor recorded their receipt in the usual manner, but, instead, diverted the revenues to other bank accounts;  (5) they deliberately understated the amounts of rental income received when transmitting data to their accountant preliminary to the accountant's preparation of their tax return;  and (6) they withheld materials from the accountant (and, later, from the IRS auditor) that would have pointed to the existence and extent of the undeclared income.  Notwithstanding the defendants' denials and regardless of the exculpatory evidence that lurked in the record, these findings enabled a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants were guilty of income tax evasion for the year 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>C. The Judgment of Acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, steadfast in its desire to ensure the integrity of the reasonable doubt standard, undertook a painstakingly thorough examination of the record.  The court conceded that the government's case was not \"unpersuasive,\" Olbres, 881 F.Supp. at 716, that a jury \"could rationally reach\" the conclusion that the defendants willfully attempted to defraud the government in respect to their 1987 taxes, id., and that, if the court were to determine the existence of willfulness by means of a preponderance test, it would find for the government, see id. at 717.   Nevertheless, the court entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the proof did not permit a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants willfully filed a false tax return.  To the court's way of thinking, the defendants had articulated a \"hypothesis of innocence (negligence, incompetence, inattention, and reasonable reliance on the family's long-time certified public accountant) ... [that was] sufficiently reasonable and sufficiently strong and sufficiently credible that a rational trier of fact ... must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt about defendants' guilt....\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our independent review of the record convinces us that the court, while giving lip service to the \"viewpoint\" principle (which holds that the evidence must be viewed, for the purpose of an acquittal motion, in the light most flattering to the government), subverted the principle by isolating each piece of evidence and determining whether that evidence, standing alone, gave rise to a powerful enough inference of willfulness to allay any reasonable doubt about the defendants' guilt.  In the bargain, the court appears to have misunderstood the interplay between the viewpoint principle and the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court's handling of the rent-receipts evidence illustrates our concerns.  In discussing this evidence, the court acknowledged that an inference adverse to the defendants could rationally be drawn, but concluded that this inference was not \"of sufficient persuasive value to establish [the defendants'] knowing intent to evade taxes, beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Id. at 716.   But few, if any, circumstantial evidence cases can survive this sort of balkanization.  For purposes of Rule 29, a broader perspective must be employed to gauge the prosecution's mettle.  Under the viewpoint principle, a jury charged with determining an accused's guilt or innocence is entitled to consider the evidence as a seamless whole.  Jurors are \"not required to examine the evidence in isolation, for 'individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.  The sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.' \"   United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2780-81, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993).  Here, though no one piece of evidence laid bare the defendants' intent, the aggregate evidence, taken most hospitably to the prosecution (as the viewpoint principle demands), was equal to the task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court's treatment of the evidence anent transportation rebates illustrates another (related) shortcoming in the court's inchmeal approach to evidentiary sufficiency:  the court not only took each piece of evidence in isolation, but weighed the several possible inferences associated with each piece, and chose between them.  Thus, while the judge acknowledged that the jury could rationally infer criminal intent in connection with Shirley Olbres' handling of the transportation rebates,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> he posited that Mrs. Olbres, as an \"unschooled lay person,\" might well have misconstrued the rebates as something other than income.  Olbres, 881 F.Supp. at 716.   By umpiring the duel between two competing inferences and declaring the winner on the basis of which inference appeared more robust in his eyes, the judge invaded the jury's province.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a motion for judgment of acquittalunlike, say, on a motion for a new trial<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>--it is for the jury, not the court, to choose between conflicting inferences.  In Jackson, the Supreme Court stated that a court \"faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume--even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record--that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\"  443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2793.   Under this directive, the judge's failure to defer to the permissible inference of willfulness arising out of, inter alia, the defendants' failure to report the rebate checks constitutes error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is still another aspect of the district court's methodology that bears correction.  In finding the proof insufficient to convict, the court cited, and relied upon, a statement to the effect \"that if a hypothesis of innocence is sufficiently reasonable and sufficiently strong, then a reasonable trier of fact must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Bell, 678 F.2d 547, 550 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc) (Anderson, J., concurring) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted), aff'd on other grounds, 462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983).  Even apart from a citation error,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> this stripped-down formulation, without more, comprises a misleading statement of the law.  Its principal vice is that it is incomplete.  The quoted text fails to reflect a core element of the viewpoint principle:  the necessity of drawing inferences hospitable to the government's theory of the case before judging the strength of any proffered hypothesis of innocence.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In analyzing a motion for judgment of acquittal, a court is obliged to take, and then to scrutinize, a snapshot of the case--but, as we have made clear on other occasions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> the snapshot only can be taken after focusing the lens of inquiry at an angle favorable to the prosecution.  The district court neglected this focus.  It took the snapshot head-on (as a judge would do if presiding over a bench trial).  Consequently, the court acknowledged that inferences of willfulness could plausibly be drawn from much of the evidence, but, instead of crediting those inferences and then confronting the question of evidentiary sufficiency, the court simply placed the inculpatory inferences on an equal footing with various exculpatory inferences and proceeded to weigh this mixed bag.  In other words, the court neither deferred to the jury's presumed choice of alternative inferences, see Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2792-93, nor evaluated the potency of the defendants' hypothesis of innocence in light of those presumed choices.   This improper focus emptied the viewpoint principle of its essential meaning (causing the court to usurp the jury's function) and produced a snapshot that distorted, rather than accurately depicted, the Rule 29 record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  It is trite, but true, that a court \"ought not disturb, on the ground of insufficient evidence, a jury verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the record.\"  Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.   While there may well be cases in which the government's proof founders in the \"realm between preponderance and 'beyond reasonable doubt,' \"  Olbres, 881 F.Supp. at 712, see also Hon.  Jon O. Newman, Beyond \"Reasonable Doubt\", 68 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 979, 986-88 (1993) (criticizing the perceived toothlessness of appellate application of the reasonable doubt standard in review of evidentiary insufficiency claims), this case is not of that genre.

The presence of so opulent a vehicle in so bucolic a setting piqued the taxman's interest.  He initiated an investigation that led, in succession, to an audit, an indictment, a trial, and a conviction for income tax evasion pursuant to a jury verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court then trumped the jury's verdict, granting the defendants' motions for judgments of acquittal.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></span> (D.N.H.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The government appeals.  We reinstate the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by relating certain (essentially uncontradicted) facts that serve to put the appeal into initial perspective.  In 1974, the Olbreses--he an industrial designer, she a schoolteacher destined to become a self-taught bookkeeper--launched a proprietorship, Design Consultants (DC), to conceive, construct, and erect exhibit booths for trade shows.  At first, the proprietors comprised the entire work force.  The business grew steadily, and by 1987 DC employed 23 persons and had revenues in excess of $1,900,000.  Despite the phenomenal growth of the business, Shirley Olbres continued to handle the books, toiling part-time, mostly at home.  Her working materials consisted of an invoice log (in which she recorded bills sent and payments received), and three journals reflecting, respectively, cash receipts, cash disbursements, and petty cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1976, the defendants retained the services of an accountant, Wilson Dennett.  Dennett compiled income tax returns and financial statements, but did not perform bookkeeping or kindred services.  He prepared the tax returns in reliance on information supplied by the defendants.  For the tax year at issue on this appeal--1987--Shirley Olbres drafted a summary of the defendants' books and records for Dennett's use.  She and her husband then met with Dennett to answer questions.  When Dennett completed the return, the defendants came to his office and signed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants maintained various bank accounts during 1987.  These included business checking and savings accounts at Indian Head Bank (IHB).  Defendants deposited most of their business receipts into the business checking account, but occasionally deposited business receipts into the business savings account.  While Shirley Olbres recorded all sums deposited into the business checking account in the cash receipts journal, she did not make comparable entries showing deposits made to the business savings account.  During the same time frame, the defendants also maintained payroll and petty cash accounts at a second bank, and a rent-receipts account in the name of Seabrook Properties at yet a third financial institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS started its investigation into the defendants' tax returns in 1989.  Revenue Agent Leonard Kaply pulled the laboring oar.  He determined, inter alia, that the defendants had substantially underreported their income on their joint federal income tax returns for the years 1986 through 1988.  For 1987, Kaply's audit indicated that the defendants had failed to report nearly $750,000 in income from three sources:  (1) business receipts deposited directly into the business savings account and not recorded in the cash receipts journal;  (2) rebates from a transportation company that had contracted with DC to move trade show booths from place to place;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  and (3) certain income from rental property.  In the course of the audit, the defendants gave Agent Kaply the cash receipts journal, but claimed to have misplaced the invoice log and the passbook for the business savings account (either of which would have revealed much of the unreported income).  It was only when the IRS issued a summons to IHB that it discovered the business savings account, with its trove of unreported funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS concluded that the defendants willfully failed to report substantial amounts of income on their 1986, 1987, and 1988 federal tax returns ($150,954 in 1986, $748,991 in 1987, and $175,432 in 1988).  The defendants conceded the underreporting, but denied criminal responsibility, saying that they lacked any intent to defraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment charging the defendants with willfully attempting to evade income tax for those three years.  The case was tried to a jury.  The defendants moved for judgments of acquittal at the end of the government's case, and again when both sides had rested.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).  The district court denied the first set of motions and reserved decision on the second set.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b).  On January 24, 1994, the jury reached a split decision:  it found the defendants not guilty on count 1 (1986) and count 3 (1988), but guilty on count 2 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a gestation period of nearly nine months, the district court, acting in pursuance of the earlier Rule 29(b) reservation, granted the defendants' motions for judgments of acquittal on count 2.  The government then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this case is partitioned into three segments.  First, we limn the standard of review.  Second, we examine the elements of the offense of conviction and the sufficiency of the evidence.  Third, we explain why we find the district court's analysis unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>A. Standard of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Expressing the standard for judicial review of a claim of evidentiary insufficiency in a criminal case is a straightforward exercise.  If the evidence presented, taken in the light most flattering to the prosecution, together with all reasonable inferences favorable to it, permits a rational jury to find each essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, then the evidence is legally sufficient.

Virginia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span> (1993).  In evaluating sufficiency, both direct and circumstantial evidence are accorded weight.  See, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661452\"><a href=\"/opinion/661452/43-socsecrepser-489-medicaremedicaid-guide-p-42092-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 706 (1st Cir.1994).  So long as the evidence, taken as a whole, warrants a judgment of conviction, \"it need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a finding of innocence.\"  Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, a criminal defendant mounts a sufficiency challenge, all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, is to be viewed from the government's coign of vantage.  Thus, the trial judge must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and credibility questions in the prosecution's favor;  and, moreover, as among competing inferences, two or more of which are plausible, the judge must choose the inference that best fits the prosecution's theory of guilt.  See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 974 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Like the trial court, \"we scrutinize the evidence in the light most compatible with the verdict, resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach a judgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 974.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, our assignment is simplified.  Because the defendants do not dispute that they signed the 1987 tax return and that they substantially understated their income in the process, the question of guilt reduces to whether the underreporting occurred willfully, that is, whether it constituted \"a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty,\" United States v. Pomponio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109549\"><a href=\"/opinion/109549/united-states-v-pomponio/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109549\"><a href=\"/opinion/109549/united-states-v-pomponio/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span> (1976) (per curiam) (citations omitted).  The trial focused on this narrow issue.  The government contended that the defendants deliberately understated their 1987 income, while the defendants--who claimed to have signed the return without reading it--contended that they were guilty only of inadvertence, aggravated by the hiring of a maladroit accountant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a tax evasion case in which the defendants assert that blind reliance on their accountant, not criminal intent, caused an underreporting, the critical datum is not whether the defendants ordered the accountant to falsify the return, but, rather, whether the defendants knew when they signed the return that it understated their income.  See Rothrock, 806 F.2d at 321.   So here:  if the evidence introduced at trial, taken in a pro-government light, permitted the jury to infer that the defendants (a) were aware of the contents of their return, and (b) knew that their reportable income significantly exceeded the income reflected therein, then the jury lawfully could find that the defendants acted willfully, and, hence, violated 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7201.  See, e.g., United States v. Gaines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409498\"><a href=\"/opinion/409498/united-states-v-solomon-gaines/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 855 (11th Cir.1982).  We turn to this two-part inquiry, and then buttress the results with additional evidence of willfulness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Knowledge of the Return's Contents.   This facet of the inquiry need not occupy us for long.  A jury may permissibly infer that a taxpayer read his return and knew its contents from the bare fact that he signed it.  See United States v. Drape, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398637\"><a href=\"/opinion/398637/united-states-v-gardner-s-drape/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1982) (holding that the defendant's signature on his return sufficed to establish knowledge of incorrect contents);  United States v. Romanow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322904\"><a href=\"/opinion/322904/united-states-v-bernard-h-romanow/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 814 (1st Cir.1974) (dismissing taxpayer's denial that he had read tax form, and stating that \"it is clear that a jury could disbelieve him and conclude from nothing more than the presence of his uncontested signature that he had in fact read\" the document).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the jury had before it other circumstantial evidence indicating that the defendants knew the contents of their return.  Dennett's wife, who worked with him, testified that when Dennett prepared a tax return for signature, the return was bundled into a packet with a cover sheet that summarized its contents.  The bottom portion of the cover sheet contained the bill for the tax preparation services.  The defendants testified that it was their habit to go to Dennett's office, sign the completed return, and pay the bill.  The jury could reasonably infer that, in order to have paid the accountant's bill, the defendants must have read the portion of the cover sheet that detailed the return's contents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Knowledge of the Understatement.   The most compelling proof that the defendants knew that the figure reported on their 1987 return substantially understated their true income is the product of simple arithmetic.  Tama Mitchell, a government witness, analyzed the defendants' 1987 return and found that the disposable funds available to them in that year, based on the information contained in the return, totalled $24,695.  Mitchell further testified that the defendants made expenditures of more than $620,656 during the year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In the same period, their overall savings increased by $334,003.  After subtracting net deposits of loan proceeds, Mitchell's analysis demonstrated that the defendants' combined expenditures and accretions to savings in 1987 exceeded the cash available to them, according to their tax return, by $580,989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the evidence pertaining to the defendants' lavish spending is circumstantial and suggestive, not direct and irrefutable.  Yet, the arithmetic furnishes a sturdy infrastructure capable of supporting a reasonable inference that the defendants must have been aware that their 1987 return substantially underreported their income.  See O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706-07 (holding that, despite an absence of direct evidence, circumstantial evidence adequately supported jury's inference of guilty knowledge in fraud case);  Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 981 (explaining that \"circumstantial evidence, in and of itself, is often enough to ground a conviction\");  United States v.

Even if one were to accept the defendants' self-serving hypothesis that the accountant's incompetence sparked the myriad misstatements embedded in the return, the jury could still reasonably infer that, when the defendants signed the return, they must have gained an awareness that the numbers could not possibly be accurate.  See Gaines, 690 F.2d at 855 (holding that glaring inaccuracies in figures can support a reasonable inference of knowledge);  see also Drape, 668 F.2d at 26 (\"Intent may be established where a taxpayer 'chooses to keep himself uninformed as to the full extent that [the return] is insufficient.' \")  (quoting Katz v.

For example, during 1986, Anthony Olbres (who had unrestricted access to DC's books and records) provided fiscal and marketing information to Dennett so that the latter could prepare a financial statement in connection with a prospective sale of the business.  When completed, the financial statement projected 1987 revenues in the amount of $1,976,000.  The projection proved to be prophetic--DC's actual 1987 gross receipts totalled $2,014,059--but the defendants reported gross receipts on the 1987 tax return in a far smaller amount ($1,265,069).  Based on this progression of events, a rational jury could plausibly infer that Anthony Olbres had sufficient knowledge of DC's financial matters to recognize the huge discrepancy between projected revenues and reported revenues, and to appreciate the significance of the gap.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Likewise, the jury could infer from Shirley Olbres' position as DC's bookkeeper that she, too, must have recognized the massive understatement of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Other Evidence of Willfulness.   In this case, the jury heard other evidence capable of supporting a permissible inference that the defendants acted willfully in underreporting their income.  For one thing, the defendants themselves from time to time bypassed their business checking account and deposited substantial amounts of money (including approximately $145,000 in payments from a single customer, Digital Equipment Corp.) directly into their business savings account.  They knew that these payments constituted income, yet they neither recorded them in the cash receipts journal nor reported them on their 1987 tax return.  To make matters worse, the two source materials that most easily could have identified the unreported income--the invoice log and the passbook for the business savings account--were withheld from the defendants' accountant;  and, coincidentally, the same source materials conveniently disappeared during the IRS audit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  While the defendants maintained other books and records from which the existence of these funds could perhaps be gleaned, see Olbres, 881 F.Supp. at 715, it is readily evident that a jury plausibly could infer from these facts that the defendants clumsily attempted to conceal income from both their tax preparer and their government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the defendants' counter-argument--that the evidence indicates nothing more than that they were remarkably slipshod in their business practices--is also plausible.  Withal, the option to choose between these inferences belonged to the jury, not the judge, see United States v. Guerrero-Guerrero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460920\"><a href=\"/opinion/460920/united-states-v-hector-mario-guerrero-guerrero-united-states-v-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span>, 1075 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

During 1987, the defendants owned various properties and rented them to tenants.  In 1987, Johnson Matthey Catalog Company (J/M) rented space from the defendants in Seabrook, New Hampshire, at a rate of $48,000 per annum.  J/M sent a $4,000 rent check to the defendants' home every month.  Shirley Olbres deposited each rent check, when received, into the Seabrook Properties account.  Although J/M paid the full $48,000 during 1987, the defendants informed Dennett that they had garnered only $30,000 in rental income from all their real estate.  Thus, their 1987 return failed to include $18,000 from the avails of the J/M tenancy, and also failed to include $3,890 in rental income referable to a property known as \"the barn.\"   It is beyond serious question that the defendants' action in pegging the J/M lease proceeds at $30,000 in the summary they gave to their accountant, coupled with their failure to list any rental income referable to the barn, could ground the requisite inference of criminal intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think, too, that the defendants' failure to report sums received as rebates from Mayflower Transit Company (Mayflower) gives rise to a founded inference of willfulness.  DC retained Mayflower to ferry exhibit booths to and from trade shows.  The contract between the parties stipulated that Mayflower would furnish transportation services to DC at customary tariff rates, but then remit 20% of the amounts actually paid.  The rebate would be calculated monthly, based on payments from DC to Mayflower.  Pursuant to this arrangement, Mayflower remitted $96,671 in 1987, but, for some reason, failed to issue a 1099 form memorializing the payments.  The defendants did not report any of this money as income on their 1987 return (despite the fact that they deducted 100% of the tariff charges that they paid in the first instance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shirley Olbres deposited each of the eleven rebate checks that DC received from Mayflower during the year into the Seabrook Properties account even though that account had no direct connection with DC or its business.  At trial, she testified that she did not know that the rebates constituted income.  Her husband, however, admitted that he was aware of the rebates' taxable character.  We believe that, on this record, a rational jury could infer that the concealment of the rebates resulted not from ignorance or inadvertence but from a conscious decision on the defendants' part to take criminal advantage of Mayflower's failure to issue the required 1099 form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Recapitulation.   To sum up, the record, read favorably to the verdict, supports the following findings:  (1) the defendants signed the 1987 tax return;  (2) they knew the contents of the return at the time they signed it, and they knew that it significantly understated their taxable income;  (3) they knew their business had made substantially more money than the return reflected;  (4) they had received revenues during the tax year which they knew were taxable, such as business receipts and transportation rebates, yet they neither deposited those revenues in the business checking account nor recorded their receipt in the usual manner, but, instead, diverted the revenues to other bank accounts;  (5) they deliberately understated the amounts of rental income received when transmitting data to their accountant preliminary to the accountant's preparation of their tax return;  and (6) they withheld materials from the accountant (and, later, from the IRS auditor) that would have pointed to the existence and extent of the undeclared income.  Notwithstanding the defendants' denials and regardless of the exculpatory evidence that lurked in the record, these findings enabled a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants were guilty of income tax evasion for the year 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>C. The Judgment of Acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, steadfast in its desire to ensure the integrity of the reasonable doubt standard, undertook a painstakingly thorough examination of the record.  The court conceded that the government's case was not \"unpersuasive,\" Olbres, 881 F.Supp. at 716, that a jury \"could rationally reach\" the conclusion that the defendants willfully attempted to defraud the government in respect to their 1987 taxes, id., and that, if the court were to determine the existence of willfulness by means of a preponderance test, it would find for the government, see id. at 717.   Nevertheless, the court entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the proof did not permit a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants willfully filed a false tax return.  To the court's way of thinking, the defendants had articulated a \"hypothesis of innocence (negligence, incompetence, inattention, and reasonable reliance on the family's long-time certified public accountant) ... [that was] sufficiently reasonable and sufficiently strong and sufficiently credible that a rational trier of fact ... must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt about defendants' guilt....\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our independent review of the record convinces us that the court, while giving lip service to the \"viewpoint\" principle (which holds that the evidence must be viewed, for the purpose of an acquittal motion, in the light most flattering to the government), subverted the principle by isolating each piece of evidence and determining whether that evidence, standing alone, gave rise to a powerful enough inference of willfulness to allay any reasonable doubt about the defendants' guilt.  In the bargain, the court appears to have misunderstood the interplay between the viewpoint principle and the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court's handling of the rent-receipts evidence illustrates our concerns.  In discussing this evidence, the court acknowledged that an inference adverse to the defendants could rationally be drawn, but concluded that this inference was not \"of sufficient persuasive value to establish [the defendants'] knowing intent to evade taxes, beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Id. at 716.   But few, if any, circumstantial evidence cases can survive this sort of balkanization.  For purposes of Rule 29, a broader perspective must be employed to gauge the prosecution's mettle.  Under the viewpoint principle, a jury charged with determining an accused's guilt or innocence is entitled to consider the evidence as a seamless whole.  Jurors are \"not required to examine the evidence in isolation, for 'individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.  The sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.' \"   United States v.

Thus, while the judge acknowledged that the jury could rationally infer criminal intent in connection with Shirley Olbres' handling of the transportation rebates,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> he posited that Mrs. Olbres, as an \"unschooled lay person,\" might well have misconstrued the rebates as something other than income.  Olbres, 881 F.Supp. at 716.

Even apart from a citation error,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> this stripped-down formulation, without more, comprises a misleading statement of the law.  Its principal vice is that it is incomplete.  The quoted text fails to reflect a core element of the viewpoint principle:  the necessity of drawing inferences hospitable to the government's theory of the case before judging the strength of any proffered hypothesis of innocence.

The district court neglected this focus.  It took the snapshot head-on (as a judge would do if presiding over a bench trial).  Consequently, the court acknowledged that inferences of willfulness could plausibly be drawn from much of the evidence, but, instead of crediting those inferences and then confronting the question of evidentiary sufficiency, the court simply placed the inculpatory inferences on an equal footing with various exculpatory inferences and proceeded to weigh this mixed bag.  In other words, the court neither deferred to the jury's presumed choice of alternative inferences, see Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2792-93, nor evaluated the potency of the defendants' hypothesis of innocence in light of those presumed choices.   This improper focus emptied the viewpoint principle of its essential meaning (causing the court to usurp the jury's function) and produced a snapshot that distorted, rather than accurately depicted, the Rule 29 record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.
