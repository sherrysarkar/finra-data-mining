Rafael Mercado has appealed an order of the\r                           \r\n\ndistrict court, dated October  24, 1995, which, in accordance\r\n\nwith  a  magistrate  judge's recommendation,  denied  Mercado\r\n\nleave  to file an untimely  appeal from the  January 17, 1995\r\n\ndenial of his  habeas corpus petition.  There was no error as\r\n\nthe court correctly concluded that the time within  which the\r\n\ncourt  could extend the time  for appeal had already expired.\r\n\nSee  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5).   Mercado does not contend that\r               \r\n\nhe  did not timely receive notice of the judgment denying his\r\n\nhabeas petition.  His claim that Fed. R. Civ.
