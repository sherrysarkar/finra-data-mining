Eugene W. Beaulieu, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n        Bownes and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nMark W. Pennak, Appellate Staff, Civil Division, Department of\r\nJustice, with whom Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney General, Jay\r\nP. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and Barbara L. Herwig,\r\nAppellate Staff, Civil Division, Department of Justice were on\r\nbrief for appellant United States.\r\nAlton C. Stevens with whom Marden, Dubord, Bernier &amp; Stevenswas on brief for appellant Nikhil I. Pathak.\r\nRichard L. O'Meara with whom Murray, Plumb &amp; Murray, Eric M.\r\nMehnert and Jones, Bernstein &amp; Mehnert were on consolidated brief\r\nfor plaintiffs.\r\n\nOctober 21, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  The United States and Dr. Nikhil\r\nPathak, a federal employee, appeal from the striking of the U.S.\r\nAttorney's certification that Dr. Pathak was acting within the\r\nscope of employment when he allegedly committed certain of the acts\r\nthat form the basis for claims against him.  The claims, made by\r\nKathleen Lyons, effectively charged Dr. Pathak with sexual\r\nharassment.  This appeal involves the interpretation and\r\napplication of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C.  2679(d).\r\nThe facts, as set forth below, either are undisputed or\r\nare drawn from the complaint (and thus represent allegations taken\r\nas true only for purpose of this appeal).  From 1989 to 1995,\r\nKathleen Lyons was a head nurse in the renal dialysis unit of the\r\nVeterans Administration hospital in Togus, Maine.  Her supervisor\r\nwas Dr. Nikhil Pathak.  According to Lyons, Dr. Pathak made\r\nadvances to her while she and the doctor were attending a\r\nnephrology conference in Chicago in June 1994.\r\nLyons says that when she spurned Dr. Pathak, he\r\nretaliated against her by (for example) not talking to her at work,\r\nchallenging her laboratory test requests, and writing up a\r\ncomplaint against her.  Lyons claims that Dr. Pathak also made\r\nharassing comments, suggested that the dialysis unit might be\r\nclosed, withdrew the unit from a research study, and questioned a\r\npolice officer about missing log books, apparently implying that\r\nLyons was somehow responsible for them.  Lyons also says that the\r\ndoctor inappropriately pushed her during the Chicago trip and\r\ninappropriately hugged her at the hospital in Maine.\r\nIn August 1995, Lyons filed suit in the federal district\r\ncourt.  Putting aside a civil rights conspiracy claim later\r\ndismissed, the complaint charged the Secretary of the Department of\r\nVeterans Affairs as an employer with violations of Title VII, 42\r\nU.S.C.  2000e et seq., and charged Dr. Pathak with state law\r\nclaims for infliction of emotional distress, slander, and assault\r\nand battery.  The federal and state claims were separated for\r\npurposes of trial, and Lyons prevailed in a jury trial on the Title\r\nVII claims, obtaining a $375,000 judgment against the government;\r\nthat judgment is apparently not yet final due to the continuing\r\npendency of Lyons' state-law claims against Dr. Pathak.\r\nUnder the Westfall Act, the Attorney General can certify\r\nthat a federal employee named as a defendant in a civil case was\r\n\"acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of\r\nthe incident\" that serves as the basis for a tort claim against\r\nthat employee.  28 U.S.C.  2679(d)(1).  If the certification\r\nstands, the defendant federal employee is immune from suit on\r\nclaims arising from certified conduct, and the United States is\r\nsubstituted as the defendant with regard to those claims.  Id. \r\n2679(b)(1), (d)(1).  The employee can also petition the court to\r\norder certification if the Attorney General has wrongly refused to\r\ncertify.  Id.  2679(d)(3).\r\nOn March 19, 1997, the U.S. Attorney for the District of\r\nMaine certified that Dr. Pathak was generally acting within the\r\nscope of employment \"regarding the issues directly related to\r\npatient care, clinical judgment, and hospital procedures and\r\noperations,\" including \"allegations regarding critical values,\r\nphysician's orders, rounds, and quality assurance reports.\" \r\nSpecifically, the certificate identified 22 of 240 paragraphs of\r\nthe complaint as comprising certified conduct; for example, the\r\nU.S. Attorney did not certify the alleged inappropriate hugging and\r\npushing but did certify Dr. Pathak's work complaint against Lyons,\r\nhis challenges to her test requests, and his refusals to talk to\r\nher at the hospital.\r\nScope of employment certifications by the government are\r\nreviewable by the district court.  See Gutierrez de Martinez v.Lamagno, 515 U.S. 417, 436-37 (1995).  In April 1997, Lyons moved\r\nto strike the government's certificate and sought an evidentiary\r\nhearing.  Dr. Pathak, who had earlier requested certification of\r\nall of his conduct, maintained that the government had not gone far\r\nenough in its certificate.  The district court requested that all\r\nparties brief the issues and later heard oral argument.\r\nOn August 1, 1997, the district court issued an order\r\nstriking the scope certificate entirely, holding that the\r\ngovernment could not pick and choose among the alleged acts in the\r\ncomplaint; rather the court said that the correct approach was to\r\nevaluate whether in \"the totality of the circumstances, the conduct\r\nalleged in the Complaint occurred within the scope of . . .\r\nemployment.\"  Taking the complaint as a whole, the court said that\r\nsexual harassment amounting to assault and battery was clearly\r\noutside the scope of employment.  This appeal followed, the\r\ngovernment urging reinstatement of its original certificate and Dr.\r\nPathak arguing that even more acts should have been certified.\r\nAt the threshold, Lyons says that the district court's\r\norder striking the certificate is not yet reviewable.  Lyons\r\nrecognizes that denials of immunity in the district court are\r\ncustomarily subject to immediate interlocutory appeal, Behrens v.\r\nPelletier, 516 U.S. 299 (1996), with an exception not here\r\npertinent, Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 315-16 (1995), under the\r\ncollateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,\r\n337 U.S. 541 (1949).  For this purpose, qualified immunity in\r\nfederal civil rights actions and Westfall Act immunity are treated\r\nin the same fashion.  See Taboas v. Mlynczak, 149 F.3d 576, 579\r\n(7th Cir. 1998).\r\nNevertheless, Lyons says that review now is premature\r\nbecause, even if the government's certificate were reinstated, Dr.\r\nPathak would still have to stand trial for the uncertified acts\r\nalleged in the complaint.  Thus, the disruption and delay of an\r\ninterlocutory appeal would be incurred not to rescue a defendant\r\nfrom discovery and trial but merely to limit the claims against\r\nhim.  Whatever force the argument might otherwise have, it was\r\nrejected by the Supreme Court in Behrens.  There the Court said\r\nthat an interlocutory appeal lay from a denial of immunity even if\r\ngranting it would not resolve the entire case.  See 516 U.S. at\r\n311-13.\r\nTurning to the merits, the first question is to determine\r\nthe \"unit\" for which certification is appropriate under the\r\nWestfall Act.  Where a single case involves multiple claims,\r\ncertification is properly done at least down to the level of\r\nindividual claims and not for the entire case viewed as a whole. \r\nThis is evident from Behrens itself as well as other cases\r\napproving certification of some claims but not others.  E.g., De\r\nAbadia v. Izquierdo Mora, 792 F.2d 1187, 1190 (1st Cir. 1986);\r\nAraujo v. Welch, 742 F.2d 802, 805-06 (3d Cir. 1984).\r\nThe harder question is how to handle a situation in which\r\nan individual claim taken separately encompasses multiple\r\nincidents.  This question is posed by the present case; for\r\nexample, Lyons' infliction of emotional distress charge embraces a\r\nwhole series of individual incidents (e.g., hugging, a negative\r\nreport, refusing to converse).  In all likelihood, we are\r\naddressing an issue to which Congress gave no thought when it\r\nframed the Westfall Act.\r\nThe Westfall Act is an offshoot of statutes imposing\r\nliability on the federal government for such events as accidents\r\ninvolving federal-employee drivers--events in which there is\r\ncommonly a single incident (the crash) corresponding to a single\r\nclaim (driver negligence).  See Behrens, 516 U.S. at 303; Nasuti v.\r\nScannell, 906 F.2d 802, 809 (1st Cir. 1990).  While Congress surely\r\nknew that a complaint may include multiple claims, a claim\r\nsupported by many divergent acts is less common.  Indeed, neither\r\nside has found a Westfall Act case that squarely addresses the\r\nissue we now face.\r\nStatutory language--always the starting point,\r\nPetitioning Creditors of Melon Produce, Inc. v. Braunstein, 112\r\nF.3d 1232, 1237 (1st Cir. 1997)--lends some support to the\r\ngovernment's act-by-act approach.  The Westfall Act speaks of\r\ncertification not of \"the claim\" but of \"the incident out of which\r\nthe claim arose,\" 28 U.S.C.  2679(d); \"incident\" could easily be\r\nequated with \"act\" or \"event.\"  We do not think that either of\r\nLyons' counters--that the word \"incident\" appears in the singular\r\nand that other related statutory provisions (e.g., removal, 28\r\nU.S.C.  2679(d)(2)) explicitly operate on a claim-by-claim basis--\r\nare of much force.\r\nNevertheless, it is hard to make too much of this\r\nlanguage where Congress may have assumed a rough equation of\r\n\"incident\" and \"claim\" and where the problem in our case arises\r\nfrom a failure of the equation.  Nor do we have any direct evidence\r\nof congressional intent derived from legislative history.  Lyons'\r\nargument that Congress did not intend to allow certification of\r\n\"egregious misconduct,\" H.R. Rep. No. 100-700, 100th Cong., 2d\r\nSess. 5 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5945, 5949, does not\r\nseem to us to bear directly on the \"claim versus incident\" issue\r\nbefore us.\r\nIn granting Westfall Act immunity, Congress aimed to\r\nprotect federal employees against personal lawsuits growing out of\r\ntheir routine conduct of official business.  See United States v.\r\nWood, 995 F.2d 1122, 1125-26 (1st Cir. 1993).  The Federal Tort\r\nClaims Act, 28 U.S.C.  1346(b), 2671-2680, had already made the\r\ngovernment liable for certain wrongful employee conduct within \"the\r\nscope of employment\"; Congress simply provided in the Westfall Act,\r\ncontrary to ordinary tort law, that the employee would be immune to\r\nsuit for conduct within the scope of employment.\r\nGiven the objective to protect conduct within the scope\r\nof employment, we reject Lyons' notion that a plaintiff can defeat\r\ncertification merely by choosing to plead two different acts under\r\nthe heading of a single claim.  Modern pleading is so flexible, and\r\ncauses of action so numerous, that it is often child's play to\r\ncombine as part of the same \"claim\" remotely related incidents.  We\r\nare far less concerned about the possibility suggested by Lyons\r\nthat a plaintiff might simply choose not to identify incidents in\r\nthe complaint, thereby frustrating any effort to certify specific\r\nacts; discovery provides an easy remedy for that tactic.\r\nLyons is right that the incident-by-incident approach may\r\nincrease the burden on the courts.  It certainly would be quicker\r\nto make an all or nothing judgment as to each multi-incident claim,\r\nalthough not easy to invent a standard (would it be the\r\npredominance of scope versus nonscope conduct within each claim?). \r\nBut mechanisms--such as special masters--exist for dealing with\r\nroutine, serial disputes, and our major concern must be to\r\nimplement Congress' basic aim:  to protect the employee for conduct\r\nwithin the scope of employment but not outside it.  See Wood, 995\r\nF.2d at 1125.\r\nFinally, Lyons objects that the government, by certifying\r\ndiscrete incidents, can carve the evidentiary heart out of a case\r\nwhose gravamen is a single course of conduct.  But we see no reason\r\nwhy, subject to the sound discretion of the district judge, conduct\r\nwithin the scope of employment would automatically be excluded from\r\nevidence if it were offered merely to show pattern, motivation or\r\nanything else pertinent to imposing liability on the employee for\r\nconduct that has not been certified.  See United Mine Workers of\r\nAmerica v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670 n.3 (1965); cf. Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 404(b).  Of course, the jury ought to be told of the limited\r\npurpose.  See Fed. R. Evid. 105.\r\nWe thus conclude that the district court should have\r\napplied the scope test to acts or incidents, as the government\r\nclaims.  The government, although urging reversal, says that the\r\ndistrict court has already developed the pertinent evidence and\r\nurges this court to decide which incidents should be certified. \r\nSee Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151, 179 n.29 (1978). \r\nDr. Pathak goes further, asking us to hold that the government\r\nshould have certified additional conduct.  Lyons, by contrast, asks\r\nfor a remand to decide what should be certified.  A remand cannot\r\nbe avoided, but we can and will narrow the issues for the remand.\r\nUnder the Westfall Act, private action is barred against\r\nan employee of the federal government for a \"negligent or wrongful\r\nact or omission of [the employee] . . . while acting within the\r\nscope of his office or employment . . . .\"  28 U.S.C. 2679(b)(1). \r\nFederal law determines whether a person is a federal employee and\r\ndefines the nature and contours of his official responsibilities;\r\nbut the law of the state in which the tortious act allegedly\r\noccurred determines whether the employee  was acting within the\r\nscope of those responsibilities.  Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d\r\n1200, 1208-09 (1st Cir. 1996).  Here, only the latter issue is in\r\ndispute.\r\nAll sides appear to concur that the scope issue should be\r\ndetermined under Maine law (although a few of the acts occurred\r\noutside Maine).  As elsewhere, the scope-of-employment issue in\r\nMaine is normally resolved not to give immunity to the employee,\r\nbut to impose vicarious liability on an employer under the\r\nrespondeat superior doctrine.  Maine's courts follow the tests set\r\nforth in the Restatement (Second) of Agency  228 et seq. (1958). \r\nSee McClain v. Training and Development Corp., 572 A.2d 494, 497\r\n(Me. 1990).  The Restatement's general rule  228 reads as follows:\r\n     (1) Conduct of a servant is within the\r\n     scope of employment if, but only if:\r\n\n          (a) it is of the kind he is\r\n     employed to perform;\r\n\n          (b) it occurs substantially within\r\n     the authorized time and space limits;\r\n\n          (c) it is actuated, at least in\r\n     part, by a purpose to serve the master,\r\n     and \r\n\n          (d) if force is intentionally used\r\n     by the servant against another, the use\r\n     of force is not unexpectable by the\r\n     master.\r\n\n     (2) Conduct of a servant is not within\r\n     the scope of employment if it is\r\n     different in kind from that authorized,\r\n     far beyond the authorized time or space\r\n     limits, or too little actuated by a\r\n     purpose to serve the master.\r\n\nThe rule is given more content by a further 24 pages\r\ncontaining subordinate rules, commentary and illustrations, seeRestatement, supra,  228-236, and by case law and rules of thumb. \r\nFor example, usually--but not always--acts relating to work and\r\ndone in the workplace during working hours are within the scope,\r\nsee id.  229, 233, 234; negligent performance of duties is within\r\nthe scope, see id.  232-233, while serious intentional wrongdoing\r\nis outside it, see id.  231 &amp; cmt. a.; and the motivation of the\r\nemployee (to serve the master's interests or his own) is often an\r\nimportant element, see id.  235-236.\r\nSet forth in an appendix to this opinion is the full text\r\nof each paragraph listed by the U.S. Attorney as certified.  Most\r\nof the acts in these 22 paragraphs appear on their face to be work-\r\nrelated.  For example, paragraph 59 says that \"[i]n August 1994,\r\nDr. Pathak logged a Complaint with William Harnass and Dr. Holyoke,\r\nChief of Staff, against Mrs. Lyons.\"  Paragraph 115 says, \"[o]n\r\nFebruary 23, 1995, Dr. Pathak announced to the Renal Dialysis Unit\r\nthat 'they' were considering closing the Renal Dialysis Unit.\" \r\nParagraph 129 says:\r\nOn March 13, 1995, without telling Mrs. Lyons,\r\nDr. Pathak withdrew  Togus from the dialysis\r\nresearch study.  The study had been the\r\npurpose of the June, 1994 trip to Chicago and\r\nwould have enhanced Ms. Lyons' standing in the\r\nnephrology community.\r\n\nUnder Wood v. United States, 995 F.2d 1122 (1st Cir.\r\n1993), the district court in deciding the immunity issue must\r\nassume that the \"harm-causing incident\" alleged by the plaintiff\r\ndid occur and must then resolve issues regarding the\r\n\"characterization of the incident and subsidiary immunity-related\r\nfacts.\"  Id. at 1129.  Here, Dr. Pathak's filing of a complaint and\r\nwithdrawal from the dialysis research study were obviously work-\r\nrelated in the sense that these acts might have been taken to serve\r\nhis employer; but they could also prove to be outside the scope of\r\nemployment if they were done instead with a private purpose on Dr.\r\nPathak's part to retaliate against Lyons for rejecting his\r\nadvances.\r\nIf the complaint or the treatment of the study were done\r\nin good faith to serve the employer's interests, then the conduct\r\nwas likely within the scope of employment even if Dr. Pathak's\r\njudgment was mistaken.  Restatement, supra,  232-33; cf. Nasuti,\r\n906 F.2d at 808.  Conversely, whatever justification Dr. Pathak\r\nmight have for his actions could be overcome if his actual purpose\r\nwas to retaliate, a motive that would convert his conduct into\r\n\"serious intentional wrongdoing\" outside the scope of employment. \r\nRestatement, supra,  231 &amp; comment a; cf. Wood, 995 F.2d at 1123. \r\nOf course, whether the conduct was objectively justified might play\r\nsome evidentiary role in helping the judge decide whether the\r\ndoctor's motive was professional or personal.\r\nIn challenging the U.S. Attorney's certificate, the\r\nburden is upon Lyons to prove any facts needed to contradict the\r\ngovernment's characterization of the conduct in dispute.  SeeRogers v. Management Technology, Inc., 123 F.3d 34, 36-37 (1st Cir.\r\n1997); Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 808.  On remand, Lyons is entitled to\r\nchallenge the certificate as to each of the 22 certified\r\nparagraphs.  For example, Lyons asserts that Dr. Pathak did not\r\nhonestly believe that the complaint he filed against her was true,\r\nand she asserts that Dr. Pathak's superiors had no intention of\r\nclosing the dialysis unit. If her proffer so warrants, and the\r\nfacts alleged are in controversy, then an evidentiary hearing may\r\nbe required.\r\nWe turn now to Dr. Pathak's claim that the U.S. Attorney\r\nerred in refusing to certify other acts, apart from the 22\r\nparagraphs, as within the scope of employment.  For example, Dr.\r\nPathak suggests that his alleged statement to Lyons that he \"loved\"\r\nher should be regarded as a misunderstood attempt by him to solve\r\na workplace disagreement; his choice of words, he says, reflects\r\nthe fact that English is not his native language.  Although a few\r\nexamples of this kind are given, Dr. Pathak's principal argument on\r\nappeal is that the district court erred in refusing to consider his\r\nclaims on an act-by-act basis.  We agree for reasons already\r\nstated.\r\nIf Dr. Pathak chooses on remand to pursue such claims, he\r\n(like Lyons) will bear the burden of proof in moving for\r\ncertification under  2679(d)(3).  It will be up to him to offer\r\nwhatever evidence is necessary to persuade the district judge that\r\nan individual alleged act, not found by the U.S. Attorney to be\r\nwithin the scope of employment, falls within the scope of\r\nemployment.  And in soliciting a finding by the district court\r\n(e.g., as to the motivation or circumstances surrounding an alleged\r\nact), Dr. Pathak (like Lyons) confronts the risk that an adverse\r\ndetermination may turn out to be harmful to him in the trial\r\nitself.\r\nThe order of the district court striking the U.S.\r\nAttorney's certificate is vacated, and the matter is remanded to\r\nthe district court for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.\r\nIt is so ordered.                             APPENDIX\r\n\n52.  The Defendant said, no one would do anything unless\r\nMs. Lyons said so and that the plaintiff was \"walking around in her\r\nwhite coat and high heels like she was a big person.\"\r\n\n53.  For the next three months, Dr. Pathak undertook a\r\ncontinuing course of harassment against Ms. Lyons which centered\r\naround work related issues.\r\n\n55.  Dr. Pathak would not communicate with Ms. Lyons,\r\ncanceled meetings and, most importantly, publicly questioned Ms.\r\nLyons's professional judgment on issues of critical labs, patient\r\norders and the like.\r\n\n59.  In August 1994, Dr. Pathak logged a Complaint with\r\nWilliam Harness and Dr. Holyoke, Chief of Staff, against Ms. Lyons.\r\n\n61.  The Complaint alleged that Ms. Lyons had maliciously\r\nlocked Dr. Pathak out of the Dialysis Unit.  Ms. Lyons never locked\r\nDr. Pathak out of the Dialysis Unit.  The Plaintiff expressed her\r\nconcerns to Dr. Beaupre who told her not to take it seriously\r\nbecause we know it's not you.\r\n\n69.  On August 31, 1994, Ms. Lyons approached the\r\nDefendant Pathak with a list of suggestions as requested by Dr.\r\nBeaupre.  Dr. Pathak responded, \"I don't want to talk to you.\"\r\n\n88.  Dr. Pathak also asked Joe Morelli, a police officer\r\nat Togus, to question Ms. Lyons about missing log books.\r\n\n91.  On November 26, 1994, Dr. Pathak dictated in a\r\npatient HX and Physical that \"the patient's family talked with the\r\nhead nurse, Ms. Daigle.\"\r\n\n115.  On February 23, 1995, Dr. Pathak announced to the\r\nRenal Dialysis Unit that \"they\" were considering closing the Renal\r\nDialysis Unit.\r\n\n129.  On March 13, 1995, without telling Ms. Lyons, Dr.\r\nPathak withdrew Togus from the dialysis research study.  The study\r\nhad been the purpose of the June, 1994 trip to Chicago and would\r\nhave enhanced Ms. Lyons' standing in the nephrology community.\r\n\n130.  Throughout March of 1995, Dr. Pathak continued to\r\navoid Ms. Lyons at work and refused to speak with her.  This made\r\nit extremely difficult for Ms. Lyons to do her job because Dr.\r\nPathak was the director of the unit and directly responsible for\r\nproviding Ms. Lyons with critical patient care information.\r\n\n131.  From November, 1994 through the present, Ms. Lyons\r\nhas kept management updated about Dr. Pathak's behavior and the\r\nrisk to patient care it has created, but nothing has changed.\r\n\n132.  On March 16, 1995, Ms. Lyons paged the Defendant\r\nwith a question about patient care and Dr. Pathak refused to talk\r\nto Ms. Lyons.\r\n\n133.  On March 21, 1995, Ms. Lyons again attempted to\r\ntalk to Dr. Pathak about a patient care issue, but only after\r\nrepeated requests did Dr. Pathak supply her any information.  Then,\r\nthe information he gave was minimal.\r\n\n134.  Throughout March of 1995, Dr. Pathak refused to\r\nattend Renal Dialysis Unit staff meetings or do rounds with Ms.\r\nLyons.\r\n\n135.  On March 31, 1995, Ms. Lyons questioned Dr. Pathak\r\nabout a patient care situation needing immediate information and\r\nDr. Pathak refused to talk with her.\r\n\n140.  On April 8, 1995, Ms. Lyons again tried to talk to\r\nDr. Pathak about a patient care issue, but Dr. Pathak refused to\r\neven take her call.  Ms. Lyons had to track Dr. Pathak down through\r\nthe hospital before he would talk to her.\r\n\n142.  Dr. Pathak unreasonably and without discussion\r\nrefused to allow the patient to see the video and ordered that the\r\npatient receive no more information about the treatment.\r\n\n145.  On May 15, 1995, Dr. Pathak scheduled two patients\r\nto come to the Renal Dialysis Unit but purposely refused to tell\r\nMs. Lyons they were coming.\r\n\n147.  On May 24, 1995, in front of a fellow nurse, Ms.\r\nLyons asked Dr. Pathak a specific question regarding preparing for\r\ntransient dialysis patients.  Dr. Pathak refused to answer her. \r\nShe asked him another question and he refused to talk to her.\r\n\n148.  Throughout the week of May 25, 1995, Dr. Pathak\r\nrefused to talk to Ms. Lyons at all.  Dr. Pathak even planned the\r\ntransfer of patients off the unit without ever informing Ms. Lyons,\r\nthe head nurse.\n",

The claims, made by Kathleen Lyons, effectively charged Dr. Pathak with sexual harassment.  This appeal involves the interpretation and application of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, as set forth below, either are undisputed or are drawn from the complaint (and thus represent allegations taken as true only for purpose of this appeal).  From 1989 to 1995, Kathleen Lyons was a head nurse in the renal dialysis unit of the Veterans Administration hospital in Togus, Maine.  Her supervisor was Dr. Nikhil Pathak.  According to Lyons, Dr. Pathak made advances to her while she and the doctor were attending a nephrology conference in Chicago in June 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lyons says that when she spurned Dr. Pathak, he retaliated against her by (for example) not talking to her at work, challenging her laboratory test requests, and writing up a complaint against her.  Lyons claims that Dr. Pathak also made harassing comments, suggested that the dialysis unit might be closed, withdrew the unit from a research study, and questioned a police officer about missing log books, apparently implying that Lyons was somehow responsible for them.  Lyons also says that the doctor inappropriately pushed her during the Chicago trip and inappropriately hugged her at the hospital in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1995, Lyons filed suit in the federal district court.  Putting aside a civil rights conspiracy claim later dismissed, the complaint charged the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs as an employer with violations of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., and charged Dr. Pathak with state law claims for infliction of emotional distress, slander, and assault and battery.  The federal and state claims were separated for purposes of trial, and Lyons prevailed in a jury trial on the Title VII claims, obtaining a $375,000 judgment against the government;  that judgment is apparently not yet final due to the continuing pendency of Lyons' state-law claims against Dr. Pathak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Westfall Act, the Attorney General can certify that a federal employee named as a defendant in a civil case was \"acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident\" that serves as the basis for a tort claim against that employee.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).  If the certification stands, the defendant federal employee is immune from suit on claims arising from certified conduct, and the United States is substituted as the defendant with regard to those claims.  Id. &#167;&#167; 2679(b)(1), (d)(1).  The employee can also petition the court to order certification if the Attorney General has wrongly refused to certify.  Id. &#167; 2679(d)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 19, 1997, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Maine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> certified that Dr. Pathak was generally acting within the scope of employment \"regarding the issues directly related to patient care, clinical judgment, and hospital procedures and operations,\" including \"allegations regarding critical values, physician's orders, rounds, and quality assurance reports.\"   Specifically, the certificate identified 22 of 240 paragraphs of the complaint as comprising certified conduct;  for example, the U.S. Attorney did not certify the alleged inappropriate hugging and pushing but did certify Dr. Pathak's work complaint against Lyons, his challenges to her test requests, and his refusals to talk to her at the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scope of employment certifications by the government are reviewable by the district court.  See Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U.S. 417, 436-37, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995).  In April 1997, Lyons moved to strike the government's certificate and sought an evidentiary hearing.  Dr. Pathak, who had earlier requested certification of all of his conduct, maintained that the government had not gone far enough in its certificate.  The district court requested that all parties brief the issues and later heard oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 1997, the district court issued an order striking the scope certificate entirely, holding that the government could not pick and choose among the alleged acts in the complaint;  rather the court said that the correct approach was to evaluate whether in \"the totality of the circumstances, the conduct alleged in the Complaint occurred within the scope of ... employment.\"   Taking the complaint as a whole, the court said that sexual harassment amounting to assault and battery was clearly outside the scope of employment.  This appeal followed, the government urging reinstatement of its original certificate and Dr. Pathak arguing that even more acts should have been certified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, Lyons says that the district court's order striking the certificate is not yet reviewable.  Lyons recognizes that denials of immunity in the district court are customarily subject to immediate interlocutory appeal, Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996), with an exception not here pertinent, Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 315-16, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995), under the collateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).  For this purpose, qualified immunity in federal civil rights actions and Westfall Act immunity are treated in the same fashion.  See Taboas v. Mlynczak, 149 F.3d 576, 579 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Lyons says that review now is premature because, even if the government's certificate were reinstated, Dr. Pathak would still have to stand trial for the uncertified acts alleged in the complaint.  Thus, the disruption and delay of an interlocutory appeal would be incurred not to rescue a defendant from discovery and trial but merely to limit the claims against him.  Whatever force the argument might otherwise have, it was rejected by the Supreme Court in Behrens.   There the Court said that an interlocutory appeal lay from a denial of immunity even if granting it would not resolve the entire case.  See 516 U.S. at 311-13, 116 S.Ct. 834.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, the first question is to determine the \"unit\" for which certification is appropriate under the Westfall Act.  Where a single case involves multiple claims, certification is properly done at least down to the level of individual claims and not for the entire case viewed as a whole.  This is evident from Behrens itself as well as other cases approving certification of some claims but not others.  E.g., de Abadia v. Izquierdo Mora, 792 F.2d 1187, 1190 (1st Cir.1986);  Araujo v. Welch, 742 F.2d 802, 805-06 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The harder question is how to handle a situation in which an individual claim taken separately encompasses multiple incidents.  This question is posed by the present case;  for example, Lyons' infliction of emotional distress charge embraces a whole series of individual incidents (e.g., hugging, a negative report, refusing to converse).  In all likelihood, we are addressing an issue to which Congress gave no thought when it framed the Westfall Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Westfall Act is an offshoot of statutes imposing liability on the federal government for such events as accidents involving federal-employee drivers--events in which there is commonly a single incident (the crash) corresponding to a single claim (driver negligence).  See Behrens, 516 U.S. at 303, 116 S.Ct. 834;  Nasuti v. Scannell, 906 F.2d 802, 809 (1st Cir.1990).  While Congress surely knew that a complaint may include multiple claims, a claim supported by many divergent acts is less common.  Indeed, neither side has found a Westfall Act case that squarely addresses the issue we now face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statutory language--always the starting point, Petitioning Creditors of Melon Produce, Inc. v. Braunstein, 112 F.3d 1232, 1237 (1st Cir.1997)--lends some support to the government's act-by-act approach.  The Westfall Act speaks of certification not of \"the claim\" but of \"the incident out of which the claim arose,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d);  \"incident\" could easily be equated with \"act\" or \"event.\"   We do not think that either of Lyons' counters--that the word \"incident\" appears in the singular and that other related statutory provisions (e.g., removal, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(2)) explicitly operate on a claim-by-claim basis--are of much force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it is hard to make too much of this language where Congress may have assumed a rough equation of \"incident\" and \"claim\" and where the problem in our case arises from a failure of the equation.  Nor do we have any direct evidence of congressional intent derived from legislative history.  Lyons' argument that Congress did not intend to allow certification of \"egregious misconduct,\" H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5945, 5949, does not seem to us to bear directly on the \"claim versus incident\" issue before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting Westfall Act immunity, Congress aimed to protect federal employees against personal lawsuits growing out of their routine conduct of official business.  See Wood v. United States, 995 F.2d 1122, 1125-26 (1st Cir.1993).  The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2671-2680, had already made the government liable for certain wrongful employee conduct within \"the scope of employment\";  Congress simply provided in the Westfall Act, contrary to ordinary tort law, that the employee would be immune to suit for conduct within the scope of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the objective to protect conduct within the scope of employment, we reject Lyons' notion that a plaintiff can defeat certification merely by choosing to plead two different acts under the heading of a single claim.  Modern pleading is so flexible, and causes of action so numerous, that it is often child's play to combine as part of the same \"claim\" remotely related incidents.  We are far less concerned about the possibility suggested by Lyons that a plaintiff might simply choose not to identify incidents in the complaint, thereby frustrating any effort to certify specific acts;  discovery provides an easy remedy for that tactic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lyons is right that the incident-by-incident approach may increase the burden on the courts.  It certainly would be quicker to make an all or nothing judgment as to each multi-incident claim, although not easy to invent a standard (would it be the predominance of scope versus nonscope conduct within each claim?).  But mechanisms--such as special masters--exist for dealing with routine, serial disputes, and our major concern must be to implement Congress' basic aim:  to protect the employee for conduct within the scope of employment but not outside it.  See Wood, 995 F.2d at 1125.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Lyons objects that the government, by certifying discrete incidents, can carve the evidentiary heart out of a case whose gravamen is a single course of conduct.  But we see no reason why, subject to the sound discretion of the district judge, conduct within the scope of employment would automatically be excluded from evidence if it were offered merely to show pattern, motivation or anything else pertinent to imposing liability on the employee for conduct that has not been certified.  See United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670 n. 3, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965);  cf.  Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).  Of course, the jury ought to be told of the limited purpose.  See Fed.R.Evid. 105.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus conclude that the district court should have applied the scope test to acts or incidents, as the government claims.  The government, although urging reversal, says that the district court has already developed the pertinent evidence and urges this court to decide which incidents should be certified.  See Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151, 179 n. 29, 98 S.Ct. 988, 55 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978).  Dr. Pathak goes further, asking us to hold that the government should have certified additional conduct.  Lyons, by contrast, asks for a remand to decide what should be certified.  A remand cannot be avoided, but we can and will narrow the issues for the remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Westfall Act, private action is barred against an employee of the federal government for a \"negligent or wrongful act or omission of [the employee] ... while acting within the scope of his office or employment....\"  28 U.S.C. 2679(b)(1).  Federal law determines whether a person is a federal employee and defines the nature and contours of his official responsibilities;  but the law of the state in which the tortious act allegedly occurred determines whether the employee was acting within the scope of those responsibilities.  Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1208-09 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Here, only the latter issue is in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All sides appear to concur that the scope issue should be determined under Maine law (although a few of the acts occurred outside Maine).  As elsewhere, the scope-of-employment issue in Maine is normally resolved not to give immunity to the employee, but to impose vicarious liability on an employer under the respondeat superior doctrine.  Maine's courts follow the tests set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 228 et seq.  (1958).  See McLain v. Training and Development Corp., 572 A.2d 494, 497 (Me.1990).  The Restatement 's general rule &#167; 228 reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(1) Conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if, but only if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(2) Conduct of a servant is not within the scope of employment if it is different in kind from that authorized, far beyond the authorized time or space limits, or too little actuated by a purpose to serve the master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule is given more content by a further 24 pages containing subordinate rules, commentary and illustrations, see Restatement, supra, &#167;&#167; 228-236, and by case law and rules of thumb.  For example, usually--but not always--acts relating to work and done in the workplace during working hours are within the scope, see id. &#167;&#167; 229, 233, 234; negligent performance of duties is within the scope, see id. &#167;&#167; 232-233, while serious intentional wrongdoing is outside it, see id. &#167; 231 &amp; cmt. a.;   and the motivation of the employee (to serve the master's interests or his own) is often an important element, see id. &#167;&#167; 235-236.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Set forth in an appendix to this opinion is the full text of each paragraph listed by the U.S. Attorney as certified.  Most of the acts in these 22 paragraphs appear on their face to be work-related.  For example, paragraph 59 says that \"[i]n August 1994, Dr. Pathak logged a Complaint with William Harnass and Dr. Holyoke, Chief of Staff, against Mrs. Lyons.\"   Paragraph 115 says, \"[o]n February 23, 1995, Dr. Pathak announced to the Renal Dialysis Unit that 'they' were considering closing the Renal Dialysis Unit.\"  Paragraph 129 says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>On March 13, 1995, without telling Mrs. Lyons, Dr. Pathak withdrew Togus from the dialysis research study.  The study had been the purpose of the June, 1994 trip to Chicago and would have enhanced Ms. Lyons' standing in the nephrology community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Wood v. United States, 995 F.2d 1122 (1st Cir.1993), the district court in deciding the immunity issue must assume that the \"harm-causing incident\" alleged by the plaintiff did occur and must then resolve issues regarding the \"characterization of the incident and subsidiary immunity-related facts.\"  Id. at 1129.   Here, Dr. Pathak's filing of a complaint and withdrawal from the dialysis research study were obviously work-related in the sense that these acts might have been taken to serve his employer;  but they could also prove to be outside the scope of employment if they were done instead with a private purpose on Dr. Pathak's part to retaliate against Lyons for rejecting his advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the complaint or the treatment of the study were done in good faith to serve the employer's interests, then the conduct was likely within the scope of employment even if Dr. Pathak's judgment was mistaken.  Restatement, supra, &#167;&#167; 232-33;  cf.  Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 808.   Conversely, whatever justification Dr. Pathak might have for his actions could be overcome if his actual purpose was to retaliate, a motive that would convert his conduct into \"serious intentional wrongdoing\" outside the scope of employment.  Restatement, supra, &#167; 231 &amp; comment a;  cf.  Wood, 995 F.2d at 1123.   Of course, whether the conduct was objectively justified might play some evidentiary role in helping the judge decide whether the doctor's motive was professional or personal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the U.S. Attorney's certificate, the burden is upon Lyons to prove any facts needed to contradict the government's characterization of the conduct in dispute.  See Rogers v. Management Technology, Inc., 123 F.3d 34, 36-37 (1st Cir.1997);  Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 808.   On remand, Lyons is entitled to challenge the certificate as to each of the 22 certified paragraphs.  For example, Lyons asserts that Dr. Pathak did not honestly believe that the complaint he filed against her was true, and she asserts that Dr. Pathak's superiors had no intention of closing the dialysis unit.  If her proffer so warrants, and the facts alleged are in controversy, then an evidentiary hearing may be required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Dr. Pathak's claim that the U.S. Attorney erred in refusing to certify other acts, apart from the 22 paragraphs, as within the scope of employment.  For example, Dr. Pathak suggests that his alleged statement to Lyons that he \"loved\" her should be regarded as a misunderstood attempt by him to solve a workplace disagreement;  his choice of words, he says, reflects the fact that English is not his native language.  Although a few examples of this kind are given, Dr. Pathak's principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in refusing to consider his claims on an act-by-act basis.  We agree for reasons already stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Dr. Pathak chooses on remand to pursue such claims, he (like Lyons) will bear the burden of proof in moving for certification under &#167; 2679(d)(3).

The claims, made by Kathleen Lyons, effectively charged Dr. Pathak with sexual harassment.  This appeal involves the interpretation and application of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, as set forth below, either are undisputed or are drawn from the complaint (and thus represent allegations taken as true only for purpose of this appeal).  From 1989 to 1995, Kathleen Lyons was a head nurse in the renal dialysis unit of the Veterans Administration hospital in Togus, Maine.  Her supervisor was Dr. Nikhil Pathak.  According to Lyons, Dr. Pathak made advances to her while she and the doctor were attending a nephrology conference in Chicago in June 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lyons says that when she spurned Dr. Pathak, he retaliated against her by (for example) not talking to her at work, challenging her laboratory test requests, and writing up a complaint against her.  Lyons claims that Dr. Pathak also made harassing comments, suggested that the dialysis unit might be closed, withdrew the unit from a research study, and questioned a police officer about missing log books, apparently implying that Lyons was somehow responsible for them.  Lyons also says that the doctor inappropriately pushed her during the Chicago trip and inappropriately hugged her at the hospital in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1995, Lyons filed suit in the federal district court.  Putting aside a civil rights conspiracy claim later dismissed, the complaint charged the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs as an employer with violations of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., and charged Dr. Pathak with state law claims for infliction of emotional distress, slander, and assault and battery.  The federal and state claims were separated for purposes of trial, and Lyons prevailed in a jury trial on the Title VII claims, obtaining a $375,000 judgment against the government;  that judgment is apparently not yet final due to the continuing pendency of Lyons' state-law claims against Dr. Pathak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Westfall Act, the Attorney General can certify that a federal employee named as a defendant in a civil case was \"acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident\" that serves as the basis for a tort claim against that employee.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).

Dr. Pathak, who had earlier requested certification of all of his conduct, maintained that the government had not gone far enough in its certificate.  The district court requested that all parties brief the issues and later heard oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 1997, the district court issued an order striking the scope certificate entirely, holding that the government could not pick and choose among the alleged acts in the complaint;  rather the court said that the correct approach was to evaluate whether in \"the totality of the circumstances, the conduct alleged in the Complaint occurred within the scope of ... employment.\"   Taking the complaint as a whole, the court said that sexual harassment amounting to assault and battery was clearly outside the scope of employment.  This appeal followed, the government urging reinstatement of its original certificate and Dr. Pathak arguing that even more acts should have been certified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, Lyons says that the district court's order striking the certificate is not yet reviewable.

See Taboas v.

Thus, the disruption and delay of an interlocutory appeal would be incurred not to rescue a defendant from discovery and trial but merely to limit the claims against him.  Whatever force the argument might otherwise have, it was rejected by the Supreme Court in Behrens.   There the Court said that an interlocutory appeal lay from a denial of immunity even if granting it would not resolve the entire case.  See 516 U.S. at 311-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Where a single case involves multiple claims, certification is properly done at least down to the level of individual claims and not for the entire case viewed as a whole.  This is evident from Behrens itself as well as other cases approving certification of some claims but not others.  E.g., de Abadia v. Izquierdo Mora, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471591\"><a href=\"/opinion/471591/luisa-a-de-abadia-v-hon-luis-izquierdo-mora/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1187</span></a></span>, 1190 (1st Cir.1986);  Araujo v.

This question is posed by the present case;  for example, Lyons' infliction of emotional distress charge embraces a whole series of individual incidents (e.g., hugging, a negative report, refusing to converse).  In all likelihood, we are addressing an issue to which Congress gave no thought when it framed the Westfall Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Westfall Act is an offshoot of statutes imposing liability on the federal government for such events as accidents involving federal-employee drivers--events in which there is commonly a single incident (the crash) corresponding to a single claim (driver negligence).  See Behrens, 516 U.S. at 303, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While Congress surely knew that a complaint may include multiple claims, a claim supported by many divergent acts is less common.

The Westfall Act speaks of certification not of \"the claim\" but of \"the incident out of which the claim arose,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d);  \"incident\" could easily be equated with \"act\" or \"event.\"   We do not think that either of Lyons' counters--that the word \"incident\" appears in the singular and that other related statutory provisions (e.g., removal, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(2)) explicitly operate on a claim-by-claim basis--are of much force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it is hard to make too much of this language where Congress may have assumed a rough equation of \"incident\" and \"claim\" and where the problem in our case arises from a failure of the equation.  Nor do we have any direct evidence of congressional intent derived from legislative history.  Lyons' argument that Congress did not intend to allow certification of \"egregious misconduct,\" H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5945, 5949, does not seem to us to bear directly on the \"claim versus incident\" issue before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting Westfall Act immunity, Congress aimed to protect federal employees against personal lawsuits growing out of their routine conduct of official business.  See Wood v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609175\"><a href=\"/opinion/609175/theresa-h-wood-v-united-states-of-america-charles-d-owens-theresa-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span>, 1125-26 (1st Cir.1993).  The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2671-2680, had already made the government liable for certain wrongful employee conduct within \"the scope of employment\";  Congress simply provided in the Westfall Act, contrary to ordinary tort law, that the employee would be immune to suit for conduct within the scope of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the objective to protect conduct within the scope of employment, we reject Lyons' notion that a plaintiff can defeat certification merely by choosing to plead two different acts under the heading of a single claim.  Modern pleading is so flexible, and causes of action so numerous, that it is often child's play to combine as part of the same \"claim\" remotely related incidents.  We are far less concerned about the possibility suggested by Lyons that a plaintiff might simply choose not to identify incidents in the complaint, thereby frustrating any effort to certify specific acts;  discovery provides an easy remedy for that tactic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lyons is right that the incident-by-incident approach may increase the burden on the courts.  It certainly would be quicker to make an all or nothing judgment as to each multi-incident claim, although not easy to invent a standard (would it be the predominance of scope versus nonscope conduct within each claim?).  But mechanisms--such as special masters--exist for dealing with routine, serial disputes, and our major concern must be to implement Congress' basic aim:  to protect the employee for conduct within the scope of employment but not outside it.  See Wood, 995 F.2d at 1125.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Lyons objects that the government, by certifying discrete incidents, can carve the evidentiary heart out of a case whose gravamen is a single course of conduct.  But we see no reason why, subject to the sound discretion of the district judge, conduct within the scope of employment would automatically be excluded from evidence if it were offered merely to show pattern, motivation or anything else pertinent to imposing liability on the employee for conduct that has not been certified.  See United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107086\"><a href=\"/opinion/107086/mine-workers-v-pennington/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span>, 670 n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107086\"><a href=\"/opinion/107086/mine-workers-v-pennington/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government, although urging reversal, says that the district court has already developed the pertinent evidence and urges this court to decide which incidents should be certified.  See Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 179 n. 29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109811\"><a href=\"/opinion/109811/ray-v-atlantic-richfield-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span> (1978).  Dr. Pathak goes further, asking us to hold that the government should have certified additional conduct.  Lyons, by contrast, asks for a remand to decide what should be certified.  A remand cannot be avoided, but we can and will narrow the issues for the remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Westfall Act, private action is barred against an employee of the federal government for a \"negligent or wrongful act or omission of [the employee] ... while acting within the scope of his office or employment....\"  28 U.S.C. 2679(b)(1).  Federal law determines whether a person is a federal employee and defines the nature and contours of his official responsibilities;  but the law of the state in which the tortious act allegedly occurred determines whether the employee was acting within the scope of those responsibilities.  Aversa v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197034\"><a href=\"/opinion/197034/aversa-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span>, 1208-09 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Here, only the latter issue is in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All sides appear to concur that the scope issue should be determined under Maine law (although a few of the acts occurred outside Maine).  As elsewhere, the scope-of-employment issue in Maine is normally resolved not to give immunity to the employee, but to impose vicarious liability on an employer under the respondeat superior doctrine.  Maine's courts follow the tests set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 228 et seq.  (1958).  See McLain v. Training and Development Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1938999\"><a href=\"/opinion/1938999/mclain-v-training-and-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>, 497 (Me.1990).  The Restatement 's general rule &#167; 228 reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(1) Conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if, but only if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(2) Conduct of a servant is not within the scope of employment if it is different in kind from that authorized, far beyond the authorized time or space limits, or too little actuated by a purpose to serve the master.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule is given more content by a further 24 pages containing subordinate rules, commentary and illustrations, see Restatement, supra, &#167;&#167; 228-236, and by case law and rules of thumb.  For example, usually--but not always--acts relating to work and done in the workplace during working hours are within the scope, see id. &#167;&#167; 229, 233, 234; negligent performance of duties is within the scope, see id. &#167;&#167; 232-233, while serious intentional wrongdoing is outside it, see id. &#167; 231 &amp; cmt. a.;   and the motivation of the employee (to serve the master's interests or his own) is often an important element, see id. &#167;&#167; 235-236.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Set forth in an appendix to this opinion is the full text of each paragraph listed by the U.S. Attorney as certified.  Most of the acts in these 22 paragraphs appear on their face to be work-related.  For example, paragraph 59 says that \"[i]n August 1994, Dr. Pathak logged a Complaint with William Harnass and Dr. Holyoke, Chief of Staff, against Mrs. Lyons.\"   Paragraph 115 says, \"[o]n February 23, 1995, Dr. Pathak announced to the Renal Dialysis Unit that 'they' were considering closing the Renal Dialysis Unit.\"  Paragraph 129 says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>On March 13, 1995, without telling Mrs. Lyons, Dr. Pathak withdrew Togus from the dialysis research study.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609175\"><a href=\"/opinion/609175/theresa-h-wood-v-united-states-of-america-charles-d-owens-theresa-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993), the district court in deciding the immunity issue must assume that the \"harm-causing incident\" alleged by the plaintiff did occur and must then resolve issues regarding the \"characterization of the incident and subsidiary immunity-related facts.\"  Id. at 1129.   Here, Dr. Pathak's filing of a complaint and withdrawal from the dialysis research study were obviously work-related in the sense that these acts might have been taken to serve his employer;  but they could also prove to be outside the scope of employment if they were done instead with a private purpose on Dr. Pathak's part to retaliate against Lyons for rejecting his advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the complaint or the treatment of the study were done in good faith to serve the employer's interests, then the conduct was likely within the scope of employment even if Dr. Pathak's judgment was mistaken.  Restatement, supra, &#167;&#167; 232-33;  cf.  Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 808.   Conversely, whatever justification Dr. Pathak might have for his actions could be overcome if his actual purpose was to retaliate, a motive that would convert his conduct into \"serious intentional wrongdoing\" outside the scope of employment.  Restatement, supra, &#167; 231 &amp; comment a;  cf.  Wood, 995 F.2d at 1123.   Of course, whether the conduct was objectively justified might play some evidentiary role in helping the judge decide whether the doctor's motive was professional or personal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the U.S. Attorney's certificate, the burden is upon Lyons to prove any facts needed to contradict the government's characterization of the conduct in dispute.  See Rogers v. Management Technology, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197503\"><a href=\"/opinion/197503/rogers-v-management-technolog/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 36-37 (1st Cir.1997);  Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 808.   On remand, Lyons is entitled to challenge the certificate as to each of the 22 certified paragraphs.  For example, Lyons asserts that Dr. Pathak did not honestly believe that the complaint he filed against her was true, and she asserts that Dr. Pathak's superiors had no intention of closing the dialysis unit.  If her proffer so warrants, and the facts alleged are in controversy, then an evidentiary hearing may be required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to Dr. Pathak's claim that the U.S. Attorney erred in refusing to certify other acts, apart from the 22 paragraphs, as within the scope of employment.  For example, Dr. Pathak suggests that his alleged statement to Lyons that he \"loved\" her should be regarded as a misunderstood attempt by him to solve a workplace disagreement;  his choice of words, he says, reflects the fact that English is not his native language.  Although a few examples of this kind are given, Dr. Pathak's principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in refusing to consider his claims on an act-by-act basis.  We agree for reasons already stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Dr. Pathak chooses on remand to pursue such claims, he (like Lyons) will bear the burden of proof in moving for certification under &#167; 2679(d)(3).  It will be up to him to offer whatever evidence is necessary to persuade the district judge that an individual alleged act, not found by the U.S. Attorney to be within the scope of employment, falls within the scope of employment.  And in soliciting a finding by the district court (e.g., as to the motivation or circumstances surrounding an alleged act), Dr. Pathak (like Lyons) confronts the risk that an adverse determination may turn out to be harmful to him in the trial itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of the district court striking the U.S. Attorney's certificate is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">52.
