See Woods-\r                                                                           \r\n\nLeber v. Hyatt Hotels  of P.R., Inc.,  951 F. Supp. 1028  (D.P.R.\r                                              \r\n\n1996).  We affirm.\r\n\nI.  THE MONGOOSE ATTACK AND ITS SEQUELAE\r          I.  THE MONGOOSE ATTACK AND ITS SEQUELAE\r\n\n          Defendant-appellee Hyatt  Hotels of  Puerto Rico,  Inc.\r\n\n(Hyatt) owns and operates the Cerromar Beach Hotel (the hotel) in\r\n\nDorado, Puerto Rico.  The hotel occupies a picturesque oceanfront\r\n\nsetting.   Its  verdant grounds  are bordered  on  the west  by a\r\n\nmangrove   swamp   which   is  under   the   protection   of  the\r\n\nCommonwealth's Department  of Natural Resources.  On the far side\r\n\nof  the swamp  lies Lakeside  Villas,  a residential  subdivision\r\n\nwhich was being built at the time material hereto.  Hyatt  has no\r\n\nfinancial or other proprietary interest in the development of the\r\n\nsubdivision.\r\n\n          On   April  10,  1995,   at  approximately  5:00  p.m.,\r\n\nplaintiff-appellant Lynne  Woods-Leber, a  guest, was  sunbathing\r\n\nnear the  hotel's  pool.   Suddenly  (and  without  any  apparent\r\n\nprovocation) a wild mongoose scurried  into the pool area and bit\r\n\nher.   Because the mongoose carried rabies, Woods-Leber underwent\r\n\na series of painful inoculations.\r\n\n          A few  days  after  the  attack,  the  hotel  hired  an\r\n\nexterminator, Pest Management International (PMI), to implement a\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nmongoose  control program.    PMI set  several  baited traps  and\r\n\ncaptured fifteen mongooses in a week's time.1  PMI concluded that\r\n\nthe   most  likely  explanation  for  the  infestation  was  that\r\n\nmongooses living in  the mangrove swamp had been disturbed by the\r\n\nconstruction  activity  at  Lakeside  Villas  and   had  migrated\r\n\neastward onto the hotel's grounds.  The traps were left in  place\r\n\non the premises.\r\n\n          In   due   season,    Woods-Leber   invoked   diversity\r\n\njurisdiction,  28  U.S.C.    1332(a)  (1994), and  sued  Hyatt in\r\n\nPuerto Rico's federal  district court.2  Her  suit sought damages\r\n\nfor   personal  injuries   under  local   law.     Hyatt   denied\r\n\nresponsibility  and, following a  period of discovery,  moved for\r\n\nbrevis  disposition, supporting  its  motion  with  a  number  of\r                \r\n\naffidavits  and declarations.   The plaintiff opposed  the motion\r\n\nbut made only one evidentiary proffer:   her husband's conclusory\r\n\nrecitation of his suspicion that a temporary food preparation and\r\n\nstorage area which had been installed near the pool functioned as\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  plural of  \"mongoose\" is  a matter  of some  debate in\r\nlexicographic circles.  See, e.g., Webster's Ninth New Collegiate\r                                                                           \r\nDictionary  767 (1989)  (\"mongoose .  .  . n,  pl mongooses  also\r                                                                           \r\nmongeese . . . .\").  Having noted the debate, however,  we choose\r\nnot  to  enter  it.   Thus,  while we  use  the  term \"mongooses\"\r\nthroughout,  we express  no  opinion  on  which  plural  noun  is\r\nlinguistically preferable.\r\n\n     2Woods-Leber's husband,  Anthony  Leber,  joined  as  a  co-\r\nplaintiff.   Inasmuch as  his claim is  derivative, we  treat the\r\nappeal  as if Woods-Leber were  the sole plaintiff and appellant.\r\nOf  course, our  decision disposes  of Anthony  Leber's claim  as\r\nwell.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\na mongoose magnet.3\r\n\n          On  December  30,  1996,  the  district  court  granted\r\n\nHyatt's motion.   The court concluded,  in substance, that  Hyatt\r\n\ncould not be  held strictly liable because it had not exerted any\r\n\ncontrol over the mongoose,  and that it could not be  held liable\r\n\nin negligence because it could not  reasonably have been expected\r\n\nto foresee the mongoose attack.  See Woods-Leber, 951 F. Supp. at\r                                                          \r\n\n1039.  This appeal followed.\r\n\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\n          Summary judgment  is appropriate when the  record shows\r\n\n\"no genuine issue as  to any material fact and  . . . the  moving\r\n\nparty is  entitled to a  judgment as a  matter of law.\"   Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P 56(c); see also Anderson  v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n242, 247  (1986).  The  genuineness requirement signifies  that a\r\n\nfactual  controversy \"must be sufficiently open-ended to permit a\r\n\nrational factfinder  to  resolve the  issue  in favor  of  either\r\n\nside.\"  National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731,\r                                                             \r\n\n735 (1st Cir. 1995).  The materiality requirement signifies  that\r\n\nthe factual  controversy must  pertain to  an issue  which \"might\r\n\naffect  the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\"  Morris\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Government Dev.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The gist of Leber's statement  is reprinted in the district\r\ncourt's opinion.

Taber Partners  I, 53  F.3d 454, 457  (1st Cir.  1995).\r                                     \r\n\nDespite  this  advantage,  however, the  party  opposing  summary\r\n\njudgment   cannot   simply  rest   on   \"conclusory  allegations,\r\n\nimprobable  inferences, and  unsupported  speculation.\"   Medina-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMunoz  v.

To the contrary, at least with respect to issues on which\r\n\nshe  bears  the burden  of  proof,  the  nonmovant must  identify\r\n\nproperly  substantiated   facts   sufficient   to   establish   a\r\n\ntrialworthy issue.  See  Morris, 27 F.3d at 748;  Kelly v.

ANALYSIS\r\n\n          The  substantive  law   of  Puerto  Rico   governs  the\r\n\nliability question in  this diversity action.  See  Erie R.R. Co.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Tompkins, 304 U.S.  64, 78 (1938); Daigle v. Maine  Med. Ctr.,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc. 14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st  Cir. 1994).  The plaintiff makes  two\r              \r\n\nclaims under that law.  We consider them sequentially.\r\n\n                   A.  The Article 1805 Claim.\r                             A.  The Article 1805 Claim.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Article 1805 of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,\r\n\n  5144 (1992), imposes strict  liability on the possessor or user\r\n\nof  an animal  for  any damages  which  the animal  causes.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSerrano v. Lopez, 79 P.R.R. 922, 927 (1957).  In order to prevail\r                          \r\n\non  an Article  1805  claim, a  plaintiff must  show,  at a  bare\r\n\nminimum,  that the defendant  owned, possessed, or  used the wild\r\n\nanimal.    See Ferrer  v.  Rivera,  56  P.R.R. 480,  482  (1940);\r                                           \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nRedinger v. Crespo, 18 P.R.R.  106, 111 (1912).  This customarily\r                            \r\n\ninvolves a showing that the defendant exercised control  over the\r\n\nanimal.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   1480 (1993).\r                      \r\n\n          The  district  court ordered  summary judgment  on this\r\n\ncount,  holding that Woods-Leber  failed to present  any evidence\r\n\ntending to  show that Hyatt  controlled the rabid mongoose.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWoods-Leber, 951 F.  Supp. at 1035.   We agree.  A  person cannot\r                     \r\n\ncontrol an animal of which  he is completely unaware.  Here,  the\r\n\nuncontradicted  evidence indicates that  Hyatt had no  inkling of\r\n\nthe mongoose's existence, had no reason to suspect that mongooses\r\n\nwere lurking nearby, and received as jolting a surprise as Woods-\r\n\nLeber when  the mongoose  struck.   In the utter  absence of  any\r\n\nevidence  of  either  knowledge or  control,  the  district court\r\n\nproperly entered summary judgment on the Article 1805 claim.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff  endeavors  to  avoid  this  predictable\r\n\nresult by arguing  that a symbiotic relationship  existed between\r\n\nHyatt and  the mongoose  population in the  mangrove swamp.   She\r\n\npins this  rather exotic theory  to a suggestion that  Hyatt must\r\n\nhave   benefitted  from  the   mongooses'  natural  affinity  for\r\n\ndevouring snakes  and rodents, and  that this benefit  is legally\r\n\ntantamount to control.  This  argument is woven entirely from the\r\n\ngossamer strands  of  speculation and  surmise.   The  record  is\r\n\ndevoid of any evidence that mongooses patrolled the perimeters of\r\n\nthe hotel's  grounds, performing  pest control  functions.   And,\r\n\nmoreover,  the  argument  is  unaccompanied   by  any  meaningful\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ncitation to applicable  legal authority.4  In  sum, this argument\r\n\nis   factually   barren,   legally   bankrupt,   and   altogether\r\n\ninsufficient  to breathe life  into the plaintiff's  Article 1805\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n                   B.  The Article 1802 Claim.\r                             B.  The Article 1802 Claim.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Article 1802 of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,\r\n\n  5141, imposes liability  on any person or entity which, by his,\r\n\nher, or its  negligent acts or omissions, causes  harm or damage.\r\n\nIn broad  perspective, Puerto Rico law defines  negligence as the\r\n\nfailure to  exercise due  diligence to  avoid foreseeable  risks.\r\n\nSee  Coyne, 53 F.3d at 459;  Malave-Felix v. Volvo Car Corp., 946\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 967,  971-72 (1st Cir. 1991).5   To recover  on a negligence\r\n\ntheory, a  plaintiff suing  for personal  injuries under  Article\r\n\n1802 must establish (1) a duty requiring the defendant to conform\r\n\nto a certain standard of conduct, (2)  a breach of that duty, (3)\r\n\nproof of damage,  and (4) a causal connection  between the damage\r\n\nand  the  tortious  conduct.

See Mas v. United States, 984 F.2d 527, 530 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n1993).\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ncare).  See Coyne, 53 F.3d at 459-60.\r                           \r\n\n          The plaintiff contends  that, under Puerto Rico  law, a\r\n\nhotel-keeper owes  its  guests  a heightened  duty  of  care  and\r\n\nprotection.   The law so  provides.  See, e.g.,  Mejias-Quiros v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMaxxam Property Corp., 108 F.3d  425, 427 (1st Cir. 1997); Coyne,\r                                                                          \r\n\n53  F.3d at  458;  Pabon-Escabi  v. Axtmayer,  90  P.R.R. 20,  29\r                                                      \r\n\n(1964).   Nevertheless, a hotel-keeper  is not an insurer  of its\r\n\nguests' well-being.  See, e.g., Goose v. Hilton Hotels, 79 P.R.R.\r                                                                \r\n\n494,  499 (1956) (holding that a hotelier is liable for a guest's\r\n\nfall on hotel  premises only if the hotelier knew  or should have\r\n\nknown  of  a  preexisting  dangerous condition).    Consequently,\r\n\nnotwithstanding the heightened  duty of care and  protection, the\r\n\nhotel-keeper is not liable for harm unless the harm is reasonably\r\n\nforeseeable.  See Coyne, 53 F.3d at 460-61.\r                                 \r\n\n          In this case, the  linchpin question is whether  it was\r\n\nreasonably foreseeable at  the time and place in  question that a\r\n\nmongoose would attack  a guest (for, without  a foreseeable harm,\r\n\nHyatt could  not have  breached its  duty of  care by failing  to\r\n\nimplement a mongoose control program before the attack).  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat  460.   The  district  court  answered  this question  in  the\r\n\nnegative.  See Woods-Leber, 951 F. Supp.  at 1039.  We think that\r                                    \r\n\nJudge Dominguez got it right.\r\n\n          The  evidence as  to  knowledge is  telling.   On  this\r\n\npoint, the record permits only one conclusion:  that Hyatt had no\r\n\nknowledge,  actual  or  constructive,  either of  the  mongooses'\r\n\nexistence or of the incipient  danger that they presented, at any\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ntime  before  the attack.    The  hotel personnel  most  directly\r\n\ninvolved in the  matter (such as the head grounds  keeper and the\r\n\nchief  of security) submitted affidavits  which made plain that a\r\n\nmongoose had never  before been seen on the  hotel premises; that\r\n\nno  one at  the hotel knew  of the  presence of mongooses  in the\r\n\nmangrove swamp or  otherwise in the vicinity; and  that, prior to\r\n\nthe  assault on Woods-Leber, no wild animal  of any kind had ever\r\n\nbitten any hotel guest.  By the same token, there was no evidence\r\n\nfrom which a factfinder could conclude, without rank speculation,\r\n\nthat  the temporary food  preparation and storage  area presented\r\n\nany hazard or that Hyatt should have known the  inauguration of a\r\n\nconstruction  project near the mangrove swamp portended an influx\r\n\nof  wild animals.  Indeed, several previous construction projects\r\n\nhad been  undertaken near the  swamp without incident.   Finally,\r\n\nthere  was  no   evidence  either  that  a   non-rabid  mongoose,\r\n\nunprovoked, was likely to bite a supine sunbather, or that rabies\r\n\nwas prevalent in the area.\r\n\n          We do  not mean to  imply that, merely because  a rabid\r\n\nmongoose  had never  before  invaded the  premises  and bitten  a\r\n\nguest, the  attack could not  have been foreseen.   See generally\r                                                                           \r\n\nPabon-Escabi, 90 P.R.R.  at 25 (explaining that  \"the requirement\r                      \r\n\nof  foreseeability [does not  require] that  the precise  risk or\r\n\nconsequences  have been  foreseen\").   If,  say,  an occupier  of\r\n\npremises disregards a known general danger, or omits a precaution\r\n\nregularly  taken by prudent  persons similarly situated,  a first\r\n\nattack might  well be foreseeable  (and, thus, actionable).

See  Kelly, 924\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 358.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  As the district court correctly\r\n\nstated, \"[t]he normal rule is that a person does not have  a duty\r\n\nto prevent an attack upon another . . . by wild animals.\"  Woods-\r                                                                           \r\n\nLeber, 951 F.  Supp. at 1036 (citations omitted).  While the rule\r               \r\n\nadmits of  exceptions,  the plaintiff  in  this case  adduced  no\r\n\nevidence which sufficed  to bring the mongoose  attack within any\r\n\nof those exceptions.  Since  a hotel-keeper, like any other owner\r\n\nor occupier of premises, cannot be held liable  for that which it\r\n\ncannot  reasonably  foresee,  the  lower  court  did  not err  in\r\n\ngranting Hyatt's motion for summary judgment.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6This  presents  a marked  contrast  to the  cases  on which\r\nWoods-Leber  relies.

THE MONGOOSE ATTACK AND ITS SEQUELAE\r          I.  THE MONGOOSE ATTACK AND ITS SEQUELAE\r\n\n          Defendant-appellee Hyatt  Hotels of  Puerto Rico,  Inc.\r\n\n(Hyatt) owns and operates the Cerromar Beach Hotel (the hotel) in\r\n\nDorado, Puerto Rico.  The hotel occupies a picturesque oceanfront\r\n\nsetting.   Its  verdant grounds  are bordered  on  the west  by a\r\n\nmangrove   swamp   which   is  under   the   protection   of  the\r\n\nCommonwealth's Department  of Natural Resources.  On the far side\r\n\nof  the swamp  lies Lakeside  Villas,  a residential  subdivision\r\n\nwhich was being built at the time material hereto.  Hyatt  has no\r\n\nfinancial or other proprietary interest in the development of the\r\n\nsubdivision.\r\n\n          On   April  10,  1995,   at  approximately  5:00  p.m.,\r\n\nplaintiff-appellant Lynne  Woods-Leber, a  guest, was  sunbathing\r\n\nnear the  hotel's  pool.   Suddenly  (and  without  any  apparent\r\n\nprovocation) a wild mongoose scurried  into the pool area and bit\r\n\nher.   Because the mongoose carried rabies, Woods-Leber underwent\r\n\na series of painful inoculations.\r\n\n          A few  days  after  the  attack,  the  hotel  hired  an\r\n\nexterminator, Pest Management International (PMI), to implement a\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nmongoose  control program.    PMI set  several  baited traps  and\r\n\ncaptured fifteen mongooses in a week's time.1  PMI concluded that\r\n\nthe   most  likely  explanation  for  the  infestation  was  that\r\n\nmongooses living in  the mangrove swamp had been disturbed by the\r\n\nconstruction  activity  at  Lakeside  Villas  and   had  migrated\r\n\neastward onto the hotel's grounds.  The traps were left in  place\r\n\non the premises.\r\n\n          In   due   season,    Woods-Leber   invoked   diversity\r\n\njurisdiction,  28  U.S.C.    1332(a)  (1994), and  sued  Hyatt in\r\n\nPuerto Rico's federal  district court.2  Her  suit sought damages\r\n\nfor   personal  injuries   under  local   law.     Hyatt   denied\r\n\nresponsibility  and, following a  period of discovery,  moved for\r\n\nbrevis  disposition, supporting  its  motion  with  a  number  of\r                \r\n\naffidavits  and declarations.   The plaintiff opposed  the motion\r\n\nbut made only one evidentiary proffer:   her husband's conclusory\r\n\nrecitation of his suspicion that a temporary food preparation and\r\n\nstorage area which had been installed near the pool functioned as\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  plural of  \"mongoose\" is  a matter  of some  debate in\r\nlexicographic circles.  See, e.g., Webster's Ninth New Collegiate\r                                                                           \r\nDictionary  767 (1989)  (\"mongoose .  .  . n,  pl mongooses  also\r                                                                           \r\nmongeese . . . .\").  Having noted the debate, however,  we choose\r\nnot  to  enter  it.   Thus,  while we  use  the  term \"mongooses\"\r\nthroughout,  we express  no  opinion  on  which  plural  noun  is\r\nlinguistically preferable.\r\n\n     2Woods-Leber's husband,  Anthony  Leber,  joined  as  a  co-\r\nplaintiff.   Inasmuch as  his claim is  derivative, we  treat the\r\nappeal  as if Woods-Leber were  the sole plaintiff and appellant.\r\nOf  course, our  decision disposes  of Anthony  Leber's claim  as\r\nwell.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\na mongoose magnet.3\r\n\n          On  December  30,  1996,  the  district  court  granted\r\n\nHyatt's motion.   The court concluded,  in substance, that  Hyatt\r\n\ncould not be  held strictly liable because it had not exerted any\r\n\ncontrol over the mongoose,  and that it could not be  held liable\r\n\nin negligence because it could not  reasonably have been expected\r\n\nto foresee the mongoose attack.  See Woods-Leber, 951 F. Supp. at\r                                                          \r\n\n1039.  This appeal followed.\r\n\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.

This customarily\r                            \r\n\ninvolves a showing that the defendant exercised control  over the\r\n\nanimal.  See P.R.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWoods-Leber, 951 F.  Supp. at 1035.   We agree.  A  person cannot\r                     \r\n\ncontrol an animal of which  he is completely unaware.  Here,  the\r\n\nuncontradicted  evidence indicates that  Hyatt had no  inkling of\r\n\nthe mongoose's existence, had no reason to suspect that mongooses\r\n\nwere lurking nearby, and received as jolting a surprise as Woods-\r\n\nLeber when  the mongoose  struck.   In the utter  absence of  any\r\n\nevidence  of  either  knowledge or  control,  the  district court\r\n\nproperly entered summary judgment on the Article 1805 claim.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff  endeavors  to  avoid  this  predictable\r\n\nresult by arguing  that a symbiotic relationship  existed between\r\n\nHyatt and  the mongoose  population in the  mangrove swamp.   She\r\n\npins this  rather exotic theory  to a suggestion that  Hyatt must\r\n\nhave   benefitted  from  the   mongooses'  natural  affinity  for\r\n\ndevouring snakes  and rodents, and  that this benefit  is legally\r\n\ntantamount to control.  This  argument is woven entirely from the\r\n\ngossamer strands  of  speculation and  surmise.   The  record  is\r\n\ndevoid of any evidence that mongooses patrolled the perimeters of\r\n\nthe hotel's  grounds, performing  pest control  functions.   And,\r\n\nmoreover,  the  argument  is  unaccompanied   by  any  meaningful\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ncitation to applicable  legal authority.4  In  sum, this argument\r\n\nis   factually   barren,   legally   bankrupt,   and   altogether\r\n\ninsufficient  to breathe life  into the plaintiff's  Article 1805\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n                   B.

Consequently,\r\n\nnotwithstanding the heightened  duty of care and  protection, the\r\n\nhotel-keeper is not liable for harm unless the harm is reasonably\r\n\nforeseeable.  See Coyne, 53 F.3d at 460-61.\r                                 \r\n\n          In this case, the  linchpin question is whether  it was\r\n\nreasonably foreseeable at  the time and place in  question that a\r\n\nmongoose would attack  a guest (for, without  a foreseeable harm,\r\n\nHyatt could  not have  breached its  duty of  care by failing  to\r\n\nimplement a mongoose control program before the attack).  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat  460.   The  district  court  answered  this question  in  the\r\n\nnegative.  See Woods-Leber, 951 F. Supp.  at 1039.  We think that\r                                    \r\n\nJudge Dominguez got it right.\r\n\n          The  evidence as  to  knowledge is  telling.   On  this\r\n\npoint, the record permits only one conclusion:  that Hyatt had no\r\n\nknowledge,  actual  or  constructive,  either of  the  mongooses'\r\n\nexistence or of the incipient  danger that they presented, at any\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ntime  before  the attack.    The  hotel personnel  most  directly\r\n\ninvolved in the  matter (such as the head grounds  keeper and the\r\n\nchief  of security) submitted affidavits  which made plain that a\r\n\nmongoose had never  before been seen on the  hotel premises; that\r\n\nno  one at  the hotel knew  of the  presence of mongooses  in the\r\n\nmangrove swamp or  otherwise in the vicinity; and  that, prior to\r\n\nthe  assault on Woods-Leber, no wild animal  of any kind had ever\r\n\nbitten any hotel guest.  By the same token, there was no evidence\r\n\nfrom which a factfinder could conclude, without rank speculation,\r\n\nthat  the temporary food  preparation and storage  area presented\r\n\nany hazard or that Hyatt should have known the  inauguration of a\r\n\nconstruction  project near the mangrove swamp portended an influx\r\n\nof  wild animals.  Indeed, several previous construction projects\r\n\nhad been  undertaken near the  swamp without incident.   Finally,\r\n\nthere  was  no   evidence  either  that  a   non-rabid  mongoose,\r\n\nunprovoked, was likely to bite a supine sunbather, or that rabies\r\n\nwas prevalent in the area.\r\n\n          We do  not mean to  imply that, merely because  a rabid\r\n\nmongoose  had never  before  invaded the  premises  and bitten  a\r\n\nguest, the  attack could not  have been foreseen.   See generally\r                                                                           \r\n\nPabon-Escabi, 90 P.R.R.  at 25 (explaining that  \"the requirement\r                      \r\n\nof  foreseeability [does not  require] that  the precise  risk or\r\n\nconsequences  have been  foreseen\").

But  here,\r                     \r\n\nthe  plaintiff  offered  no  evidence  to support  a  finding  of\r\n\nforeseeability, electing  instead  to  rely  on  the  defendant's\r\n\naffidavits and declarations.6   We have warned  before, and today\r\n\nreiterate, that parties  who permit the  movant to configure  the\r\n\nsummary judgment  record do so  at their  peril.  See  Kelly, 924\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 358.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  As the district court correctly\r\n\nstated, \"[t]he normal rule is that a person does not have  a duty\r\n\nto prevent an attack upon another . . . by wild animals.\"  Woods-\r                                                                           \r\n\nLeber, 951 F.  Supp. at 1036 (citations omitted).  While the rule\r               \r\n\nadmits of  exceptions,  the plaintiff  in  this case  adduced  no\r\n\nevidence which sufficed  to bring the mongoose  attack within any\r\n\nof those exceptions.  Since  a hotel-keeper, like any other owner\r\n\nor occupier of premises, cannot be held liable  for that which it\r\n\ncannot  reasonably  foresee,  the  lower  court  did  not err  in\r\n\ngranting Hyatt's motion for summary judgment.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6This  presents  a marked  contrast  to the  cases  on which\r\nWoods-Leber  relies.
