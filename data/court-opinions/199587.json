Sullivan,  Assistant   Attorney General,\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, with whom Thomas F. Reilly,\nAttorney General, was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                         September 5, 2001\n\f\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.             Petitioner-appellant Charles C.\n\nDelaney III, a Massachusetts state prisoner, sought a writ of\n\nhabeas   corpus    in    the   United    States     District    Court     for   the\n\nDistrict   of     Massachusetts,         but     voluntarily     withdrew       his\n\napplication when the Commonwealth pointed out that it contained\n\nunexhausted     claims.         After    pursuing      all     available    state\n\nremedies, the petitioner returned to federal court.                       At that\n\njuncture, the court dismissed his new application as untimely\n\nunder the one-year limitation period enacted as part of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996).\n\n           The petitioner appeals this order, asseverating that\n\nthe district court erred in refusing to toll the limitation\n\nperiod   during    the    pendency      of    his   original    federal    habeas\n\npetition; that absent such tolling the statutory limitation\n\nviolates the Suspension Clause; and that, in all events, the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by failing to resuscitate\n\nhis time-barred claim on equitable grounds.                     Recent Supreme\n\nCourt precedent holding that the relevant statutory provision,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), may not be tolled by the pendency of\n\nfederal,   as     opposed      to   state,     post-conviction      proceedings\n\ndefeats the first of these asseverations.               See Duncan v. Walker,\n\n121 S. Ct. 2120, 2129 (2001).           The second fails on the law.            The\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthird fails on the facts:          even assuming, for argument's sake,\n\nthat equitable tolling is available in the precincts patrolled\n\nby section 2244(d) — a matter on which we take no view — the\n\ndistrict court supportably determined that the petitioner had\n\nnot established a sufficiently compelling basis for remediation.\n\nConsequently, we uphold the district court's dismissal of the\n\npetitioner's application for habeas relief.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n          We retrace the relevant portions of the petitioner's\n\njourney through the procedural labyrinth that typifies modern\n\nhabeas litigation.      The facts are essentially uncontested.\n\n          In 1989, a Massachusetts jury found the petitioner\n\nguilty   of    murder   in   the   second    degree.      The    trial    judge\n\nsentenced him to life imprisonment.              On direct review, his\n\nconviction     was   sequentially     affirmed    by     the    Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court and the Supreme Judicial Court.              See Commonwealth\n\nv. Delaney, 616 N.E.2d 111 (Mass. App. Ct. 1993), aff'd, 639\n\nN.E.2d   710   (Mass.   1994).       The    conviction    became    final    on\n\nSeptember 20, 1994.\n\n          On February 24, 1997, ten months after the AEDPA's\n\neffective date, the petitioner for the first time asked the\n\nfederal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.                      See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254.       In this pro se petition (Petition No. 1), he\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\freasserted various claims that he had presented to the state\n\ncourts      and   added     four    new     (unexhausted)      claims.     The\n\nCommonwealth promptly moved to dismiss this \"mixed\" petition.\n\nSee Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 522 (1982) (holding that a\n\nfederal habeas court ordinarily should not adjudicate a \"mixed\"\n\npetition, i.e., one containing both exhausted and unexhausted\n\nclaims); Adelson v. DiPaola, 131 F.3d 259, 261-62 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (same).        The petitioner countered by moving to dismiss the\n\naction without prejudice.           The district court granted the latter\n\nmotion on May 2, 1997.\n\n             On June 6, 1997, the petitioner returned to state court\n\nand filed a motion for a new trial that raised two ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims.              These claims were not the claims\n\npreviously asserted in Petition No. 1, but, rather, were newly\n\nminted.     The superior court denied this motion a few weeks later\n\nand,   by    March    27,   1998,    the    petitioner   had   exhausted   all\n\navailable state appellate remedies.\n\n             On April 10, 1998, the petitioner refiled for federal\n\nhabeas relief, raising only the two ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims.         Citing 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), the district\n\ncourt dismissed this application (Petition No. 2) as untimely.\n\nWhen   the    petitioner     moved     for    reconsideration,     the   court\n\nwithheld a ruling and asked us to consider whether Petition No.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f2 was a \"second or successive\" habeas petition, and thus subject\n\nto the gatekeeping requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3).                    See\n\ngenerally Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 57-58 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).    Following the reasoning explicated in Slack v. McDaniel,\n\n529 U.S. 473, 487 (2000), we advised the lower court that\n\nPetition No. 2 was not a \"second or successive\" petition and\n\nthat, therefore, the gatekeeping regime did not apply.\n\n            The district court proceeded to deny the petitioner's\n\nmotion    for    reconsideration        on   the   merits.    The   court   then\n\ngranted    a    certificate     of   appealability.          See   28   U.S.C.    §\n\n2253(c).       We augmented the issues, appointed counsel for the\n\npetitioner, consolidated the case for argument with a case\n\ncontaining a similar limitation issue, and heard oral argument\n\non November 9, 2000.          Four days later, the Supreme Court granted\n\ncertiorari to review the decision of the United States Court of\n\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in Walker v. Artuz, 208 F.3d 357\n\n(2d Cir.), cert. granted sub nom. Duncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct.\n\n480 (2000).       Because Duncan squarely raised the question of\n\nwhether section 2244(d)(1) could be tolled by the pendency of\n\nfederal,    as    well   as    state,    post-conviction      proceedings,       we\n\nstayed our hand.\n\n            The Supreme Court decided Duncan on June 18, 2001.                   By\n\norder entered June 28, 2001, we vacated the stay previously\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fentered in this case and the companion case.                          We resolved the\n\ncompanion case in an opinion filed on August 20, 2001,                               see\n\nNeverson v. Bissonnette, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 00-\n\n1044], and now decide the petitioner's appeal.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n               Congress enacted the AEDPA on April 24, 1996, in part\n\nto combat increasingly pervasive abuses of the federal courts'\n\nhabeas    jurisdiction.            Felker    v.    Turpin,      518    U.S.   651,   664\n\n(1996).    Pertinently, the AEDPA imposed a one-year limitation\n\nperiod applicable to state prisoners' habeas applications.                           See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).                  This period of limitation normally\n\nbegins    to    accrue       on   \"the    date    on   which    the    [state    court]\n\njudgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\n\nexpiration       of    the    time   for    seeking      such    review.\"        Id.   §\n\n2244(d)(1)(A).\n\n               The    courts      have     determined         that    this    language\n\nencompasses a one-year grace period within which state prisoners\n\nmay file federal habeas petitions to test the correctness of\n\nconvictions that became final before the AEDPA's effective date.\n\nSee   Gaskins v. Duval, 183 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir. 1999) (per\n\ncuriam); see also Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 n.1 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring)          (collecting     cases       to    like    effect     from    other\n\ncircuits).           Accordingly, the petitioner had until April 24,\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f1997, to file an application for federal habeas relief.                       He\n\ndocketed Petition No. 1 within that window of opportunity, but\n\nhe voluntarily withdrew that petition.               He did not propound\n\nPetition No. 2 until April 10, 1998 (nearly a year after the\n\ngrace period had run its course).              Hence, that petition was\n\ntime-barred,     as    the    district     court     ruled,   absent        some\n\nsufficiently excusatory circumstance.\n\n            The petitioner's principal attempt to rescue his habeas\n\napplication implicates 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), which provides\n\nthat \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for\n\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to\n\nthe pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted\n\ntoward any period of limitation under [section 2244(d)].\"                    But\n\nthis provision is of no help to the petitioner:                   although it\n\nplainly tolls the limitation period from and after June 6, 1997\n\n(the date upon which he moved for a new trial in state court),\n\nthe one-year period already had elapsed by that date.\n\n            In an attempt to overcome this obstacle, the petitioner\n\ncontends that the reference in section 2244(d)(2) to \"other\n\ncollateral review\" includes not only state collateral review\n\nproceedings but also federal habeas proceedings.                  If that were\n\nso,   the   pendency   of    Petition    No.   1   would   have    tolled    the\n\nlimitation period from the date of filing (February 24, 1997) to\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthe date of dismissal (May 2, 1997), and this hiatus, coupled\n\nwith the tolling that accompanied the petitioner's pursuit of\n\npost-conviction remedies in the state courts during the period\n\nfrom June 6, 1997, through March 27, 1998, would have rendered\n\nPetition No. 2 timely (i.e., filed within one year of April 24,\n\n1996, after subtracting \"tolled\" periods).               As a first fallback\n\nposition, the petitioner maintains that the statutory limitation\n\nperiod, if construed otherwise, violates the Constitution.                     As\n\na second fallback, he asserts that even if his reading of\n\nsection 2244(d)(2) proves overly sanguine and the provision\n\nnonetheless     is    constitutional,      the   district   judge      erred   in\n\nrefusing to apply principles of equitable tolling to assure his\n\nday in court.        We address each of these arguments.\n\n                          A.   Statutory Tolling.\n\n           The question of what Congress meant when it wrote that\n\nthe AEDPA's limitation period, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), would be\n\ntolled while a state prisoner pursued \"State post-conviction or\n\nother collateral review,\" id. § 2244(d)(2), is no longer open.\n\nThe   Duncan    Court   made   it   crystal      clear   that   the    adjective\n\n\"State\" qualifies both of the phrases that follow.                    121 S. Ct.\n\nat 2128.      Accordingly, section 2244(d)(2), properly construed,\n\n\"toll[s] the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies\n\n[but]   not    during   the    pendency    of    applications    for    federal\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\freview.\"     Id.   It follows inexorably that \"an application for\n\nfederal habeas corpus review is not an 'application for State\n\npost-conviction or other collateral review' within the meaning\n\nof 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).\"        Id. at 2129; accord Neverson, ___\n\nF.3d at ___ [slip op. at 8-9].        This means, of course, that the\n\npendency of Petition No. 1 did not toll the limitation period\n\n(and, therefore, did not render Petition No. 2 timeous).\n\n                      B.    The Suspension Clause.\n\n           The     petitioner    rejoins   that   so   restrictive   an\n\ninterpretation of the statutory tolling provision renders the\n\nAEDPA's limitation period constitutionally suspect under the\n\nSuspension Clause.         Duncan does not foreclose this argument —\n\nthe Suspension Clause was not raised in that case — so we\n\naddress it here.\n\n           The Suspension Clause states that \"[t]he Privilege of\n\nthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in\n\nCases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require\n\nit.\"   U.S. Const. art. 1 § 9, cl. 2.        In Felker, 518 U.S. at\n\n663, the Court noted that the purpose of the writ has changed\n\nover time.    In 1789, the writ was designed primarily to protect\n\nagainst the power of the Executive to hold someone captive\n\nwithout trial, INS v. St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 2280 (2001), and\n\nit was not until 1867 that Congress extended the writ to include\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fstate     prisoners   who    challenged   their    convictions   on\n\nconstitutional or statutory grounds.      See Felker, 518 U.S. at\n\n559-60.    Because the current writ is so different from the one\n\nknown to the Framers, some jurists have questioned whether — and\n\nto what extent — the Suspension Clause applies to the modern\n\nhabeas remedy.    E.g., Freeman v. Page, 208 F.3d 572, 576 (7th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 345 (2000).       The Supreme Court\n\nhas yet to answer that question,1 and we need not do so today.\n\n           Even assuming, for purposes of our inquiry, that the\n\nSuspension Clause applies, reasonable limits on the use and\n\napplication of the habeas remedy do not work an unconstitutional\n\nsuspension of the writ.     See United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d\n\n\n    1 While the historical puzzle remains unsolved, the Justices\napparently harbor divergent views about the sweep of the\nSuspension Clause.      In a set of opinions analyzing the\ninteraction between the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act, Pub. L. No. 104-108, 110 Stat. 3009-546, and\nthe AEDPA, Justice Stevens, writing for a five-member majority,\ninterpreted these statutes as allowing habeas relief for certain\naliens, predicting that any other reading would raise serious\nconstitutional questions under the Suspension Clause. St. Cyr,\n121 S. Ct. at 2282; Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 121 S. Ct. 2268,\n2270 (2001) (adopting St. Cyr's Suspension Clause analysis).\nJustice Scalia, in dissents joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist\nand Justice Thomas, posited that the Suspension Clause does not\naffirmatively guarantee a right to habeas corpus, but simply\nprohibits temporary withholding of the writ. See St. Cyr, 121\nS. Ct. at 2299 (Scalia, J., dissenting); Calcano-Martinez, 121\nS. Ct. at 2271 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice O'Connor filed\nseparate dissents in both cases, taking no position on the\nspecific meaning and application of the Suspension Clause. See\nSt. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. at 2293 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Calcano-\nMartinez, 121 S. Ct. at 2270 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).\n\n                                -11-\n\f34, 53 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1176 (2000).               The\n\nCourt   has    held,   for    example,     that   the    AEDPA's    stringent\n\nrestrictions on second habeas petitions do not run afoul of the\n\nSuspension Clause.         See Felker, 518 U.S. at 664.            We believe\n\nthat the same reasoning applies to the AEDPA's time-limiting\n\nprovisions.    We therefore join several of our sister circuits in\n\nholding that the AEDPA's one-year limitation period does not, as\n\na general matter, offend the Suspension Clause.              See Wyzykowski\n\nv. Dep't of Corrs., 226 F.3d 1213, 1217-18 (11th Cir. 2000);\n\nLucidore v. New York State Div. of Parole, 209 F.3d 107, 113 (2d\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 175 (2000); Turner v. Johnson,\n\n177 F.3d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1007\n\n(1999); Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 977-78 (10th Cir. 1998).2\n\n            The question reduces, then, to whether the tolling\n\nprovision, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), as interpreted by the Duncan\n\nCourt, renders the AEDPA's limitation period vulnerable to the\n\npetitioner's    attack.       We   think   not.    The    AEDPA's    one-year\n\nstatute of limitation is part of \"a complex and evolving body of\n\nequitable     principles     informed    and   controlled    by    historical\n\n\n\n    2Some courts have suggested that the AEDPA's built-in\nlimitation period might violate the Suspension Clause if a\nprisoner-petitioner could make a showing of actual innocence.\nSee, e.g., Wyzykowski, 226 F.3d at 1218-19; Lucidore, 209 F.3d\nat 113-14. Because Delaney makes no such proffer, we need not\nreach this question.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fusage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions.\" Felker,\n\n518 U.S. at 664 (quoting McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 489\n\n(1991)).      Rather than rendering the limitation period more\n\nonerous, the tolling provision relaxes its rigors.                 That the\n\nprovision is not as generous as the petitioner might like does\n\nnot undermine the reasonableness of the framework that Congress\n\nchose to erect.      It follows that the tolling provision falls\n\nwell within the heartland of the evolutionary process described\n\nby the Felker Court.\n\n            To sum up, the one-year limitation period of section\n\n2244(d)(1), as embellished by the tolling provision of section\n\n2244(d)(2), does not suspend the writ because, when read in\n\ntandem, these provisions neither gut the writ of habeas corpus\n\nnor render it impuissant to test the legality of a prisoner's\n\ndetention.     See Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 381 (1977)\n\n(describing the contours of the Suspension Clause).              Tolling the\n\nlimitation period during the pendency of state post-conviction\n\nproceedings     leaves    habeas      petitioners     with   a   reasonable\n\nopportunity to have their claims heard on the merits.                     See\n\nLucidore,    209   F.3d   at   113.      From   the   standpoint     of   the\n\nSuspension Clause, no more is exigible.3\n\n\n    3Relatedly, the petitioner asserts that the limitation\nperiod, as embroidered by the tolling provision, has an\nimpermissibly retroactive effect. This argument is hopeless,\n\n                                   -13-\n\f              We add a postscript. The Suspension Clause applies (if\n\nat all) only when Congress totally bars an individual or a group\n\nfrom access to habeas relief.                See Barrett, 178 F.3d at 53.\n\nHere, the petitioner had ample opportunity, both before and\n\nafter Congress passed the AEDPA, to exhaust state court remedies\n\nand seek federal habeas review.             That he had those opportunities\n\nand did not seasonably avail himself of them is, in itself,\n\nenough   to    doom   his    constitutional        challenge.     See    Molo   v.\n\nJohnson, 207 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (holding\n\nthat   the     Suspension        Clause    was   not   violated   when   nothing\n\nprevented the prisoner from filing his application before the\n\nstatute of limitation expired).\n\n                            C.    Equitable Tolling.\n\n              In the district court, the petitioner argued, in the\n\nalternative, that the court should deem the limitation period\n\ntolled as a matter of equity.                    The court entertained this\n\nargument but rejected it on the merits.                 The petitioner renews\n\nthe argument on appeal, positing that the district court erred\n\nin refusing to rejuvenate his time-barred habeas application.\n\n\n\nsee Rogers v. United States, 180 F.3d 349, 353-55 (1st Cir.\n1999), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1126 (2000) (rejecting similar\nretroactivity argument); Libby v. Magnusson, 177 F.3d 43, 46\n(1st Cir. 1999) (same); cf. Pratt, 129 F.3d at 58 (discussing\nretroactivity in the context of second or successive habeas\npetitions), and we reject it out of hand.\n\n                                          -14-\n\f              We review the district court's ruling for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.          See United States v. Patterson, 211 F.3d 927, 931\n\n(5th Cir. 2000); see also Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,\n\n935 F.2d 370, 377 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[F]ashioning or withholding\n\nequitable relief . . . rests uniquely within the discretion of\n\nthe trial court.\").           This is a highly deferential standard, but\n\nnot an unbounded one.              See United States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d\n\n17, 20 (1st Cir. 1992); Indep. Oil & Chem. Workers, Inc. v.\n\nProcter & Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n              The concurring opinion in Duncan furnishes at least\n\nsome       support    for    the   view    that,   in     an   appropriate      case,\n\nequitable tolling may be available to soften the rigors of\n\nsection 2244(d)(1).           There, Justice Stevens, writing for himself\n\nand Justice Souter, took the position that \"neither the Court's\n\nnarrow      holding     [in    Duncan],     nor    anything      in   the    text   or\n\nlegislative history of AEDPA, precludes a federal court from\n\ndeeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a\n\nmatter of equity.\"            Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring).         This is interesting food for thought,4 but we need\n\nnot    resolve       today    whether     courts   ever    can   apply      equitable\n\n\n\n       4\n      Post-Duncan, at least one court of appeals has held that\nequitable tolling is available to habeas petitioners in respect\nto section 2244(d)(1)'s one-year limitation period. See Zarvela\nv. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 379 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n                                          -15-\n\ftolling     to    ameliorate     the        AEDPA's     one-year       statute    of\n\nlimitations.         In   this   case,       the   district       court   squarely\n\nconfronted the petitioner's equitable tolling claim and rejected\n\nit   on   the    facts.    Assuming,        arguendo,     the    availability     of\n\nequitable tolling, the record makes manifest that the district\n\ncourt acted within its proper province in withholding such\n\nrelief.\n\n            The party who seeks to invoke equitable tolling bears\n\nthe burden of establishing the basis for it.                          Carter v.   W.\n\nPubl'g Co., 225 F.3d 1258, 1265 (11th Cir. 2000); I.V. Servs. of\n\nAm., Inc. v. Inn Dev. & Mgmt., Inc., 182 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).     In the AEDPA environment, courts have indicated that\n\nequitable tolling, if available at all, is the exception rather\n\nthan the rule; resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified\n\nonly in extraordinary circumstances.                  E.g., United States v.\n\nMarcello, 212 F.3d 1005, 1010 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S.\n\nCt. 188 (2000); Davis v. Johnson, 158 F.3d 806, 810 (5th Cir.\n\n1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1074 (1999); Sandvik v. United\n\nStates, 177 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir. 1999).                      The district\n\ncourt found that the petitioner did not meet this benchmark, and\n\nthe argument to the contrary is not compelling.\n\n            The    petitioner    maintains         that   he     is   entitled    to\n\nequitable       tolling   because      he     diligently        pursued   judicial\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fremedies.     Even if the district court were obligated to apply\n\nequitable tolling for an attentive applicant, the facts of\n\nrecord here do not corroborate the petitioner's contention that\n\nhe was diligent.    He waited over two years after his conviction\n\nbecame final (and ten months after the AEDPA's effective date)\n\nto promulgate his first federal habeas petition.   He did nothing\n\nduring that protracted period to exhaust state remedies as to\n\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel claims that he now seeks\n\nto advance.    Indeed, his first habeas application ignored those\n\nclaims and, at any rate, he withdrew that application in the\n\nface of the AEDPA's known one-year limitation period, without\n\nasking the district court to retain jurisdiction.5    He did not\n\nfile a proper habeas application until April of 1998 — more than\n\neleven months after the AEDPA's limitation period had expired.\n\n\n\n    5 The petitioner perhaps could have improved his position by\nrequesting that the district court stay, rather than dismiss,\nPetition No. 1. See Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring) (observing that \"there is no reason why a district\ncourt should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim\nand stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of\nstate remedies\"); Neverson, ___ F.3d at ___ n.3 [slip op. at 11\nn.3] (describing such an approach as \"preferable\" in cases\ninvolving \"mixed\" petitions); see also Zarvela v. Artuz, 254\nF.3d 374, 380 (2d Cir. 2001); Freeman, 208 F.3d at 577; Calderon\nv. United States Dist. Ct., 134 F.3d 981, 986-87 (9th Cir.\n1998). We especially commend such an approach to the district\ncourts in instances in which the original habeas petition,\nthough unexhausted, is timely filed, but there is a realistic\ndanger that a second petition, filed after exhaustion has\noccurred, will be untimely.\n\n                               -17-\n\f            The district court was well aware of these facts and\n\ntook them into account in addressing the petitioner's plea for\n\nequitable tolling.    Judge Keeton noted that while the petitioner\n\nhad pursued a variety of claims over a nine-year period, he had\n\nnot done so in an especially assiduous fashion.           See Delaney v.\n\nMatesanz, No. 98-10635-REK, slip op. at 7 (D. Mass. Nov. 6,\n\n1998)    (unpublished).     In    addition,   Judge    Keeton   found     no\n\nextraordinary circumstances that might suffice to excuse the\n\npetitioner's failure to comply with the temporal deadline:                no\n\none lulled the petitioner into a false belief that he had more\n\nthan the allotted time to file, or otherwise misled him.                Id.\n\n            We need not rehearse all the details of the decision\n\nbelow.    What matters is that the judge plainly considered all\n\nthe   pertinent   factors   and   no   impertinent    ones.     Given    his\n\nthorough explanation, we cannot say that his refusal to apply\n\nprinciples of equitable tolling to salvage the petitioner's\n\ntime-barred habeas application constituted a plain mistake in\n\njudgment.    After all, \"the principles of equitable tolling . .\n\n. do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of\n\nexcusable neglect.\"       Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498\n\nU.S. 89, 96 (1990).\n\n            The petitioner makes a final plea.            He says that\n\nbecause he was a pro se prisoner, ignorant of the applicable\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\flaw, the lower court should have tolled the limitation period.\n\nWe reject this plea.            In the context of habeas claims, courts\n\nhave been loath to excuse late filings simply because a pro se\n\nprisoner misreads the law.                  E.g., Marsh v. Soares, 223 F.3d\n\n1217, 1220 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1195\n\n(2001) (refusing to toll the AEDPA's limitation period because\n\na pro se petitioner did not understand the dictates of the\n\nstatutory scheme); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 159-60 (3d\n\nCir.    1999)    (explaining         that    misunderstanding          the     effect       of\n\nfiling a prior unexhausted federal habeas petition does not\n\nwarrant equitable tolling); Fisher v. Johnson, 174 F.3d 710, 714\n\n(5th    Cir.     1999),    cert.       denied,       121      S.    Ct.    1124       (2001)\n\n(\"[I]gnorance      of     the   law,    even       for   an    incarcerated           pro   se\n\npetitioner, generally does not excuse prompt filing.\").\n\n               In this instance, the district court had good reason\n\nto    follow    this    line    of    authority.         The       court   specifically\n\nremarked that the petitioner was no ordinary pro se litigant;\n\nhis    submissions,       in    the    court's       view,         displayed      a    clear\n\nunderstanding of the AEDPA amendments.                   See Delaney, supra, slip\n\nop. at 7.       We are reluctant to second-guess this fact-sensitive\n\njudgment.        While    judges      are    generally        lenient      with       pro   se\n\nlitigants, the Constitution does not require courts to undertake\n\n\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fheroic    measures    to   save      pro   se   litigants   from   the   readily\n\nforeseeable consequences of their own inaction.\n\n            Even where available, equitable tolling is normally\n\nappropriate only when circumstances beyond a litigant's control\n\nhave prevented him from filing on time.              Bonilla v. Muebles J.J.\n\nAlvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1999) (addressing\n\nequitable tolling in the context of the ADA).                      In the usual\n\ncase, a court may deny a request for equitable tolling unless\n\nthe proponent shows that he was actively misled or prevented \"in\n\nsome extraordinary way from asserting his rights.\"                   Patterson,\n\n211 F.3d at 930-31 (citation omitted).                  In short, equitable\n\ntolling is strong medicine, not profligately to be dispensed.\n\n            In this case, the Commonwealth did not mislead the\n\npetitioner, nor has he alleged any exceptional circumstances\n\nthat prevented him from filing his habeas petition on time.\n\nAccordingly, the lower court acted within its discretion in\n\ndeclining to excuse the petitioner's non-compliance with the\n\nlegislatively-mandated limitation period.\n\nIII.     CONCLUSION\n\n            We   need      go   no     further.       The   Supreme      Court's\n\ninterpretation of section 2244(d)(2) permits courts to toll the\n\nlimitation period only while state collateral review is pending.\n\nSee Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2128-29; Neverson, ___ F.3d at ___\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f[slip op. at 8-9].     The instant petition therefore fails because\n\nthe petitioner did not bring it within this constitutionally\n\npermissible interval.       Moreover, no extraordinary circumstances\n\nprevented him from protecting his own interests, so the district\n\ncourt   did   not   abuse   its   discretion   in   declining   to   apply\n\nequitable tolling to resuscitate his time-barred habeas case.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\f",

Petitioner-appellant Charles C.\n\nDelaney III, a Massachusetts state prisoner, sought a writ of\n\nhabeas   corpus    in    the   United    States     District    Court     for   the\n\nDistrict   of     Massachusetts,         but     voluntarily     withdrew       his\n\napplication when the Commonwealth pointed out that it contained\n\nunexhausted     claims.         After    pursuing      all     available    state\n\nremedies, the petitioner returned to federal court.                       At that\n\njuncture, the court dismissed his new application as untimely\n\nunder the one-year limitation period enacted as part of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.

BACKGROUND\n\n          We retrace the relevant portions of the petitioner's\n\njourney through the procedural labyrinth that typifies modern\n\nhabeas litigation.      The facts are essentially uncontested.\n\n          In 1989, a Massachusetts jury found the petitioner\n\nguilty   of    murder   in   the   second    degree.      The    trial    judge\n\nsentenced him to life imprisonment.              On direct review, his\n\nconviction     was   sequentially     affirmed    by     the    Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court and the Supreme Judicial Court.              See Commonwealth\n\nv.

The    conviction    became    final    on\n\nSeptember 20, 1994.\n\n          On February 24, 1997, ten months after the AEDPA's\n\neffective date, the petitioner for the first time asked the\n\nfederal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.                      See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254.       In this pro se petition (Petition No. 1), he\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\freasserted various claims that he had presented to the state\n\ncourts      and   added     four    new     (unexhausted)      claims.     The\n\nCommonwealth promptly moved to dismiss this \"mixed\" petition.\n\nSee Rose v.

The petitioner countered by moving to dismiss the\n\naction without prejudice.           The district court granted the latter\n\nmotion on May 2, 1997.\n\n             On June 6, 1997, the petitioner returned to state court\n\nand filed a motion for a new trial that raised two ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims.              These claims were not the claims\n\npreviously asserted in Petition No. 1, but, rather, were newly\n\nminted.     The superior court denied this motion a few weeks later\n\nand,   by    March    27,   1998,    the    petitioner   had   exhausted   all\n\navailable state appellate remedies.\n\n             On April 10, 1998, the petitioner refiled for federal\n\nhabeas relief, raising only the two ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims.

ANALYSIS\n\n               Congress enacted the AEDPA on April 24, 1996, in part\n\nto combat increasingly pervasive abuses of the federal courts'\n\nhabeas    jurisdiction.            Felker    v.    Turpin,      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   664\n\n(1996).    Pertinently, the AEDPA imposed a one-year limitation\n\nperiod applicable to state prisoners' habeas applications.                           See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).                  This period of limitation normally\n\nbegins    to    accrue       on   \"the    date    on   which    the    [state    court]\n\njudgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\n\nexpiration       of    the    time   for    seeking      such    review.\"        Id.   §\n\n2244(d)(1)(A).\n\n               The    courts      have     determined         that    this    language\n\nencompasses a one-year grace period within which state prisoners\n\nmay file federal habeas petitions to test the correctness of\n\nconvictions that became final before the AEDPA's effective date.\n\nSee   Gaskins v. Duval, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198545\"><a href=\"/opinion/198545/gaskins-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 1999) (per\n\ncuriam); see also Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 n.1 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring)          (collecting     cases       to    like    effect     from    other\n\ncircuits).           Accordingly, the petitioner had until April 24,\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f1997, to file an application for federal habeas relief.                       He\n\ndocketed Petition No. 1 within that window of opportunity, but\n\nhe voluntarily withdrew that petition.               He did not propound\n\nPetition No. 2 until April 10, 1998 (nearly a year after the\n\ngrace period had run its course).              Hence, that petition was\n\ntime-barred,     as    the    district     court     ruled,   absent        some\n\nsufficiently excusatory circumstance.\n\n            The petitioner's principal attempt to rescue his habeas\n\napplication implicates 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), which provides\n\nthat \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for\n\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to\n\nthe pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted\n\ntoward any period of limitation under [section 2244(d)].\"                    But\n\nthis provision is of no help to the petitioner:                   although it\n\nplainly tolls the limitation period from and after June 6, 1997\n\n(the date upon which he moved for a new trial in state court),\n\nthe one-year period already had elapsed by that date.\n\n            In an attempt to overcome this obstacle, the petitioner\n\ncontends that the reference in section 2244(d)(2) to \"other\n\ncollateral review\" includes not only state collateral review\n\nproceedings but also federal habeas proceedings.                  If that were\n\nso,   the   pendency   of    Petition    No.   1   would   have    tolled    the\n\nlimitation period from the date of filing (February 24, 1997) to\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthe date of dismissal (May 2, 1997), and this hiatus, coupled\n\nwith the tolling that accompanied the petitioner's pursuit of\n\npost-conviction remedies in the state courts during the period\n\nfrom June 6, 1997, through March 27, 1998, would have rendered\n\nPetition No. 2 timely (i.e., filed within one year of April 24,\n\n1996, after subtracting \"tolled\" periods).               As a first fallback\n\nposition, the petitioner maintains that the statutory limitation\n\nperiod, if construed otherwise, violates the Constitution.                     As\n\na second fallback, he asserts that even if his reading of\n\nsection 2244(d)(2) proves overly sanguine and the provision\n\nnonetheless     is    constitutional,      the   district   judge      erred   in\n\nrefusing to apply principles of equitable tolling to assure his\n\nday in court.        We address each of these arguments.\n\n                          A.   Statutory Tolling.\n\n           The question of what Congress meant when it wrote that\n\nthe AEDPA's limitation period, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), would be\n\ntolled while a state prisoner pursued \"State post-conviction or\n\nother collateral review,\" id. § 2244(d)(2), is no longer open.\n\nThe   Duncan    Court   made   it   crystal      clear   that   the    adjective\n\n\"State\" qualifies both of the phrases that follow.                    121 S. Ct.\n\nat 2128.      Accordingly, section 2244(d)(2), properly construed,\n\n\"toll[s] the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies\n\n[but]   not    during   the    pendency    of    applications    for    federal\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\freview.\"     Id.   It follows inexorably that \"an application for\n\nfederal habeas corpus review is not an 'application for State\n\npost-conviction or other collateral review' within the meaning\n\nof 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).\"        Id. at 2129; accord Neverson, ___\n\nF.3d at ___ [slip op. at 8-9].        This means, of course, that the\n\npendency of Petition No. 1 did not toll the limitation period\n\n(and, therefore, did not render Petition No. 2 timeous).\n\n                      B.    The Suspension Clause.\n\n           The     petitioner    rejoins   that   so   restrictive   an\n\ninterpretation of the statutory tolling provision renders the\n\nAEDPA's limitation period constitutionally suspect under the\n\nSuspension Clause.         Duncan does not foreclose this argument —\n\nthe Suspension Clause was not raised in that case — so we\n\naddress it here.\n\n           The Suspension Clause states that \"[t]he Privilege of\n\nthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in\n\nCases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require\n\nit.\"   U.S. Const. art. 1 § 9, cl. 2.        In Felker, 518 U.S. at\n\n663, the Court noted that the purpose of the writ has changed\n\nover time.    In 1789, the writ was designed primarily to protect\n\nagainst the power of the Executive to hold someone captive\n\nwithout trial, INS v. St. Cyr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Felker, 518 U.S. at\n\n559-60.    Because the current writ is so different from the one\n\nknown to the Framers, some jurists have questioned whether — and\n\nto what extent — the Suspension Clause applies to the modern\n\nhabeas remedy.    E.g., Freeman v.

The Supreme Court\n\nhas yet to answer that question,1 and we need not do so today.\n\n           Even assuming, for purposes of our inquiry, that the\n\nSuspension Clause applies, reasonable limits on the use and\n\napplication of the habeas remedy do not work an unconstitutional\n\nsuspension of the writ.

We   think   not.    The    AEDPA's    one-year\n\nstatute of limitation is part of \"a complex and evolving body of\n\nequitable     principles     informed    and   controlled    by    historical\n\n\n\n    2Some courts have suggested that the AEDPA's built-in\nlimitation period might violate the Suspension Clause if a\nprisoner-petitioner could make a showing of actual innocence.\nSee, e.g., Wyzykowski, 226 F.3d at 1218-19; Lucidore, 209 F.3d\nat 113-14.

Rather than rendering the limitation period more\n\nonerous, the tolling provision relaxes its rigors.                 That the\n\nprovision is not as generous as the petitioner might like does\n\nnot undermine the reasonableness of the framework that Congress\n\nchose to erect.      It follows that the tolling provision falls\n\nwell within the heartland of the evolutionary process described\n\nby the Felker Court.\n\n            To sum up, the one-year limitation period of section\n\n2244(d)(1), as embellished by the tolling provision of section\n\n2244(d)(2), does not suspend the writ because, when read in\n\ntandem, these provisions neither gut the writ of habeas corpus\n\nnor render it impuissant to test the legality of a prisoner's\n\ndetention.     See Swain v.

Tolling the\n\nlimitation period during the pendency of state post-conviction\n\nproceedings     leaves    habeas      petitioners     with   a   reasonable\n\nopportunity to have their claims heard on the merits.                     See\n\nLucidore,    209   F.3d   at   113.      From   the   standpoint     of   the\n\nSuspension Clause, no more is exigible.3\n\n\n    3Relatedly, the petitioner asserts that the limitation\nperiod, as embroidered by the tolling provision, has an\nimpermissibly retroactive effect.

See Barrett, 178 F.3d at 53.\n\nHere, the petitioner had ample opportunity, both before and\n\nafter Congress passed the AEDPA, to exhaust state court remedies\n\nand seek federal habeas review.

There, Justice Stevens, writing for himself\n\nand Justice Souter, took the position that \"neither the Court's\n\nnarrow      holding     [in    Duncan],     nor    anything      in   the    text   or\n\nlegislative history of AEDPA, precludes a federal court from\n\ndeeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a\n\nmatter of equity.\"            Duncan, 121 S.

In the AEDPA environment, courts have indicated that\n\nequitable tolling, if available at all, is the exception rather\n\nthan the rule; resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified\n\nonly in extraordinary circumstances.

The district\n\ncourt found that the petitioner did not meet this benchmark, and\n\nthe argument to the contrary is not compelling.\n\n            The    petitioner    maintains         that   he     is   entitled    to\n\nequitable       tolling   because      he     diligently        pursued   judicial\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fremedies.     Even if the district court were obligated to apply\n\nequitable tolling for an attentive applicant, the facts of\n\nrecord here do not corroborate the petitioner's contention that\n\nhe was diligent.    He waited over two years after his conviction\n\nbecame final (and ten months after the AEDPA's effective date)\n\nto promulgate his first federal habeas petition.   He did nothing\n\nduring that protracted period to exhaust state remedies as to\n\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel claims that he now seeks\n\nto advance.    Indeed, his first habeas application ignored those\n\nclaims and, at any rate, he withdrew that application in the\n\nface of the AEDPA's known one-year limitation period, without\n\nasking the district court to retain jurisdiction.5    He did not\n\nfile a proper habeas application until April of 1998 — more than\n\neleven months after the AEDPA's limitation period had expired.\n\n\n\n    5 The petitioner perhaps could have improved his position by\nrequesting that the district court stay, rather than dismiss,\nPetition No. 1. See Duncan, 121 S. Ct. at 2130 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring) (observing that \"there is no reason why a district\ncourt should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim\nand stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of\nstate remedies\"); Neverson, ___ F.3d at ___ n.3 [slip op. at 11\nn.3] (describing such an approach as \"preferable\" in cases\ninvolving \"mixed\" petitions); see also Zarvela v.

We especially commend such an approach to the district\ncourts in instances in which the original habeas petition,\nthough unexhausted, is timely filed, but there is a realistic\ndanger that a second petition, filed after exhaustion has\noccurred, will be untimely.\n\n                               -17-\n\f            The district court was well aware of these facts and\n\ntook them into account in addressing the petitioner's plea for\n\nequitable tolling.    Judge Keeton noted that while the petitioner\n\nhad pursued a variety of claims over a nine-year period, he had\n\nnot done so in an especially assiduous fashion.           See Delaney v.\n\nMatesanz, No. 98-10635-REK, slip op. at 7 (D. Mass. Nov. 6,\n\n1998)    (unpublished).     In    addition,   Judge    Keeton   found     no\n\nextraordinary circumstances that might suffice to excuse the\n\npetitioner's failure to comply with the temporal deadline:                no\n\none lulled the petitioner into a false belief that he had more\n\nthan the allotted time to file, or otherwise misled him.                Id.\n\n            We need not rehearse all the details of the decision\n\nbelow.    What matters is that the judge plainly considered all\n\nthe   pertinent   factors   and   no   impertinent    ones.     Given    his\n\nthorough explanation, we cannot say that his refusal to apply\n\nprinciples of equitable tolling to salvage the petitioner's\n\ntime-barred habeas application constituted a plain mistake in\n\njudgment.    After all, \"the principles of equitable tolling . .\n\n. do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of\n\nexcusable neglect.\"       Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (1990).\n\n            The petitioner makes a final plea.            He says that\n\nbecause he was a pro se prisoner, ignorant of the applicable\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\flaw, the lower court should have tolled the limitation period.\n\nWe reject this plea.            In the context of habeas claims, courts\n\nhave been loath to excuse late filings simply because a pro se\n\nprisoner misreads the law.                  E.g., Marsh v.

The       court   specifically\n\nremarked that the petitioner was no ordinary pro se litigant;\n\nhis    submissions,       in    the    court's       view,         displayed      a    clear\n\nunderstanding of the AEDPA amendments.                   See Delaney, supra, slip\n\nop. at 7.       We are reluctant to second-guess this fact-sensitive\n\njudgment.        While    judges      are    generally        lenient      with       pro   se\n\nlitigants, the Constitution does not require courts to undertake\n\n\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fheroic    measures    to   save      pro   se   litigants   from   the   readily\n\nforeseeable consequences of their own inaction.\n\n            Even where available, equitable tolling is normally\n\nappropriate only when circumstances beyond a litigant's control\n\nhave prevented him from filing on time.

In the usual\n\ncase, a court may deny a request for equitable tolling unless\n\nthe proponent shows that he was actively misled or prevented \"in\n\nsome extraordinary way from asserting his rights.\"                   Patterson,\n\n211 F.3d at 930-31 (citation omitted).                  In short, equitable\n\ntolling is strong medicine, not profligately to be dispensed.\n\n            In this case, the Commonwealth did not mislead the\n\npetitioner, nor has he alleged any exceptional circumstances\n\nthat prevented him from filing his habeas petition on time.\n\nAccordingly, the lower court acted within its discretion in\n\ndeclining to excuse the petitioner's non-compliance with the\n\nlegislatively-mandated limitation period.\n\nIII.     CONCLUSION\n\n            We   need      go   no     further.       The   Supreme      Court's\n\ninterpretation of section 2244(d)(2) permits courts to toll the\n\nlimitation period only while state collateral review is pending.\n\nSee Duncan, 121 S.

The instant petition therefore fails because\n\nthe petitioner did not bring it within this constitutionally\n\npermissible interval.       Moreover, no extraordinary circumstances\n\nprevented him from protecting his own interests, so the district\n\ncourt   did   not   abuse   its   discretion   in   declining   to   apply\n\nequitable tolling to resuscitate his time-barred habeas case.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\f</pre>",
