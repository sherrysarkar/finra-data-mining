Plaintiff Rita Nethersole\n\nappeals from the district court judgment which dismissed her\n\nsection 1983 claims against her employer, the University of\n\nMassachusetts    (\"UMass\"),          following     her    transfer      to    a   new\n\nadministrative position.         See 42 U.S.C. § 1983; infra note 3.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n           In   1995,   UMass        appointed     Nethersole,     an    African-\n\nAmerican, as its state-wide associate vice-president for student\n\naffairs.    As such, she was responsible, among other things, for\n\npromoting faculty/student diversity.               During her early tenure,\n\na UMass credit card disappeared.                 Subsequently it was used,\n\nwithout    authorization,       by    a   person    whose    identity        remains\n\nunknown,   to   purchase    a   laptop        computer.      The   UMass      police\n\nlaunched an investigation.\n\n           Not long after the credit card fraud, UMass revised its\n\nadmissions policies (e.g., by heightening GPA requirements and\n\neliminating special admissions programs).                   Although the newly\n\nappointed UMass President, William Bulger, voiced approval of\n\nthe revised policies, some minority faculty members reacted with\n\nexpressions of concern that minority-student recruitment and\n\nadmissions would be adversely affected.                   Nethersole conveyed\n\nthese concerns to her supervisor, Vice President Joseph Deck,\n\n\n                                          3\n\fwho warned her not to air her opinions.               Later, Deck accused\n\nNethersole   of    leaking    information     to   opponents       of    the   new\n\nadmissions policies.\n\n           On April 1, 1996, Nethersole invited minority faculty\n\nand staff to meet and \"discuss relevant issues and concerns and\n\nperhaps   establish   an     action   plan   which    will      relate    to   our\n\ncollective needs.\"      The meeting took place on April 11.                    The\n\nfollowing day, Nethersole transmitted an e-mail memorandum to\n\nUMass Executive Vice-President James Julian, requesting that\n\nUMass President Bulger meet with the minority faculty caucus to\n\ndiscuss   their    concerns     regarding,     inter       alia,    the    UMass\n\nadmissions   and   diversity     policies.1        Later   in    April,    UMass\n\n\n    1In pertinent part, the Nethersole memorandum stated:\n\n           The University Caucus of Color, a group of\n           faculty and staff of color, have requested a\n           meeting   with   the  president   and   five\n           chancellors.    We hope that this meeting\n           could be a conversation [in] which the\n           concerns of the community of color can be\n           detailed to the president and responded to\n           by the president and chancellors.      Those\n           concerns include the issues of diversity\n           among the University leadership[,], . . .\n           University        admission      policies,\n           responsibility for diversity concerns . . .\n           within the President's Office, Affirmative\n           Action, the report of the Massachusetts\n           Association of Scholars, Ethnic Studies\n           programs, etc. I envision that this meeting\n           would take approximately two hours and\n           involve twenty-five campus representatives.\n           The Caucus would like to schedule the\n\n                                      4\n\finformed Nethersole's counsel that it was considering whether to\n\nterminate Nethersole's employment \"for cause,\" ostensibly a\n\nveiled reference to her suspected involvement in the November\n\n1995 credit card fraud and related computer theft.\n\n           Thereafter, on September 26, 1996, UMass Vice-President\n\nStephen Lenhardt advised Nethersole in writing that she was to\n\nbe terminated, based on \"credible evidence\" derived through an\n\nongoing investigation by the UMass police, that she had been\n\ninvolved in the November 1995 credit card fraud. 2               Lenhardt\n\ninformed Nethersole that the charges against her were to be\n\naired at a pretermination hearing, which was subsequently held\n\non October 4, 1996.\n\n           On November 22, 1996, Lenhardt sent Nethersole another\n\nletter, advising that notwithstanding \"numerous concerns over\n\nthe past months regarding [her] conduct,\" UMass was rescinding\n\nits termination decision \"at this time,\" and reassigning her to\n\nits   UMass-Boston   campus   as   the   Assistant   Dean   of   Graduate\n\nStudies, with no reduction in salary. (Emphasis added.)               The\n\nLenhardt letter neither mentioned nor described the findings\n\n\n\n           meeting for the early part of the day.\n      2\n     The only \"credible evidence\" described in the Lenhardt\nletter was the assertion that Nethersole had assured the UMass\npolice that though she did not steal the credit card, she knew\nwho did, yet refused to identify the culprit.\n\n                                    5\n\fresulting from Nethersole’s pretermination hearing.               Nethersole\n\nregarded the announced transfer as a demotion.\n\n            In due course, Nethersole instituted the present action\n\nagainst, inter alios, UMass and its Board of Trustees, as well\n\nas Bulger, Julian, and Lenhardt, claiming that her November 1996\n\ntransfer    to     UMass-Boston    constituted   (i)   retaliation      for\n\nexercising her First Amendment right to free speech, see U.S.\n\nConst. amend. I, and (ii) a deprivation of her liberty or\n\nreputational interest, without due process of law, see id.\n\namend. XIV.       Additionally, Nethersole alleged that certain press\n\ncomments were defamatory, hence actionable under state law.\n\n            In due course, the district court dismissed all the\n\nfederal claims, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6).    Finally, the state-law defamation claim was dismissed\n\ndue   to   lack    of   supplemental   jurisdiction,   see   28    U.S.C.   §\n\n1367(c)(3), and Nethersole appealed.\n\n                                       II\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n            Nethersole contends that the amended complaint states\n\nan actionable First Amendment violation, under section 1983, in\n\nthat it alleges retaliation for her exercise of free speech,\n\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\fviz., the April 12, 1996, memorandum to James Julian. 3                  She\n\npoints to the suspicious circumstance that, within weeks of her\n\nmemorandum,     her   attorney    received     notice   that    UMass    was\n\nconsidering whether to terminate her employment \"for cause.\"\n\nShe reasons that notwithstanding the UMass attempt, some seven\n\nmonths later, to predicate its termination decision upon her\n\nalleged complicity in the November 1995 credit card fraud, the\n\ntemporal proximity alone provides a sufficient circumstantial\n\ncausal link between her exercise of free speech and the ensuing\n\ntransfer.    We agree.\n\n            We review the Rule 12(b)(6) ruling de novo, accepting\n\nall   factual   allegations      in   the   complaint   and    drawing   all\n\nreasonable inferences in Nethersole's favor.             See Alternative\n\nEnergy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 267 F.3d 30,\n\n33 (1st Cir. 2001).      The dismissal is to be affirmed \"only if,\n\nunder the facts alleged, [Nethersole] cannot recover on any\n\nviable theory.\"       Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC, 244 F.3d 193,\n\n197 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      See Kelley v. LaForce, 279 F.3d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 2002)\n(\"Section 1983 provides a cause of action for . . . money\ndamages from a defendant who acted under color of state law to\ndeprive plaintiff of a right guaranteed by the Constitution or\nby federal law.\"); Cont'l Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins.\nCo., 924 F.2d 370, 377 (1st Cir. 1991) (observing that UMass is\na \"state actor,\" hence subject to suit under § 1983).\n\n                                      7\n\f            Three inquiries must be undertaken in assessing whether\n\nthe challenged employment action contravened the First Amendment\n\nright to freedom of speech:           whether (i) the speech Nethersole\n\nengaged in can be considered that of a public employee on a\n\nmatter of public concern, or merely related to matters primarily\n\nof concern to employees (e.g., internal working conditions);\n\n(ii) Nethersole's interest in speaking, as well as the public\n\ninterest, outweigh any legitimate governmental interest in the\n\nefficient performance of its public function; and (iii) the\n\nspeech was either a motivating or substantial factor in the\n\nadverse employment action.            See Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo\n\nRodriguez, 212 F.3d 69, 78 (1st Cir. 2000); see also O'Connor v.\n\nSteeves, 994 F.2d 905, 911-13 (1st Cir. 1993).4            Unlike the first\n\ntwo criteria, which often involve issues of law amenable to\n\nresolution by the court, see Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 148\n\nn.7 (1983); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968);\n\nO’Connor,    994   F.2d   at   912;    Gorman-Bakos   v.    Cornell   Coop.\n\nExtension of Schenectady Cty., 252 F.3d 545, 557 (2d Cir. 2001),5\n\n\n     4\n     UMass does not contend that Nethersole did not adequately\nallege that her transfer was sufficiently \"adverse\" to state an\nactionable First Amendment retaliation claim.\n     5UMass argues on appeal that Nethersole’s April 1996 memo\nwas not \"protected speech,\" as a matter of law, since it\ncontained simply a routine scheduling request for a meeting with\nPresident Bulger, and although Nethersole and her caucus might\nhave engaged in protected speech at such a meeting, her memo did\n\n                                       8\n\fthe \"causation\" or \"motivation\" element normally presents a\n\nfactfinding responsibility for the jury.                See O'Connor, 994 F.2d\n\nat 913; Shands v. City of Kennett, 993 F.2d 1337, 1343 (8th Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n                The district court dismissed the amended complaint due\n\nto   its    failure      sufficiently       to   allege    that     Nethersole's\n\nopposition to the new UMass admissions policies was a motivating\n\nfactor     in    the   later   UMass   decision    to     relieve   her   of   her\n\nposition as the associate vice-president for student affairs\n\nresponsible for promoting faculty/student diversity.                      As the\n\nrationale for its Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, the district court\n\npointed to the seven-month lapse between the April memorandum\n\nNethersole transmitted to Julian and her ensuing transfer in\n\nNovember.\n\n                In section 1983 cases asserting a First Amendment\n\nclaim,      the plaintiff need only allege facts sufficient to\n\nenable a reasonable inference that the employer retaliated, at\n\n\nnot address the substance of their \"concerns.\"      We disagree.\nGiven the context of the recent changes in the UMass admissions\npolicies, as well as Nethersole’s alleged vocal opposition to\nthe changes, the reference in the April 1996 memo to the\ncaucus’s \"concerns\" with faculty/student \"diversity\" arguably\nimplied continuing opposition to the new UMass policies, thereby\npossibly implicating a matter of public concern. See supra note\n1. We need not resolve the issue here. It suffices that, at\nthe Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the facts alleged in the Nethersole\ncomplaint support a reasonable inference that she engaged in\nconstitutionally protected speech.\n\n                                        9\n\fleast in part, in response to constitutionally protected speech.\n\nOnce the plaintiff alleges — and thereafter proves — that such\n\nretaliation was \"a\" motivating factor, the burden shifts to the\n\ndefendants to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthat       the    adverse      employment         action       would     have      obtained\n\nregardless of the protected conduct engaged in by the plaintiff;\n\ne.g., here, by reason of the suspicions relating to the November\n\n1995 credit card fraud.            See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977); Beattie v. Madison\n\nCty. Sch. Dist., 254 F.3d 595, 601 (5th Cir. 2001).                                    The\n\nallegations         in   the   amended   Nethersole             complaint       meet   that\n\nminimal      pleading       standard,    entitling          Nethersole        to    conduct\n\ndiscovery regarding the section 1983 causation element.\n\n                 First, we assess the April 1996 Nethersole memo in the\n\ncontext of the events which allegedly preceded it, particularly\n\nher discussions with Vice President Deck, and Deck's explicit\n\nwarning      that    Nethersole      refrain        from       voicing    publicly     her\n\nconcerns         regarding     diversity.               Further,       Deck     questioned\n\nNethersole’s loyalty as a team player, charging that she leaked\n\ninformation         to   opponents      of        the    new    admissions         policies\n\nsupported by incoming President Bulger.6                           Thereafter, UMass\n\n\n       6\n     UMass contends on appeal that these allegations are\nirrelevant to the retaliation claim since Deck was no longer\nvice-president for academic affairs at the time Nethersole was\n\n                                             10\n\fexcluded Nethersole from all policymaking discussions relating\n\nto the new admissions policies, even though faculty/student\n\ndiversity issues constituted a prime focus of her employment.\n\n          Second, although seven months passed between the April\n\nmemo and Nethersole's transfer, at the preliminary Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nstage in the proceedings the temporal disparity does not compel\n\nthe conclusion, as a matter of law, that Nethersole’s diversity\n\nconcerns could not have played some role in the UMass decision\n\nto replace her as associate vice-president for student affairs,\n\na   position   which   specifically      entailed    responsibility    for\n\ndiversity issues.      Notwithstanding unsubstantiated accusations\n\nthat Nethersole was complicit in the computer theft, which\n\narguably would have made her unfit for              any position at the\n\nuniversity — rather than a mere job transfer — UMass transferred\n\nNethersole from a position in which she was directly involved\n\nwith diversity policy to a more peripheral position outside the\n\npresident’s    office.     Thus,   the    thematic    link   between   the\n\nsubstance of Nethersole's speech and the particular corrective\n\n\n\ntransferred, thus could not have participated in the transfer\ndecision. We disagree. Although ultimately this may prove to\nhave been a valid reason to dismiss Deck as a party defendant,\nit does not necessarily follow that discovery could not disclose\nthat Deck recorded or otherwise reported these encounters with\nNethersole to other UMass officials, and that any such reports\nlater motivated others to target Nethersole for investigation by\nthe UMass police and/or to demote her.\n\n                                   11\n\faction taken by UMass diminishes the evidentiary significance of\n\nthe seven-month time lapse, especially since UMass noted in\n\nNovember 1996 that its concerns with Nethersole had extended\n\n\"over the past months.\"            (Emphasis added.)\n\n            Further,        the     Nethersole     complaint          alleged      no\n\nuninterrupted      seven-month        retaliatory       lapse.        Rather,     it\n\nasserted that, within a matter of weeks following Nethersole's\n\nApril    1996    memo,   UMass      announced    that    it    was    considering\n\nterminating her employment. \"[C]lose temporal proximity between\n\ntwo events may give rise to an inference of causal connection.\"\n\nHodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 168 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    Although the ostensible basis for the UMass announcement\n\nrelated to the UMass police investigation into the November 1995\n\ncomputer    theft,   Nethersole’s       ongoing     opposition        to    the   new\n\nadmissions policies represents a potential intervening cause.\n\nSee Springer v. Seaman, 821 F.2d 871, 876 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(noting    that    proximate       causation     issue    in   §     1983   action,\n\nincluding       viability     of     asserted     superseding         causes      for\n\nemployment      decision,     normally       generates    jury       issue).       In\n\nreviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we may neither ignore the\n\nallegation of temporal proximity, nor presume that it is a mere\n\ncoincidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f               Finally, although UMass claims that its employment\n\naction was motivated solely by Nethersole’s conduct in relation\n\nto    the   computer     theft    investigation,         the    amended   complaint\n\nquestions UMass’s credibility in this regard.                          UMass first\n\nannounced Nethersole's termination in September 1996, due to\n\n\"credible evidence\" that she was involved in the computer theft.\n\nNevertheless, two months later, without releasing any findings\n\narrived at during her pretermination hearing, UMass implicitly\n\nacknowledged that the evidence disclosed at the termination\n\nhearing was insufficient to warrant termination, while vaguely\n\nstating that it had \"numerous concerns over the past months\n\nregarding [Nethersole’s] conduct,\" and implicitly threatening\n\nher with future termination (viz., \"the University has decided\n\nnot to terminate you at this time\") (emphasis added).\n\n               Among   the     inferences      arguably    suggested      by    these\n\nallegations are the following:              (i) UMass trumped up the credit\n\ncard fraud charges as a cover for its attempted First Amendment\n\nretaliation; (ii) its lingering \"concerns\" included Nethersole’s\n\npropensity to question the existing UMass diversity policies;\n\nand    (iii)    the    UMass    threat,   along    with        her   transfer   to   a\n\nposition       which   no    longer   involved     diversity         matters,   were\n\ndesigned to chill future protected speech by Nethersole on these\n\nmatters.

Nevertheless, a complaint need not set forth all\n\nevidentiary facts, given that discovery proceedings may yet\n\nprove fruitful.       Thus, while appellees may well decide to submit\n\na   summary    judgment     motion    following    further     proceedings     on\n\nremand, at the present stage of the proceedings, the dismissal\n\nfor failure to state a claim was inappropriate.7\n\n\n      7\n      Nethersole also appeals from the district court order\ndisallowing the claim that she was deprived of a liberty\ninterest, without due process of law, due to the UMass decision\nto transfer her to another position on account of the credit\ncard fraud charges, which she says were false.

As such, she was responsible, among other things, for promoting faculty/student diversity. During her early tenure, a UMass credit card disappeared. Subsequently it was used, without authorization, by a person whose identity remains unknown, to purchase a laptop computer. The UMass police launched an investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not long after the credit card fraud, UMass revised its admissions policies (<i>e.g.,</i> by heightening GPA requirements and eliminating special admissions programs). Although the newly appointed UMass President, William Bulger, voiced approval of the revised policies, some minority faculty members reacted with expressions of concern that minority-student recruitment and admissions would be adversely affected. Nethersole conveyed these concerns to her supervisor, Vice President Joseph Deck, who warned her not to air her opinions. Later, Deck accused Nethersole of leaking information to opponents of the new admissions policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, 1996, Nethersole invited minority faculty and staff to meet and \"discuss relevant issues and concerns and perhaps establish an action plan which will relate to our collective needs.\" The meeting took place on April 11. The following day, Nethersole transmitted an e-mail memorandum to UMass Executive Vice-President James Julian, requesting that UMass President Bulger meet with the minority faculty caucus to discuss their concerns regarding, <i>inter alia,</i> the UMass admissions and diversity policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Later in April, UMass informed Nethersole's counsel that it was considering whether to terminate Nethersole's employment \"for cause,\" ostensibly a veiled reference to her suspected involvement in the November 1995 credit card fraud and related computer theft.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on September 26, 1996, UMass Vice-President Stephen Lenhardt advised Nethersole in writing that she was to be terminated, based on \"credible evidence\" derived through an ongoing investigation by the UMass police, that she had been involved in the November 1995 credit card fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Lenhardt informed Nethersole that the charges against her were to be aired at a pretermination hearing, which was subsequently held on October 4, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1996, Lenhardt sent Nethersole another letter, advising that notwithstanding \"numerous concerns <i>over the past months</i> regarding [her] conduct,\" UMass was rescinding its termination decision \"at this time,\" and reassigning her to its UMass-Boston campus as the Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies, with no reduction in salary. (Emphasis added.) The Lenhardt letter neither mentioned nor described the findings resulting from Nethersole's pretermination hearing. Nethersole regarded the announced transfer as a demotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Nethersole instituted the present action against, <i>inter alios,</i> UMass and its Board of Trustees, as well as Bulger, Julian, and Lenhardt, claiming that her November 1996 transfer to UMass-Boston constituted (i) retaliation for exercising her First Amendment right to free speech, <i>see</i> U.S. Const. amend. I, and (ii) a deprivation of her liberty or reputational interest, without due process of law, <i>see id.</i> amend. XIV. Additionally, Nethersole alleged that certain press comments were defamatory, hence actionable under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court dismissed all the federal claims, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Finally, the state-law defamation claim was dismissed due to lack of supplemental jurisdiction, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3), and Nethersole appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nethersole contends that the amended complaint states an actionable First Amendment violation, under section 1983, in that it alleges retaliation for her exercise of free speech, viz., the April 12, 1996, memorandum to James Julian.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> She points to the suspicious circumstance that, within weeks of her memorandum, her attorney received notice that UMass was considering whether to terminate her employment \"for cause.\" She reasons that notwithstanding the UMass attempt, some seven months later, to predicate its termination decision upon her alleged complicity in the November 1995 credit card fraud, the temporal proximity alone provides a sufficient circumstantial causal link between her exercise of free speech and the ensuing transfer. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the Rule 12(b)(6) ruling <i>de novo,</i> accepting all factual allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in Nethersole's favor. <i>See Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2001). The dismissal is to be affirmed \"only if, under the facts alleged, [Nethersole] cannot recover on any viable theory.\" <i>Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC,</i> 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three inquiries must be undertaken in assessing whether the challenged employment action contravened the First Amendment right to freedom of speech: <i>whether</i> (i) the speech Nethersole engaged in can be considered that of a public employee on a matter of public concern, or merely related to matters primarily of concern to employees (<i>e.g.,</i> internal working conditions); (ii) Nethersole's interest in speaking, as well as the public interest, outweigh any legitimate governmental interest in the efficient performance of its public function; and (iii) the speech was either a motivating or substantial factor in the adverse employment action. <i>See Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 78 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also O'Connor v. Steeves,</i> 994 F.2d 905, 911-13 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Unlike the first two criteria, which often involve issues of law amenable to resolution by the court, <i>see Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 148 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <i>O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 912; <i>Gorman-Bakos v. Cornell Coop. Extension of Schenectady Cty.,</i> 252 F.3d 545, 557 (2d Cir.2001),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the \"causation\" or \"motivation\" element normally presents a factfinding responsibility for the jury. <i>See O'Connor,</i> 994 F.2d at 913; <i>Shands v. City of Kennett,</i> 993 F.2d 1337, 1343 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the amended complaint due to its failure sufficiently to allege that Nethersole's opposition to the new UMass admissions policies was <i>a</i> motivating factor in the later UMass decision to relieve her of her position as the associate vice-president for student affairs responsible for promoting faculty/student diversity. As the rationale for its Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, the district court pointed to the seven-month lapse between the April memorandum Nethersole transmitted to Julian and her ensuing transfer in November.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In section 1983 cases asserting a First Amendment claim, the plaintiff need only allege facts sufficient to enable a reasonable inference that the employer retaliated, <i>at least in part,</i> in response to constitutionally protected speech. Once the plaintiff alleges &#8212; and thereafter proves &#8212; that such retaliation was \"a\" motivating factor, the burden shifts to the defendants to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the adverse employment action would have obtained regardless of the protected conduct engaged in by the plaintiff; <i>e.g.,</i> here, by reason of the suspicions relating to the November 1995 credit card fraud. <i>See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Beattie v. Madison Cty. Sch. Dist.,</i> 254 F.3d 595, 601 (5th Cir.2001). The allegations in the amended Nethersole complaint meet that minimal pleading standard, entitling Nethersole to conduct discovery regarding the section 1983 causation element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we assess the April 1996 Nethersole memo in the context of the events which allegedly preceded it, particularly her discussions with Vice President Deck, and Deck's explicit warning that Nethersole refrain from voicing publicly her concerns regarding diversity. Further, Deck questioned Nethersole's loyalty as a team player, charging that she leaked information to opponents of the new admissions policies supported by incoming President Bulger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thereafter, UMass excluded Nethersole from all policymaking discussions relating to the new admissions policies, even though faculty/student diversity issues constituted a prime focus of her employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although seven months passed between the April memo and Nethersole's transfer, at the preliminary Rule 12(b)(6) stage in the proceedings the temporal disparity does not <i>compel</i> the conclusion, as a matter of law, that Nethersole's diversity concerns could not have played <i>some role</i> in the UMass decision to replace her as associate vice-president for student affairs, a position which specifically entailed responsibility for diversity issues. Notwithstanding unsubstantiated accusations that Nethersole was complicit in the computer theft, which arguably would have made her unfit for <i>any</i> position at the university &#8212; rather than a mere job transfer&#8212;UMass transferred Nethersole from a position in which she was directly involved with <i>diversity policy</i> to a more peripheral position outside the president's office. Thus, the thematic link between the substance of Nethersole's speech and the particular corrective action taken by UMass diminishes the evidentiary significance of the seven-month time lapse, especially since UMass noted in November 1996 that its concerns with Nethersole had extended <i>\"over the past months.\"</i> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Nethersole complaint alleged no uninterrupted seven-month retaliatory lapse. Rather, it asserted that, within a matter of <i>weeks</i> following Nethersole's April 1996 memo, UMass announced that it was considering terminating her employment. \"[C]lose temporal proximity between two events may give rise to an inference of causal connection.\" <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 168 (1st Cir.1998). Although the ostensible basis for the UMass announcement related to the UMass police investigation into the November 1995 computer theft, Nethersole's ongoing opposition to the new admissions policies represents a potential intervening cause. <i>See Springer v. Seaman,</i> 821 F.2d 871, 876 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that proximate causation issue in &#167; 1983 action, including viability of asserted superseding causes for employment decision, normally generates jury issue). In reviewing a <i>Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,</i> we may neither ignore the allegation of temporal proximity, nor presume that it is a mere coincidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although UMass claims that its employment action was motivated solely by Nethersole's conduct in relation to the computer theft investigation, the amended complaint questions UMass's credibility in this regard. UMass first announced Nethersole's termination in September 1996, due to \"credible evidence\" that she was involved in the computer theft. Nevertheless, two months later, without releasing any findings arrived at during her pretermination hearing, UMass implicitly acknowledged that the evidence disclosed at the termination hearing was insufficient to warrant termination, while vaguely stating that it had \"numerous concerns <i>over the past months</i> regarding [Nethersole's] conduct,\" and implicitly threatening her with future termination (<i>viz.,</i> \"the University has decided not to terminate you <i>at this time</i>\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the inferences arguably suggested by these allegations are the following: (i) UMass trumped up the credit card fraud charges as a cover for its attempted First Amendment retaliation; (ii) its lingering \"concerns\" included Nethersole's propensity to question the existing UMass diversity policies; and (iii) the UMass threat, along with her transfer to a position which no longer involved diversity matters, were designed to chill future protected speech by Nethersole on these matters. Absent an opportunity to conduct appropriate discovery, however, the paper trail UMass created in documenting the UMass police investigation, as well as its pretermination decisionmaking process, remain within the control of UMass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the facts alleged in the complaint, we understand the district court's inclination to believe that the strength of Nethersole's First Amendment claim is open to considerable doubt, especially as concerns the causation element. Nevertheless, a complaint need not set forth all evidentiary facts, given that discovery proceedings may yet prove fruitful. Thus, while appellees may well decide to submit a summary judgment motion following further proceedings on remand, at the present stage of the proceedings, the dismissal for failure to state a claim was inappropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The district court order dismissing the First Amendment claim in the amended complaint, and dismissing the state-law claims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction, is hereby vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings on all such claims, consistent with this opinion.

Given the context of the recent changes in the UMass admissions policies, as well as Nethersole's alleged vocal opposition to the changes, the reference in the April 1996 memo to the caucus's \"concerns\" with faculty/student \"diversity\" arguably implied continuing opposition to the new UMass policies, thereby possibly implicating a matter of public concern<i>See supra</i> note 1. We need not resolve the issue here.

We disagree. Although ultimately this may prove to have been a valid reason to dismiss Deck as a party defendant, it does not necessarily follow that discovery could not disclose that Deck recorded or otherwise reported these encounters with Nethersole to other UMass officials, and that any such reports later motivated others to target Nethersole for investigation by the UMass police and/or to demote her</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Nethersole also appeals from the district court order disallowing the claim that she was deprived of a liberty interest, without due process of law, due to the UMass decision to transfer her to another position on account of the credit card fraud charges, which she says were false.

As such, she was responsible, among other things, for promoting faculty/student diversity. During her early tenure, a UMass credit card disappeared. Subsequently it was used, without authorization, by a person whose identity remains unknown, to purchase a laptop computer. The UMass police launched an investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not long after the credit card fraud, UMass revised its admissions policies (<i>e.g.,</i> by heightening GPA requirements and eliminating special admissions programs). Although the newly appointed UMass President, William Bulger, voiced approval of the revised policies, some minority faculty members reacted with expressions of concern that minority-student recruitment and admissions would be adversely affected. Nethersole conveyed these concerns to her supervisor, Vice President Joseph Deck, who warned her not to air her opinions. Later, Deck accused Nethersole of leaking information to opponents of the new admissions policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, 1996, Nethersole invited minority faculty and staff to meet and \"discuss relevant issues and concerns and perhaps establish an action plan which will relate to our collective needs.\" The meeting took place on April 11. The following day, Nethersole transmitted an e-mail memorandum to UMass Executive Vice-President James Julian, requesting that UMass President Bulger meet with the minority faculty caucus to discuss their concerns regarding, <i>inter alia,</i> the UMass admissions and diversity policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Later in April, UMass informed Nethersole's counsel that it was considering whether to terminate Nethersole's employment \"for cause,\" ostensibly a veiled reference to her suspected involvement in the November 1995 credit card fraud and related computer theft.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on September 26, 1996, UMass Vice-President Stephen Lenhardt advised Nethersole in writing that she was to be terminated, based on \"credible evidence\" derived through an ongoing investigation by the UMass police, that she had been involved in the November 1995 credit card fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Lenhardt informed Nethersole that the charges against her were to be aired at a pretermination hearing, which was subsequently held on October 4, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1996, Lenhardt sent Nethersole another letter, advising that notwithstanding \"numerous concerns <i>over the past months</i> regarding [her] conduct,\" UMass was rescinding its termination decision \"at this time,\" and reassigning her to its UMass-Boston campus as the Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies, with no reduction in salary. (Emphasis added.) The Lenhardt letter neither mentioned nor described the findings resulting from Nethersole's pretermination hearing. Nethersole regarded the announced transfer as a demotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Nethersole instituted the present action against, <i>inter alios,</i> UMass and its Board of Trustees, as well as Bulger, Julian, and Lenhardt, claiming that her November 1996 transfer to UMass-Boston constituted (i) retaliation for exercising her First Amendment right to free speech, <i>see</i> U.S. Const. amend. I, and (ii) a deprivation of her liberty or reputational interest, without due process of law, <i>see id.</i> amend. XIV. Additionally, Nethersole alleged that certain press comments were defamatory, hence actionable under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court dismissed all the federal claims, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Finally, the state-law defamation claim was dismissed due to lack of supplemental jurisdiction, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3), and Nethersole appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nethersole contends that the amended complaint states an actionable First Amendment violation, under section 1983, in that it alleges retaliation for her exercise of free speech, viz., the April 12, 1996, memorandum to James Julian.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> She points to the suspicious circumstance that, within weeks of her memorandum, her attorney received notice that UMass was considering whether to terminate her employment \"for cause.\" She reasons that notwithstanding the UMass attempt, some seven months later, to predicate its termination decision upon her alleged complicity in the November 1995 credit card fraud, the temporal proximity alone provides a sufficient circumstantial causal link between her exercise of free speech and the ensuing transfer.

As the rationale for its Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, the district court pointed to the seven-month lapse between the April memorandum Nethersole transmitted to Julian and her ensuing transfer in November.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In section 1983 cases asserting a First Amendment claim, the plaintiff need only allege facts sufficient to enable a reasonable inference that the employer retaliated, <i>at least in part,</i> in response to constitutionally protected speech. Once the plaintiff alleges &#8212; and thereafter proves &#8212; that such retaliation was \"a\" motivating factor, the burden shifts to the defendants to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the adverse employment action would have obtained regardless of the protected conduct engaged in by the plaintiff; <i>e.g.,</i> here, by reason of the suspicions relating to the November 1995 credit card fraud. <i>See Mt.

The allegations in the amended Nethersole complaint meet that minimal pleading standard, entitling Nethersole to conduct discovery regarding the section 1983 causation element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we assess the April 1996 Nethersole memo in the context of the events which allegedly preceded it, particularly her discussions with Vice President Deck, and Deck's explicit warning that Nethersole refrain from voicing publicly her concerns regarding diversity. Further, Deck questioned Nethersole's loyalty as a team player, charging that she leaked information to opponents of the new admissions policies supported by incoming President Bulger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thereafter, UMass excluded Nethersole from all policymaking discussions relating to the new admissions policies, even though faculty/student diversity issues constituted a prime focus of her employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although seven months passed between the April memo and Nethersole's transfer, at the preliminary Rule 12(b)(6) stage in the proceedings the temporal disparity does not <i>compel</i> the conclusion, as a matter of law, that Nethersole's diversity concerns could not have played <i>some role</i> in the UMass decision to replace her as associate vice-president for student affairs, a position which specifically entailed responsibility for diversity issues. Notwithstanding unsubstantiated accusations that Nethersole was complicit in the computer theft, which arguably would have made her unfit for <i>any</i> position at the university &#8212; rather than a mere job transfer&#8212;UMass transferred Nethersole from a position in which she was directly involved with <i>diversity policy</i> to a more peripheral position outside the president's office. Thus, the thematic link between the substance of Nethersole's speech and the particular corrective action taken by UMass diminishes the evidentiary significance of the seven-month time lapse, especially since UMass noted in November 1996 that its concerns with Nethersole had extended <i>\"over the past months.\"</i> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Nethersole complaint alleged no uninterrupted seven-month retaliatory lapse. Rather, it asserted that, within a matter of <i>weeks</i> following Nethersole's April 1996 memo, UMass announced that it was considering terminating her employment. \"[C]lose temporal proximity between two events may give rise to an inference of causal connection.\" <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197958\"><a href=\"/opinion/197958/hodgens-v-general-dynamics-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 168 (1st Cir.1998). Although the ostensible basis for the UMass announcement related to the UMass police investigation into the November 1995 computer theft, Nethersole's ongoing opposition to the new admissions policies represents a potential intervening cause. <i>See Springer v. Seaman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490117\"><a href=\"/opinion/490117/beresford-n-springer-v-gretchen-seaman/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span>, 876 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that proximate causation issue in &#167; 1983 action, including viability of asserted superseding causes for employment decision, normally generates jury issue). In reviewing a <i>Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,</i> we may neither ignore the allegation of temporal proximity, nor presume that it is a mere coincidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although UMass claims that its employment action was motivated solely by Nethersole's conduct in relation to the computer theft investigation, the amended complaint questions UMass's credibility in this regard. UMass first announced Nethersole's termination in September 1996, due to \"credible evidence\" that she was involved in the computer theft. Nevertheless, two months later, without releasing any findings arrived at during her pretermination hearing, UMass implicitly acknowledged that the evidence disclosed at the termination hearing was insufficient to warrant termination, while vaguely stating that it had \"numerous concerns <i>over the past months</i> regarding [Nethersole's] conduct,\" and implicitly threatening her with future termination (<i>viz.,</i> \"the University has decided not to terminate you <i>at this time</i>\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the inferences arguably suggested by these allegations are the following: (i) UMass trumped up the credit card fraud charges as a cover for its attempted First Amendment retaliation; (ii) its lingering \"concerns\" included Nethersole's propensity to question the existing UMass diversity policies; and (iii) the UMass threat, along with her transfer to a position which no longer involved diversity matters, were designed to chill future protected speech by Nethersole on these matters. Absent an opportunity to conduct appropriate discovery, however, the paper trail UMass created in documenting the UMass police investigation, as well as its pretermination decisionmaking process, remain within the control of UMass.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the facts alleged in the complaint, we understand the district court's inclination to believe that the strength of Nethersole's First Amendment claim is open to considerable doubt, especially as concerns the causation element. Nevertheless, a complaint need not set forth all evidentiary facts, given that discovery proceedings may yet prove fruitful. Thus, while appellees may well decide to submit a summary judgment motion following further proceedings on remand, at the present stage of the proceedings, the dismissal for failure to state a claim was inappropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The district court order dismissing the First Amendment claim in the amended complaint, and dismissing the state-law claims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction, is hereby vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings on all such claims, consistent with this opinion.

Given the context of the recent changes in the UMass admissions policies, as well as Nethersole's alleged vocal opposition to the changes, the reference in the April 1996 memo to the caucus's \"concerns\" with faculty/student \"diversity\" arguably implied continuing opposition to the new UMass policies, thereby possibly implicating a matter of public concern<i>See supra</i> note 1.
