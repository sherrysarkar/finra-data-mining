After a  ten day trial, a jury  convicted the\r\n\ndefendants of maliciously destroying  by fire a building used\r\n\nin interstate  commerce (18 U.S.C.   844(i)),  mail fraud (18\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341), conspiracy  to commit the foregoing  offenses\r\n\n(18 U.S.C.   371), and use of fire to commit a federal felony\r\n\n(18 U.S.C.   844(h)(1)).

See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

Like the district court, we\r                  \r\n\n\"must  resolve  all  evidentiary  conflicts  and  credibility\r\n\nquestions  in the prosecution's  favor,\" and, among competing\r\n\nplausible inferences, we \"must choose the inference that best\r\n\nfits  the prosecution's  theory of  guilt.\"   Id.   With this\r                                                             \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nstandard  of review  in  mind, we  turn to  the facts  of the\r\n\ncase.1\r\n\nA.  Facts\r                     \r\n\n          1.  Pre-Fire Events\r                                         \r\n\n           In February  1990, defendant  Santo Ruiz opened  a\r\n\nretail business named Brothers Fashions and Multiple Services\r\n\n(\"Brothers Fashions\"), in the  basement area of a three-story\r\n\nresidential  duplex.    Three  of  Santo's  brothers,  Pablo,\r\n\nFrederico,   and  co-defendant   Virgilio  Ruiz,   shared  an\r\n\napartment directly above the store.  The duplex comprised six\r\n\nresidential   apartments  occupied  by  a  total  of  sixteen\r\n\nresidents, including the building's owner.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  At the  end of the government's case,  Santo and Virgilio\r\nRuiz  moved for  judgment of  acquittal, pursuant to  Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P.  29.  Because  the defendants presented  evidence in\r\ntheir defense after  the denial of  the initial motion,  they\r\nare deemed to have waived review of  the earlier motion.  See\r                                                                         \r\nUnited States v. de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d 986, 997-98 (1st\r                                               \r\nCir. 1995); United States  v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288,  291 (1st\r                                                \r\nCir. 1992).   Thus, in reviewing  the defendants' sufficiency\r\nof  the evidence challenge,  we consider,  in the  light most\r\nfavorable  to  the verdict,  the  evidence  presented in  the\r\ndefense  case.  See 2 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice and\r                                                                         \r\nProcedure   463, at 643-45 (1982).\r                     \r\n          We note also that although  defendants' motions for\r\nacquittal and new trial were filed more than seven days after\r\nthe  verdicts  were rendered  and  the  jury discharged,  the\r\nmotions were  timely because,  within that  seven-day period,\r\nthe district court extended the time allowable for making the\r\nmotions.   See Fed. R. Evid. 29(c) &amp; 33; see also Carlisle v.\r                                                                      \r\nUnited States, 116 S. Ct. 1460, 1463-64 (1996) (holding that,\r                         \r\nabsent  proper  time  extension,  a district  court  may  not\r\nentertain an untimely Rule 29 motion).  Thus, we consider the\r\nmotions timely  and properly  preserved for our  full review.\r\nSee  id. at  1471  (explaining that  a sufficiency  challenge\r                    \r\nuntimely  brought in  the trial  court  is subject  to \"plain\r\nerror\" review) (Ginsburg, J., concurring).\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Santo  borrowed  $10,000   from  another   brother,\r\n\nWilliam  Ruiz,  as  the   start-up  capital  for  the  store;\r\n\nadditionally, Santo incurred  a debt of $4000  to William for\r\n\nthe store's  fixtures.2  The $14,000 debt  remained unpaid in\r\n\nits entirety through the time of the fire.\r\n\n          The  store sold  sundry items,  including clothing,\r\n\nshoes,  blankets, cosmetics, household products, music albums\r\n\nand  cassettes,  beverages and  candy.    Santo obtained  the\r\n\nstore's  merchandise  for  cash  from a  variety  of  sources\r\n\nlocated in  Massachusetts, New Hampshire,  New York, Florida,\r\n\nand California.\r\n\n          Virgilio  Ruiz spent  much  time at  the store  and\r\n\nfrequently assisted  Santo, who  did not speak  English, with\r\n\nneeded  language  interpretation.   Although  Santo  was  the\r\n\nputative owner of  Brothers Fashions,  the evidence  suggests\r\n\nthat  Santo  and  Virgilio  represented  to  others  a  joint\r\n\nownership  and responsibility  for the  store.   For example,\r\n\nboth Santo and  Virgilio signed  the lease for  the space  as\r\n\nwell  as  the business  certificate  filed with  the  City of\r\n\nBoston.\r\n\n          In  early   September  1990,  Santo   and  Virgilio\r\n\nnegotiated for the installation of a store security alarm and\r\n\njointly  signed  the  agreement  with  the  alarm  monitoring\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  William had operated a convenience market in the basement\r\nspace before the opening of Brothers Fashions. \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nservice.   The alarm, which could detect heat and motion, was\r\n\ndesigned  primarily to  trigger  when a  burglar entered  the\r\n\npremises after hours; a sufficient  amount of smoke from fire\r\n\ncould also trigger a response.  The alarm, however, would not\r\n\noperate  unless   the  subscriber  activated  the  system  by\r\n\nentering  the proper pass code.   About two  weeks before the\r\n\nfire, Santo ceased activating the alarm system.\r\n\n          In  early November 1990,  approximately nine months\r\n\nafter Brothers Fashions opened and about six weeks before the\r\n\nfire,  Santo   and  Virgilio  obtained   $40,000's  worth  of\r\n\ninsurance  coverage  for   the  store's  contents.     During\r\n\ndiscussions   with  the   insurance  agent,   the  defendants\r\n\nspecifically asked  about the processing and  payment of loss\r\n\nclaims.   Although such information  was not a  usual part of\r\n\nthe agent's initial discussions about  insurance coverage, in\r\n\nresponse  to this  inquiry,  he explained  that receipts  and\r\n\ncancelled  checks   would  be  required  to   prove  a  loss.\r\n\nVirgilio, representing Brothers Fashions, signed an insurance\r\n\nfinance agreement.   Coverage  began shortly thereafter  when\r\n\nthe brothers  tendered a down payment  of approximately $750.\r\n\nThe  payment schedule  provided that  a first  installment of\r\n\napproximately $250 would fall due on December 20, 1990.\r\n\n          Santo kept in  his possession most of  the time the\r\n\nonly  set of keys to  Brothers Fashions.   Before closing the\r\n\nbusiness each  day, Santo  would secure the  store-front with\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthree heavy  metal security shutters, each  fastened with two\r\n\npadlocks.   The store's  back door, which  was rarely opened,\r\n\nmeasured  three-feet  wide by  four-feet  tall  and could  be\r\n\nopened only from the inside of the store.  It  was secured on\r\n\nthe inside with a sliding lock and at least one wooden cross-\r\n\nbar laid across the  door.  An outer iron grate,  locked from\r\n\nthe inside with a padlock, further secured the back door.\r\n\n          Less  than  two  days  before  the  fire,  Brothers\r\n\nFashions was  fully  stocked with  merchandise  displayed  on\r\n\nclothing racks, shelves, and in display cases.\r\n\n          2.  The Fire\r                                  \r\n\n          Around 2:00  a.m. on  Sunday, December 16,  1990, a\r\n\nfire raged through Brothers Fashions.  The close proximity of\r\n\nthe  store  to a  fire  station  resulted in  near  immediate\r\n\nresponse.    Nonetheless, the  blaze  was  serious enough  to\r\n\nwarrant   the  services  of   some  seventy  fire  department\r\n\npersonnel and over one dozen fire vehicles.\r\n\n          Arriving  at  the scene,  fire-fighters encountered\r\n\nthe metal security shutters  lying in the street in  front of\r\n\nthe store;  the shutters  apparently had been  blown off  the\r\n\nstore-front by a  powerful explosion.  A  fire-fighter in the\r\n\nfirst group to  reach the  back of the  building noticed  the\r\n\nstore's back door standing open with flames shooting out from\r\n\nthe  basement.    The  fire-fighters  extinguished  the  fire\r\n\nwithout forcible entry of the property.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Normally, when a store stocked with clothing burns,\r\n\npiles  of clothing in various  stages of ruin  remain.  After\r\n\nthe  fire at  Brothers  Fashions was  suppressed, however,  a\r\n\ncasual inspection  of the damaged store  revealed very little\r\n\nburned or  charred merchandise; rather, all  that was visible\r\n\nwere a  few beverage bottles,  some canned goods  and minimal\r\n\ncharred foodstuffs.   The  dearth of charred  merchandise and\r\n\nthe complete absence of clothing remnants in the store evince\r\n\nthat it was nearly empty when it burned.\r\n\n          All  of the  apartment  tenants,  except  Virgilio,\r\n\nescaped  unharmed from  the burning  building.   None  of the\r\n\ntenants, including Virgilio, required fire-fighter assistance\r\n\nto evacuate.  Virgilio suffered second and third degree burns\r\n\non his  ankles, a severe  cut above  his left eye,  and large\r\n\nbruises  below his  left  eye  and  across  his  chest.    An\r\n\nambulance  carried him from the  scene to the hospital, where\r\n\nhe remained for eighteen days.\r\n\n          3.  Post-Fire Events\r                                          \r\n\n          Subsequent  investigation  revealed  that the  fire\r\n\noriginated  in two  distinct locations  within the  store and\r\n\nburned in an unusual manner.   Specifically, the burn pattern\r\n\nindicated  that an  accelerant,  such as  gasoline, had  been\r\n\npoured  over  a counter  and  other  areas.   The  building's\r\n\nelectrical  and natural  gas  distribution systems  showed no\r\n\nsign  of having caused or contributed to the fire.  Following\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthe fire, Boston  Gas Company, the  natural gas provider  for\r\n\nthe building,  conducted  a search  of  its records  for  the\r\n\nperiod from 1984 through the time of the fire for any reports\r\n\nof gas leak  repairs at  the building.   The search  revealed\r\n\nnothing.\r\n\n          Sometime within the first two weeks after the fire,\r\n\nJohn  Greenaway, who had been hired for carpentry work on the\r\n\npremises, opened up the boarded-up store so  that Santo could\r\n\nretrieve an empty clothes  rack.  In January 1991,  Santo and\r\n\nVirgilio prepared,  jointly signed  and submitted a  claim to\r\n\ntheir insurer --  via certified mail -- asserting  a contents\r\n\nloss  of some $48,000.   The claim detailed  various items of\r\n\nstore   merchandise  and  fixtures,  including  thousands  of\r\n\ndollars'  worth  of  men's and  women's  clothing,  curtains,\r\n\nshoes, blankets, music albums and cassettes, videos, watches,\r\n\ncandy, household items and toys.\r\n\n          Contrary  to the  insurance agent's  earlier advice\r\n\nand the  insurance company's request, the  defendants did not\r\n\nsubmit any  receipts, invoices,  or other records  to support\r\n\ntheir  claim of loss.   Instead, the  defendants claimed that\r\n\nthe fire destroyed all such records and submitted a couple of\r\n\nphotographs purporting to represent the  store merchandise at\r\n\nthe  time of the fire  and a cancelled  check from Virgilio's\r\n\nbank account  for approximately $15  in cigarette tax.   When\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nasked by the  insurance company, Santo  could not recall  the\r\n\nnames of any of his retail merchandise suppliers.\r\n\n          At various times before trial, Virgilio related his\r\n\nversion of the  fire events  to  his  attending physician,  a\r\n\nBoston  Fire  Department  investigator,   and,  in  a   sworn\r\n\ndeposition,  representatives of  the insurance  company.   He\r\n\nprofessed  a general  inability  to recall  clearly and  gave\r\n\nsomewhat  inconsistent accounts of  the fire events.   To the\r\n\nextent  Virgilio's  various  stories overlap,  they  indicate\r\n\nthat: he awoke in  the first floor apartment to  the smell of\r\n\nsmoke, went  to the living room  to check the gas  heater and\r\n\nsaw  smoke  coming  through  the  floor;  he  then  heard  an\r\n\nexplosion and ran to awaken his sleeping brothers (Pablo  and\r\n\nFrederico)  to  warn  them of  the  fire;  he  picked up  the\r\n\ntelephone to call the fire department, but the line was dead;\r\n\nhe proceeded to run out the  front hallway of the duplex  and\r\n\ndown  the stairs toward the building's front exit; on his way\r\n\nout to the sidewalk in front of the duplex, another explosion\r\n\noccurred and his  \"fuzzy\" socks caught  on fire, causing  the\r\n\ninjuries to  his ankles; at some point, he ran into a door --\r\n\nperhaps the front door  of the apartment unit --  causing his\r\n\nbruises and the severe cut above his eye.\r\n\n          4.  The Defendants' Case\r                                              \r\n\n          The defendants  presented a joint  defense, calling\r\n\nto the stand  members of the  Ruiz family: Pablo,  Frederico,\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nSanto,  and  Rosa  (Santo's   wife).    Pablo  and  Frederico\r\n\ntestified  that, on the night  of the fire,  Virgilio went to\r\n\nbed around midnight, and they  retired soon thereafter.  They\r\n\nstated  that Virgilio later woke them up because of the fire.\r\n\nFrederico  testified  that  he   then  dressed  quickly   and\r\n\nproceeded  out the  front door.   As  he descended  the front\r\n\nstairs,  he met Virgilio, who  was bleeding from his forehead\r\n\nand down his face.   Frederico and Virgilio ran out the front\r\n\nof  the building together.   Frederico was not  injured -- by\r\n\nflame  or otherwise  --  as he  exited.   Upon  reaching  the\r\n\nsidewalk in front of the building, he noticed fire coming out\r\n\nof the basement store.  Frederico said that he  then told the\r\n\nfire-fighters that Pablo was still inside the building.\r\n\n          Pablo testified that his only avenue of escape from\r\n\nthe  burning building  was  the apartment's  back  door.   He\r\n\nstated  that when  he exited  the building,  he  observed two\r\n\nfire-fighters, who, he says, had been attempting  to pry open\r\n\nthe  apartment's back door  to let him  out.  Both  Pablo and\r\n\nFrederico testified  that they  saw fire-fighters force  open\r\n\nthe  store's back door, which, they claimed, had been closed.\r\n\nThey  further claimed that, upon the opening of the back door\r\n\n-- which measured  four-feet by  three-feet --  fire-fighters\r\n\nemerged from  within  the store  wearing  full  fire-fighting\r\n\nregalia, including oxygen tanks and masks.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          Santo testified in his  defense.  He explained that\r\n\nhe  initially did  not insure  the  contents of  the Brothers\r\n\nFashions  because he  wanted first  to see  how the  business\r\n\nfared.   He testified that only he  knew the alarm pass code,\r\n\nand  that he failed to  activate the alarm  for several weeks\r\n\nbefore the  fire because of  the recurrence of  false alarms.\r\n\nHe had deduced that  rats entering the store after  hours (to\r\n\neat candy) triggered the  alarm, and he wanted to  \"kill\" the\r\n\nrodents before further engaging the alarm.  He testified that\r\n\nhe  complained  about  the rats  to  both  the  owner and  to\r\n\nGreenaway,  who,  in turn,  testified  that  Santo had  never\r\n\ncomplained to him about a rat problem.\r\n\n          Santo suggested  that a  natural gas  explosion may\r\n\nhave contributed to the fire.   Specifically, he claimed that\r\n\nabout one month before the fire, he called Boston Gas because\r\n\nhe smelled  a  natural  gas leak;  contrary  to  other  trial\r\n\ntestimony, he claimed that Boston Gas personnel then came out\r\n\nto the store  and fixed  the leak.   Santo further  testified\r\n\nthat  there  may have  been paint  and  paint thinner  in the\r\n\nstore, as well as household detergents, that might have acted\r\n\nas  an  accelerant for  the fire  and  would account  for the\r\n\npeculiar burn patterns.\r\n\n          Santo testified that on  December 15, 1990, the day\r\n\nbefore the fire, the store was fully stocked.  That night, he\r\n\nexplained, he had closed the store between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\np.m. and secured  the front  entrance.  He  insisted that  he\r\n\nleft the  back door fully secured and that he retained in his\r\n\npossession the only  set of store keys.  He  then went to his\r\n\nhome in Dorchester.   The next morning, around 6:00  a.m., he\r\n\nreceived a call at home informing him of the fire.  He walked\r\n\nto  the store (his car was  not operational), arriving around\r\n\n8:00 a.m..\r\n\n          Santo further testified  that, upon his arrival  at\r\n\nthe  fire scene, he  saw ten to fifteen  people in and around\r\n\nthe  burned  store, including  people  from  Boston Gas,  and\r\n\nGreenaway's  son.   He said  the  people were  removing half-\r\n\nburned items  from the store.   He admitted at  trial that he\r\n\nhad never previously mentioned his observance of the looters,\r\n\neven to the insurance company.  He also testified that he did\r\n\nnot attempt to stop the looting because the merchandise taken\r\n\nwas, in any event, ruined.\r\n\n          Santo admitted  that, although he did  not speak or\r\n\nunderstand  English   and  had   to  rely  on   Virgilio  for\r\n\ntranslation, he  fully understood his actions  when he signed\r\n\nthe lease to  the store, the business certificate,  the alarm\r\n\nsystem contract, and the insurance  claim for $48,000 in lost\r\n\ninventory.    Santo  denied  removing, or  asking  anyone  to\r\n\nremove, the  merchandise  from Brothers  Fashions before  the\r\n\nfire.  He also denied  lighting the fire or asking  anyone to\r\n\nlight the fire.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          The defendants painted  a picture  of a  prosperous\r\n\nstore that earned some $600 to $1000 in retail sales per day,\r\n\nsuggesting  the  absence of  a  motive  to collect  insurance\r\n\nproceeds.   The  defendants also  attempted to  establish the\r\n\nbias of various trial witnesses.   For example, they produced\r\n\n(contradicted)  evidence of  the  unlawful  absence of  smoke\r\n\ndetectors in the  duplex, suggesting that  the owner had  her\r\n\nown  motive to  collect insurance  proceeds.   The defendants\r\n\nalso  suggested  that  the  carpenter  Greenaway  was  biased\r\n\nbecause  he had married the  owner's niece in  1990 and, upon\r\n\nthe owner's  death, the  owner's niece stood  to inherit  the\r\n\nbuilding.\r\n\nB.

Although   circumstantial  evidence  requires  an\r\n\ninferential   step  in   its  proof,   there  is   \"no  legal\r\n\ndistinction\"  between circumstantial  and direct  evidence in\r\n\nthe context of a Rule 29 motion.

The\r\n\njury thus could rationally infer that, because only Santo had\r\n\nthe means to  access the  store that evening,  he opened  the\r\n\nback  door from the inside  of the store  sometime before the\r\n\nfire.   Santo's exclusive access also  permits the conclusion\r\n\nthat  he  was  involved  with  the  removal  of  the  store's\r\n\nmerchandise before the fire.   The jury could infer  that his\r\n\nnew   and  uncorroborated  testimony   about  looters  was  a\r\n\nfabrication  to  account  for   the  lost  merchandise  --  a\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nfabrication  intended  to  cover  up  his  knowledge  of  and\r\n\ninvolvement in its removal.\r\n\n          The  jury could  conclude that  Santo lied  when he\r\n\ntestified  that he discontinued activating the security alarm\r\n\nshortly  before the fire because of rats.  From this untruth,\r\n\nthe  jury could  infer  that Santo's  unexpressed reason  for\r\n\nfailing to engage  the alarm  was to nullify  its ability  to\r\n\ndetect both the  removal of  merchandise and the  fire.   The\r\n\njury could further find  that Santo lied when he  stated that\r\n\nhe left  the store's back  door secured on  the night of  the\r\n\nfire and that, in fact,  he left it open for Virgilio  to set\r\n\nthe fire.\r\n\n          A  jury  could   rationally  infer  that   Virgilio\r\n\npersonally set fire to Brothers Fashions.  Virgilio, the only\r\n\napartment tenant injured by the fire, had severe burns on his\r\n\nankles, consistent  with  direct and  prolonged  exposure  to\r\n\nflame;  yet Frederico, who  exited the  building in  the same\r\n\nmanner and  through the  same area  as  claimed by  Virgilio,\r\n\ntestified  that he was not injured in  any manner and that he\r\n\ndid not encounter any  fire until he reached the  sidewalk in\r\n\nfront of  the building,  where he  viewed the  fire emanating\r\n\nfrom the  store.  The  jury could  also choose not  to credit\r\n\nVirgilio's unembellished and confused account of the cause of\r\n\nthe injuries to his face and body and infer that, in fact, he\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nsuffered those  injuries escaping the store  (perhaps out the\r\n\nsmall back door) after lighting the fire.\r\n\n          The jury  could further  find that Santo  lied when\r\n\ntestifying that: (1) he had nothing to do with the removal of\r\n\nthe store's  contents, (2) he  observed looters at  the store\r\n\nthe morning after the fire, and (3) Boston Gas repaired a gas\r\n\nleak at the store one month before the fire.   The jury could\r\n\nalso conclude  that  Virgilio lied  about the  source of  his\r\n\ninjuries.   Lies such as these legitimately support a finding\r\n\nof guilt.  See  United States v. Hadfield, 918  F.2d 987, 999\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)  (finding inference of guilt could  have been\r\n\nbolstered  by defendant's  \"tall  tale\");  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nJimenez-Perez,  869 F.2d  9, 11  (1st Cir.  1989) (explaining\r                         \r\n\nthat  the  jury's  disbelief   of  defendants'  story  allows\r\n\nlegitimate inference  \"that the fabrication was  all the more\r\n\nproof of their guilt\").\r\n\n          As  to  motive,  although  the  government  did not\r\n\nproduce   evidence  that  Brothers  Fashions  was  a  failing\r\n\nbusiness,3  the defendants  clearly  stood to  gain from  the\r\n\ninsurance  proceeds.  Moreover, the jury could have given due\r\n\nweight to the fact that the defendants did not have insurance\r\n\nfor the first nine months of the store's operation,  obtained\r\n\nit  only six weeks before  the fire, and  expressed  peculiar\r\n\nconcern about claim payments  and proof of loss requirements.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

Laboy, 909  F.2d 581, 588  (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                   \r\n\nThe jury  was \"free to choose  among reasonable constructions\r\n\nof evidence,\"  id.,  and  the trial  evidence,  as  a  whole,\r                              \r\n\npermits a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nid.  We  cannot say that the jury's verdict  on the arson and\r               \r\n\nconspiracy counts was irrational.\r\n\nC.  Mail Fraud\r                          \r\n\n          Little discussion  of this count is  necessary.  To\r\n\nprove  mail fraud,  the government  must establish:  \"(1) the\r\n\ndefendant's knowing and willing  participation in a scheme or\r\n\nartifice to defraud with the specific intent to  defraud, and\r\n\n(2) the use of the mails . . . in furtherance of the scheme.\"\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nSawyer,  85  F.3d  at 723.    There  was  more than  adequate\r                  \r\n\nevidence  to  prove  that  Santo  and Virgilio  intentionally\r\n\nagreed  to  collect   insurance  proceeds  fraudulently,  and\r\n\ntogether  submitted, by  mail,  a false  insurance claim  for\r\n\nmerchandise they knew had not been lost in the fire.  We will\r\n\nnot disturb the jury's verdict on this count.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                     Motion for New Trial\r                                 Motion for New Trial\r                                                     \r\n\n          The defendants alternatively challenge the district\r\n\ncourt's denial of their new trial  motions, claiming that, on\r\n\nthe weight  of the evidence, their  convictions constituted a\r\n\nmiscarriage  of justice.  A district court's power to order a\r\n\nnew  trial is  greater than its  power to grant  a motion for\r\n\nacquittal.   See United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d 318, 318\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1986).   In  considering a  new trial  motion, the\r\n\ncourt  may consider both the  weight of the  evidence and the\r\n\ncredibility of witnesses.  See id. at 321.  Where a new trial\r                                              \r\n\nmotion  is based upon the  weight of the  evidence, the court\r\n\nmay not order a new trial \"unless it is quite  clear that the\r\n\njury has reached a  seriously erroneous result.\"  See  id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n322  (internal quotation  marks and  citations omitted).   We\r\n\nreview  the district court's ruling on a new trial motion for\r\n\nabuse of discretion.  See id. \r                                         \r\n\n          True,  the trial  evidence  was in  conflict.   The\r\n\njury, however, was not compelled to credit Virgilio's account\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nof  the  manner  in  which  he  was  injured,  or  Pablo  and\r\n\nFrederico's testimony that fire-fighters forcibly entered the\r\n\nstore's  back  door.    The   jury  could  have  agreed  with\r\n\nVirgilio's   argument  that,   given  the   evident  powerful\r\n\nexplosion in  the store,  his injuries  would have  been more\r\n\nsevere, or worse, he would not have  survived had he been the\r\n\narsonist.  The jury was warranted, however, in rejecting this\r\n\ntheory.\r\n\n          The   strongest   competing  theory   of  innocence\r\n\nconcerns Santo's involvement in  the arson.  Put  simply, the\r\n\njury could have  reasonably found that Santo knew  nothing of\r\n\nthe fire  before its  occurrence, but  acted as  an accessory\r\n\nafter  the fact both to  protect Virgilio and  to profit from\r\n\nfraudulently obtained insurance proceeds.   Santo insisted in\r\n\nhis  testimony, however, that he had the only means of access\r\n\nto the store on  the night of the  fire and that he left  the\r\n\nback door secured that evening.  In  contrast, the government\r\n\nproduced direct, credible evidence that the back door was not\r                                                                         \r\n\nclosed at the  time of  the fire; while  the jury might  have\r\n\nfound  that Virgilio opened  the door, or,  perhaps, that the\r\n\nexplosion blew the  door open (although no  witness opined as\r\n\nsuch),  given  Santo's  staunch  refusal  to  allow  for  the\r\n\npossibility  that someone  else may  have had  access to  the\r\n\nstore,  the jury  could  and did  plausibly  find that  Santo\r\n\nopened the door.   The evidence that Santo obtained insurance\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\ncoverage  and disengaged  the alarm  shortly before  the fire\r\n\nconstitutes  further proof  of  his prior  knowledge of,  and\r\n\ninvolvement in, the arson-for-profit scheme.  Finally,  other\r\n\nthan  generally  to  deny  any involvement  with  the  arson,\r\n\nSanto's  trial testimony  did nothing  to support  the theory\r\n\nthat he was an unwitting dupe in Virgilio's criminal plan.\r\n\n          The largely  circumstantial nature of the  proof in\r\n\nthis case  gave rise to competing  plausible inferences, some\r\n\npointing  to  guilt and  others to  innocence.   The  jury is\r\n\ncharged with choosing between such inferences, see Olbres, 61\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at  972,  and, having  had  the opportunity  to  observe\r\n\nSanto's trial testimony  and demeanor, it saw  fit to convict\r\n\nhim  on all counts.  While reasonable people could have found\r\n\notherwise, \"a trial judge  is not a thirteenth juror  who may\r\n\nset  aside a verdict merely  because he would  have reached a\r\n\ndifferent  result.\"  Rothrock, 806  F.2d at 322.   Because we\r                                         \r\n\ncannot say the jury reached a seriously  erroneous result, we\r\n\nfind  no  abuse  of   discretion  in  the  court's  carefully\r\n\nconsidered refusal to grant Santo or Virgilio a new trial.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                       Jury Composition\r                                   Jury Composition\r                                                   \r\n\n          For the first time on appeal, Virgilio complains of\r\n\nthe   absence  of  minority   jury  members,   suggesting  an\r\n\nunconstitutionally disproportionate  ethnic representation in\r\n\nthe  jury  venire.    We consider  Virgilio's  unadorned  and\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nperfunctory appellate arguments waived.

See United States v. Pion,\r                                                                        \r\n\n25  F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining elements of prima\r\n\nfacie case of unconstitutional disproportionality).4  \r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                 Other Asserted Trial Errors\r                             Other Asserted Trial Errors\r                                                        \r\n\n          Virgilio contends  that  the prosecutor  asked  two\r\n\nquestions  of  Pablo Ruiz  that  were  calculated to  inflame\r\n\nethnic  prejudice in  the jury.   Some  context is  in order.\r\n\nPablo  testified that,  although  he received  many years  of\r\n\neducation in  the Dominican  Republic and earned  an advanced\r\n\ndegree in agriculture, he  could not find work in  the United\r\n\nStates because he did not speak English.  When later asked by\r\n\nthe prosecutor how  he could  remember at trial  the time  he\r\n\nwent to bed on  the night of the fire  (some three-and-a-half\r\n\nyears earlier) Pablo replied, \"Well, if I can remember what I\r\n\nstudied  during 23 years, I should be able to remember a part\r\n\nof what happened that night.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Virgilio  also suggests  that three  of the  jury members\r\nwere  biased  because they  had  relatives  in the  insurance\r\nindustry.  Because Virgilio failed to raise the  issue below,\r\nand fails adequately to  develop it on appeal, we  decline to\r\naddress it.\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          After  further questioning  about the  fire events,\r\n\nduring which Pablo's credibility  was called into question by\r\n\nvarious inconsistencies, the prosecutor rekindled the subject\r\n\nof Pablo's inability to find agricultural work in the  United\r\n\nStates.  The following exchange ensued:\r\n\n          [The Prosecutor]:  What about California,\r\n          .  . .  you ever  tried to  get a  job in\r\n          agriculture in California?\r\n\n          [Court   overrules   the  objection   and\r\n          directs the witness to answer yes or no]\r\n\n          [Pablo Ruiz]:  No.\r\n\n          [The Prosecutor]:   What about Texas, did\r\n          you ever --\r\n\n          [Court sustains objection].5\r\n\n          In  its post-trial  order  denying  the  defendants\r\n\nmotions for acquittal and new trial, the district court found\r\n\nthat \"the  now disputed  cross-examination of Pablo  Ruiz was\r\n\nproper,  did not constitute a racist appeal to the jury, and,\r\n\nwhen viewed in context,  was not material in any event.\"   We\r\n\nagree.   We  have  warned  that  \"courts  must  not  tolerate\r\n\nprosecutors' efforts  gratuitously to inject issues like race\r\n\nand  ethnicity  into  criminal  trials.\"   United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSaccoccia, 58  F.3d 754, 774  (1st Cir. 1995),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n116 S.

See id.6\r                               \r\n\n          Virgilio also claims that the prosecutor frequently\r\n\n\"bellowed offensively at defense testimony\" and \"screamed  at\r\n\nthe jury with totally inappropriate accompanying facial moues\r\n\nand  flailing gesticulation.\"    Virgilio did  not raise  any\r\n\nobjection to the prosecutor's  style or manner at trial.   In\r\n\nits post-trial  order, the district court  found that, \"while\r\n\nthe prosecutor's closing argument was loudly and passionately\r\n\ndelivered,  it  did  not  exceed the  bounds  of  propriety.\"\r\n\nHaving failed on appeal to  develop his argument or  explain,\r\n\nwith any detail, how  the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the\r\n\ntrial, Virgilio cannot prevail on this challenge.7\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  We also note that the district court carefully instructed\r\nthe jury, at some  length, that it must not draw  any adverse\r\ninference from  the fact  that the  defendants were  from the\r\nDominican Republic and were not native English speakers.\r\n\n7.

For  the  reasons discussed  above\r\nconcerning the  arson, conspiracy  and mail fraud  counts, we\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\ndefendants set fire to Brothers Fashions \"to carry out\" their\r\n\nscheme to  deceive the insurance company  into making payment\r\n\nfor claimed losses.   Specifically, the fire constituted \"the\r\n\nmeans\"  by  which  the  defendants attempted  to  create  the\r\n\nappearance  of a legitimate loss of insured items.  While the\r\n\ndefendants also \"used\" the mails in furtherance of the scheme\r\n\nto   defraud,  that   does  not   diminish  the   fact  that,\r\n\nadditionally, they \"employed\" or \"availed themselves of\" fire\r\n\nto  effect  their  scheme.    Cf.  Smith,  508  U.S.  at  230\r                                                    \r\n\n(explaining that including one  method of \"us[ing] a firearm\"\r\n\ndoes  not   result  in  excluding  others).     Finally,  the\r\n\ndefendants make no argument that the placement and purpose of\r\n\nthe  word  \"use\"  in  its  statutory  context  undermine  the\r\n\napplicability of   844(h)(1) here.  See Bailey, 116 S.

Moreover, the legislative history  of the Anti-Arson Act\r\nof   1982,  which  amends    844(h)(1)  and  other  statutory\r\nsections,  strongly  suggests Congress'  recognition,  in the\r\ncontext  of this statutory scheme, that one can \"use fire\" to\r\neffect a number of criminal purposes,  specifically insurance\r\nfraud.

The   arson   guideline  commentary   further  provides,\r\n\"Creating  a  substantial risk  of  death  or serious  bodily\r\ninjury includes creating that risk to fire fighters and other\r\nemergency  and law  enforcement personnel  who respond  to or\r\ninvestigate an offense.\"  U.S.S.G.   2K1.4, comment. (n.2).\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\n          As  indicated  by the  underscored language  in the\r\n\ntext  of the arson guideline set forth above, the higher base\r\n\noffense level (24) is warranted  under either the first prong\r\n\nof    2K1.4(a)(1) --  the knowing  creation of  a substantial\r\n\nrisk of death or  serious bodily injury (  2K1.4(a)(1)(A)) --\r\n\nor  the   second  prong  --  the   destruction  or  attempted\r\n\ndestruction of a dwelling  (  2K1.4(a)(1)(B)).  The selection\r\n\nbetween  this base offense level and the lower level (20) set\r\n\nforth in the subsequent section,   2K1.4(a)(2),  depends upon\r\n\neither  the defendant's mens rea (i.e., whether or not it was\r                                            \r\n\n\"knowing\") in  creating the  requisite risk, or  the type  of\r                                                           \r\n\nstructure involved,  i.e., dwelling or non-dwelling.   If the\r\n\nfire  involved a  dwelling,  the selection  between the  base\r\n\noffense levels depends on whether the defendant destroyed (or\r\n\nattempted to destroy) it, or merely endangered it.\r\n\n          The   defendants  offered  two  rationales  to  the\r\n\ndistrict court in support of an application of a base offense\r\n\nlevel  of  20:  (1)  it  is  inconceivable  that  they  would\r\n\nintentionally create  a substantial risk of  death or serious\r\n\nbodily injury  to their family members  living directly above\r\n\nBrothers Fashions; and (2) they did not destroy or attempt to\r\n\ndestroy  a dwelling,  but rather, a  store; and  the upstairs\r                               \r\n\nresidences, only minimally damaged, were  merely \"endangered\"\r\n\nincidentally to the arson offense.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\n          The government countered that a  base offense level\r\n\nof 24  was  warranted  because,  under  the  first  prong  of\r\n\n  2K1.4(a)(1), the  defendants had only  to \"knowingly,\"  not\r\n\n\"intentionally,\"  create  the   risk  of  death   or  injury.\r\n\nMoreover, the government argued, the defendants satisfied the\r\n\n\"knowingly\" requirement because they committed the arson at a\r\n\ntime  when they knew residents  were in the  very building to\r\n\nwhich  they set fire.  The government argued further that the\r\n\nsecond prong  of   2K1.4(a)(1)  warranted a level  24 because\r\n\nthe defendants destroyed or attempted to destroy a dwelling.\r\n\n          The district court observed that a pivotal question\r\n\nrevolved  around  the  meaning   of  the  word   \"knowingly.\"\r\n\n  2K1.4(a)(1)(A).   The court  opined that the  definition of\r\n\n\"knowingly\" was  \"a little bit  ambiguous\" in the  context of\r\n\nthe arson guideline.  It first observed that, \"[o]bjectively,\r\n\na  rational person  perhaps should  know that  if he  set the\r\n\ngasoline fire in the basement,  people living above would  be\r\n\ninjured.\"   The court,  however, further  stated  that if  it\r\n\ninterpreted   \"knowingly\"  as  \"intentionally,\"  it  did  not\r\n\nbelieve that Virgilio Ruiz  intentionally put his brothers in\r\n\ndanger; instead, the court observed, \"I think subjectively he\r\n\nmay have had the  foolish, but sincere belief that  this fire\r\n\ncould be  started, that everybody could  be quickly evacuated\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\nor  even  that the  dwelling where  they  lived would  not be\r\n\ndestroyed, just the store would be.\"13 \r\n\n          The court then concluded:\r\n\n               Well, I'll tell  you what I'm  going\r\n          to do.  I'm  going to rate this as  a 22.\r\n          There is  a  preamble to  the  guidelines\r\n          which I cannot find right [now] that says\r\n          if  something  doesn't perfectly  fit one\r\n          category or another, it is permissible to\r\n          interpolate.\r\n               For  example, there  is  a law  that\r\n          says if somebody  is between a minor  and\r\n          minimal participant, you  can reduce  the\r\n          role in the offense by 3 rather than 2 or\r\n          4  and, in  [another  case],  I [had]  to\r\n          study the interpolation  language at  the\r\n          beginning of the guidelines.  It seems to\r\n          me this is a [case] which generally falls\r\n          between      the      two     provisions,\r\n          [  2K1.4](a)(1)  and (a)(2),  essentially\r\n          for  the reasons [stated  above].   And I\r\n          think  the  fairest  and  legal[ly]  most\r\n          appropriate   thing   to   do    in   the\r\n          circumstances would be to interpolate and\r\n          I'm going to rate this as a 22.14\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The court appeared to find inapplicable the second prong\r\nof   2K1.4(a)(1)  -- \"destruction or attempted destruction of\r\na dwelling.\"    2K1.4(a)(1)(B).   The court observed that the\r\ncircumstances   of  the   arson  appeared   to  involve   the\r\ndestruction of the  store, and the  endangering, but not  the\r\ndestruction,  of the dwelling.  In the apparent absence of an\r\nintent  to destroy  the whole  building, the  court impliedly\r\nfound   the   \"attempted   destruction\"    alternative   also\r\ninapplicable.     The   government  challenges   the  factual\r\nunderpinnings  of this conclusion.  Finding no clear error at\r\nthis juncture, we leave this ruling undisturbed.\r\n\n14.  The court eventually adjusted Santo's base offense level\r\ndownward, from 22 to  20, for being a \"minor  participant\" in\r\nthe offense, see  U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b),  which, combined  with\r                            \r\nhis criminal history category I, yielded a guideline range of\r\n33 to 41 months.  The court declined the government's request\r\nto increase Santo's offense level by two points  for perjury.\r\nThe  court selected  a 33-month  prison  term for  the arson,\r\nconspiracy,  and mail  fraud counts,  to be  followed  by the\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\n          On appeal, the defendants contend that the district\r\n\ncourt  erroneously  \"interpolated\"  when  applying  the arson\r\n\nguideline.  They  argue that if the  court found inapplicable\r\n\n  2K1.4(a)(1), it should have  affixed the lower base offense\r\n\nlevel  provided for  in   2K1.4(a)(2),  rather than  apply an\r\n\nintermediate  level.   The  government  does  not appeal  the\r                                                             \r\n\nsentences  as calculated,  but  nonetheless  argues that  the\r\n\nhigher base  offense level  was clearly appropriate  and that\r\n\nthe   defendants,    who   benefitted   from    the   court's\r\n\n\"interpolation\" exercise, have no basis for complaint.\r\n\n          The  district  court's  use  of  \"interpolation\" to\r\n\naffix  an intermediate  base  offense level  was an  apparent\r\n\nattempt  to   invoke  a   paragraph  (now  deleted)   in  the\r\n\nIntroduction  to  the  pre-November  1989  Guidelines Manual.\r\n\nSee,  e.g.,  U.S.S.G.     1A4(b)  (1987).    The   Sentencing\r                      \r\n\nCommission  had  designated  \"interpolation\"  as  a  form  of\r\n\ndeparture  in  which  a  sentencing  court  could  choose  an\r\n\nintermediate   point   \"between  two   adjacent,  numerically\r\n\noriented guidelines rules.\"  Id.  Effective November 1, 1989,\r                                            \r\n\nhowever, the Commission deleted that interpolation provision,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nmandatory 60 month consecutive  term for his conviction under\r\n18  U.S.C.    844(h)(1)  (using  fire  to  commit  a  federal\r\nfelony), for  a total of 93 months' imprisonment.  Virgilio's\r\nbase offense  level remained  at 22,  which, combined  with a\r\ncriminal  history   category  I   and  the  added   60  month\r\nconsecutive term, yielded a total range of 93-111 months.  On\r\nthe  government's recommendation,  the  court affixed  a 108-\r\nmonth prison term for Virgilio.\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nconcluding \"that  it is  simpler to add  intermediate offense\r\n\nlevel  adjustments to the  guidelines where  interpolation is\r\n\nmost likely to be considered.\"  U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment 68\r\n\n(1989).  The Commission also stated, however: \"This amendment\r\n\nis  not intended  to preclude  interpolation in  other cases;\r\n\nwhere appropriate, the court will be able to achieve the same\r\n\nresult  by use  of the  regular departure  provisions.\"   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nThus, although the issue is somewhat unclear, it appears that\r\n\ninterpolation between guideline rules is permissible where it\r\n\ncould  be  properly  justified  under  the  normal  departure\r\n\nprocedures.\r\n\n          Assuming  that  the  court essentially  effected  a\r\n\ndownward departure when affixing a base offense level of  22,\r\n\nwe  find  that because  the  district  court failed  to  make\r\n\nspecific findings  on the defendants'  state of mind,  we are\r\n\nunable to resolve either  the defendants' contention that the\r\n\nfacts warranted a level 20, or the government's argument that\r\n\na  level 24  was appropriate.   Our  inability to  settle the\r\n\nsentencing issue  absent such findings requires  us to remand\r\n\nthe case for  further findings and resentencing.

See id.  at 1255 (citing  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nKarlic, 997 F.2d 564, 568-69 (9th Cir. 1993)).  In this case,\r                  \r\n\nthe court explored the various possibilities of a \"knowledge\"\r\n\nfinding, opining first that a rational person would know that\r\n\nsetting such  a fire would cause injury,  then observing that\r\n\nVirgilio did not \"intentionally\" put others in danger because\r\n\nhe \"may\" have had the \"foolish but sincere belief\" in a swift\r\n\nevacuation of  the residents.  In the  end, the court did not\r\n\nmake any specific findings on either of the defendants' state\r\n\nof mind but, instead, resorted to interpolation.\r\n\n          The   court's  reluctance  to  make  the  requisite\r\n\nfindings may have  been the result of the  somewhat unsettled\r\n\ndefinition in  this circuit  of the  term \"knowingly\"  in the\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\narson guideline.

The  evidence established that the defendants\r\n\nset  fire to  a  building basement  in the  early hours  of a\r\n\nwinter morning, knowing that the residential units above were\r\n\noccupied.  \"It is difficult to imagine a clearer illustration\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nof the knowing  creation of  a substantial risk  of death  or\r\n\nserious bodily injury.\"   United States v.

Thus, we adopt the Model Penal\r                   \r\n\nCode absent a contrary guidelines definition.

The   Model  Penal  Code's   definition  of  \"knowingly\"\r\nprovides that:\r\n\n          A person acts knowingly with respect to a\r\n          material element of an offense when: .  .\r\n          .\r\n          (ii)  if the element involves a result of\r\n          his  conduct,  he  is  aware that  it  is\r\n          practically certain that his conduct will\r\n          cause such a result.\r\n\nModel Penal Code    2.02(2)(b) (1985).  The  Model Penal Code\r                            \r\nfurther states that \"[w]hen knowledge  of the existence of  a\r\nparticular fact  is an element of an  offense, such knowledge\r\nis established if a  person is aware of a high probability of\r\nits  existence,  unless  he  actually believes  it  does  not\r\nexist.\"  Id. at   2.02(7).\r                        \r\n\n17.

For the  purposes of  the arson\r\n\nguideline,   these    particular   \"constructive   knowledge\"\r\n\nformulations  appear  to  establish  only  \"recklessness\"  or\r\n\n\"negligence,\" both  insufficient to  trigger the  higher base\r\n\noffense level.

In order for the  higher offense\r\n\nlevel  to apply, the court  certainly need not  find that the\r\n\ndefendants  \"purposefully\"  or   \"intentionally\"  created   a\r\n\nsubstantial risk of death or  serious bodily injury.  Rather,\r\n\nthe court  need find only  that Virgilio  and Santo  actually\r\n\nknew that they created such risk, or were aware that the risk\r\n\nwas  practically certain.  If,  on the other  hand, the court\r\n\nsupportably finds  that one or both of them actually believed\r\n\nthat no substantial risk was created under the circumstances,\r\n\na  finding of knowledge would not be warranted.

Stern, United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before STAHL and LYNCH, Circuit Judges, and WOODLOCK,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> U.S. District Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, a grand jury indicted defendants-appellants Santo Ruiz and Virgilio Ruiz, two brothers, for various crimes arising out of a December 1990 fire that destroyed their variety store in Roxbury, Massachusetts.  After a ten day trial, a jury convicted the defendants of maliciously destroying by fire a building used in interstate commerce (18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i)), mail fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341), conspiracy to commit the foregoing offenses (18 U.S.C. &#167; 371), and use of fire to commit a federal felony (18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1)).  On appeal, the defendants challenge the district court's denial of their motions to acquit and for new trial.  They also appeal their sentences.  We affirm their convictions but vacate their sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the defendants' challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency of their convictions, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.  See United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 522, 133 L.Ed.2d 430 (1995).  Like the district court, we \"must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and credibility questions in the prosecution's favor,\" and, among competing plausible inferences, we \"must choose the inference that best fits the prosecution's theory of guilt.\"  Id.  With this standard of review in mind, we turn to the facts of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>A. Facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Pre-Fire Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1990, defendant Santo Ruiz opened a retail business named Brothers Fashions and Multiple Services (\"Brothers Fashions\"), in the basement area of a three-story residential duplex.  Three of Santo's brothers, Pablo, Frederico, and co-defendant Virgilio Ruiz, shared an apartment directly above the store.  The duplex comprised six residential apartments occupied by a total of sixteen residents, including the building's owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo borrowed $10,000 from another brother, William Ruiz, as the start-up capital for the store;  additionally, Santo incurred a debt of $4000 to William for the store's fixtures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The $14,000 debt remained unpaid in its entirety through the time of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The store sold sundry items, including clothing, shoes, blankets, cosmetics, household products, music albums and cassettes, beverages and candy.  Santo obtained the store's merchandise for cash from a variety of sources located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Florida, and California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virgilio Ruiz spent much time at the store and frequently assisted Santo, who did not speak English, with needed language interpretation.  Although Santo was the putative owner of Brothers Fashions, the evidence suggests that Santo and Virgilio represented to others a joint ownership and responsibility for the store.  For example, both Santo and Virgilio signed the lease for the space as well as the business certificate filed with the City of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early September 1990, Santo and Virgilio negotiated for the installation of a store security alarm and jointly signed the agreement with the alarm monitoring service.  The alarm, which could detect heat and motion, was designed primarily to trigger when a burglar entered the premises after hours;  a sufficient amount of smoke from fire could also trigger a response.  The alarm, however, would not operate unless the subscriber activated the system by entering the proper pass code.  About two weeks before the fire, Santo ceased activating the alarm system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early November 1990, approximately nine months after Brothers Fashions opened and about six weeks before the fire, Santo and Virgilio obtained $40,000's worth of insurance coverage for the store's contents.  During discussions with the insurance agent, the defendants specifically asked about the processing and payment of loss claims.  Although such information was not a usual part of the agent's initial discussions about insurance coverage, in response to this inquiry, he explained that receipts and cancelled checks would be required to prove a loss.  Virgilio, representing Brothers Fashions, signed an insurance finance agreement.  Coverage began shortly thereafter when the brothers tendered a down payment of approximately $750.  The payment schedule provided that a first installment of approximately $250 would fall due on December 20, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo kept in his possession most of the time the only set of keys to Brothers Fashions.  Before closing the business each day, Santo would secure the store-front with three heavy metal security shutters, each fastened with two padlocks.  The store's back door, which was rarely opened, measured three-feet wide by four-feet tall and could be opened only from the inside of the store.  It was secured on the inside with a sliding lock and at least one wooden cross-bar laid across the door.  An outer iron grate, locked from the inside with a padlock, further secured the back door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than two days before the fire, Brothers Fashions was fully stocked with merchandise displayed on clothing racks, shelves, and in display cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Fire</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 2:00 a.m. on Sunday, December 16, 1990, a fire raged through Brothers Fashions. The close proximity of the store to a fire station resulted in near immediate response.  Nonetheless, the blaze was serious enough to warrant the services of some seventy fire department personnel and over one dozen fire vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arriving at the scene, fire-fighters encountered the metal security shutters lying in the street in front of the store;  the shutters apparently had been blown off the storefront by a powerful explosion.  A fire-fighter in the first group to reach the back of the building noticed the store's back door standing open with flames shooting out from the basement.  The fire-fighters extinguished the fire without forcible entry of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, when a store stocked with clothing burns, piles of clothing in various stages of ruin remain.  After the fire at Brothers Fashions was suppressed, however, a casual inspection of the damaged store revealed very little burned or charred merchandise;  rather, all that was visible were a few beverage bottles, some canned goods and minimal charred foodstuffs.  The dearth of charred merchandise and the complete absence of clothing remnants in the store evince that it was nearly empty when it burned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the apartment tenants, except Virgilio, escaped unharmed from the burning building.  None of the tenants, including Virgilio, required fire-fighter assistance to evacuate.  Virgilio suffered second and third degree burns on his ankles, a severe cut above his left eye, and large bruises below his left eye and across his chest.  An ambulance carried him from the scene to the hospital, where he remained for eighteen days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Post-Fire Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent investigation revealed that the fire originated in two distinct locations within the store and burned in an unusual manner.  Specifically, the burn pattern indicated that an accelerant, such as gasoline, had been poured over a counter and other areas.  The building's electrical and natural gas distribution systems showed no sign of having caused or contributed to the fire.  Following the fire, Boston Gas Company, the natural gas provider for the building, conducted a search of its records for the period from 1984 through the time of the fire for any reports of gas leak repairs at the building.  The search revealed nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime within the first two weeks after the fire, John Greenaway, who had been hired for carpentry work on the premises, opened up the boarded-up store so that Santo could retrieve an empty clothes rack.  In January 1991, Santo and Virgilio prepared, jointly signed and submitted a claim to their insurer--via certified mail--asserting a contents loss of some $48,000.  The claim detailed various items of store merchandise and fixtures, including thousands of dollars' worth of men's and women's clothing, curtains, shoes, blankets, music albums and cassettes, videos, watches, candy, household items and toys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the insurance agent's earlier advice and the insurance company's request, the defendants did not submit any receipts, invoices, or other records to support their claim of loss.  Instead, the defendants claimed that the fire destroyed all such records and submitted a couple of photographs purporting to represent the store merchandise at the time of the fire and a cancelled check from Virgilio's bank account for approximately $15 in cigarette tax.  When asked by the insurance company, Santo could not recall the names of any of his retail merchandise suppliers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At various times before trial, Virgilio related his version of the fire events to his attending physician, a Boston Fire Department investigator, and, in a sworn deposition, representatives of the insurance company.  He professed a general inability to recall clearly and gave somewhat inconsistent accounts of the fire events.  To the extent Virgilio's various stories overlap, they indicate that:  he awoke in the first floor apartment to the smell of smoke, went to the living room to check the gas heater and saw smoke coming through the floor;  he then heard an explosion and ran to awaken his sleeping brothers (Pablo and Frederico) to warn them of the fire;  he picked up the telephone to call the fire department, but the line was dead;  he proceeded to run out the front hallway of the duplex and down the stairs toward the building's front exit;  on his way out to the sidewalk in front of the duplex, another explosion occurred and his \"fuzzy\" socks caught on fire, causing the injuries to his ankles;  at some point, he ran into a door--perhaps the front door of the apartment unit--causing his bruises and the severe cut above his eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. The Defendants' Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants presented a joint defense, calling to the stand members of the Ruiz family:  Pablo, Frederico, Santo, and Rosa (Santo's wife).  Pablo and Frederico testified that, on the night of the fire, Virgilio went to bed around midnight, and they retired soon thereafter.  They stated that Virgilio later woke them up because of the fire.  Frederico testified that he then dressed quickly and proceeded out the front door.  As he descended the front stairs, he met Virgilio, who was bleeding from his forehead and down his face.  Frederico and Virgilio ran out the front of the building together.  Frederico was not injured--by flame or otherwise--as he exited.  Upon reaching the sidewalk in front of the building, he noticed fire coming out of the basement store.  Frederico said that he then told the fire-fighters that Pablo was still inside the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pablo testified that his only avenue of escape from the burning building was the apartment's back door.  He stated that when he exited the building, he observed two firefighters, who, he says, had been attempting to pry open the apartment's back door to let him out.  Both Pablo and Frederico testified that they saw fire-fighters force open the store's back door, which, they claimed, had been closed.  They further claimed that, upon the opening of the back door--which measured four-feet by three-feet--fire-fighters emerged from within the store wearing full fire-fighting regalia, including oxygen tanks and masks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo testified in his defense.  He explained that he initially did not insure the contents of the Brothers Fashions because he wanted first to see how the business fared.  He testified that only he knew the alarm pass code, and that he failed to activate the alarm for several weeks before the fire because of the recurrence of false alarms.  He had deduced that rats entering the store after hours (to eat candy) triggered the alarm, and he wanted to \"kill\" the rodents before further engaging the alarm.  He testified that he complained about the rats to both the owner and to Greenaway, who, in turn, testified that Santo had never complained to him about a rat problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo suggested that a natural gas explosion may have contributed to the fire.  Specifically, he claimed that about one month before the fire, he called Boston Gas because he smelled a natural gas leak;  contrary to other trial testimony, he claimed that Boston Gas personnel then came out to the store and fixed the leak.  Santo further testified that there may have been paint and paint thinner in the store, as well as household detergents, that might have acted as an accelerant for the fire and would account for the peculiar burn patterns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo testified that on December 15, 1990, the day before the fire, the store was fully stocked.  That night, he explained, he had closed the store between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. and secured the front entrance.  He insisted that he left the back door fully secured and that he retained in his possession the only set of store keys.  He then went to his home in Dorchester.  The next morning, around 6:00 a.m., he received a call at home informing him of the fire.  He walked to the store (his car was not operational), arriving around 8:00 a.m..</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo further testified that, upon his arrival at the fire scene, he saw ten to fifteen people in and around the burned store, including people from Boston Gas, and Greenaway's son.  He said the people were removing half-burned items from the store.  He admitted at trial that he had never previously mentioned his observance of the looters, even to the insurance company.  He also testified that he did not attempt to stop the looting because the merchandise taken was, in any event, ruined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo admitted that, although he did not speak or understand English and had to rely on Virgilio for translation, he fully understood his actions when he signed the lease to the store, the business certificate, the alarm system contract, and the insurance claim for $48,000 in lost inventory.  Santo denied removing, or asking anyone to remove, the merchandise from Brothers Fashions before the fire.  He also denied lighting the fire or asking anyone to light the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants painted a picture of a prosperous store that earned some $600 to $1000 in retail sales per day, suggesting the absence of a motive to collect insurance proceeds.  The defendants also attempted to establish the bias of various trial witnesses.  For example, they produced (contradicted) evidence of the unlawful absence of smoke detectors in the duplex, suggesting that the owner had her own motive to collect insurance proceeds.  The defendants also suggested that the carpenter Greenaway was biased because he had married the owner's niece in 1990 and, upon the owner's death, the owner's niece stood to inherit the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Arson and Conspiracy Counts, Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Relevant Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i), the government must establish that the defendants:  (1) maliciously damaged or destroyed, or attempted to damage or destroy, (2) by fire or an explosive, (3) a building or personal property used in interstate commerce or in any activity affecting interstate commerce.  The government sought to prove that Virgilio set the fire, and Santo either aided and abetted him, or reasonably could foresee that Virgilio would set the fire in furtherance of an unlawful conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove aiding and abetting on the part of Santo, the government had to prove that Virgilio committed the arson, and that Santo associated himself with, and participated in, the arson \"as something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\"  United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 590-91 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted);  see Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 769-70, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949).  Alternatively, to convict Santo of the substantive arson offense, the government had to establish that Virgilio's setting of the fire was a foreseeable act done in furtherance of their unlawful conspiracy.  See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 647, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1184, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the underlying conspiracy--a predicate to Santo's Pinkerton liability as well as a substantive count in the indictment--the government needed to establish the defendants' knowledge and voluntary participation in the agreement, and an overt act in furtherance of it.  See United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 742 (1st Cir.1996).  \"The agreement need not be explicit;  a tacit agreement will suffice.\"  Id.  To establish voluntary participation, the government must prove both the intent to agree and the intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.  See id.   Of course, direct evidence is not required to prove either the agreement (which may be inferred from circumstances) or the defendants' participation in it.  See id.;  United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1300 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence more than adequately established that someone deliberately torched Brothers Fashions with the aid of an accelerant.  Further, there is little question that the store was used in an activity affecting interstate commerce both because it was a rental property, and because the merchandise purchased for resale moved in interstate commerce.  See United States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1247-48 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that \"rental property is per se sufficiently connected to interstate commerce\" for purposes of &#167; 844(i)) (explaining further that the jurisdictional element is met where restaurant received food supplies that travelled in interstate commerce);  see also Russell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858, 862, 105 S.Ct. 2455, 2457-58, 85 L.Ed.2d 829 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more troubling question is whether or not the evidence sufficiently proved that Santo and Virgilio were the parties criminally responsible for the fire.  We note that the case against the defendants is largely circumstantial.  Circumstantial evidence does not represent the proposition in question, but asserts \" 'something else, from which the trier of fact may either (i) reasonably infer the truth of the proposition, ... or (ii) at least reasonably infer an increase in the probability that the proposition is in fact true.' \"  U.S. v. Clotida, 892 F.2d 1098, 1104 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting 1 D. Louisell &amp; C. Mueller,  Federal Evidence &#167; 94 (1977)).  Although circumstantial evidence requires an inferential step in its proof, there is \"no legal distinction\" between circumstantial and direct evidence in the context of a Rule 29 motion.  Id.;  see Olbres, 61 F.3d at 971.   We recognize that \"the government's proof may lay entirely in circumstantial evidence,\" United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 63-64 (1st Cir.1995);  we are, however, \"loath to stack inference upon inference in order to uphold the jury's verdict.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government produced direct evidence that Santo had in his possession the only keys to the store on the night of the fire, that the store's back door, rarely opened, was open at the time of the fire, and that Brothers Fashions had been emptied of almost all merchandise at that time.  The jury thus could rationally infer that, because only Santo had the means to access the store that evening, he opened the back door from the inside of the store sometime before the fire.  Santo's exclusive access also permits the conclusion that he was involved with the removal of the store's merchandise before the fire.  The jury could infer that his new and uncorroborated testimony about looters was a fabrication to account for the lost merchandise--a fabrication intended to cover up his knowledge of and involvement in its removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could conclude that Santo lied when he testified that he discontinued activating the security alarm shortly before the fire because of rats.  From this untruth, the jury could infer that Santo's unexpressed reason for failing to engage the alarm was to nullify its ability to detect both the removal of merchandise and the fire.  The jury could further find that Santo lied when he stated that he left the store's back door secured on the night of the fire and that, in fact, he left it open for Virgilio to set the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could rationally infer that Virgilio personally set fire to Brothers Fashions.  Virgilio, the only apartment tenant injured by the fire, had severe burns on his ankles, consistent with direct and prolonged exposure to flame;  yet Frederico, who exited the building in the same manner and through the same area as claimed by Virgilio, testified that he was not injured in any manner and that he did not encounter any fire until he reached the sidewalk in front of the building, where he viewed the fire emanating from the store.  The jury could also choose not to credit Virgilio's unembellished and confused account of the cause of the injuries to his face and body and infer that, in fact, he suffered those injuries escaping the store (perhaps out the small back door) after lighting the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could further find that Santo lied when testifying that:  (1) he had nothing to do with the removal of the store's contents, (2) he observed looters at the store the morning after the fire, and (3) Boston Gas repaired a gas leak at the store one month before the fire.  The jury could also conclude that Virgilio lied about the source of his injuries.  Lies such as these legitimately support a finding of guilt.  See United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 999 (1st Cir.1990) (finding inference of guilt could have been bolstered by defendant's \"tall tale\");  United States v. Jimenez-Perez, 869 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that the jury's disbelief of defendants' story allows legitimate inference \"that the fabrication was all the more proof of their guilt\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to motive, although the government did not produce evidence that Brothers Fashions was a failing business,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the defendants clearly stood to gain from the insurance proceeds.  Moreover, the jury could have given due weight to the fact that the defendants did not have insurance for the first nine months of the store's operation, obtained it only six weeks before the fire, and expressed peculiar concern about claim payments and proof of loss requirements.  Further, the fire occurred just four days before the due date of the first installment payment, but after the down payment had already triggered coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, although not overwhelming, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Santo and Virgilio conspired to set afire Brothers Fashions, (2) Virgilio set the fire, (3) Santo assisted Virgilio in this task by providing access to the store and by failing to engage the alarm, and (4) Santo reasonably could foresee that Virgilio would set the fire in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Although the evidence does not compel a finding of guilt, it need not \"exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except guilt.\"  United States v. Laboy, 909 F.2d 581, 588 (1st Cir.1990).  The jury was \"free to choose among reasonable constructions of evidence,\" id., and the trial evidence, as a whole, permits a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See id.   We cannot say that the jury's verdict on the arson and conspiracy counts was irrational.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Mail Fraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little discussion of this count is necessary.  To prove mail fraud, the government must establish:  \"(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails ... in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723.   There was more than adequate evidence to prove that Santo and Virgilio intentionally agreed to collect insurance proceeds fraudulently, and together submitted, by mail, a false insurance claim for merchandise they knew had not been lost in the fire.  We will not disturb the jury's verdict on this count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants alternatively challenge the district court's denial of their new trial motions, claiming that, on the weight of the evidence, their convictions constituted a miscarriage of justice.  A district court's power to order a new trial is greater than its power to grant a motion for acquittal.  See United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d 318, 318 (1st Cir.1986).  In considering a new trial motion, the court may consider both the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses.  See id. at 321.   Where a new trial motion is based upon the weight of the evidence, the court may not order a new trial \"unless it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result.\"   See id. at 322 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We review the district court's ruling on a new trial motion for abuse of discretion.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, the trial evidence was in conflict.  The jury, however, was not compelled to credit Virgilio's account of the manner in which he was injured, or Pablo and Frederico's testimony that fire-fighters forcibly entered the store's back door.  The jury could have agreed with Virgilio's argument that, given the evident powerful explosion in the store, his injuries would have been more severe, or worse, he would not have survived had he been the arsonist.  The jury was warranted, however, in rejecting this theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strongest competing theory of innocence concerns Santo's involvement in the arson.  Put simply, the jury could have reasonably found that Santo knew nothing of the fire before its occurrence, but acted as an accessory after the fact both to protect Virgilio and to profit from fraudulently obtained insurance proceeds.  Santo insisted in his testimony, however, that he had the only means of access to the store on the night of the fire and that he left the back door secured that evening.  In contrast, the government produced direct, credible evidence that the back door was not closed at the time of the fire;  while the jury might have found that Virgilio opened the door, or, perhaps, that the explosion blew the door open (although no witness opined as such), given Santo's staunch refusal to allow for the possibility that someone else may have had access to the store, the jury could and did plausibly find that Santo opened the door.  The evidence that Santo obtained insurance coverage and disengaged the alarm shortly before the fire constitutes further proof of his prior knowledge of, and involvement in, the arson-for-profit scheme.  Finally, other than generally to deny any involvement with the arson, Santo's trial testimony did nothing to support the theory that he was an unwitting dupe in Virgilio's criminal plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The largely circumstantial nature of the proof in this case gave rise to competing plausible inferences, some pointing to guilt and others to innocence.  The jury is charged with choosing between such inferences, see Olbres, 61 F.3d at 972, and, having had the opportunity to observe Santo's trial testimony and demeanor, it saw fit to convict him on all counts.  While reasonable people could have found otherwise, \"a trial judge is not a thirteenth juror who may set aside a verdict merely because he would have reached a different result.\"  Rothrock, 806 F.2d at 322.   Because we cannot say the jury reached a seriously erroneous result, we find no abuse of discretion in the court's carefully considered refusal to grant Santo or Virgilio a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Jury Composition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, Virgilio complains of the absence of minority jury members, suggesting an unconstitutionally disproportionate ethnic representation in the jury venire.  We consider Virgilio's unadorned and perfunctory appellate arguments waived.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that undeveloped appellate arguments are deemed waived).  Moreover, not only did he fail timely to raise the issue below, his assertions on appeal are, in any event, inadequate to meet his burden on the issue.  See United States v. Pion, 25 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining elements of prima facie case of unconstitutional disproportionality).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Other Asserted Trial Errors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virgilio contends that the prosecutor asked two questions of Pablo Ruiz that were calculated to inflame ethnic prejudice in the jury.  Some context is in order.  Pablo testified that, although he received many years of education in the Dominican Republic and earned an advanced degree in agriculture, he could not find work in the United States because he did not speak English.  When later asked by the prosecutor how he could remember at trial the time he went to bed on the night of the fire (some three-and-a-half years earlier) Pablo replied, \"Well, if I can remember what I studied during 23 years, I should be able to remember a part of what happened that night.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further questioning about the fire events, during which Pablo's credibility was called into question by various inconsistencies, the prosecutor rekindled the subject of Pablo's inability to find agricultural work in the United States.  The following exchange ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>[The Prosecutor]:  What about California, ... you ever tried to get a job in agriculture in California?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>[Court overrules the objection and directs the witness to answer yes or no]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>[Pablo Ruiz]:  No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>[The Prosecutor]:  What about Texas, did you ever--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>[Court sustains objection].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its post-trial order denying the defendants motions for acquittal and new trial, the district court found that \"the now disputed cross-examination of Pablo Ruiz was proper, did not constitute a racist appeal to the jury, and, when viewed in context, was not material in any event.\"   We agree.  We have warned that \"courts must not tolerate prosecutors' efforts gratuitously to inject issues like race and ethnicity into criminal trials.\"  United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 774 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996).  To the extent the disputed questions here unnecessarily (albeit marginally) invited ethnic or cultural prejudice, we strongly disapprove. While, however, the inquiries may have been of borderline relevance and materiality, it was Pablo who initially offered the explanation that his inability to speak English precluded his employment in the field for which he was most qualified.  Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the prosecutor impermissibly injected into the trial a harmful appeal to any ethnic bias in the jury by asking these two questions.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virgilio also claims that the prosecutor frequently \"bellowed offensively at defense testimony\" and \"screamed at the jury with totally inappropriate accompanying facial moues and flailing gesticulation.\"   Virgilio did not raise any objection to the prosecutor's style or manner at trial.  In its post-trial order, the district court found that, \"while the prosecutor's closing argument was loudly and passionately delivered, it did not exceed the bounds of propriety.\"   Having failed on appeal to develop his argument or explain, with any detail, how the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the trial, Virgilio cannot prevail on this challenge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>:  Use of Fire to Commit Federal Felony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also challenge their convictions and sentences under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1), which provides, in relevant part:  \"Whoever ... uses fire or an explosive to commit any [federal] felony ... shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years but not more than 15 years....\"  The indictment charged Santo and Virgilio with using fire to commit mail fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.  The defendants claim, however, that \"fire\" was not used \"to commit\" mail fraud, but rather, the \"mailing of articles\" was used to commit mail fraud.  They contend that fire may have been used to commit the arson, \"but it was not the letter, envelope or stamp, or handwriting/printing/typing used to commit mail fraud.\"   In the past, we have implicitly assumed the legal conclusion that defendants now challenge.  See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 569 (1st Cir.1993) (involving &#167; 844(h)(1) conviction for using fire to commit mail fraud where defendant arranged arson fraudulently to secure insurance proceeds).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' challenge calls into question the meaning of the phrase \"uses fire ... to commit [certain crimes].\"  We have not previously been presented with this issue.  We begin our analysis with the statute's language.  See Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 501, 506, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).  Because the word \"use\" is not defined by statute, we \"construe it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning.\"  Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 228, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2054, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993);  see Bailey, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 506.   The word is \"variously defined as '[t]o convert to one's service,' 'to employ,' 'to avail oneself of,' and 'to carry out a purpose or action by means of.' \"  Bailey, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 506 (quoting Smith, 508 U.S. at 228-29, 113 S.Ct. at 2054 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Webster's New International Dictionary of English Language 2806 (2d ed. 1949) and Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it plain that the defendants \"used\" fire to commit mail fraud within the meaning of &#167; 844(h)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The defendants set fire to Brothers Fashions \"to carry out\" their scheme to deceive the insurance company into making payment for claimed losses.  Specifically, the fire constituted \"the means\" by which the defendants attempted to create the appearance of a legitimate loss of insured items.  While the defendants also \"used\" the mails in furtherance of the scheme to defraud, that does not diminish the fact that, additionally, they \"employed\" or \"availed themselves of\" fire to effect their scheme.  Cf. Smith, 508 U.S. at 230, 113 S.Ct. at 2054-55 (explaining that including one method of \"us[ing] a firearm\" does not result in excluding others).  Finally, the defendants make no argument that the placement and purpose of the word \"use\" in its statutory context undermine the applicability of &#167; 844(h)(1) here.  See Bailey, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 506-07 (considering disputed language in the context of overall statutory scheme).  No basis for such an argument is apparent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we see no basis to overturn the defendants' convictions and attendant penalties under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p>Sentencing Guideline Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants appeal the court's application of the federal arson guideline.

We review de novo sentencing issues involving questions of law, including the applicability of a relevant guideline.  See id.   Because the sentencing court enjoys a unique vantage point and has \"special competence\" in assessing the \"ordinariness\" of a case, we afford it substantial deference in departure decisions, which we review only for abuse of discretion.  Koon v.

Subsection (a)(1) of the guideline authorizes the application of a base offense level of 24 if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>the offense (A) created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person other than a participant in the offense, and that risk was created knowingly;  or (B) involved the destruction or attempted destruction of a dwelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Subsection (a)(2) authorizes a lower base offense level, 20, if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>the offense (A) created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person other than a participant in the offense;  (B) involved the destruction or attempted destruction of a structure other than a dwelling;  or (C) endangered a dwelling, or a structure other than a dwelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated by the underscored language in the text of the arson guideline set forth above, the higher base offense level (24) is warranted under either the first prong of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)--the knowing creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury (&#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A))--or the second prong--the destruction or attempted destruction of a dwelling (&#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(B)).  The selection between this base offense level and the lower level (20) set forth in the subsequent section, &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2), depends upon either the defendant's mens rea (i.e., whether or not it was \"knowing\") in creating the requisite risk, or the type of structure involved, i.e., dwelling or non-dwelling.  If the fire involved a dwelling, the selection between the base offense levels depends on whether the defendant destroyed (or attempted to destroy) it, or merely endangered it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants offered two rationales to the district court in support of an application of a base offense level of 20:(1) it is inconceivable that they would intentionally create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to their family members living directly above Brothers Fashions;  and (2) they did not destroy or attempt to destroy a dwelling, but rather, a store;  and the upstairs residences, only minimally damaged, were merely \"endangered\" incidentally to the arson offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government countered that a base offense level of 24 was warranted because, under the first prong of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1), the defendants had only to \"knowingly,\" not \"intentionally,\" create the risk of death or injury.  Moreover, the government argued, the defendants satisfied the \"knowingly\" requirement because they committed the arson at a time when they knew residents were in the very building to which they set fire.  The government argued further that the second prong of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) warranted a level 24 because the defendants destroyed or attempted to destroy a dwelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court observed that a pivotal question revolved around the meaning of the word \"knowingly.\"  &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A).  The court opined that the definition of \"knowingly\" was \"a little bit ambiguous\" in the context of the arson guideline.  It first observed that, \"[o]bjectively, a rational person perhaps should know that if he set the gasoline fire in the basement, people living above would be injured.\"   The court, however, further stated that if it interpreted \"knowingly\" as \"intentionally,\" it did not believe that Virgilio Ruiz intentionally put his brothers in danger;  instead, the court observed, \"I think subjectively he may have had the foolish, but sincere belief that this fire could be started, that everybody could be quickly evacuated or even that the dwelling where they lived would not be destroyed, just the store would be.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court then concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

It seems to me this is a [case] which generally falls between the two provisions, [&#167; 2K1.4](a)(1) and (a)(2), essentially for the reasons [stated above].  And I think the fairest and legal[ly] most appropriate thing to do in the circumstances would be to interpolate and I'm going to rate this as a 22.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the defendants contend that the district court erroneously \"interpolated\" when applying the arson guideline.  They argue that if the court found inapplicable &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1), it should have affixed the lower base offense level provided for in &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2), rather than apply an intermediate level.  The government does not appeal the sentences as calculated, but nonetheless argues that the higher base offense level was clearly appropriate and that the defendants, who benefitted from the court's \"interpolation\" exercise, have no basis for complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's use of \"interpolation\" to affix an intermediate base offense level was an apparent attempt to invoke a paragraph (now deleted) in the Introduction to the pre-November 1989 Guidelines Manual.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 1A4(b) (1987).  The Sentencing Commission had designated \"interpolation\" as a form of departure in which a sentencing court could choose an intermediate point \"between two adjacent, numerically oriented guidelines rules.\"  Id.  Effective November 1, 1989, however, the Commission deleted that interpolation provision, concluding \"that it is simpler to add intermediate offense level adjustments to the guidelines where interpolation is most likely to be considered.\"  U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 68 (1989).  The Commission also stated, however:  \"This amendment is not intended to preclude interpolation in other cases;  where appropriate, the court will be able to achieve the same result by use of the regular departure provisions.\"  Id.  Thus, although the issue is somewhat unclear, it appears that interpolation between guideline rules is permissible where it could be properly justified under the normal departure procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the court essentially effected a downward departure when affixing a base offense level of 22, we find that because the district court failed to make specific findings on the defendants' state of mind, we are unable to resolve either the defendants' contention that the facts warranted a level 20, or the government's argument that a level 24 was appropriate.  Our inability to settle the sentencing issue absent such findings requires us to remand the case for further findings and resentencing.  See United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 234-36 (1st Cir.1993) (remanding for resentencing where sentencing court failed to make reasonably specific findings concerning foreseeability of drug quantity);  see also United States v.

DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1256 (1st Cir.1996), we stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>Given the structure of the arson guidelines, we conclude that &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) requires that the district court make a specific finding that the defendant 'knowingly' created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, as opposed to merely finding that defendant recklessly (or negligently) created such a risk which would more appropriately trigger application of [&#167; 2K1.4(a)(2) ] (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the defendant acted \"knowingly\" calls for an inquiry into his subjective state of mind when he created the requisite risk.  See id. at 1255 (citing United States v. Karlic, 997 F.2d 564, 568-69 (9th Cir.1993)).  In this case, the court explored the various possibilities of a \"knowledge\" finding, opining first that a rational person would know that setting such a fire would cause injury, then observing that Virgilio did not \"intentionally\" put others in danger because he \"may\" have had the \"foolish but sincere belief\" in a swift evacuation of the residents.  In the end, the court did not make any specific findings on either of the defendants' state of mind but, instead, resorted to interpolation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reluctance to make the requisite findings may have been the result of the somewhat unsettled definition in this circuit of the term \"knowingly\" in the arson guideline.  See generally, DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1256-58.   In DiSanto, we discussed at some length the possible parameters of the word \"knowingly.\"   See id. at 1256-58.   We explained that \" 'the hypothetical knowledge continuum' is marked by 'constructive knowledge' at one end and 'actual knowledge' at the other.\"  Id. at 1257 (quoting United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 236-37 (1st Cir.1995)).  In between these extremes lie various \"gradations,\" including \"notice of likelihood\" and \"practically certain.\"  Id.  Although we expressed our inclination \"to conclude that a showing of knowledge anywhere along this continuum satisfies application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A),\" we declined to determine the exact level of knowledge required for the guideline.  Id. at 1257-58 (finding that government had established the somewhat high standard of defendant's awareness that the requisite risk was \"practically certain\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the district court here actually found that the defendants acted knowingly when they created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to someone other than themselves, we likely would have upheld the finding as not clearly erroneous, even under the stringent \"practically certain\" test.  The evidence established that the defendants set fire to a building basement in the early hours of a winter morning, knowing that the residential units above were occupied.  \"It is difficult to imagine a clearer illustration of the knowing creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"  United States v. Honeycutt, 8 F.3d 785, 787 (11th Cir.1993) (finding requisite level of knowledge where defendant, having seen people inside tavern, threw a Molotov cocktail at the outside corner of the building) (using \"practically certain\" test).  The sentencing court, however, must make such a finding in the first instance, and we will not engage in that initial exercise on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we remand this case for findings and resentencing, we think it necessary to clarify further the definition of \"knowingly\" appearing in subsection (a)(1), but not (a)(2), of the arson guideline.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4.  The guideline's structure \"clearly suggests that there must be a meaningful distinction between the two sections.\"  DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1256.   As we noted in DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1257, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have adopted the Model Penal Code's definition of \"knowingly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  In those circuits, \"a defendant can be found to have 'knowingly' created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury under &#167; 2K1.4 only if the defendant was aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from the criminal act.\"  Karlic, 997 F.2d at 569 (emphasis added);  accord Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787;  see also Model Penal Code &#167; 202(2)(b) (1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with our sister circuits that the Model Penal Code's definition gives due regard to the \"meaningful distinction\" between the pertinent guideline sections. Indeed, we have already held that a \"practically certain\" finding, which is akin to, but something less than, actual knowledge,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> satisfies the definition of \"knowingly.\"  DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1257-58.   Thus, we adopt the Model Penal Code absent a contrary guidelines definition.  We acknowledge our earlier inclination to include all gradations of the knowledge continuum in this context.  Id. at 1257.   To the extent, however, that \"constructive knowledge\" requires only that the defendant either have had a \"notice of likelihood\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> or \"should have known\" of a substantial risk, see id. at 1257-58 n. 30;  Spinney, 65 F.3d at 236-37, we now think something more is needed.  For the purposes of the arson guideline, these particular \"constructive knowledge\" formulations appear to establish only \"recklessness\" or \"negligence,\" both insufficient to trigger the higher base offense level.  See DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court should articulate specific findings of each defendant's state of mind regarding the creation of the risk.  In order for the higher offense level to apply, the court certainly need not find that the defendants \"purposefully\" or \"intentionally\" created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.  Rather, the court need find only that Virgilio and Santo actually knew that they created such risk, or were aware that the risk was practically certain.  If, on the other hand, the court supportably finds that one or both of them actually believed that no substantial risk was created under the circumstances, a finding of knowledge would not be warranted.  See DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1257 n. 29 (citing Model Penal Code &#167; 2.02(7)(1985), which provides that a defendant's actual belief in the nonexistence of a fact precludes knowledge finding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendants' convictions, vacate their sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the end of the government's case, Santo and Virgilio Ruiz moved for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.

See United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d 986, 997-98 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 291 (1st Cir.1992).  Thus, in reviewing the defendants' sufficiency of the evidence challenge, we consider, in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence presented in the defense case.  See 2 Charles A.

Like the district court, we \"must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and credibility questions in the prosecution's favor,\" and, among competing plausible inferences, we \"must choose the inference that best fits the prosecution's theory of guilt.\"  Id.

Pre-Fire Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1990, defendant Santo Ruiz opened a retail business named Brothers Fashions and Multiple Services (\"Brothers Fashions\"), in the basement area of a three-story residential duplex.  Three of Santo's brothers, Pablo, Frederico, and co-defendant Virgilio Ruiz, shared an apartment directly above the store.  The duplex comprised six residential apartments occupied by a total of sixteen residents, including the building's owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo borrowed $10,000 from another brother, William Ruiz, as the start-up capital for the store;  additionally, Santo incurred a debt of $4000 to William for the store's fixtures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The $14,000 debt remained unpaid in its entirety through the time of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The store sold sundry items, including clothing, shoes, blankets, cosmetics, household products, music albums and cassettes, beverages and candy.  Santo obtained the store's merchandise for cash from a variety of sources located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Florida, and California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virgilio Ruiz spent much time at the store and frequently assisted Santo, who did not speak English, with needed language interpretation.  Although Santo was the putative owner of Brothers Fashions, the evidence suggests that Santo and Virgilio represented to others a joint ownership and responsibility for the store.  For example, both Santo and Virgilio signed the lease for the space as well as the business certificate filed with the City of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early September 1990, Santo and Virgilio negotiated for the installation of a store security alarm and jointly signed the agreement with the alarm monitoring service.  The alarm, which could detect heat and motion, was designed primarily to trigger when a burglar entered the premises after hours;  a sufficient amount of smoke from fire could also trigger a response.  The alarm, however, would not operate unless the subscriber activated the system by entering the proper pass code.  About two weeks before the fire, Santo ceased activating the alarm system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early November 1990, approximately nine months after Brothers Fashions opened and about six weeks before the fire, Santo and Virgilio obtained $40,000's worth of insurance coverage for the store's contents.  During discussions with the insurance agent, the defendants specifically asked about the processing and payment of loss claims.  Although such information was not a usual part of the agent's initial discussions about insurance coverage, in response to this inquiry, he explained that receipts and cancelled checks would be required to prove a loss.  Virgilio, representing Brothers Fashions, signed an insurance finance agreement.  Coverage began shortly thereafter when the brothers tendered a down payment of approximately $750.  The payment schedule provided that a first installment of approximately $250 would fall due on December 20, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo kept in his possession most of the time the only set of keys to Brothers Fashions.  Before closing the business each day, Santo would secure the store-front with three heavy metal security shutters, each fastened with two padlocks.  The store's back door, which was rarely opened, measured three-feet wide by four-feet tall and could be opened only from the inside of the store.  It was secured on the inside with a sliding lock and at least one wooden cross-bar laid across the door.  An outer iron grate, locked from the inside with a padlock, further secured the back door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than two days before the fire, Brothers Fashions was fully stocked with merchandise displayed on clothing racks, shelves, and in display cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Fire</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 2:00 a.m. on Sunday, December 16, 1990, a fire raged through Brothers Fashions. The close proximity of the store to a fire station resulted in near immediate response.  Nonetheless, the blaze was serious enough to warrant the services of some seventy fire department personnel and over one dozen fire vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arriving at the scene, fire-fighters encountered the metal security shutters lying in the street in front of the store;  the shutters apparently had been blown off the storefront by a powerful explosion.  A fire-fighter in the first group to reach the back of the building noticed the store's back door standing open with flames shooting out from the basement.  The fire-fighters extinguished the fire without forcible entry of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, when a store stocked with clothing burns, piles of clothing in various stages of ruin remain.  After the fire at Brothers Fashions was suppressed, however, a casual inspection of the damaged store revealed very little burned or charred merchandise;  rather, all that was visible were a few beverage bottles, some canned goods and minimal charred foodstuffs.  The dearth of charred merchandise and the complete absence of clothing remnants in the store evince that it was nearly empty when it burned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the apartment tenants, except Virgilio, escaped unharmed from the burning building.  None of the tenants, including Virgilio, required fire-fighter assistance to evacuate.  Virgilio suffered second and third degree burns on his ankles, a severe cut above his left eye, and large bruises below his left eye and across his chest.  An ambulance carried him from the scene to the hospital, where he remained for eighteen days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Post-Fire Events</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent investigation revealed that the fire originated in two distinct locations within the store and burned in an unusual manner.  Specifically, the burn pattern indicated that an accelerant, such as gasoline, had been poured over a counter and other areas.  The building's electrical and natural gas distribution systems showed no sign of having caused or contributed to the fire.  Following the fire, Boston Gas Company, the natural gas provider for the building, conducted a search of its records for the period from 1984 through the time of the fire for any reports of gas leak repairs at the building.  The search revealed nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime within the first two weeks after the fire, John Greenaway, who had been hired for carpentry work on the premises, opened up the boarded-up store so that Santo could retrieve an empty clothes rack.  In January 1991, Santo and Virgilio prepared, jointly signed and submitted a claim to their insurer--via certified mail--asserting a contents loss of some $48,000.  The claim detailed various items of store merchandise and fixtures, including thousands of dollars' worth of men's and women's clothing, curtains, shoes, blankets, music albums and cassettes, videos, watches, candy, household items and toys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the insurance agent's earlier advice and the insurance company's request, the defendants did not submit any receipts, invoices, or other records to support their claim of loss.  Instead, the defendants claimed that the fire destroyed all such records and submitted a couple of photographs purporting to represent the store merchandise at the time of the fire and a cancelled check from Virgilio's bank account for approximately $15 in cigarette tax.  When asked by the insurance company, Santo could not recall the names of any of his retail merchandise suppliers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At various times before trial, Virgilio related his version of the fire events to his attending physician, a Boston Fire Department investigator, and, in a sworn deposition, representatives of the insurance company.  He professed a general inability to recall clearly and gave somewhat inconsistent accounts of the fire events.  To the extent Virgilio's various stories overlap, they indicate that:  he awoke in the first floor apartment to the smell of smoke, went to the living room to check the gas heater and saw smoke coming through the floor;  he then heard an explosion and ran to awaken his sleeping brothers (Pablo and Frederico) to warn them of the fire;  he picked up the telephone to call the fire department, but the line was dead;  he proceeded to run out the front hallway of the duplex and down the stairs toward the building's front exit;  on his way out to the sidewalk in front of the duplex, another explosion occurred and his \"fuzzy\" socks caught on fire, causing the injuries to his ankles;  at some point, he ran into a door--perhaps the front door of the apartment unit--causing his bruises and the severe cut above his eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. The Defendants' Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants presented a joint defense, calling to the stand members of the Ruiz family:  Pablo, Frederico, Santo, and Rosa (Santo's wife).  Pablo and Frederico testified that, on the night of the fire, Virgilio went to bed around midnight, and they retired soon thereafter.  They stated that Virgilio later woke them up because of the fire.  Frederico testified that he then dressed quickly and proceeded out the front door.  As he descended the front stairs, he met Virgilio, who was bleeding from his forehead and down his face.  Frederico and Virgilio ran out the front of the building together.  Frederico was not injured--by flame or otherwise--as he exited.  Upon reaching the sidewalk in front of the building, he noticed fire coming out of the basement store.  Frederico said that he then told the fire-fighters that Pablo was still inside the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pablo testified that his only avenue of escape from the burning building was the apartment's back door.  He stated that when he exited the building, he observed two firefighters, who, he says, had been attempting to pry open the apartment's back door to let him out.  Both Pablo and Frederico testified that they saw fire-fighters force open the store's back door, which, they claimed, had been closed.  They further claimed that, upon the opening of the back door--which measured four-feet by three-feet--fire-fighters emerged from within the store wearing full fire-fighting regalia, including oxygen tanks and masks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo testified in his defense.  He explained that he initially did not insure the contents of the Brothers Fashions because he wanted first to see how the business fared.  He testified that only he knew the alarm pass code, and that he failed to activate the alarm for several weeks before the fire because of the recurrence of false alarms.  He had deduced that rats entering the store after hours (to eat candy) triggered the alarm, and he wanted to \"kill\" the rodents before further engaging the alarm.  He testified that he complained about the rats to both the owner and to Greenaway, who, in turn, testified that Santo had never complained to him about a rat problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo suggested that a natural gas explosion may have contributed to the fire.  Specifically, he claimed that about one month before the fire, he called Boston Gas because he smelled a natural gas leak;  contrary to other trial testimony, he claimed that Boston Gas personnel then came out to the store and fixed the leak.  Santo further testified that there may have been paint and paint thinner in the store, as well as household detergents, that might have acted as an accelerant for the fire and would account for the peculiar burn patterns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo testified that on December 15, 1990, the day before the fire, the store was fully stocked.  That night, he explained, he had closed the store between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. and secured the front entrance.  He insisted that he left the back door fully secured and that he retained in his possession the only set of store keys.  He then went to his home in Dorchester.  The next morning, around 6:00 a.m., he received a call at home informing him of the fire.  He walked to the store (his car was not operational), arriving around 8:00 a.m..</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo further testified that, upon his arrival at the fire scene, he saw ten to fifteen people in and around the burned store, including people from Boston Gas, and Greenaway's son.  He said the people were removing half-burned items from the store.  He admitted at trial that he had never previously mentioned his observance of the looters, even to the insurance company.  He also testified that he did not attempt to stop the looting because the merchandise taken was, in any event, ruined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santo admitted that, although he did not speak or understand English and had to rely on Virgilio for translation, he fully understood his actions when he signed the lease to the store, the business certificate, the alarm system contract, and the insurance claim for $48,000 in lost inventory.  Santo denied removing, or asking anyone to remove, the merchandise from Brothers Fashions before the fire.  He also denied lighting the fire or asking anyone to light the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants painted a picture of a prosperous store that earned some $600 to $1000 in retail sales per day, suggesting the absence of a motive to collect insurance proceeds.  The defendants also attempted to establish the bias of various trial witnesses.  For example, they produced (contradicted) evidence of the unlawful absence of smoke detectors in the duplex, suggesting that the owner had her own motive to collect insurance proceeds.  The defendants also suggested that the carpenter Greenaway was biased because he had married the owner's niece in 1990 and, upon the owner's death, the owner's niece stood to inherit the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Alternatively, to convict Santo of the substantive arson offense, the government had to establish that Virgilio's setting of the fire was a foreseeable act done in furtherance of their unlawful conspiracy.  See Pinkerton v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 647, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See United States v. Sawyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196785\"><a href=\"/opinion/196785/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 742 (1st Cir.1996).  \"The agreement need not be explicit;  a tacit agreement will suffice.\"  Id.  To establish voluntary participation, the government must prove both the intent to agree and the intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.  See id.   Of course, direct evidence is not required to prove either the agreement (which may be inferred from circumstances) or the defendants' participation in it.  See id.;  United States v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1300 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence more than adequately established that someone deliberately torched Brothers Fashions with the aid of an accelerant.  Further, there is little question that the store was used in an activity affecting interstate commerce both because it was a rental property, and because the merchandise purchased for resale moved in interstate commerce.  See United States v. DiSanto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196811\"><a href=\"/opinion/196811/united-states-v-disanto/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span>, 1247-48 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that \"rental property is per se sufficiently connected to interstate commerce\" for purposes of &#167; 844(i)) (explaining further that the jurisdictional element is met where restaurant received food supplies that travelled in interstate commerce);  see also Russell v.

We note that the case against the defendants is largely circumstantial.  Circumstantial evidence does not represent the proposition in question, but asserts \" 'something else, from which the trier of fact may either (i) reasonably infer the truth of the proposition, ... or (ii) at least reasonably infer an increase in the probability that the proposition is in fact true.' \"  U.S. v. Clotida, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534522\"><a href=\"/opinion/534522/united-states-v-erwin-pascacio-clotida-united-states-of-america-v-olivia/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span>, 1104 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting 1 D. Louisell &amp; C. Mueller,  Federal Evidence &#167; 94 (1977)).  Although circumstantial evidence requires an inferential step in its proof, there is \"no legal distinction\" between circumstantial and direct evidence in the context of a Rule 29 motion.  Id.;  see Olbres, 61 F.3d at 971.   We recognize that \"the government's proof may lay entirely in circumstantial evidence,\" United States v. Valerio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195933\"><a href=\"/opinion/195933/united-states-v-valerio/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 63-64 (1st Cir.1995);  we are, however, \"loath to stack inference upon inference in order to uphold the jury's verdict.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government produced direct evidence that Santo had in his possession the only keys to the store on the night of the fire, that the store's back door, rarely opened, was open at the time of the fire, and that Brothers Fashions had been emptied of almost all merchandise at that time.  The jury thus could rationally infer that, because only Santo had the means to access the store that evening, he opened the back door from the inside of the store sometime before the fire.  Santo's exclusive access also permits the conclusion that he was involved with the removal of the store's merchandise before the fire.  The jury could infer that his new and uncorroborated testimony about looters was a fabrication to account for the lost merchandise--a fabrication intended to cover up his knowledge of and involvement in its removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could conclude that Santo lied when he testified that he discontinued activating the security alarm shortly before the fire because of rats.  From this untruth, the jury could infer that Santo's unexpressed reason for failing to engage the alarm was to nullify its ability to detect both the removal of merchandise and the fire.  The jury could further find that Santo lied when he stated that he left the store's back door secured on the night of the fire and that, in fact, he left it open for Virgilio to set the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could rationally infer that Virgilio personally set fire to Brothers Fashions.  Virgilio, the only apartment tenant injured by the fire, had severe burns on his ankles, consistent with direct and prolonged exposure to flame;  yet Frederico, who exited the building in the same manner and through the same area as claimed by Virgilio, testified that he was not injured in any manner and that he did not encounter any fire until he reached the sidewalk in front of the building, where he viewed the fire emanating from the store.  The jury could also choose not to credit Virgilio's unembellished and confused account of the cause of the injuries to his face and body and infer that, in fact, he suffered those injuries escaping the store (perhaps out the small back door) after lighting the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could further find that Santo lied when testifying that:  (1) he had nothing to do with the removal of the store's contents, (2) he observed looters at the store the morning after the fire, and (3) Boston Gas repaired a gas leak at the store one month before the fire.  The jury could also conclude that Virgilio lied about the source of his injuries.  Lies such as these legitimately support a finding of guilt.  See United States v. Hadfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551471\"><a href=\"/opinion/551471/united-states-v-royal-w-hadfield-jr-united-states-of-america-v-helen/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir.1990) (finding inference of guilt could have been bolstered by defendant's \"tall tale\");  United States v.

Moreover, the jury could have given due weight to the fact that the defendants did not have insurance for the first nine months of the store's operation, obtained it only six weeks before the fire, and expressed peculiar concern about claim payments and proof of loss requirements.  Further, the fire occurred just four days before the due date of the first installment payment, but after the down payment had already triggered coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, although not overwhelming, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Santo and Virgilio conspired to set afire Brothers Fashions, (2) Virgilio set the fire, (3) Santo assisted Virgilio in this task by providing access to the store and by failing to engage the alarm, and (4) Santo reasonably could foresee that Virgilio would set the fire in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Although the evidence does not compel a finding of guilt, it need not \"exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except guilt.\"  United States v. Laboy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545478\"><a href=\"/opinion/545478/united-states-v-maribel-laboy-aka-jennifer-morales-mary-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 588 (1st Cir.1990).  The jury was \"free to choose among reasonable constructions of evidence,\" id., and the trial evidence, as a whole, permits a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See id.   We cannot say that the jury's verdict on the arson and conspiracy counts was irrational.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Mail Fraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little discussion of this count is necessary.  To prove mail fraud, the government must establish:  \"(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails ... in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723.   There was more than adequate evidence to prove that Santo and Virgilio intentionally agreed to collect insurance proceeds fraudulently, and together submitted, by mail, a false insurance claim for merchandise they knew had not been lost in the fire.  We will not disturb the jury's verdict on this count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants alternatively challenge the district court's denial of their new trial motions, claiming that, on the weight of the evidence, their convictions constituted a miscarriage of justice.  A district court's power to order a new trial is greater than its power to grant a motion for acquittal.  See United States v. Rothrock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480164\"><a href=\"/opinion/480164/united-states-v-albert-h-rothrock-and-vivian-s-rothrock/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span>, 318 (1st Cir.1986).  In considering a new trial motion, the court may consider both the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses.  See id. at 321.   Where a new trial motion is based upon the weight of the evidence, the court may not order a new trial \"unless it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result.\"   See id. at 322 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We review the district court's ruling on a new trial motion for abuse of discretion.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, the trial evidence was in conflict.  The jury, however, was not compelled to credit Virgilio's account of the manner in which he was injured, or Pablo and Frederico's testimony that fire-fighters forcibly entered the store's back door.  The jury could have agreed with Virgilio's argument that, given the evident powerful explosion in the store, his injuries would have been more severe, or worse, he would not have survived had he been the arsonist.  The jury was warranted, however, in rejecting this theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strongest competing theory of innocence concerns Santo's involvement in the arson.  Put simply, the jury could have reasonably found that Santo knew nothing of the fire before its occurrence, but acted as an accessory after the fact both to protect Virgilio and to profit from fraudulently obtained insurance proceeds.  Santo insisted in his testimony, however, that he had the only means of access to the store on the night of the fire and that he left the back door secured that evening.  In contrast, the government produced direct, credible evidence that the back door was not closed at the time of the fire;  while the jury might have found that Virgilio opened the door, or, perhaps, that the explosion blew the door open (although no witness opined as such), given Santo's staunch refusal to allow for the possibility that someone else may have had access to the store, the jury could and did plausibly find that Santo opened the door.  The evidence that Santo obtained insurance coverage and disengaged the alarm shortly before the fire constitutes further proof of his prior knowledge of, and involvement in, the arson-for-profit scheme.  Finally, other than generally to deny any involvement with the arson, Santo's trial testimony did nothing to support the theory that he was an unwitting dupe in Virgilio's criminal plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The largely circumstantial nature of the proof in this case gave rise to competing plausible inferences, some pointing to guilt and others to innocence.  The jury is charged with choosing between such inferences, see Olbres, 61 F.3d at 972, and, having had the opportunity to observe Santo's trial testimony and demeanor, it saw fit to convict him on all counts.  While reasonable people could have found otherwise, \"a trial judge is not a thirteenth juror who may set aside a verdict merely because he would have reached a different result.\"  Rothrock, 806 F.2d at 322.   Because we cannot say the jury reached a seriously erroneous result, we find no abuse of discretion in the court's carefully considered refusal to grant Santo or Virgilio a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Jury Composition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, Virgilio complains of the absence of minority jury members, suggesting an unconstitutionally disproportionate ethnic representation in the jury venire.  We consider Virgilio's unadorned and perfunctory appellate arguments waived.  See United States v.

Some context is in order.  Pablo testified that, although he received many years of education in the Dominican Republic and earned an advanced degree in agriculture, he could not find work in the United States because he did not speak English.  When later asked by the prosecutor how he could remember at trial the time he went to bed on the night of the fire (some three-and-a-half years earlier) Pablo replied, \"Well, if I can remember what I studied during 23 years, I should be able to remember a part of what happened that night.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further questioning about the fire events, during which Pablo's credibility was called into question by various inconsistencies, the prosecutor rekindled the subject of Pablo's inability to find agricultural work in the United States.

While, however, the inquiries may have been of borderline relevance and materiality, it was Pablo who initially offered the explanation that his inability to speak English precluded his employment in the field for which he was most qualified.  Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the prosecutor impermissibly injected into the trial a harmful appeal to any ethnic bias in the jury by asking these two questions.

In its post-trial order, the district court found that, \"while the prosecutor's closing argument was loudly and passionately delivered, it did not exceed the bounds of propriety.\"   Having failed on appeal to develop his argument or explain, with any detail, how the prosecutor's conduct prejudiced the trial, Virgilio cannot prevail on this challenge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>:  Use of Fire to Commit Federal Felony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also challenge their convictions and sentences under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1), which provides, in relevant part:  \"Whoever ... uses fire or an explosive to commit any [federal] felony ... shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years but not more than 15 years....\"  The indictment charged Santo and Virgilio with using fire to commit mail fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.  The defendants claim, however, that \"fire\" was not used \"to commit\" mail fraud, but rather, the \"mailing of articles\" was used to commit mail fraud.  They contend that fire may have been used to commit the arson, \"but it was not the letter, envelope or stamp, or handwriting/printing/typing used to commit mail fraud.\"   In the past, we have implicitly assumed the legal conclusion that defendants now challenge.

The selection between this base offense level and the lower level (20) set forth in the subsequent section, &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2), depends upon either the defendant's mens rea (i.e., whether or not it was \"knowing\") in creating the requisite risk, or the type of structure involved, i.e., dwelling or non-dwelling.  If the fire involved a dwelling, the selection between the base offense levels depends on whether the defendant destroyed (or attempted to destroy) it, or merely endangered it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants offered two rationales to the district court in support of an application of a base offense level of 20:(1) it is inconceivable that they would intentionally create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to their family members living directly above Brothers Fashions;  and (2) they did not destroy or attempt to destroy a dwelling, but rather, a store;  and the upstairs residences, only minimally damaged, were merely \"endangered\" incidentally to the arson offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government countered that a base offense level of 24 was warranted because, under the first prong of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1), the defendants had only to \"knowingly,\" not \"intentionally,\" create the risk of death or injury.  Moreover, the government argued, the defendants satisfied the \"knowingly\" requirement because they committed the arson at a time when they knew residents were in the very building to which they set fire.  The government argued further that the second prong of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) warranted a level 24 because the defendants destroyed or attempted to destroy a dwelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court observed that a pivotal question revolved around the meaning of the word \"knowingly.\"  &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A).  The court opined that the definition of \"knowingly\" was \"a little bit ambiguous\" in the context of the arson guideline.  It first observed that, \"[o]bjectively, a rational person perhaps should know that if he set the gasoline fire in the basement, people living above would be injured.\"   The court, however, further stated that if it interpreted \"knowingly\" as \"intentionally,\" it did not believe that Virgilio Ruiz intentionally put his brothers in danger;  instead, the court observed, \"I think subjectively he may have had the foolish, but sincere belief that this fire could be started, that everybody could be quickly evacuated or even that the dwelling where they lived would not be destroyed, just the store would be.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court then concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

It seems to me this is a [case] which generally falls between the two provisions, [&#167; 2K1.4](a)(1) and (a)(2), essentially for the reasons [stated above].  And I think the fairest and legal[ly] most appropriate thing to do in the circumstances would be to interpolate and I'm going to rate this as a 22.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the defendants contend that the district court erroneously \"interpolated\" when applying the arson guideline.  They argue that if the court found inapplicable &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1), it should have affixed the lower base offense level provided for in &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2), rather than apply an intermediate level.  The government does not appeal the sentences as calculated, but nonetheless argues that the higher base offense level was clearly appropriate and that the defendants, who benefitted from the court's \"interpolation\" exercise, have no basis for complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's use of \"interpolation\" to affix an intermediate base offense level was an apparent attempt to invoke a paragraph (now deleted) in the Introduction to the pre-November 1989 Guidelines Manual.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 1A4(b) (1987).  The Sentencing Commission had designated \"interpolation\" as a form of departure in which a sentencing court could choose an intermediate point \"between two adjacent, numerically oriented guidelines rules.\"  Id.  Effective November 1, 1989, however, the Commission deleted that interpolation provision, concluding \"that it is simpler to add intermediate offense level adjustments to the guidelines where interpolation is most likely to be considered.\"  U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 68 (1989).  The Commission also stated, however:  \"This amendment is not intended to preclude interpolation in other cases;  where appropriate, the court will be able to achieve the same result by use of the regular departure provisions.\"  Id.  Thus, although the issue is somewhat unclear, it appears that interpolation between guideline rules is permissible where it could be properly justified under the normal departure procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the court essentially effected a downward departure when affixing a base offense level of 22, we find that because the district court failed to make specific findings on the defendants' state of mind, we are unable to resolve either the defendants' contention that the facts warranted a level 20, or the government's argument that a level 24 was appropriate.  Our inability to settle the sentencing issue absent such findings requires us to remand the case for further findings and resentencing.  See United States v.

In this case, the court explored the various possibilities of a \"knowledge\" finding, opining first that a rational person would know that setting such a fire would cause injury, then observing that Virgilio did not \"intentionally\" put others in danger because he \"may\" have had the \"foolish but sincere belief\" in a swift evacuation of the residents.  In the end, the court did not make any specific findings on either of the defendants' state of mind but, instead, resorted to interpolation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reluctance to make the requisite findings may have been the result of the somewhat unsettled definition in this circuit of the term \"knowingly\" in the arson guideline.

We explained that \" 'the hypothetical knowledge continuum' is marked by 'constructive knowledge' at one end and 'actual knowledge' at the other.\"  Id. at 1257 (quoting United States v.

In between these extremes lie various \"gradations,\" including \"notice of likelihood\" and \"practically certain.\"  Id.  Although we expressed our inclination \"to conclude that a showing of knowledge anywhere along this continuum satisfies application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A),\" we declined to determine the exact level of knowledge required for the guideline.

The evidence established that the defendants set fire to a building basement in the early hours of a winter morning, knowing that the residential units above were occupied.  \"It is difficult to imagine a clearer illustration of the knowing creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"  United States v.

The sentencing court, however, must make such a finding in the first instance, and we will not engage in that initial exercise on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we remand this case for findings and resentencing, we think it necessary to clarify further the definition of \"knowingly\" appearing in subsection (a)(1), but not (a)(2), of the arson guideline.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4.  The guideline's structure \"clearly suggests that there must be a meaningful distinction between the two sections.\"  DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1256.   As we noted in DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1257, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have adopted the Model Penal Code's definition of \"knowingly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  In those circuits, \"a defendant can be found to have 'knowingly' created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury under &#167; 2K1.4 only if the defendant was aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from the criminal act.\"  Karlic, 997 F.2d at 569 (emphasis added);  accord Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787;  see also Model Penal Code &#167; 202(2)(b) (1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with our sister circuits that the Model Penal Code's definition gives due regard to the \"meaningful distinction\" between the pertinent guideline sections. Indeed, we have already held that a \"practically certain\" finding, which is akin to, but something less than, actual knowledge,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> satisfies the definition of \"knowingly.\"  DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1257-58.   Thus, we adopt the Model Penal Code absent a contrary guidelines definition.  We acknowledge our earlier inclination to include all gradations of the knowledge continuum in this context.  Id. at 1257.   To the extent, however, that \"constructive knowledge\" requires only that the defendant either have had a \"notice of likelihood\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> or \"should have known\" of a substantial risk, see id. at 1257-58 n. 30;  Spinney, 65 F.3d at 236-37, we now think something more is needed.  For the purposes of the arson guideline, these particular \"constructive knowledge\" formulations appear to establish only \"recklessness\" or \"negligence,\" both insufficient to trigger the higher base offense level.  See DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court should articulate specific findings of each defendant's state of mind regarding the creation of the risk.  In order for the higher offense level to apply, the court certainly need not find that the defendants \"purposefully\" or \"intentionally\" created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.  Rather, the court need find only that Virgilio and Santo actually knew that they created such risk, or were aware that the risk was practically certain.  If, on the other hand, the court supportably finds that one or both of them actually believed that no substantial risk was created under the circumstances, a finding of knowledge would not be warranted.  See DiSanto, 86 F.3d at 1257 n. 29 (citing Model Penal Code &#167; 2.02(7)(1985), which provides that a defendant's actual belief in the nonexistence of a fact precludes knowledge finding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendants' convictions, vacate their sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the end of the government's case, Santo and Virgilio Ruiz moved for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.  Because the defendants presented evidence in their defense after the denial of the initial motion, they are deemed to have waived review of the earlier motion.  See United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196221\"><a href=\"/opinion/196221/united-states-v-de-la-cruz-paulino/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span>, 997-98 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Thus, in reviewing the defendants' sufficiency of the evidence challenge, we consider, in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence presented in the defense case.  See 2 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 463, at 643-45 (1982)</p>\n        <p>We note also that although defendants' motions for acquittal and new trial were filed more than seven days after the verdicts were rendered and the jury discharged, the motions were timely because, within that seven-day period, the district court extended the time allowable for making the motions.

Further, to the extent Virgilio submits new evidence in support of his request for new trial, that evidence must be brought to the attention of the district court in the first instance, either in a timely motion pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, or on a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We also note that the government has frequently charged a &#167; 844(h)(1) offense in connection with mail fraud, specifically where a defendant sought to secure insurance proceeds for property he had burned.

See H.R.Rep.

The court observed that the circumstances of the arson appeared to involve the destruction of the store, and the endangering, but not the destruction, of the dwelling.  In the apparent absence of an intent to destroy the whole building, the court impliedly found the \"attempted destruction\" alternative also inapplicable.

The court declined the government's request to increase Santo's offense level by two points for perjury.

Virgilio's base offense level remained at 22, which, combined with a criminal history category I and the added 60 month consecutive term, yielded a total range of 93-111 months.
