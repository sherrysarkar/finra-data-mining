Peckrill,  Assistant\r                                                                  \r\nRegional  Counsel,  Social  Security  Administration,  on   brief  for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.    Claimant  Carmen  Rivera  filed  an\r                                 \r\n\napplication for Social Security disability benefits  on March\r\n\n28, 1991, alleging  an onset date of November 28,  1988.  The\r\n\napplication was denied on August 8, 1991 and claimant did not\r\n\nseek reconsideration.   Instead, she filed  a new application\r\n\non January 21, 1993, alleging the same onset date and listing\r\n\nas  impairments  a herniated  disc  and  nerves.   Claimant's\r\n\ninsured   status  expired   on   December  31,   1993.     An\r\n\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) held a hearing in October 1993\r\n\nat which claimant and a vocational expert (VE) testified.\r\n\n          The ALJ first  determined not to  reopen claimant's\r\n\ninitial application with the result  that he did not consider\r\n\nevidence from the time period  prior to August 8, 1991.   The\r\n\nALJ  then   decided  that   claimant  suffered   from  severe\r\n\nuncontrolled arterial  hypertension, a small  herniated disc,\r\n\ncostochondritis,   and  an   affective   disorder.      These\r\n\nconditions, the ALJ opined, prevented her from performing her\r\n\npast  work  as  a  meat  packager,  a  job  requiring  medium\r\n\nexertion.    Further,  the   ALJ  stated  that  claimant  was\r\n\nprohibited  from performing  complex  or  detailed tasks  and\r\n\nengaging  in work  in which  she could  not change  position.\r\n\nUsing the  grid as a framework  and the testimony of  the VE,\r\n\nthe ALJ  nonetheless concluded that there  were other, light-\r\n\nduty jobs which claimant could perform.  The  Appeals Council\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndenied claimant's  request for review and  the district court\r\n\naffirmed this decision.\r\n\n          Claimant argues on  appeal that the  ALJ's decision\r\n\nnot to  reopen her first application  for disability benefits\r\n\nis reviewable.  \"Absent a colorable constitutional claim  . .\r\n\n. a district court  does not have jurisdiction to  review the\r\n\nSecretary's discretionary decision  not to reopen an  earlier\r\n\nadjudication.\"    Torres v.  Secretary  of  Health and  Human\r                                                                         \r\n\nServices, 845 F.2d  1136, 1138 (1st  Cir. 1988) (per  curiam)\r                    \r\n\n(citing  cases).   To  come within  this exception,  claimant\r\n\nasserts that the determination not to reopen violated her due\r\n\nprocess  rights because the ALJ  never had held  a hearing on\r\n\nher first request  for benefits.  However,  claimant does not\r\n\nassert  that she was denied the opportunity for a hearing and\r\n\nit does not appear that she requested one.  We  have held, in\r\n\nsimilar circumstances,  that such  a claim is  not colorable.\r\n\nSee Matos v. Secretary of HEW, 581 F.2d 282, 284-86 (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1978).  Thus, we  consider, as did the ALJ, only the evidence\r\n\nfor  the period  after August  8,  1991 through  December 31,\r\n\n1993.\r\n\n          1.    Back Condition.   Although  claimant received\r                                          \r\n\ntreatment for  her back  at the  State Insurance  Fund during\r\n\n1988 and  1989, there are no records of any treatment for the\r\n\nperiod  1990  through 1993.    The  other  evidence  for  the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nrelevant   time   --  consultative   examinations,   two  RFC\r\n\nassessments, and a report from claimant's  treating physician\r\n\n-- is conflicting.\r\n\n          For example, Dr.  Roberto Leon Perez,  an internist\r\n\nand  rheumatologist, performed a  consultative examination in\r\n\nJuly 1991.  He reported that claimant could walk on her toes,\r\n\nbut  that  her  flexion/extension was  somewhat  limited  (70\r\n\ndegrees).    An  x-ray  showed  (1)  narrowing of  the  L4-L5\r\n\nintervertebral   space,   (2)    narrowing   of   the   L5-S1\r\n\nintervertebral  space  associated with  posterior spondylosis\r\n\n(fusion of  a vertebral joint), (3)  facet joint degenerative\r\n\ndisease at L5-S1, and  (4) reversal of normal lordosis.   The\r\n\ndiagnosis was herniated disc by history.\r\n\n          The other consultative examination was performed in\r\n\nMarch 1993 by Dr.  Phillip Bonneaux.  At this  time, claimant\r\n\nhad  normal  muscle tone  and strength.    Her gait  also was\r\n\nnormal and she had full  range of motion of her back.   There\r\n\nwere moderate  spasms of the paravertebral muscles.  An x-ray\r\n\nshowed  slight   scoliosis  and  minimal  spondylosis.    The\r\n\ndiagnosis  was  moderate  paravertebral muscle  spasm.    Dr.\r\n\nBonneaux concluded that claimant could sit, stand, walk, lift\r\n\nand carry without limitation.\r\n\n          The  two  non-examining  physicians  who  completed\r\n\nresidual functional capacity (RFC) assessments in 1993 agreed\r\n\nthat claimant retained the weight-lifting capacity consistent\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nwith light work.   They also agreed that claimant  could sit,\r\n\nstand and walk for  up to six hours each per  day.  She could\r\n\noccasionally  climb,  stoop,  crouch  and  crawl,  and  could\r\n\nfrequently kneel.\r\n\n          Although   claimant's   treating   physician,   Dr.\r\n\nFrancisco Sanchez, gave a significantly more restrictive view\r\n\nof claimant's RFC,  the ALJ  was not required  to credit  it.\r\n\nSee  20 C.F.R.    404.1527(d)(2)  (if a  treating physician's\r               \r\n\nopinion  is inconsistent with  the other substantial evidence\r\n\nin the record, controlling  weight need not be given  to that\r\n\nopinion).    Thus,   the  medical  findings   outlined  above\r\n\nsufficiently support the ALJ's conclusion that claimant could\r\n\nperform light work.  See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman Services, 647 F.2d 218,  222 (1st Cir. 1981) (conflicts\r                          \r\n\nare for the Secretary to resolve).\r\n\n          2.  High Blood Pressure.  There are only two pieces\r                                             \r\n\nof evidence  relating to  claimant's high blood  pressure for\r\n\nthe relevant period.   First, claimant's  treating physician,\r\n\nDr. Sanchez, reported that  he began seeing claimant  in 1985\r\n\nfor high  blood pressure.   During the  course of  treatment,\r\n\nclaimant  experienced  dizzy  spells  and chest  pain.    Dr.\r\n\nSanchez  opined  that   claimant's  prognosis  was   guarded.\r\n\nHowever, he did not  specify any limits on the  activities in\r\n\nwhich  claimant could  engage.   Second,  Dr. Bonneaux,  in a\r\n\nchest   pain  questionnaire,   stated  that  the   origin  of\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nclaimant's  chest  pain  was  musculoskeletal.   Although  he\r\n\nopined  that claimant's blood  pressure should be controlled,\r\n\nhe  also did  not  list  any  limitations  on  the  kinds  of\r\n\nactivities  in which  she could engage.   Given  the complete\r\n\ndearth of evidence  that this condition limited  the kinds of\r\n\nwork-related activities  in which claimant could  engage, the\r\n\nrecord  is  more than  adequate  to  support the  Secretary's\r\n\ndecision.  See id.\r                              \r\n\n          3.   Emotional Condition.  As  with claimant's back\r                                              \r\n\ncondition, the  evidence concerning the  effect of claimant's\r\n\nmental  impairment   is  conflicting.    Dr.   Luis  Toro,  a\r\n\npsychiatrist,  conducted  three  evaluations   of  claimant's\r\n\nmental  status.  In the first two reports, Dr. Toro described\r\n\nclaimant as  being in contact with  reality, with appropriate\r\n\naffect.   She was oriented  and coherent, but  her capacities\r\n\nfor  attention,  concentration, and  retention  were somewhat\r\n\ndiminished.   Her  memory was  good  and she  exhibited  good\r\n\ninsight.  Dr. Toro noted that claimant could handle funds and\r\n\nengage in  normal interpersonal relationships.   At the final\r\n\nexamination,  claimant appeared  slightly depressed,  but was\r\n\nspontaneous,  logical,  and  oriented.    Her  concentration,\r\n\nattention,  retention  and  memory  were normal.    Dr.  Toro\r\n\ndiagnosed   a  mild  dysthymic   disorder  and   stated  that\r\n\nclaimant's prognosis was fair.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          A non-examining doctor,  in 1993, found  claimant's\r\n\ncondition severe and diagnosed an affective disorder.  As for\r\n\nwork-related activities, the only areas in which claimant was\r\n\nrated  as moderately  limited were  in dealing  with detailed\r\n\ninstructions and accepting instruction from others.  Claimant\r\n\nwas not significantly limited in all other areas.\r\n\n          In  contrast  to  the  above,  claimant's  treating\r\n\nphysician opined that claimant had marked restrictions in the\r\n\nactivities  of daily  living  and was  seriously impaired  in\r\n\nrelating to others.  Dr. Sanchez also noted that claimant had\r\n\nhallucinations, autistic or regressive behavior, and suicidal\r\n\nideation.  He  rated claimant as severely  impaired in almost\r\n\nall  areas  relating to  work.   Dr.  Sanchez  concluded that\r\n\nclaimant could not work.\r\n\n          The  ALJ's  decision  essentially incorporates  the\r\n\nassessments of  the  non-examining physician  and  Dr.  Toro.\r\n\nGiven the  conflict between these assessments  and the report\r\n\nof Dr. Sanchez, the ALJ did not err in not giving controlling\r\n\nweight  to  the latter's  opinion.   See  Rodriguez  Pagan v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSecretary  of Health and Human  Services, 819 F.2d  1, 3 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1987) (per curiam), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1012 (1988).\r                                                 \r\n\n          4.   Pain.  Claimant  alleges that the  ALJ did not\r                               \r\n\nproperly  credit her allegations  of totally  disabling pain.\r\n\nSee Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n19  (1st  Cir. 1986).   Even  assuming  that the  record from\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nAugust 1991 through 1993 provided  objective medical evidence\r\n\nof a  back impairment  that reasonably could  be expected  to\r\n\ncause  pain,  the dearth  of  evidence  relating to  sensory,\r\n\nmotor, or strength deficits conflicts with the level of  pain\r\n\nclaimant asserts.   Further, claimant told  one examiner that\r\n\nshe  performed   household  chores  and   claimant  generally\r\n\nreported a  fairly  active  social life.    Because  the  ALJ\r\n\ncorrectly   considered  the   Avery  factors,   his  decision\r                                               \r\n\nregarding  claimant's   pain  is  supported   by  substantial\r\n\nevidence.\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  judgment of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n",

The application was denied on August 8, 1991 and claimant did not seek reconsideration.   Instead, she filed a new application on January 21, 1993, alleging the same onset date and listing as impairments a herniated disc and nerves.   Claimant's insured status expired on December 31, 1993.   An administrative law judge (ALJ) held a hearing in October 1993 at which claimant and a vocational expert (VE) testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ first determined not to reopen claimant's initial application with the result that he did not consider evidence from the time period prior to August 8, 1991.   The ALJ then decided that claimant suffered from severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension, a small herniated disc, costochondritis, and an affective disorder.   These conditions, the ALJ opined, prevented her from performing her past work as a meat packager, a job requiring medium exertion.   Further, the ALJ stated that claimant was prohibited from performing complex or detailed tasks and engaging in work in which she could not change position.   Using the grid as a framework and the testimony of the VE, the ALJ nonetheless concluded that there were other, light-duty jobs which claimant could perform.   The Appeals Council denied claimant's request for review and the district court affirmed this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant argues on appeal that the ALJ's decision not to reopen her first application for disability benefits is reviewable.  \"Absent a colorable constitutional claim ... a district court does not have jurisdiction to review the Secretary's discretionary decision not to reopen an earlier adjudication.\"  Torres v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 845 F.2d 1136, 1138 (1st Cir.1988) (per curiam) (citing cases).   To come within this exception, claimant asserts that the determination not to reopen violated her due process rights because the ALJ never had held a hearing on her first request for benefits.   However, claimant does not assert that she was denied the opportunity for a hearing and it does not appear that she requested one.   We have held, in similar circumstances, that such a claim is not colorable.  See Matos v. Secretary of HEW, 581 F.2d 282, 284-86 (1st Cir.1978).   Thus, we consider, as did the ALJ, only the evidence for the period after August 8, 1991 through December 31, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Back Condition.   Although claimant received treatment for her back at the State Insurance Fund during 1988 and 1989, there are no records of any treatment for the period 1990 through 1993.   The other evidence for the relevant time--consultative examinations, two RFC assessments, and a report from claimant's treating physician--is conflicting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, Dr. Roberto Leon Perez, an internist and rheumatologist, performed a consultative examination in July 1991.   He reported that claimant could walk on her toes, but that her flexion/extension was somewhat limited (70 degrees).   An x-ray showed (1) narrowing of the L4-L5 intervertebral space, (2) narrowing of the L5-S1 intervertebral space associated with posterior spondylosis (fusion of a vertebral joint), (3) facet joint degenerative disease at L5-S1, and (4) reversal of normal lordosis.

See 20 C.F.R. &#167; 404.1527(d)(2) (if a treating physician's opinion is inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record, controlling weight need not be given to that opinion).   Thus, the medical findings outlined above sufficiently support the ALJ's conclusion that claimant could perform light work.  See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1981) (conflicts are for the Secretary to resolve).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. High Blood Pressure.   There are only two pieces of evidence relating to claimant's high blood pressure for the relevant period.   First, claimant's treating physician, Dr. Sanchez, reported that he began seeing claimant in 1985 for high blood pressure.   During the course of treatment, claimant experienced dizzy spells and chest pain.   Dr. Sanchez opined that claimant's prognosis was guarded.   However, he did not specify any limits on the activities in which claimant could engage.   Second, Dr. Bonneaux, in a chest pain questionnaire, stated that the origin of claimant's chest pain was musculoskeletal.   Although he opined that claimant's blood pressure should be controlled, he also did not list any limitations on the kinds of activities in which she could engage.   Given the complete dearth of evidence that this condition limited the kinds of work-related activities in which claimant could engage, the record is more than adequate to support the Secretary's decision.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Emotional Condition.   As with claimant's back condition, the evidence concerning the effect of claimant's mental impairment is conflicting.   Dr. Luis Toro, a psychiatrist, conducted three evaluations of claimant's mental status.   In the first two reports, Dr. Toro described claimant as being in contact with reality, with appropriate affect.   She was oriented and coherent, but her capacities for attention, concentration, and retention were somewhat diminished.   Her memory was good and she exhibited good insight.   Dr. Toro noted that claimant could handle funds and engage in normal interpersonal relationships.   At the final examination, claimant appeared slightly depressed, but was spontaneous, logical, and oriented.   Her concentration, attention, retention and memory were normal.   Dr. Toro diagnosed a mild dysthymic disorder and stated that claimant's prognosis was fair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A non-examining doctor, in 1993, found claimant's condition severe and diagnosed an affective disorder.   As for work-related activities, the only areas in which claimant was rated as moderately limited were in dealing with detailed instructions and accepting instruction from others.   Claimant was not significantly limited in all other areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the above, claimant's treating physician opined that claimant had marked restrictions in the activities of daily living and was seriously impaired in relating to others.   Dr. Sanchez also noted that claimant had hallucinations, autistic or regressive behavior, and suicidal ideation.   He rated claimant as severely impaired in almost all areas relating to work.   Dr. Sanchez concluded that claimant could not work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ's decision essentially incorporates the assessments of the non-examining physician and Dr. Toro.  Given the conflict between these assessments and the report of Dr. Sanchez, the ALJ did not err in not giving controlling weight to the latter's opinion.  See Rodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 819 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1012 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Pain.  Claimant alleges that the ALJ did not properly credit her allegations of totally disabling pain.  See Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir.1986).   Even assuming that the record from August 1991 through 1993 provided objective medical evidence of a back impairment that reasonably could be expected to cause pain, the dearth of evidence relating to sensory, motor, or strength deficits conflicts with the level of pain claimant asserts.   Further, claimant told one examiner that she performed household chores and claimant generally reported a fairly active social life.   Because the ALJ correctly considered the Avery factors, his decision regarding claimant's pain is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The application was denied on August 8, 1991 and claimant did not seek reconsideration.   Instead, she filed a new application on January 21, 1993, alleging the same onset date and listing as impairments a herniated disc and nerves.   Claimant's insured status expired on December 31, 1993.   An administrative law judge (ALJ) held a hearing in October 1993 at which claimant and a vocational expert (VE) testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ first determined not to reopen claimant's initial application with the result that he did not consider evidence from the time period prior to August 8, 1991.   The ALJ then decided that claimant suffered from severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension, a small herniated disc, costochondritis, and an affective disorder.   These conditions, the ALJ opined, prevented her from performing her past work as a meat packager, a job requiring medium exertion.   Further, the ALJ stated that claimant was prohibited from performing complex or detailed tasks and engaging in work in which she could not change position.   Using the grid as a framework and the testimony of the VE, the ALJ nonetheless concluded that there were other, light-duty jobs which claimant could perform.   The Appeals Council denied claimant's request for review and the district court affirmed this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant argues on appeal that the ALJ's decision not to reopen her first application for disability benefits is reviewable.  \"Absent a colorable constitutional claim ... a district court does not have jurisdiction to review the Secretary's discretionary decision not to reopen an earlier adjudication.\"  Torres v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505495\"><a href=\"/opinion/505495/21-socsecrepser-511-unemplinsrep-cch-179867-jose-a-torres-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>, 1138 (1st Cir.1988) (per curiam) (citing cases).   To come within this exception, claimant asserts that the determination not to reopen violated her due process rights because the ALJ never had held a hearing on her first request for benefits.   However, claimant does not assert that she was denied the opportunity for a hearing and it does not appear that she requested one.   We have held, in similar circumstances, that such a claim is not colorable.  See Matos v. Secretary of HEW, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358672\"><a href=\"/opinion/358672/matilde-matos-v-secretary-of-health-education-and-welfare/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span>, 284-86 (1st Cir.1978).   Thus, we consider, as did the ALJ, only the evidence for the period after August 8, 1991 through December 31, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Back Condition.   Although claimant received treatment for her back at the State Insurance Fund during 1988 and 1989, there are no records of any treatment for the period 1990 through 1993.   The other evidence for the relevant time--consultative examinations, two RFC assessments, and a report from claimant's treating physician--is conflicting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, Dr. Roberto Leon Perez, an internist and rheumatologist, performed a consultative examination in July 1991.   He reported that claimant could walk on her toes, but that her flexion/extension was somewhat limited (70 degrees).   An x-ray showed (1) narrowing of the L4-L5 intervertebral space, (2) narrowing of the L5-S1 intervertebral space associated with posterior spondylosis (fusion of a vertebral joint), (3) facet joint degenerative disease at L5-S1, and (4) reversal of normal lordosis.   The diagnosis was herniated disc by history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other consultative examination was performed in March 1993 by Dr. Phillip Bonneaux.   At this time, claimant had normal muscle tone and strength.   Her gait also was normal and she had full range of motion of her back.   There were moderate spasms of the paravertebral muscles.   An x-ray showed slight scoliosis and minimal spondylosis.   The diagnosis was moderate paravertebral muscle spasm.   Dr. Bonneaux concluded that claimant could sit, stand, walk, lift and carry without limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two non-examining physicians who completed residual functional capacity (RFC) assessments in 1993 agreed that claimant retained the weight-lifting capacity consistent with light work.   They also agreed that claimant could sit, stand and walk for up to six hours each per day.   She could occasionally climb, stoop, crouch and crawl, and could frequently kneel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although claimant's treating physician, Dr. Francisco Sanchez, gave a significantly more restrictive view of claimant's RFC, the ALJ was not required to credit it.   See 20 C.F.R. &#167; 404.1527(d)(2) (if a treating physician's opinion is inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record, controlling weight need not be given to that opinion).   Thus, the medical findings outlined above sufficiently support the ALJ's conclusion that claimant could perform light work.  See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389936\"><a href=\"/opinion/389936/maria-s-rodriguez-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.1981) (conflicts are for the Secretary to resolve).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.
