Upon careful review of the briefs and record, we\r\nperceive no clear error in the enhancement of defendant's sentence\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  3B1.1(c).  The information available to the\r\ndistrict court, including among other things the pre-sentence\r\nreport and the suppression hearing, adequately supported the\r\nfinding that defendant was a supervisor and organizer in the\r\nconspiracy.  We will not set aside the district court's fact-\r\nspecific decision.  See United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
