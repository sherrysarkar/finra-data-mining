That  complaint alleged\r\n\nthat  the  defendant  employees of  the  Maine  Department of\r\n\nCorrections  had violated that  right by denying  or ignoring\r\n\nplaintiff's requests for access to the prison  law library at\r\n\nMCI-Warren.1\r                       1\r\n\n     As   it  is  undisputed  that  plaintiff  is  no  longer\r\n\nincarcerated  at MCI-Warren, we agree that the district court\r\n\nproperly dismissed plaintiff's complaint as moot.
