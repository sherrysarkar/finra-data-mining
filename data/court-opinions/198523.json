We have reviewed the parties' briefs\r\nand the record and affirm the judgment of the district court\r\ndenying the Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion of Felipe Bernal. \r\nFirst, we note that since defendant did not object to the\r\nReport and Recommendation of the magistrate judge   despite an\r\nadequate warning regarding the consequences of the failure to\r\ndo so   he has waived the right to appellate review.  See\r\nHenley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150-51 &amp; n.19 (1st\r\nCir. 1994); Park Motor Mart, Inc. v.
