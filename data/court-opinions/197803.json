This  court has thoroughly reviewed  the record and\r\n\nSinai's brief  on appeal.   We agree  that the  complaint was\r\n\nproperly  dismissed, for the  reasons stated by  the district\r\n\ncourt.   Accordingly, the  judgment of the  district court is\r\n\nsummarily affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\r                                    \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
