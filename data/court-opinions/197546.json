We have carefully reviewed the record\r                                 \r\n\nand  read the  briefs  on  appeal.   We  affirm the  district\r\n\ncourt's judgment dismissing the complaint of  appellant James\r\n\nE. Cofield for essentially the  reasons stated in the court's\r\n\nMemorandum and Order, dated October 31, 1996.  See Local Rule\r                                                              \r\n\n27.1.  We add only two comments.\r\n\n          1.   Statute of  Limitations.   We assume,  without\r                                                  \r\n\ndeciding, that  appellant argued  below that  Fannie Mae  had\r\n\nperpetrated  a fraud on  the bankruptcy court.   Nonetheless,\r\n\nthe claim cannot  succeed.  Simply, appellant may  not pursue\r\n\nthe fraud claim  now, either via motion or  in an independent\r\n\naction, because  he could have litigated it  in the adversary\r\n\nproceeding.  That is, from  the undisputed facts, it is plain\r\n\nthat appellant knew of Fannie Mae's alleged fraud  before the\r\n\nadversary proceeding was  dismissed.  As we pointed  out in a\r\n\nrecent case, Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) does not permit a party to\r\n\nrelitigate, in  an independent  action or  by motion,  issues\r\n\nthat  the party  had a  fair opportunity  to litigate  in the\r\n\nformer  action.   See Geo.  P. Reintjes  Co. v.  Riley Stoker\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., 71 F.3d  44, 49 (1st  Cir. 1995) (citing  7 J.

At the  least,\r                                     \r\n\nappellant  could have filed  a motion for  reconsideration of\r\n\nthe order of dismissal.\r\n\n          2.  Malicious Prosecution.
