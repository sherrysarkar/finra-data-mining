We\r\n\naffirm the Tax Court ruling, without deciding whether prejudgment\r\n\ninterest  is ever excludable  as \"damages received  on account of\r\n\npersonal  injuries\"  under  Section  104(a)(2)  of  the  Internal\r\n\nRevenue Code. \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          In 1988, the  Delaneys commenced a tort action in Rhode\r\n\nIsland Superior  Court, demanding  damages for personal  injuries\r\n\nsustained by Mr. Delaney in a fall from the second-floor porch of\r\n\ntheir  Apple  Valley  condominium in  Smithfield,  Rhode  Island.\r\n\nApple Valley Associates,  Inc., the condominium developer;  Apple\r\n\nValley  Condominium  Association,  Inc., the  condominium  owners\r\n\nassociation;   and Condominium Management,  Inc., the  management\r\n\nfirm responsible for maintaining the condominium properties, were\r\n\nnamed as defendants. \r\n\n          On October  12, 1990,  a jury  awarded $150,000 to  Mr.\r\n\nDelaney  for personal injuries  and $25,000  to Mrs.  Delaney for\r\n\nloss of consortium, assigning fault among the three defendants as\r\n\nfollows:   Apple Valley Associates 25%;  Apple Valley Condominium\r\n\nAssociation and  Apple  Valley Condominium  Management,  jointly,\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n75%.   As required  under Rhode Island  law, the  clerk of  court\r\n\nadded  $112,000 in  statutory  prejudgment interest  to the  jury\r\n\naward,  bringing the total judgment to  $287,000.  The defendants\r\n\nappealed the judgment to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.\r\n\n          In 1991,  while their  appeal was still  pending, Apple\r\n\nValley Condominium Association,  Inc. and Condominium Management,\r\n\nInc.  entered  into a  settlement agreement  to pay  the Delaneys\r\n\n$250,000 for a release of \"any and all past, present, or future .\r\n\n. .  claims .  . .  arising out of  bodily injuries  sustained by\r                      \r\n\nJoseph P.  Delaney .  . .  .\"1   The  agreement itself  mentioned\r                                       1\r\n\nneither  prejudgment nor  postjudgment interest;  furthermore, it\r\n\nfailed  to  indicate what,  if  any,  understanding the  settling\r\n\nparties had reached regarding any apportionment of the settlement\r\n\namount as  between prejudgment interest and compensatory damages.\r\n\nSubsequently, however,  the settling parties filed  a stipulation\r\n\nof dismissal with the Rhode Island  Superior Court, which stated:\r\n\n\"No interest.   No costs.\"2   The  stipulation was  silent as  to\r\n\nwhether   the  term   \"interest\"   meant  prejudgment   interest,\r\n\npostjudgment interest, or both.\r\n\n          The Delaneys did not declare the $250,000 on their 1991\r\n\nfederal income tax return.  Ultimately, the Commissioner assessed\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Under the  settlement agreement, both Mr.  and Mrs. Delaney\r\nreleased their claims  against Apple Valley  Condominium Associa-\r\ntion,  Inc. and  Condominium Management,  Inc.  The  Delaneys re-\r\nserved their  right to  proceed against Apple  Valley Associates,\r\nwhich was not a party to the settlement agreement. \r\n\n     2After deducting $85,866 in legal fees and expenses, counsel\r\nto the Delaneys issued them a check for $164,134.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\na $20,580 deficiency for  tax year 1991, which was  calculated by\r\n\nallocating 39 percent    or $97,561    of the settlement proceeds\r\n\nto prejudgment interest.  The IRS based its 39 percent allocation\r\n\non the fact that 39 percent (or $112,000) of the $287,000 superi-\r\n\nor court judgment constituted prejudgment interest. \r\n\n          The  Delaneys initiated  proceedings in the  Tax Court,\r\n\nalleging that  the entire  $250,000 settlement had  been properly\r\n\nexcluded from gross income as \"damages  received . . . on account\r\n\nof personal  injuries or sickness\" pursuant  to Section 104(a)(2)\r\n\nof the Internal Revenue Code.  The Commissioner has conceded that\r\n\nthe  settlement amount attributable  to compensatory  damages for\r\n\npersonal injuries  is excludable, but not  the statutory prejudg-\r\n\nment interest.   Through the  testimony of their  counsel in  the\r\n\nunderlying tort action, their  letter proposing settlement to the\r\n\ndefendants, the settlement agreement  itself, and the stipulation\r\n\nof dismissal, the  Delaneys attempted  to show the  Tax Court  at\r\n\ntrial that none  of the  settlement amount had  been intended  as\r\n\nprejudgment interest.   After  determining that the  Delaneys had\r\n\nnot  met their  burden of  proving the  Commissioner's assessment\r\n\nincorrect, the  Tax Court  ruled that  the settlement  included a\r\n\nprejudgment interest  component amounting  to $97,561, or  39% of\r\n\nthe  $250,000 settlement.

First, the Delaneys claim that the Tax Court improperly\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nsecond-guessed their settlement agreement  with the defendants in\r\n\nthe  tort action by treating a portion of the $250,000 settlement\r\n\nas statutory prejudgment  interest despite the explicit  language\r\n\nin  their subsequent stipulation of dismissal:  \"No interest.  No\r\n\ncosts.\"  The Delaneys insist that the  stipulated settlement term\r\n\n\"no interest\" unambiguously  provides that the  settlement amount\r\n\nincluded no interest component  of any type.   Second, appellants\r\n\nmaintain that  any prejudgment interest in  a settlement recovery\r\n\nfor personal  injuries comes within the  section 104(a)(2) exclu-\r\n\nsion  for \"damages\"  resulting from personal  injuries.   We find\r\n\nneither claim availing.\r\n\nA.   Settlement Agreement\r          A.   Settlement Agreement\r                                   \r\n\n          It is  settled law  that taxpayers  bear the burden  of\r\n\nproving  that a  tax deficiency  assessment is  erroneous. United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

The  Supreme Court has\r\n\nheld  that the Commissioner's \"ruling  has the support  of a pre-\r\n\nsumption of  correctness, and  the petitioner  has the  burden of\r\n\nproving  it to be wrong.\"  Welch  v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115\r                                                        \r\n\n(1933);  see also  United  States v.

The rationale  for this rule is  more\r\n\ndeeply  rooted  than the  conventional  regimen  that places  the\r\n\nburden of proof on the moving party.  See Rexach, 482 F.2d at 16.\r                                                          \r\n\nThus,  in a tax deficiency suit \"the burdens of going forward and\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nof ultimate persuasion are always on the taxpayer and never shift\r\n\nto the Commissioner.\"   Id. at 16-17.   Ultimately, of course,  a\r                                    \r\n\ntax deficiency assessment is subject to reversal if  the taxpayer\r\n\nestablishes by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence  that  it  was\r\n\nerroneous.

Commissioner, 751 F.2d  1548, 1556\r                                                     \r\n\n(11th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1005 (1985). \r                                   \r\n\n          Viewed  simply  as a  linguistic  exercise, appellants'\r\n\ninterpretation  has  a  certain  appeal.   Since  the  settlement\r\n\nagreement  language itself  suggests  no differentiation  between\r\n\ndamages and prejudgment interest, its silence plainly permits the\r\n\ninterpretation  that the  entire $250,000  constituted recompense\r\n\nfor  personal injury.   Moreover,  the subsequent  stipulation of\r\n\ndismissal  executed by the parties to the tort action purports to\r\n\nfill  the void by precluding     with the  language \"No interest.\r\n\nNo costs.\"    the interpretation urged by the Commissioner.  \r\n\n          The difficulty  with appellants'  approach lies  in the\r\n\nfact that  the required  inquiry encompasses much  more than  the\r                                 \r\n\nmere  language  subscribed to  by  the  parties, whether  in  the\r\n\nsettlement  agreement proper,  the  stipulation of  dismissal, or\r\n\nboth,  because under  established  precedent the  Tax Court  must\r\n\ndetermine \"in  lieu  of  what  were damages  awarded\"  or  paid.3\r                                       \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Of course, it  is the  nature of the  settled claim  itself\r                                                                   \r\nwhich controls whether any  of the settlement constituted compen-\r\nsation for a tort-type personal injury.

Thus,  in ascertaining  the tax  consequences of  the\r\n\nfinal  settlement, the  Tax Court  appropriately went  beyond the\r\n\nexplicit \"no interest\" allocation memorialized in the stipulation\r\n\nof dismissal, see Bent, 87 T.C. at 244, to consider any extrinsic\r                                \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nevidence probative of the true nature of the settlement.  \r\n\n          The  Tax Court  was presented  with a  markedly similar\r\n\nsituation on a prior occasion, where the taxpayers had obtained a\r\n\n$1,275,000  jury award in a personal injury action under a state-\r\n\nlaw regime that entitled  them to statutory prejudgment interest.\r\n\nMcShane  v.

On the  other hand,  the superior\r\ncourt  judgment appealed  from in  Delaney did  include statutory\r                                                    \r\nprejudgment interest. \r\n\n     5Appellants cite McShane for their claim that the underlying\r                                       \r\ntort judgment had not become final since it was on  appeal at the\r\ntime of  the settlement;  therefore, following McShane,  the debt\r                                                                \r\nhad  not been liquidated and  there was no  fixed or determinable\r\namount excludable under    104(a)(2).

Second, the  intentions\r                             \r\n\nof  all parties to the underlying tort action, as stated by their\r\n\nattorneys,  were  most consistent  with  an intention  to  pay no\r\n\ninterest.  Third,  the Tax  Court credited the  testimony of  all\r\n\ncounsel in the tort  action that the settlement amounts  for each\r\n\nplaintiff  had been arrived at  by assessing the  risks on appeal\r\n\nand that the tax consequences had never been discussed.  Id. \r                                                                     \r\n\n          The  Tax Court in the present  case pursued a similarly\r\n\ninclusive  approach by  probing beyond  the settlement  agreement\r\n\nterms, examining all relevant evidence including the testimony of\r\n\nthe Delaneys' counsel in  the underlying tort action, who  stated\r\n\nthat  the excludability  of the  $250,000 settlement  amount from\r\n\ngross income  was  never taken  into  account in  the  settlement\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nagreement, only the risks  on appeal.  In addition,  however, the\r\n\nTax Court considered a letter  from the Delaneys' counsel propos-\r\n\ning  settlement to  the  tort-action defendants  and noting  that\r\n\ninterest was continuing to accumulate on the superior court judg-\r\n\nment.  There was no  testimonial evidence regarding the  relevant\r\n\nintentions of any tort-action defendant.  \r\n\n          Finally, the Tax  Court considered the  appropriateness\r\n\nof  the parallel utilized by the Commissioner in apportioning the\r\n\nundifferentiated settlement amount  as between prejudgment inter-\r\n\nest and compensatory damages.  The Commissioner had allocated 39%\r\n\nof the  $250,000  settlement to  statutory prejudgment  interest,\r\n\nrepresenting  the  identical proportion  by  which  the clerk  of\r\n\ncourt, pursuant  to Rhode  Island law,  had increased the  jury's\r\n\npersonal  injury award.  The  Fifth Circuit has  noted in similar\r\n\ncircumstances that  a jury verdict provides  \"the best indication\r\n\nof the worth\" of  the taxpayers' original tort claims.

The  Delaneys maintain  that\r                                            .  \r\n\nKovacs is unsound because it  relied upon judicial precedents for\r                \r\n\ntaxing postjudgment interest as authority for taxing  prejudgment\r                                                                           \r\n\ninterest.

As their argument  is raised for\r                 \r\n\nthe  first time on appeal, we decline  to address it.

Since prejudgment interest is an element of\r\n\ndamages  under Rhode  Island  law, appellants  argue, the  entire\r\n\n$250,000  settlement must  be  excluded from  gross income  under\r\n\nsection 104(a)(2) as damages for personal injury.  \r\n\n          The Tenth Circuit, recently  confronted with a  similar\r\n\nproblem,  noted that though state law governs the nature of legal\r\n\ninterests and  rights created under  state law, the  \"federal tax\r\n\nconsequences pertaining to such interests and rights are solely a\r\n\nmatter of federal  law.\"   Brabson, 73 F.3d  1040, 1044  (Coffin,\r                                            \r\n\nJ.).    Accordingly,  the  Brabson panel  first  ascertained  the\r                                            \r\n\npertinent characteristics of statutory prejudgment interest under\r\n\nColorado law, but  then looked  to federal law  to determine  its\r\n\nexcludability.   Id. at 1044.   As we  agree with  the thoughtful\r                             \r\n\napproach in  Brabson, we turn first to Rhode Island law to deter-\r                              \r\n\nmine the nature of  the statutory prejudgment interest ministeri-\r\n\nally added by  the superior  court clerk to  the personal  injury\r\n\ndamages award returned by the jury in this case.  \r\n\n          Unlike  the  Colorado  statute  at  issue  in  Brabson,\r                                                                          \r\n\nstatutory  prejudgment interest is not an element of damages in a\r\n\npersonal injury action under Rhode Island law.

Delaney....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The agreement itself mentioned neither prejudgment nor postjudgment interest;  furthermore, it failed to indicate what, if any, understanding the settling parties had reached regarding any apportionment of the settlement amount as between prejudgment interest and compensatory damages.  Subsequently, however, the settling parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with the Rhode Island Superior Court, which stated:  \"No interest.  No costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The stipulation was silent as to whether the term \"interest\" meant prejudgment interest, postjudgment interest, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys did not declare the $250,000 on their 1991 federal income tax return.  Ultimately, the Commissioner assessed a $20,580 deficiency for tax year 1991, which was calculated by allocating 39 percent--or $97,561--of the settlement proceeds to prejudgment interest.  The IRS based its 39 percent allocation on the fact that 39 percent (or $112,000) of the $287,000 superior court judgment constituted prejudgment interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys initiated proceedings in the Tax Court, alleging that the entire $250,000 settlement had been properly excluded from gross income as \"damages received ... on account of personal injuries or sickness\" pursuant to Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Commissioner has conceded that the settlement amount attributable to compensatory damages for personal injuries is excludable, but not the statutory prejudgment interest.  Through the testimony of their counsel in the underlying tort action, their letter proposing settlement to the defendants, the settlement agreement itself, and the stipulation of dismissal, the Delaneys attempted to show the Tax Court at trial that none of the settlement amount had been intended as prejudgment interest.  After determining that the Delaneys had not met their burden of proving the Commissioner's assessment incorrect, the Tax Court ruled that the settlement included a prejudgment interest component amounting to $97,561, or 39% of the $250,000 settlement.  Delaney v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 70 T.C.M.  (CCH) 353 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case concerns the inherent tension between two sections of the Internal Revenue Code governing exclusions from gross income.  Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code states:  \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income from whatever source derived.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 61(a) (emphasis added).  On the other hand, section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that \"damages received ... on account of personal injuries or sickness\" are excludable from gross income.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 104(a)(2).  The courts have accorded section 61(a) wide sweep.   Commissioner v. Schleier,  --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2159, 2167, 132 L.Ed.2d 294 (1995);  Brabson v. United States, 73 F.3d 1040, 1042 (10th Cir.1996);  O'Gilvie v. United States, 66 F.3d 1550, 1555 (10th Cir.1995), cert. granted, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1316, 134 L.Ed.2d 469 (1996);  see also 26 U.S.C. &#167; 61(a)(4) (including \"interest\" within definition of \"gross income\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, gain constitutes gross income under section 61(a) unless the taxpayer can demonstrate a specific exclusion.  Brabson, 73 F.3d at 1042 (citing  Schleier, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2163 (1995);  Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426, 430, 75 S.Ct. 473, 476, 99 L.Ed. 483 (1955);  Wesson v. United States, 48 F.3d 894, 898 (5th Cir.1995)).  In determining exclusions under 104(a)(2), courts are \"guided by the corollary to &#167; 61(a)'s broad construction, the 'default rule of statutory interpretation that exclusions from income must be narrowly construed.' \"  Id. (quoting  Schleier, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2163).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present appeal revolves around two principal claims.  First, the Delaneys claim that the Tax Court improperly second-guessed their settlement agreement with the defendants in the tort action by treating a portion of the $250,000 settlement as statutory prejudgment interest despite the explicit language in their subsequent stipulation of dismissal:  \"No interest.  No costs.\"   The Delaneys insist that the stipulated settlement term \"no interest\" unambiguously provides that the settlement amount included no interest component of any type.  Second, appellants maintain that any prejudgment interest in a settlement recovery for personal injuries comes within the section 104(a)(2) exclusion for \"damages\" resulting from personal injuries.  We find neither claim availing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Settlement Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law that taxpayers bear the burden of proving that a tax deficiency assessment is erroneous.  United States v. Rexach, 482 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1039, 94 S.Ct. 540, 38 L.Ed.2d 330 (1973);  Tax Court Rule 142(a).  The Supreme Court has held that the Commissioner's \"ruling has the support of a presumption of correctness, and the petitioner has the burden of proving it to be wrong.\"  Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933);  see also United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433, 439, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 3025, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976);  Estate of Todisco v. Commissioner, 757 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1985) (the basic rule in all tax cases places the burden of proof with the taxpayer).  The rationale for this rule is more deeply rooted than the conventional regimen that places the burden of proof on the moving party.  See Rexach, 482 F.2d at 16.   Thus, in a tax deficiency suit \"the burdens of going forward and of ultimate persuasion are always on the taxpayer and never shift to the Commissioner.\"  Id. at 16-17.   Ultimately, of course, a tax deficiency assessment is subject to reversal if the taxpayer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that it was erroneous.  Estate of Whitt v. Commissioner, 751 F.2d 1548, 1556 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1005, 106 S.Ct. 523, 88 L.Ed.2d 456 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed simply as a linguistic exercise, appellants' interpretation has a certain appeal.  Since the settlement agreement language itself suggests no differentiation between damages and prejudgment interest, its silence plainly permits the interpretation that the entire $250,000 constituted recompense for personal injury.  Moreover, the subsequent stipulation of dismissal executed by the parties to the tort action purports to fill the void by precluding--with the language \"No interest.  No costs.\"--the interpretation urged by the Commissioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with appellants' approach lies in the fact that the required inquiry encompasses much more than the mere language subscribed to by the parties, whether in the settlement agreement proper, the stipulation of dismissal, or both, because under established precedent the Tax Court must determine \"in lieu of what were damages awarded\" or paid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Alexander v. I.R.S., 72 F.3d 938, 942 (1st Cir.1995) (emphasis added) (quoting Raytheon Production Corp. v. Commissioner, 144 F.2d 110, 113 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 779, 65 S.Ct. 192, 89 L.Ed. 622 (1944)).  See Getty v. Commissioner, 913 F.2d 1486, 1490 (9th Cir.1990) (utilizing Raytheon 's \"in lieu of\" test to classify, for tax purposes, components comprising settlement amount).  See also Bent v. Commissioner, 87 T.C. 236, 1986 WL 22165 (1986), aff'd, 835 F.2d 67 (3d Cir.1987).  Moreover, the courts repeatedly have held that the intent of the payor is a key determinant whether a settlement recovery is excludable from gross income.  See Knuckles v. Commissioner, 349 F.2d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1965);  Ray v. United States, 25 Cl. Ct. 535, 540 (1992), aff'd, 989 F.2d 1204 (Table) (Fed.Cir.1993);  Stocks v. Commissioner, 98 T.C. 1, 10, 1992 WL 189 (1992);  Agar v. Commissioner, 290 F.2d 283, 284 (2d Cir.1961), aff'g per curiam 19 T.C.M.  (CCH) 116 (1960).  Thus, while acknowledging the importance of the terms employed in the stipulation of dismissal, the Tax court appropriately inquired, inter alia, whether a portion of the settlement amount represented prejudgment interest, by looking beyond the language utilized by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, confronted with a $250,000 postjudgment settlement literally allocating nothing to statutory prejudgment interest notwithstanding the $112,000 prejudgment interest component concededly included in the $287,000 superior court judgment, the Tax Court reasonably considered, inter alia, the intent of the parties in context.  The Tax Court's approach seems especially apt in these circumstances, where a relevant indicator extrinsic to the settlement documentation suggested that their choice of settlement language may have been driven by tax considerations.  See Taggi v. United States, 35 F.3d 93, 96 (2d Cir.1994);  Glynn v. Commissioner, 76 T.C. 116, 121, 1981 WL 11320 (1981), aff'd, 676 F.2d 682 (Table) (1st Cir.1982);  Robinson v. Commissioner, 102 T.C. 116, 126, 1994 WL 26303 (1994), aff'd. in part, rev'd. in part, 70 F.3d 34 (5th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 83, 136 L.Ed.2d 40 (1996);  Threlkeld v.

(CCH) 1368 (1990) (allocation in settlement documentation not binding where taxpayer drafted document without participation or approval of adversary), aff'd, 992 F.2d 1219 (Table) (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 861, 114 S.Ct. 177, 126 L.Ed.2d 136 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, viewed in context the settlement term \"no interest\" is not without ambiguity as the Delaneys would have it.  Rather, it may fairly be read either to provide for no interest, as the Delaneys suggest, or no interest in addition to the $250,000 settlement amount.  Under the latter interpretation, the stipulation of dismissal left open whether the $250,000 settlement amount included statutory prejudgment or postjudgment interest.  Thus, in ascertaining the tax consequences of the final settlement, the Tax Court appropriately went beyond the explicit \"no interest\" allocation memorialized in the stipulation of dismissal, see Bent, 87 T.C. at 244, to consider any extrinsic evidence probative of the true nature of the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court was presented with a markedly similar situation on a prior occasion, where the taxpayers had obtained a $1,275,000 jury award in a personal injury action under a state-law regime that entitled them to statutory prejudgment interest.  McShane v. Commissioner, 53 T.C.M.  (CCH) 409 (1987).  As in our own case, the taxpayers in McShane eventually settled with the tort-action defendants while their case was on appeal, for an amount greater than the jury award.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In the deficiency suit subsequently brought by the taxpayers, the Tax Court decided that it \"must carefully review the settlement agreements and all other evidence in the record in order to determine whether the payments ultimately received included interest.\"  Id.  Its approach simply mirrors other Tax Court rulings requiring that all relevant facts and circumstances receive careful consideration in resolving such disputes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Byrne v. Commissioner, 90 T.C. 1000, 1007, 1988 WL 46847 (1988), rev'd. on other grounds, 883 F.2d 211 (3d Cir.1989);  Glynn, 76 T.C. at 120;  Robinson, 102 T.C. at 126;  cf.  Miller v. Commissioner, 65 T.C.M.  (CCH) 1884 (1993), supplemented by 66 T.C.M.  (CCH) 1568 (1993) (absent explicit allocations in settlement agreement itself, Tax Court may consider pleadings, jury award, and any court order or judgment in determining settlement payor's intent), aff'd, 60 F.3d 823 (Table) (4th Cir.1995);  Fitts v. Commissioner, 67 T.C.M.  (CCH) 2136 (1994) (if no lawsuit has been filed, court considers all relevant documents, letters and testimony), aff'd, 53 F.3d 335 (Table) (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The McShane court considered a combination of factors.  First, the term \"without costs and interest\" had been included in the settlement agreement at the insistence of counsel for the principal defendant in the tort action.  Second, the intentions of all parties to the underlying tort action, as stated by their attorneys, were most consistent with an intention to pay no interest.  Third, the Tax Court credited the testimony of all counsel in the tort action that the settlement amounts for each plaintiff had been arrived at by assessing the risks on appeal and that the tax consequences had never been discussed.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court in the present case pursued a similarly inclusive approach by probing beyond the settlement agreement terms, examining all relevant evidence including the testimony of the Delaneys' counsel in the underlying tort action, who stated that the excludability of the $250,000 settlement amount from gross income was never taken into account in the settlement agreement, only the risks on appeal.  In addition, however, the Tax Court considered a letter from the Delaneys' counsel proposing settlement to the tort-action defendants and noting that interest was continuing to accumulate on the superior court judgment.  There was no testimonial evidence regarding the relevant intentions of any tort-action defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Tax Court considered the appropriateness of the parallel utilized by the Commissioner in apportioning the undifferentiated settlement amount as between prejudgment interest and compensatory damages.  The Commissioner had allocated 39% of the $250,000 settlement to statutory prejudgment interest, representing the identical proportion by which the clerk of court, pursuant to Rhode Island law, had increased the jury's personal injury award.  The Fifth Circuit has noted in similar circumstances that a jury verdict provides \"the best indication of the worth\" of the taxpayers' original tort claims.  Robinson v. Commissioner, 70 F.3d 34, 38 (5th Cir.1995) (approving Tax Court's allocation of settlement proceeds based on percentage of damages represented by each element in jury award, where Tax Court went beyond terms of agreement settling action against bank for wrongful failure to release lien).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Tax Court supportably ruled that the Delaneys had not overcome the presumption of correctness to which the Commissioner's allocation is entitled, the allocation of 39% of the settlement amount to statutory prejudgment interest, substantially based upon the aforementioned parallelism, did not constitute error.  See Robinson, 70 F.3d at 38;  Estate of Todisco, 757 F.2d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Excludability of Prejudgment Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys next contend that statutory prejudgment interest itself is excludable as \"damages received ... on account of personal injury or sickness,\" see 26 U.S.C. &#167; 104(a)(2) (1986) (emphasis added), because the \"gross income\" exclusion under section 104(a)(2) embraces all amounts recovered, by settlement or otherwise, as compensation for personal injuries, without regard to the stage in the litigation process at which settlement occurs.  We address their predicate arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Tax Court Authorities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys challenge the leading precedent upon which the Tax Court relied, see Kovacs v. Commissioner, 100 T.C. 124, 1993 WL 46512 (1993), aff'd, 25 F.3d 1048 (Table) (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 963, 115 S.Ct. 424, 130 L.Ed.2d 338 (1994), for its holding that the prejudgment interest component in a compensatory damages recovery for personal injuries is taxable.  The Delaneys maintain that Kovacs is unsound because it relied upon judicial precedents for taxing postjudgment interest as authority for taxing prejudgment interest.  Consequently, they contend, Kovacs progeny such as Delaney are similarly flawed.  As their argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we decline to address it.  See, e.g., Villafane-Neriz v. F.D.I.C., 75 F.3d 727, 734 (1st Cir.1996) (arguments first raised on appeal not ordinarily addressed).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Choice of Governing Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys next contend that Rhode Island law controls whether any statutory prejudgment interest included in a personal injury settlement constitutes \"damages\" for federal income tax purposes.  Since prejudgment interest is an element of damages under Rhode Island law, appellants argue, the entire $250,000 settlement must be excluded from gross income under section 104(a)(2) as damages for personal injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit, recently confronted with a similar problem, noted that though state law governs the nature of legal interests and rights created under state law, the \"federal tax consequences pertaining to such interests and rights are solely a matter of federal law.\"  Brabson, 73 F.3d 1040, 1044 (Coffin, J.).  Accordingly, the Brabson panel first ascertained the pertinent characteristics of statutory prejudgment interest under Colorado law, but then looked to federal law to determine its excludability.  Id. at 1044.   As we agree with the thoughtful approach in Brabson, we turn first to Rhode Island law to determine the nature of the statutory prejudgment interest ministerially added by the superior court clerk to the personal injury damages award returned by the jury in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the Colorado statute at issue in Brabson, statutory prejudgment interest is not an element of damages in a personal injury action under Rhode Island law.  DiMeo v. Philbin, 502 A.2d 825, 826 (R.I.1986) (prejudgment interest in personal injury action purely statutory and therefore not an element of damages);  Castrignano v. E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc., 900 F.2d 455, 463 (1st Cir.1990) (prejudgment interest under Rhode Island law \"is not an element of damages\" in personal injury action) (citing Andrade v. State, 448 A.2d 1293, 1295 (R.I.1982)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Accordingly, in order to prevail, the Delaneys must establish that prejudgment interest is excludable under section 104(a)(2) notwithstanding its state-law characterization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Delaney (\"appellants\" or \"the Delaneys\") challenge a United States Tax Court ruling upholding a determination by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that a portion of their $250,000 settlement recovery in a tort-based action for personal injuries is subject to federal income tax as statutory prejudgment interest.  We affirm the Tax Court ruling, without deciding whether prejudgment interest is ever excludable as \"damages received on account of personal injuries\" under Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, the Delaneys commenced a tort action in Rhode Island Superior Court, demanding damages for personal injuries sustained by Mr. Delaney in a fall from the second-floor porch of their Apple Valley condominium in Smithfield, Rhode Island.  Apple Valley Associates, Inc., the condominium developer;  Apple Valley Condominium Association, Inc., the condominium owners association;  and Condominium Management, Inc., the management firm responsible for maintaining the condominium properties, were named as defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1990, a jury awarded $150,000 to Mr. Delaney for personal injuries and $25,000 to Mrs. Delaney for loss of consortium, assigning fault among the three defendants as follows:  Apple Valley Associates 25%;  Apple Valley Condominium Association and Apple Valley Condominium Management, jointly, 75%.  As required under Rhode Island law, the clerk of court added $112,000 in statutory prejudgment interest to the jury award, bringing the total judgment to $287,000.  The defendants appealed the judgment to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, while their appeal was still pending, Apple Valley Condominium Association, Inc. and Condominium Management, Inc. entered into a settlement agreement to pay the Delaneys $250,000 for a release of \"any and all past, present, or future ... claims ... arising out of bodily injuries sustained by Joseph P. Delaney....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The agreement itself mentioned neither prejudgment nor postjudgment interest;  furthermore, it failed to indicate what, if any, understanding the settling parties had reached regarding any apportionment of the settlement amount as between prejudgment interest and compensatory damages.  Subsequently, however, the settling parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with the Rhode Island Superior Court, which stated:  \"No interest.  No costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The stipulation was silent as to whether the term \"interest\" meant prejudgment interest, postjudgment interest, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys did not declare the $250,000 on their 1991 federal income tax return.  Ultimately, the Commissioner assessed a $20,580 deficiency for tax year 1991, which was calculated by allocating 39 percent--or $97,561--of the settlement proceeds to prejudgment interest.  The IRS based its 39 percent allocation on the fact that 39 percent (or $112,000) of the $287,000 superior court judgment constituted prejudgment interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys initiated proceedings in the Tax Court, alleging that the entire $250,000 settlement had been properly excluded from gross income as \"damages received ... on account of personal injuries or sickness\" pursuant to Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Commissioner has conceded that the settlement amount attributable to compensatory damages for personal injuries is excludable, but not the statutory prejudgment interest.  Through the testimony of their counsel in the underlying tort action, their letter proposing settlement to the defendants, the settlement agreement itself, and the stipulation of dismissal, the Delaneys attempted to show the Tax Court at trial that none of the settlement amount had been intended as prejudgment interest.  After determining that the Delaneys had not met their burden of proving the Commissioner's assessment incorrect, the Tax Court ruled that the settlement included a prejudgment interest component amounting to $97,561, or 39% of the $250,000 settlement.

Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code states:  \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income from whatever source derived.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 61(a) (emphasis added).  On the other hand, section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that \"damages received ... on account of personal injuries or sickness\" are excludable from gross income.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 104(a)(2).

No costs.\"   The Delaneys insist that the stipulated settlement term \"no interest\" unambiguously provides that the settlement amount included no interest component of any type.  Second, appellants maintain that any prejudgment interest in a settlement recovery for personal injuries comes within the section 104(a)(2) exclusion for \"damages\" resulting from personal injuries.

Since the settlement agreement language itself suggests no differentiation between damages and prejudgment interest, its silence plainly permits the interpretation that the entire $250,000 constituted recompense for personal injury.  Moreover, the subsequent stipulation of dismissal executed by the parties to the tort action purports to fill the void by precluding--with the language \"No interest.

Thus, while acknowledging the importance of the terms employed in the stipulation of dismissal, the Tax court appropriately inquired, inter alia, whether a portion of the settlement amount represented prejudgment interest, by looking beyond the language utilized by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, confronted with a $250,000 postjudgment settlement literally allocating nothing to statutory prejudgment interest notwithstanding the $112,000 prejudgment interest component concededly included in the $287,000 superior court judgment, the Tax Court reasonably considered, inter alia, the intent of the parties in context.

Rather, it may fairly be read either to provide for no interest, as the Delaneys suggest, or no interest in addition to the $250,000 settlement amount.  Under the latter interpretation, the stipulation of dismissal left open whether the $250,000 settlement amount included statutory prejudgment or postjudgment interest.  Thus, in ascertaining the tax consequences of the final settlement, the Tax Court appropriately went beyond the explicit \"no interest\" allocation memorialized in the stipulation of dismissal, see Bent, 87 T.C. at 244, to consider any extrinsic evidence probative of the true nature of the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court was presented with a markedly similar situation on a prior occasion, where the taxpayers had obtained a $1,275,000 jury award in a personal injury action under a state-law regime that entitled them to statutory prejudgment interest.  McShane v. Commissioner, 53 T.C.M.  (CCH) 409 (1987).  As in our own case, the taxpayers in McShane eventually settled with the tort-action defendants while their case was on appeal, for an amount greater than the jury award.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In the deficiency suit subsequently brought by the taxpayers, the Tax Court decided that it \"must carefully review the settlement agreements and all other evidence in the record in order to determine whether the payments ultimately received included interest.\"  Id.

First, the term \"without costs and interest\" had been included in the settlement agreement at the insistence of counsel for the principal defendant in the tort action.  Second, the intentions of all parties to the underlying tort action, as stated by their attorneys, were most consistent with an intention to pay no interest.  Third, the Tax Court credited the testimony of all counsel in the tort action that the settlement amounts for each plaintiff had been arrived at by assessing the risks on appeal and that the tax consequences had never been discussed.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court in the present case pursued a similarly inclusive approach by probing beyond the settlement agreement terms, examining all relevant evidence including the testimony of the Delaneys' counsel in the underlying tort action, who stated that the excludability of the $250,000 settlement amount from gross income was never taken into account in the settlement agreement, only the risks on appeal.  In addition, however, the Tax Court considered a letter from the Delaneys' counsel proposing settlement to the tort-action defendants and noting that interest was continuing to accumulate on the superior court judgment.  There was no testimonial evidence regarding the relevant intentions of any tort-action defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Tax Court considered the appropriateness of the parallel utilized by the Commissioner in apportioning the undifferentiated settlement amount as between prejudgment interest and compensatory damages.  The Commissioner had allocated 39% of the $250,000 settlement to statutory prejudgment interest, representing the identical proportion by which the clerk of court, pursuant to Rhode Island law, had increased the jury's personal injury award.  The Fifth Circuit has noted in similar circumstances that a jury verdict provides \"the best indication of the worth\" of the taxpayers' original tort claims.  Robinson v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8097\"><a href=\"/opinion/8097/robinson-v-cir/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 38 (5th Cir.1995) (approving Tax Court's allocation of settlement proceeds based on percentage of damages represented by each element in jury award, where Tax Court went beyond terms of agreement settling action against bank for wrongful failure to release lien).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Tax Court supportably ruled that the Delaneys had not overcome the presumption of correctness to which the Commissioner's allocation is entitled, the allocation of 39% of the settlement amount to statutory prejudgment interest, substantially based upon the aforementioned parallelism, did not constitute error.  See Robinson, 70 F.3d at 38;  Estate of Todisco, 757 F.2d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

We address their predicate arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Tax Court Authorities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Delaneys challenge the leading precedent upon which the Tax Court relied, see Kovacs v.

The Delaneys maintain that Kovacs is unsound because it relied upon judicial precedents for taxing postjudgment interest as authority for taxing prejudgment interest.  Consequently, they contend, Kovacs progeny such as Delaney are similarly flawed.  As their argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we decline to address it.  See, e.g., Villafane-Neriz v.

Since prejudgment interest is an element of damages under Rhode Island law, appellants argue, the entire $250,000 settlement must be excluded from gross income under section 104(a)(2) as damages for personal injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit, recently confronted with a similar problem, noted that though state law governs the nature of legal interests and rights created under state law, the \"federal tax consequences pertaining to such interests and rights are solely a matter of federal law.\"  Brabson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710956\"><a href=\"/opinion/710956/mary-brabson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1044 (Coffin, J.).  Accordingly, the Brabson panel first ascertained the pertinent characteristics of statutory prejudgment interest under Colorado law, but then looked to federal law to determine its excludability.  Id. at 1044.   As we agree with the thoughtful approach in Brabson, we turn first to Rhode Island law to determine the nature of the statutory prejudgment interest ministerially added by the superior court clerk to the personal injury damages award returned by the jury in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the Colorado statute at issue in Brabson, statutory prejudgment interest is not an element of damages in a personal injury action under Rhode Island law.

In Factory Mutual, the Rhode Island Supreme Court stated that the term \"damages\" included statutory prejudgment interest, id., 262 A.2d at 373, while interpreting the term \"damages\" as used in an insurance policy.  Id. at 371.   See also, e.g., Lombardi v. Merchants Mut. Ins.

In reaching its decision, the Brabson court looked to congressional intent and, most importantly, the \"default rule\" requirement that courts narrowly construe exclusions from gross income.  Brabson, 73 F.3d at 1045-1046</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The Delaneys do advert on appeal to a \"time loss value of money\" element in statutory prejudgment interest, and assert that it constitutes compensatory damages because it is designed to make the personal injury victim whole.  Their \"make whole\" claim was not preserved in the Tax Court, however.  See Villafane-Neriz, 75 F.3d at 734 (arguments first raised on appeal, not ordinarily addressed).  No argument was made below that the statutory prejudgment interest ministerially assessed by the clerk of court pursuant to Rhode Island law comprised both a taxable and a nontaxable component, nor did a \"make whole\" argument surface in any other developed manner before the Tax Court.  The sum total of their efforts to surface such a claim consisted of a quotation from the district court opinion subsequently reversed in Brabson, cited in service of the argument that prejudgment interest is an element of damages under Rhode Island law.  Even more importantly, appellants established no evidentiary predicate which would have enabled the Tax Court to determine what portion of the statutory prejudgment interest ministerially added by the clerk of court constituted \"make whole damages.\"   See United States v. Alzanki, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196113\"><a href=\"/opinion/196113/united-states-v-alzanki/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 1009 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Appellant's utter failure to [raise argument below] disabled the [court below] from making a reasoned assessment ... in the first instance, and from making the predicate factual findings upon which the claims depend.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
