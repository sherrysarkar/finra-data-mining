Sager, Merle Ruth Hass and\r\nLaw Offices of Marc Redlich, were on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                March 20, 1998\r\n                                           POLLAK, District Judge.  This case involves the extent of\r\nan employee's obligation to pursue contractual grievance procedures\r\nprior to--or in lieu of--bringing suit.  Plaintiff-appellant\r\nMichael Louis Brennan, a faculty member at Northeastern University,\r\nbrought suit in federal court in Massachusetts against\r\nNortheastern, its trustees, president, and provost, the dean of\r\nNortheastern's College of Engineering, and the acting chair of the\r\nuniversity's Department of Industrial Engineering and Information\r\nSystems.  Brennan alleged, inter alia, that defendants violated\r\nfederal and state anti-discrimination laws and breached his\r\ncontract of employment with Northeastern.  More specifically,\r\nBrennan contended that, as a tenure-track assistant professor, he\r\nwas eligible for promotion to tenure rank but was denied tenure\r\nbecause he was gay and HIV-positive.  \r\nThe district court granted defendants' motion for summary\r\njudgment on the ground that Brennan had failed to pursue the\r\ngrievance procedure governing adverse tenure decisions which was\r\nset out in the employee handbook and thereby incorporated into\r\nBrennan's employment contract.  Brennan then brought this appeal. \r\nBrennan acknowledges that he did not invoke the specified grievance\r\nprocedure, but he argues that the grievance procedure he bypassed\r\nwas not a remedy he was bound to invoke before presenting his\r\nclaims to a federal court.  With respect to Brennan's federal\r\nclaims and the bulk of his state claims, we agree and, accordingly,\r\nreverse in part.  With respect to Brennan's claims of breach of\r\ncontract, we hold that Massachusetts law required resort to\r\ncontractual remedies before suit.  We will therefore affirm on that\r\nissue.  \r\nI. Facts\r\nThe principal facts relevant to this appeal are not in\r\ndispute.  In 1988, appellant Brennan joined the Northeastern\r\nfaculty as a tenure-track assistant professor of industrial\r\nengineering.  During the 1993-94 academic year, he applied for\r\ntenure and was turned down.  Because the university has a policy\r\nthat limits non-tenured assistant professors to six years of\r\nemployment, Brennan was given a final contract for the 1994-95\r\nacademic year, after which his employment was terminated. \r\nBrennan's employment contract for 1993-94 expressly incorporated\r\nthe terms of the Northeastern University Faculty Handbook for that\r\nyear.  The handbook sets out (1) a general grievance procedure,\r\nwhich includes the possibility of \"binding arbitration,\" and (2) a\r\nseparate grievance procedure, governing tenure appeals, which\r\nincludes a form of arbitration characterized as \"binding\" but of\r\nlimited scope.\r\nA. Northeastern's Tenure Review and Appeals Procedures\r\nTenure Review\r\n\nTenure review at Northeastern is a multi-step process\r\nultimately leading to a decision by the board of trustees.\r\nInitially, the candidate's record is reviewed by at least three\r\ntenured members of his or her department.  This review leads to a\r\ndepartmental recommendation that is transmitted to the dean of the\r\ncollege.  The dean, in turn, makes a recommendation to the provost\r\nof the university.  The provost then makes a recommendation to the\r\nuniversity president.  In the last stage of the process, the\r\npresident makes a recommendation to the board of trustees, and the\r\nboard then makes a final decision.  At no stage of the procedure is\r\nthe recommendation of any evaluator binding upon the evaluator or\r\ndecision-maker at the next stage.\r\nTenure Appeals.  The tenure appeals process is made\r\navailable following a decision by the provost to recommend to the\r\npresident that the candidate's tenure application be denied.  \r\nThe precise course of the tenure appeals process varies\r\ndepending on whether the appellant makes a claim of, or including,\r\n\"discriminatory acts\" in connection with an adverse tenure\r\nrecommendation.  If a tenure candidate's appeal does not involve a\r\n\"formal claim of discriminatory acts,\" the candidate must bring his\r\nor her appeal before the University Standing Appeals Committee on\r\nTenure (\"the Appeals Committee\" or \"Committee\") within five days\r\nafter the candidate learns of the provost's adverse decision.  The\r\nAppeals Committee is composed of tenured faculty members from\r\nvarious schools of the university.  Upon concluding its inquiry,\r\nthe Committee makes a recommendation to the provost.  If the\r\nCommittee recommends in favor of the candidate, but the provost\r\ncontinues to maintain that tenure should be denied, the handbook\r\nauthorizes the candidate \"to submit procedural issues to binding\r\narbitration\" within ten days of learning of the provost's decision\r\nto proceed with the negative recommendation.  The handbook\r\nspecifies that \"[t]he decision of the arbitrator, within the scope\r\nof his or her jurisdiction, shall be final and binding on the\r\nparties to the dispute and the University; however, the arbitrator\r\nshall be without power to . . . (3) substitute his or her judgment\r\non the professional qualification of a faculty member for the\r\njudgment of any academic committee or official, or (4) engage in a\r\ncomparative review of the candidate's merits with those of other\r\ncandidates, or (5) grant or deny tenure.\"\r\nIf the arbitrator \"is convinced that the Provost's\r\ndecision is not reasonably supported by the record,\" the arbitrator\r\ncan require the provost to transmit to the president the Appeals\r\nCommittee's positive recommendation instead of the provost's\r\nnegative one.  As with all tenure evaluations received from the\r\nprovost, the president is not bound by such a recommendation.\r\nAlthough the foregoing procedures generally govern the\r\nAppeals Committee's consideration of a tenure decision, the\r\nhandbook provides a candidate with a different initial procedural\r\nroute if his or her appeal presents, or includes, issues of\r\ndiscrimination.  The manual instructs that a tenure candidate who\r\nbelieves that he or she has been subject to discrimination \"should\r\nconsult with\" the university's Office of Affirmative Action\r\n(\"OAA\").  In the event that a candidate institutes a tenure appeal,\r\nand the appeal involves \"formal claim[s] of discriminatory acts,\"\r\nthe handbook directs that the candidate present those claims to the\r\nOAA before the candidate's case will be considered by the Appeals\r\nCommittee.   The Appeals Committee will stay any issues not\r\ninvolving discrimination while the OAA conducts an investigation\r\nand makes findings.  If the OAA finds \"Reasonable Cause\"--that is,\r\nfacts supporting the claim of discrimination--it will transmit this\r\nfinding to the Appeals Committee, which will then consider the\r\nappeal.  (What weight this finding is to be given by the Appeals\r\nCommittee is left entirely unclear).  If, on the other hand, the\r\nOAA does not find \"Reasonable Cause,\" the Appeals Committee is to\r\ndismiss the discrimination issues and proceed to examine issues\r\nthat do not relate to discrimination (if any).  Thus, so long as\r\nany issues remain after the OAA makes its finding, the appeals\r\nprocess runs its course whether that finding is one of \"Reasonable\r\nCause\" or not; as explained above, the appeals process includes the\r\ncandidate's option to request arbitration if: (1) the Appeals\r\nCommittee makes a recommendation favorable to the candidate, and\r\n(2) the provost nonetheless states an intention to adhere to the\r\noriginal unfavorable recommendation.\r\n\nB. The Course of Events in Brennan's Case\r\nAlthough Brennan received positive recommendations at the\r\ndepartmental and decanal levels of review, the provost informed\r\nBrennan that he intended to recommend against the granting of\r\ntenure.  Brennan, apparently on the advice of counsel, eschewed the\r\nuniversity's tenure appeal process altogether.  That is to say,\r\nBrennan did not present his case to the Office of Affirmative\r\nAction or to the Appeals Committee.  (Not having sought Appeals\r\nCommittee review, Brennan could not have elected to present his\r\ncase to arbitration had he wished to do so).  Accordingly, the\r\nprovost transmitted his negative recommendation to the president. \r\nThe president in turn submitted a negative recommendation to the\r\nboard of trustees, and that body made the final decision to deny\r\ntenure.\r\nHaving been turned down at the highest level of\r\nuniversity decision-making, Brennan filed complaints with the\r\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") and the\r\nfederal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").  The MCAD\r\nissued a \"Lack of Probable Cause Finding,\" a decision that it\r\naffirmed on administrative appeal.  The EEOC also found no\r\nviolation, and issued a right-to-sue letter.\r\nBrennan then commenced this suit in the District Court\r\nfor the District of Massachusetts, alleging violation of the\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.,\r\nand the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.  794 et seq., as\r\nwell as several state-law claims, including breach of contract and\r\nviolation of anti-discrimination provisions of the Massachusetts\r\nConstitution and Massachusetts statutes.  The parties agree that\r\nall of Brennan's claims stem from his contention that he was denied\r\ntenure because of his sexual orientation and his HIV-positive\r\nstatus.\r\nNortheastern and its officials moved for dismissal or\r\nsummary judgment on the ground that Brennan had failed to pursue\r\nthe grievance procedure specified in his employment contract.  The\r\ndistrict court entered summary judgment in favor of the university\r\nand its fellow defendants, giving particular weight to the\r\n\"[f]ederal policy favor[ing] arbitration agreements.\"  Memorandum\r\nand Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Brennan v. King, No.\r\n96-11526, at 2 (D. Mass. Dec. 13, 1996). \"[P]laintiff's contract,\"\r\nthe court held, \"clearly commits tenure disputes to the\r\nUniversity's grievance and arbitration process.\"  Id. \r\nThe district court had federal question jurisdiction by\r\nvirtue of appellant's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  28 U.S.C.\r\n1331.  The district court also had supplemental jurisdiction over\r\nappellant's state-law claims because they arise from the same\r\noperative facts.  28 U.S.C.  1367(a). Because this is an appeal\r\nfrom entry of summary judgment, our review is de novo.  To the\r\nextent that any factual issues remain, we must resolve all such\r\nquestions in the way most favorable to the non-moving party.  SeeByrd v. Ronayne, 61 F.3d 1026, 1030 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nII.  Discussion\r\nIn bringing this lawsuit, Brennan has undertaken to place\r\nin issue the question whether Northeastern University was justified\r\nin denying him tenure, or whether, as Brennan asserts, the denial\r\nof tenure was based upon unacceptable grounds--namely that Brennan\r\nwas gay and HIV-positive.  But the district court, in granting\r\nsummary judgment in favor of the appellees, did not address the\r\nmerits of Brennan's claims.  Rather, the district court concluded\r\nthat Brennan was barred from coming to court because he had not\r\ntraveled the entire path of the grievance procedure which, pursuant\r\nto Brennan's contract of employment with Northeastern, was\r\navailable to him.  In particular, the district court, noting the\r\nstrong federal policy favoring arbitration, faulted Brennan for\r\npretermitting the arbitration aspect of the grievance procedure.  \r\nBrennan contends that the district court erred in its\r\nruling on the arbitration issue.  Brennan also argues that\r\nappellees have waived their arbitration defenses by not raising\r\nthem in the EEOC and MCAD proceedings.  For their part, appellees\r\nurge what appear to be two distinct grounds in support of\r\naffirmance: (1) both federal and state arbitration law required\r\nthat Brennan arbitrate his claims, and (2) some species of\r\nexhaustion doctrine required that Brennan utilize the university's\r\ngrievance process before resorting to court.  \r\nWe first address Brennan's waiver arguments.  We then\r\nconsider the principal questions in this case--whether the Federal\r\nArbitration Act, or its Massachusetts counterpart, or exhaustion\r\ndoctrine more broadly construed--required Brennan to pursue the\r\ngrievance procedure, including arbitration, described in his\r\ncontract of employment.  Finally, we turn to the question whether\r\nBrennan was required by Massachusetts common law to pursue the\r\ncontractual grievance procedure before suing for breach of\r\ncontract.\r\nA. Waiver\r\nAs a preliminary matter, we address Brennan's argument\r\nthat appellees waived their arbitration defenses because appellees\r\nfailed to raise them in the administrative proceedings before the\r\nEEOC and the MCAD.  The district court rejected this argument,\r\nfinding that \"the University counsel's . . . letter to the MCAD\r\n. . . discusses this failure at great length.\"  Memorandum and\r\nOrder on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, at 2 n.2.  In fact, the\r\nuniversity's letter to the MCAD does mention, in at least two\r\nplaces, the fact that Brennan did not exhaust the university's\r\ngrievance procedure prior to presenting his claim to the MCAD.\r\nBrennan, however, urges that appellees' mere mention of the fact\r\nthat he had not exhausted the procedure does not amount to raising\r\nthe issue as a defense, and that it is the failure to raise the\r\ndefense that constitutes waiver in this case.  Brennan contends\r\nthat, having failed to characterize the issue as a matter of\r\ndefense at the administrative agency level, appellees have\r\nforfeited their entitlement to raise the issue before the district\r\ncourt.\r\nIt is, of course, true that a court charged with\r\nreviewing determinations of another tribunal will not ordinarily\r\nconsider issues not raised in the earlier proceedings.  But that\r\ntruism is without application here since it was no part of the\r\nresponsibility of the district court to review the determinations\r\nof the EEOC or the MCAD.  Nor was it appellees' responsibility to\r\nraise arbitration as a defense in the administrative proceedings. \r\nAppellees' arbitration arguments do not constitute relevant\r\ndefenses before the EEOC.  As the Supreme Court recently noted, \"An\r\nindividual . . . claimant subject to an arbitration agreement will\r\nstill be free to file a charge with the EEOC, even though the\r\nclaimant is not able to institute a private judicial action.\" \r\nGilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 28 (1991). \r\nWe see no reason to suppose that the Massachusetts courts would\r\ntreat Brennan's state-law discrimination claims differently. \r\nTherefore, we do not find that appellees waived their arbitration\r\ndefenses by their failure--if failure there was--to raise before\r\neither of the administrative agencies contentions that would not\r\nhave been pertinent defenses in such a forum.   \r\nNor can it be said that appellees have advertently chosen\r\nto withhold their arbitration defenses during litigation in such a\r\nway that Brennan is prejudiced by the delay.  We have found\r\narbitration defenses waived when a party sought to take advantage\r\nof an arbitration clause by raising the issue as a defense late in\r\nthe litigation.  See, e.g., Menorah Ins. Co. v. INX Reinsurance\r\nCorp., 72 F.3d 218, 221 (1st Cir. 1995)(finding waiver where\r\narbitration was raised as defense to suit after a year of\r\nlitigation); Caribbean Insurance Services, Inc. v. American Bankers\r\nLife Assurance Co., 715 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1983) (finding waiver\r\nwhere party asserted arbitration as defense six months after being\r\nsued); Jones Motor Co. v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers Local\r\nUnion No. 633, 671 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.) (\"[T]o require that\r\nparties go to arbitration despite their having advanced so far in\r\ncourt proceedings before seeking arbitration would often be unfair,\r\nfor it would effectively allow a party sensing an adverse court\r\ndecision a second chance in another forum.\"), cert. denied, 459\r\nU.S. 943 (1982).  Appellees in this case, however, promptly raised\r\ntheir defenses in the district court, and it is to judicial, rather\r\nthan administrative, proceedings that we look to determine whether\r\nsuch waiver has occurred.  See Sevinor v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\r\nFenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 807 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1986) (finding no\r\nwaiver where defendants promptly raised arbitration as a defense to\r\na suit).  Accordingly, the district court did not err by\r\nconsidering the arbitration arguments advanced by Northeastern and\r\nits officials, and we therefore will entertain those arguments.\r\nB. Enforceability of the Handbook's Arbitration Provision\r\nWe first consider whether the Federal Arbitration Act\r\n(FAA) obligated Brennan to arbitrate his claims against\r\nNortheastern.   As we have had occasion to observe, \"a party\r\nseeking to substitute an arbitral forum for a judicial forum must\r\nshow, at a bare minimum, that the protagonists have agreed to\r\narbitrate some claims.\"  McCarthy v. Azure, 22 F.3d 351, 354-55\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).   This much appellees have shown.  The\r\nuniversity's faculty handbook describes a \"regular grievance\r\nprocedure\" committing issues other than tenure decisions to binding\r\narbitration and a separate process for submitting to binding\r\narbitration \"procedural issues\" relating to tenure review. \r\nTherefore, we apply FAA principles to this dispute.\r\nHaving determined that the FAA is here implicated, we\r\nconsider whether the dispute between Brennan and Northeastern that\r\nis the focus of this lawsuit is the sort of dispute that the\r\nparties agreed to arbitrate.  Although this is fundamentally an\r\nissue of contract interpretation--for which state law provides the\r\nbasic interpretive rules--our inquiry is informed by FAA\r\njurisprudence.  In FAA cases, Supreme Court precedents \"instruct\r\ncourts to use a particular hermeneutic principle for interpreting\r\nthe breadth of the agreement,\" viz., the presumption of\r\narbitrability.  McCarthy, 22 F.3d at 355.  This presumption\r\ndictates that \"as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning\r\nthe scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of\r\narbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the\r\ncontract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a\r\nlike defense to arbitrability.\"  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v.\r\nMercury Construction Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983).  Accordingly,\r\n\"in applying general state-law principles of contract\r\ninterpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement\r\nwithin the scope of the Act, due regard must be given to the\r\nfederal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the\r\nscope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of\r\narbitration.\"  Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Leland Stanford\r\nJunior University, 489 U.S. 468, 475-76 (1989) (citation omitted).\r\nThe presumption of arbitrability is a weighty additive to\r\nstate-law principles of contract construction, but it does not\r\nwholly supplant these principles.  As with other issues involving\r\nthe construction of individual employment contracts, in determining\r\nwhether a contract requires arbitration, \"courts generally . . .\r\nshould apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the\r\nformation of contracts.\"  First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, \r\n514 U.S. 938, 944 (1995).  At bottom, arbitration remains \"simply\r\na matter of contract between the parties; it is a way to resolve\r\nthose disputes--but only those disputes--that the parties have\r\nagreed to submit to arbitration.\" Id. at 943.  \r\nWe turn, therefore, to the application of these\r\nprinciples.  As the parties agree, Brennan's claims, though they\r\nare expressed as manifold causes of action, all concern the\r\nuniversity's denial of tenure to Brennan.  We therefore look to the\r\ncontract to determine whether the parties have agreed to submit\r\ntenure decisions to arbitration, resolving any doubts arising from\r\nthis interpretive enterprise in favor of arbitration. \r\nAs we have previously noted, Brennan's contract with\r\nNortheastern contains two arbitration provisions.  For non-tenure\r\nrelated grievances, the handbook establishes a grievance system\r\npotentially culminating in binding arbitration.  This general\r\ngrievance scheme contemplates a comparatively broad arbitral\r\nauthority for the resolution of faculty complaints of unfair or\r\ninequitable treatment or of misapplication of the handbook or other\r\ngoverning documents or regulations.  \r\nThe grievance procedure with respect to tenure disputes\r\nis wholly separate and evinces no broad arbitral authority to\r\nresolve such disputes.  The handbook does allow for a proceeding\r\nwithin the tenure consideration process labeled \"binding\r\narbitration.\"   But it is readily apparent that such arbitration as\r\nthe handbook contemplates could not have resolved Brennan's dispute\r\nwith the university.  To be sure, the handbook recites that an\r\narbitral decision \"shall be final and binding on the parties to the\r\ndispute and the University.\"  But the scope of what is subject to\r\narbitration is limited to \"procedural issues.\"  Although it is not\r\nat all clear what is embraced under the rubric of \"procedural\r\nissues,\" it is abundantly clear that among those things that the\r\narbitrator is \"without power to\" do is to \"grant or deny tenure.\" \r\nEvidently the arbitrator is confined to addressing non-substantive\r\nissues that may--but also may not--have some impact on the tenure\r\ndecision ultimately made by the university's trustees.    \r\nFurthermore, to the extent that the arbitrator can be\r\nsaid to have authority to \"bind\" the parties, including the\r\nuniversity, with respect to \"procedural issues,\" the narrowness of\r\nthat authority is plain to see.  In what would be, for the\r\nuniversity, the worst-case scenario--one in which the arbitrator\r\n\"is convinced that the Provost's decision [to transmit to the\r\npresident a negative tenure recommendation notwithstanding the\r\nAppeals Committee's positive recommendation] is not reasonably\r\nsupported by the record,\" all the arbitrator is empowered to do is\r\nrequire the \"Provost to transmit, to the President, the Standing\r\nAppeals Committee's positive recommendation in lieu of the\r\nProvost's own.\"  And both the president and the board of trustees\r\nremain entirely free to disregard the favorable Appeals Committee\r\nrecommendation forwarded by the provost pursuant to the\r\narbitrator's directive.  Consequently, the president will still\r\nreceive nothing more than a recommendation, not a conclusive\r\ndetermination.  Thus the most that a tenure candidate can achieve\r\nthrough arbitration is the substitution of the Appeals Committee's\r\npositive recommendation for the provost's negative recommendation.\r\nNor does the contract manifest an intent that arbitration\r\nbe the exclusive means for addressing a dispute over tenure.  The\r\nhandbook speaks only of the candidate having a \"right\" to request\r\narbitration.  It is true that there is authority for the\r\nproposition that in some circumstances courts have the power to\r\nenforce agreements that require arbitration even when such\r\narbitration is nonbinding.  See AMF, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., 621\r\nF. Supp. 456, 461 (E.D.N.Y. 1985) (Weinstein, J.) (holding an\r\nagreement requiring nonbinding arbitration enforceable under the\r\nFAA when there is a \"reasonable . . . expectation [that] the\r\ndispute will be settled\" by the procedure).  In this case, however,\r\nthe parties have made resort to arbitration the prerogative, but\r\nnot the obligation, of the tenure candidate.    \r\nNortheastern's arbitral procedure does not, therefore,\r\nprovide a forum for the entire resolution of a tenure candidate's\r\ndispute with Northeastern.  It merely serves to provide a formal\r\nsetting in which a candidate may seek reconsideration, on\r\ncircumscribed \"procedural\" grounds, of a provost's negative\r\nrecommendation.  Viewed closely, then, the arbitral procedure turns\r\nout to be an option that a candidate may invoke or not as he or she\r\nchooses--an option which, if invoked, has a very limited horizon. \r\nIt cannot be said that the employment contract crafted by\r\nNortheastern is one under which both the university and Brennan\r\nhave committed themselves to arbitrate disputes about tenure. \r\nNortheastern appears to have agreed that it would participate in a\r\nnarrowly confined form of arbitral process had Brennan chosen to\r\ninvoke the process.  But Brennan had no duty to make that choice. \r\nTherefore the presumption of arbitrability is overcome by the terms\r\nof the contract.\r\nWe have concluded that the Federal Arbitration Act did\r\nnot require Brennan to invoke the arbitral aspect of Northeastern's\r\ngrievance system.  We now turn to the question whether the\r\nMassachusetts Arbitration Act would call for a different result. \r\nWe conclude that it does not.  The Massachusetts Arbitration Act,\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 251  1 et seq. adopts the Uniform Arbitration\r\nAct, and its relevant language closely tracks that of the federal\r\nstatute.  The Massachusetts courts have interpreted this statute,\r\nas it relates to the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, in\r\nconformity with (and sometimes with reference to) federal\r\nauthority.  See, e.g., Unisys Finance Corp. v. Allan R. Hackel\r\nOrg., Inc., 676 N.E.2d 486, 489 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996); Town of\r\nDanvers v. Wexler Construction Co., Inc., 422 N.E.2d 782, 784\r\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1981).  Hence under Massachusetts arbitration law,\r\nwe find a similar presumption of arbitrability, which can similarly\r\nbe overcome by a showing that the particular dispute at issue is\r\nnot subject to arbitration by the terms of the agreement.  SeeUnisys, 676 N.E.2d at 489 (quoting Hurlbut v. Gantshar, 674 F.\r\nSupp. 385, 390 (D. Mass. 1987)(\"In the absence of an actual\r\nagreement to arbitrate a particular dispute or class of disputes,\r\nthe Court cannot compel arbitration.\")).  Therefore, for the\r\nreasons set forth above, we conclude that the Massachusetts\r\nArbitration Act did not require Brennan to arbitrate this dispute.\r\nC. Exhaustion\r\nAppellees also raise arguments that can be characterized\r\nas invoking exhaustion principles.  Although neither appellees'\r\nbrief nor appellant's brief separates the possible ingredients of\r\nthe concept of \"exhaustion,\" we think that, for the purposes of\r\ncoherent analysis, certain distinctions must be drawn.  First,\r\nappellees may be understood to be invoking familiar concepts of\r\nexhaustion of administrative remedies.  Alternatively (or\r\nadditionally), they may be regarded as arguing that some source of\r\nlaw requires exhaustion of possible contractual remedies before\r\nbringing suit.  We will discuss each of these possibilities.  As it\r\nrelates to Brennan's breach-of-contract claim, the contractual\r\nexhaustion issue merits independent consideration under state law\r\nand will accordingly be addressed separately below. \r\n  1.  Brennan's Statutory and  Constitutional Claims\r\nWe first consider Brennan's claims alleging violation of\r\nfederal and state anti-discrimination laws.  Brennan has alleged\r\nviolations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\r\n12101 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.  794 et seq.,\r\nand several Massachusetts anti-discrimination provisions, Mass.\r\nConst. art. 114 (prohibiting discrimination against handicapped\r\npersons); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4 (1), (16) (prohibiting\r\nemployment discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and\r\ndisability); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93,  103(a) (Massachusetts Equal\r\nRights Act).  \r\nIt is true that Brennan's claims under the ADA and under\r\nthe Massachusetts anti-discrimination statutes are subject to the\r\nexhaustion doctrine, which requires a claimant to pursue\r\nadministrative remedies before filing suit.  Brennan, however,\r\nfully pursued his discrimination claims with both the EEOC and the\r\nMCAD.  Appellees have not suggested that Brennan's pursuit of\r\nadministrative remedies was in any way inadequate to fulfill the\r\nexhaustion requirements that obtain.\r\nAppellees have, however, also sought to invoke the\r\nexhaustion doctrine in order to require Brennan to exhaust\r\npotential contractual remedies.  With respect to Brennan's federal\r\nand state civil rights claims, we find no ground to require this\r\ntype of exhaustion.  The federal statutes and the Massachusetts\r\nconstitutional and statutory provisions invoked by Brennan reveal\r\nno indication that potential contractual avenues of relief must be\r\npursued prior to suit.  Furthermore, appellees have not cited, and\r\nwe have not found, any cases suggesting that such a requirement\r\ninheres in the relevant federal or state provisions.  \r\nAppellees point out that the Supreme Court has required\r\nunion members who have a grievance under a collective bargaining\r\nagreement to invoke the grievance and arbitration machinery\r\nestablished by that contract before resort to court.  See Republic\r\nSteel v. Maddox, 379 U.S. 650, 652 (1965); Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S.\r\n171, 184 (1967).  Stated another way, in the collective bargaining\r\ncontext, there is a requirement that union members exhaust\r\navailable contractual remedies before bringing suit.  True as this\r\nis, it has no relevance to Brennan's federal and state statutory\r\nclaims or his state constitutional claims.  The record does not\r\nsuggest that Brennan is a member of a bargaining unit covered by a\r\ncollective bargaining agreement.  Appellees have pointed to no\r\ncases, nor have we found any, that extend the contractual\r\nexhaustion doctrine from federal labor law into the individual\r\nemployment setting to bar litigation of statutory or constitutional\r\ncivil rights claims. \r\nTo the extent that appellees' argument may be understood\r\nto invite us to make such an extension, we are unpersuaded. \r\nArbitration--as part of a contractual grievance procedure--is\r\ngranted an especially privileged position in labor law because it\r\nis considered integral to the bargaining process and serves to\r\navoid industrial conflict: \r\n\n  In the commercial case, arbitration is the\r\nsubstitute for litigation.  Here arbitration\r\nis the substitute for industrial strife. . . . \r\n[Arbitration of labor disputes under\r\ncollective bargaining agreements] is part and\r\nparcel of the collective bargaining process\r\nitself. \r\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement states\r\nthe rights and duties of the parties.  It is\r\nmore than a contract;  it is a generalized\r\ncode to govern a myriad of cases which the\r\ndraftsmen cannot wholly anticipate.  The\r\ncollective bargaining agreement covers the\r\nwhole employment relationship. \r\n\n  . . . Arbitration is the means of solving\r\nthe unforeseeable by molding a system of\r\nprivate law for all the problems which may\r\narise and to provide for their solution in a\r\nway which will generally accord with the\r\nvariant needs and desires of the parties.  The\r\nprocessing of disputes through the grievance\r\nmachinery is actually a vehicle by which\r\nmeaning and content are given to the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement. \r\n\n  . . . The grievance procedure is, in other\r\nwords, a part of the continuous collective\r\nbargaining process.  It, rather than a strike,\r\nis the terminal point of a disagreement. \r\n\nUnited Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co.,\r\n363 U.S. 574, 578-79 (1960)(footnotes and citations omitted).  \r\nThus the exhaustion requirement in federal labor law\r\nserves to protect the integrity of collective bargaining as a\r\nwhole.  No comparable interests would be served by enforcing an\r\nexhaustion requirement here.  Brennan is not seeking to vindicate\r\ncontractual rights secured through the collective bargaining\r\nprocess; rather, he is suing to vindicate individual rights\r\nconferred by federal and state law.  Furthermore, as the discussion\r\nin part II.B above demonstrates, the \"arbitration\" provided by the\r\nuniversity's contract with Brennan is, with respect to tenure\r\ndisputes, neither capable of rendering a binding judgment nor\r\ncontractually mandatory.  Thus it does not share the usual features\r\nof the grievance and arbitration mechanisms typical of collective\r\nbargaining agreements.  The arbitration clause at issue here is not\r\na vehicle for giving meaning to a \"generalized code,\" but a\r\nmechanism that can be fairly characterized as contemplating a\r\npurely advisory function within a narrowly circumscribed grant of\r\njurisdiction.  Consequently, we conclude that Brennan was not bound\r\nto exhaust the arbitration aspect of the handbook procedure before\r\nbringing his  discrimination claims.           \r\n  2.  Brennan's State-Law Claim for Breach of Contract\r\nAlthough there is no source of law indicating that\r\nBrennan was bound to exhaust the contractual grievance mechanism\r\nprior to bringing suit on his federal and state statutory and his\r\nstate constitutional claims, Massachusetts law does require, at\r\nleast in some instances, that contractual grievance procedures be\r\npursued before suit may be brought under the common law of\r\nMassachusetts for breach of an employment contract.  In O'Brien v.\r\nNew England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 664 N.E.2d 843, 849 (Mass.\r\n1996), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that when\r\nan employee manual constituting an enforceable contract of\r\nemployment sets up a grievance procedure, an employee who refuses\r\nto use that procedure may not resort to a judicial forum to assert\r\nclaims of wrongful discharge based on that manual.  \r\nThe plaintiff in O'Brien sued for wrongful discharge,\r\nbasing her claim upon an employee manual that set forth a four-step\r\ngrievance procedure for claims \"that an employee has, in any\r\nmanner, been unfairly treated.\"  Id. at 849.  O'Brien, however,\r\ndeclined to invoke the manual's procedures and instead brought her\r\nwrongful discharge action in state court.  After O'Brien won a jury\r\nverdict, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts granted direct\r\nreview and reversed.\r\n The court ruled that the manual not only created rights\r\nenforceable by the employee, but also obligations that bound the\r\nemployee.  Id. at 848-49.  The court concluded that O'Brien was\r\nobligated to pursue the contractual grievance procedures set forth\r\nin the manual:\r\n\n  When a collective bargaining agreement\r\nprovides a grievance procedure, the general\r\nrule is that the remedies specified in the\r\nagreement be exhausted before an employee may\r\nresort to the courts.  . . . .  We see no\r\njustification for treating differently an\r\nemployee asserting rights under a personnel\r\nmanual that contains a grievance procedure\r\n. . . .\r\n\n  The grievance procedure provided a ready\r\nmeans by which O'Brien could have brought to\r\nthe attention of management [a supervisor's]\r\nunfair treatment of her . . . .  Pursuit of\r\nthis available process might have demonstrated\r\nsufficient mitigating circumstances to rebut\r\nwhat management might otherwise have perceived\r\nas \"gross violations\" of rules or law that\r\nwere \"cause for immediate discharge.\"\r\n\nId. at 849.  Hence, we take O'Brien as a determination that, as a\r\nmatter of Massachusetts employment law, one who alleges wrongful\r\ntermination based upon a contract of employment which includes a\r\ngrievance procedure cannot seek vindication of the claim in court\r\nwithout first invoking the contractual grievance procedure.   \r\nSince Brennan's claims of common-law breach of contract\r\nare predicated upon a contract of employment containing a grievance\r\nprocedure, we find that these claims are not meaningfully\r\ndistinguishable from the claims pursued in O'Brien.  In light of\r\nthe Supreme Judicial Court's ruling in O'Brien, then, we conclude\r\nthat, under Massachusetts law, Brennan was required to pursue the\r\ngrievance procedure outlined in his contract of employment before\r\nmaintaining suit for breach of the employment contract, and we\r\ntherefore affirm on that issue.\r\n                   Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district\r\ncourt granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants is\r\nreversed with respect to Brennan's non-contractual claims.  The\r\ndistrict court's judgment is affirmed as to Brennan's claims of\r\nbreach of contract.  The case is remanded for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion.\r\n",

Plaintiff-appellant Michael Louis Brennan, a faculty member at Northeastern University, brought suit in federal court in Massachusetts against Northeastern, its trustees, president, and provost, the dean of Northeastern's College of Engineering, and the acting chair of the university's Department of Industrial Engineering and Information Systems.  Brennan alleged, inter alia, that defendants violated federal and state anti-discrimination laws and breached his contract of employment with Northeastern.  More specifically, Brennan contended that, as a tenure-track assistant professor, he was eligible for promotion to tenure rank but was denied tenure because he was gay and HIV-positive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground that Brennan had failed to pursue the grievance procedure governing adverse tenure decisions which was set out in the employee handbook and thereby incorporated into Brennan's employment contract.  Brennan then brought this appeal.  Brennan acknowledges that he did not invoke the specified grievance procedure, but he argues that the grievance procedure he bypassed was not a remedy he was bound to invoke before presenting his claims to a federal court.  With respect to Brennan's federal claims and the bulk of his state claims, we agree and, accordingly, reverse in part.  With respect to Brennan's claims of breach of contract, we hold that Massachusetts law required resort to contractual remedies before suit.  We will therefore affirm on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.  In 1988, appellant Brennan joined the Northeastern faculty as a tenure-track assistant professor of industrial engineering.  During the 1993-94 academic year, he applied for tenure and was turned down.  Because the university has a policy that limits non-tenured assistant professors to six years of employment, Brennan was given a final contract for the 1994-95 academic year, after which his employment was terminated.  Brennan's employment contract for 1993-94 expressly incorporated the terms of the Northeastern University Faculty Handbook for that year.  The handbook sets out (1) a general grievance procedure, which includes the possibility of \"binding arbitration,\" and (2) a separate grievance procedure, governing tenure appeals, which includes a form of arbitration characterized as \"binding\" but of limited scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Northeastern's Tenure Review and Appeals Procedures Tenure Review</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenure review at Northeastern is a multi-step process ultimately leading to a decision by the board of trustees.  Initially, the candidate's record is reviewed by at least three tenured members of his or her department.  This review leads to a departmental recommendation that is transmitted to the dean of the college.  The dean, in turn, makes a recommendation to the provost of the university.  The provost then makes a recommendation to the university president.  In the last stage of the process, the president makes a recommendation to the board of trustees, and the board then makes a final decision.  At no stage of the procedure is the recommendation of any evaluator binding upon the evaluator or decision-maker at the next stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenure Appeals.   The tenure appeals process is made available following a decision by the provost to recommend to the president that the candidate's tenure application be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise course of the tenure appeals process varies depending on whether the appellant makes a claim of, or including, \"discriminatory acts\" in connection with an adverse tenure recommendation.  If a tenure candidate's appeal does not involve a \"formal claim of discriminatory acts,\" the candidate must bring his or her appeal before the University Standing Appeals Committee on Tenure (\"the Appeals Committee\" or \"Committee\") within five days after the candidate learns of the provost's adverse decision.  The Appeals Committee is composed of tenured faculty members from various schools of the university.  Upon concluding its inquiry, the Committee makes a recommendation to the provost.  If the Committee recommends in favor of the candidate, but the provost continues to maintain that tenure should be denied, the handbook authorizes the candidate \"to submit procedural issues to binding arbitration\" within ten days of learning of the provost's decision to proceed with the negative recommendation.  The handbook specifies that \"[t]he decision of the arbitrator, within the scope of his or her jurisdiction, shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and the University;  however, the arbitrator shall be without power to ... (3) substitute his or her judgment on the professional qualification of a faculty member for the judgment of any academic committee or official, or (4) engage in a comparative review of the candidate's merits with those of other candidates, or (5) grant or deny tenure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the arbitrator \"is convinced that the Provost's decision is not reasonably supported by the record,\" the arbitrator can require the provost to transmit to the president the Appeals Committee's positive recommendation instead of the provost's negative one.  As with all tenure evaluations received from the provost, the president is not bound by such a recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the foregoing procedures generally govern the Appeals Committee's consideration of a tenure decision, the handbook provides a candidate with a different initial procedural route if his or her appeal presents, or includes, issues of discrimination.  The manual instructs that a tenure candidate who believes that he or she has been subject to discrimination \"should consult with\" the university's Office of Affirmative Action (\"OAA\").  In the event that a candidate institutes a tenure appeal, and the appeal involves \"formal claim[s] of discriminatory acts,\" the handbook directs that the candidate present those claims to the OAA before the candidate's case will be considered by the Appeals Committee.  The Appeals Committee will stay any issues not involving discrimination while the OAA conducts an investigation and makes findings.  If the OAA finds \"Reasonable Cause\"--that is, facts supporting the claim of discrimination--it will transmit this finding to the Appeals Committee, which will then consider the appeal.  (What weight this finding is to be given by the Appeals Committee is left entirely unclear).  If, on the other hand, the OAA does not find \"Reasonable Cause,\" the Appeals Committee is to dismiss the discrimination issues and proceed to examine issues that do not relate to discrimination (if any).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Thus, so long as any issues remain after the OAA makes its finding, the appeals process runs its course whether that finding is one of \"Reasonable Cause\" or not;  as explained above, the appeals process includes the candidate's option to request arbitration if:  (1) the Appeals Committee makes a recommendation favorable to the candidate, and (2) the provost nonetheless states an intention to adhere to the original unfavorable recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Course of Events in Brennan's Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Brennan received positive recommendations at the departmental and decanal levels of review, the provost informed Brennan that he intended to recommend against the granting of tenure.  Brennan, apparently on the advice of counsel, eschewed the university's tenure appeal process altogether.  That is to say, Brennan did not present his case to the Office of Affirmative Action or to the Appeals Committee.  (Not having sought Appeals Committee review, Brennan could not have elected to present his case to arbitration had he wished to do so).  Accordingly, the provost transmitted his negative recommendation to the president.  The president in turn submitted a negative recommendation to the board of trustees, and that body made the final decision to deny tenure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having been turned down at the highest level of university decision-making, Brennan filed complaints with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").  The MCAD issued a \"Lack of Probable Cause Finding,\" a decision that it affirmed on administrative appeal.  The EEOC also found no violation, and issued a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennan then commenced this suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 et seq., as well as several state-law claims, including breach of contract and violation of anti-discrimination provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution and Massachusetts statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The parties agree that all of Brennan's claims stem from his contention that he was denied tenure because of his sexual orientation and his HIV-positive status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Northeastern and its officials moved for dismissal or summary judgment on the ground that Brennan had failed to pursue the grievance procedure specified in his employment contract.  The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the university and its fellow defendants, giving particular weight to the \"[f]ederal policy favor[ing] arbitration agreements.\"  Memorandum and Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Brennan v. King, No. 96-11526, at 2 (D.Mass. Dec. 13, 1996).  \"[P]laintiff's contract,\" the court held, \"clearly commits tenure disputes to the University's grievance and arbitration process.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had federal question jurisdiction by virtue of appellant's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.  The district court also had supplemental jurisdiction over appellant's state-law claims because they arise from the same operative facts.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a).  Because this is an appeal from entry of summary judgment, our review is de novo.   To the extent that any factual issues remain, we must resolve all such questions in the way most favorable to the non-moving party.  See Byrd v. Ronayne, 61 F.3d 1026, 1030 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In bringing this lawsuit, Brennan has undertaken to place in issue the question whether Northeastern University was justified in denying him tenure, or whether, as Brennan asserts, the denial of tenure was based upon unacceptable grounds--namely that Brennan was gay and HIV-positive.  But the district court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees, did not address the merits of Brennan's claims.  Rather, the district court concluded that Brennan was barred from coming to court because he had not traveled the entire path of the grievance procedure which, pursuant to Brennan's contract of employment with Northeastern, was available to him.  In particular, the district court, noting the strong federal policy favoring arbitration, faulted Brennan for pretermitting the arbitration aspect of the grievance procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennan contends that the district court erred in its ruling on the arbitration issue.  Brennan also argues that appellees have waived their arbitration defenses by not raising them in the EEOC and MCAD proceedings. For their part, appellees urge what appear to be two distinct grounds in support of affirmance:  (1) both federal and state arbitration law required that Brennan arbitrate his claims, and (2) some species of exhaustion doctrine required that Brennan utilize the university's grievance process before resorting to court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address Brennan's waiver arguments.  We then consider the principal questions in this case--whether the Federal Arbitration Act, or its Massachusetts counterpart, or exhaustion doctrine more broadly construed--required Brennan to pursue the grievance procedure, including arbitration, described in his contract of employment.  Finally, we turn to the question whether Brennan was required by Massachusetts common law to pursue the contractual grievance procedure before suing for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, we address Brennan's argument that appellees waived their arbitration defenses because appellees failed to raise them in the administrative proceedings before the EEOC and the MCAD.  The district court rejected this argument, finding that \"the University counsel's ... letter to the MCAD ... discusses this failure at great length.\"   Memorandum and Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, at 2 n. 2. In fact, the university's letter to the MCAD does mention, in at least two places, the fact that Brennan did not exhaust the university's grievance procedure prior to presenting his claim to the MCAD.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Brennan, however, urges that appellees' mere mention of the fact that he had not exhausted the procedure does not amount to raising the issue as a defense, and that it is the failure to raise the defense that constitutes waiver in this case.  Brennan contends that, having failed to characterize the issue as a matter of defense at the administrative agency level, appellees have forfeited their entitlement to raise the issue before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, true that a court charged with reviewing determinations of another tribunal will not ordinarily consider issues not raised in the earlier proceedings.  But that truism is without application here since it was no part of the responsibility of the district court to review the determinations of the EEOC or the MCAD.  Nor was it appellees' responsibility to raise arbitration as a defense in the administrative proceedings.  Appellees' arbitration arguments do not constitute relevant defenses before the EEOC.  As the Supreme Court recently noted, \"An individual ... claimant subject to an arbitration agreement will still be free to file a charge with the EEOC, even though the claimant is not able to institute a private judicial action.\"  Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 1653, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991).  We see no reason to suppose that the Massachusetts courts would treat Brennan's state-law discrimination claims differently.  Therefore, we do not find that appellees waived their arbitration defenses by their failure--if failure there was--to raise before either of the administrative agencies contentions that would not have been pertinent defenses in such a forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can it be said that appellees have advertently chosen to withhold their arbitration defenses during litigation in such a way that Brennan is prejudiced by the delay.  We have found arbitration defenses waived when a party sought to take advantage of an arbitration clause by raising the issue as a defense late in the litigation.  See, e.g., Menorah Ins. Co. v. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d 218, 221 (1st Cir.1995)(finding waiver where arbitration was raised as defense to suit after a year of litigation);  Caribbean Insurance Services, Inc. v. American Bankers Life Assurance Co., 715 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1983) (finding waiver where party asserted arbitration as defense six months after being sued);  Jones Motor Co. v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers Local Union No. 633, 671 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.)  (\"[T]o require that parties go to arbitration despite their having advanced so far in court proceedings before seeking arbitration would often be unfair, for it would effectively allow a party sensing an adverse court decision a second chance in another forum.\"), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 943, 103 S.Ct. 257, 74 L.Ed.2d 200 (1982).  Appellees in this case, however, promptly raised their defenses in the district court, and it is to judicial, rather than administrative, proceedings that we look to determine whether such waiver has occurred.  See Sevinor v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 807 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1986) (finding no waiver where defendants promptly raised arbitration as a defense to a suit).  Accordingly, the district court did not err by considering the arbitration arguments advanced by Northeastern and its officials, and we therefore will entertain those arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Enforceability of the Handbook's Arbitration Provision</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) obligated Brennan to arbitrate his claims against Northeastern.  As we have had occasion to observe, \"a party seeking to substitute an arbitral forum for a judicial forum must show, at a bare minimum, that the protagonists have agreed to arbitrate some claims.\"  McCarthy v. Azure, 22 F.3d 351, 354-55 (1st Cir.1994).  This much appellees have shown.  The university's faculty handbook describes a \"regular grievance procedure\" committing issues other than tenure decisions to binding arbitration and a separate process for submitting to binding arbitration \"procedural issues\" relating to tenure review.  Therefore, we apply FAA principles to this dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the FAA is here implicated, we consider whether the dispute between Brennan and Northeastern that is the focus of this lawsuit is the sort of dispute that the parties agreed to arbitrate.  Although this is fundamentally an issue of contract interpretation--for which state law provides the basic interpretive rules--our inquiry is informed by FAA jurisprudence.  In FAA cases, Supreme Court precedents \"instruct courts to use a particular hermeneutic principle for interpreting the breadth of the agreement,\" viz., the presumption of arbitrability.  McCarthy, 22 F.3d at 355.   This presumption dictates that \"as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\"  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 941, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).  Accordingly, \"in applying general state-law principles of contract interpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the Act, due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.\"  Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Leland Stanford Junior University, 489 U.S. 468, 475-76, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1254, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presumption of arbitrability is a weighty additive to state-law principles of contract construction, but it does not wholly supplant these principles.  As with other issues involving the construction of individual employment contracts, in determining whether a contract requires arbitration, \"courts generally ... should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\"  First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 1924, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995).  At bottom, arbitration remains \"simply a matter of contract between the parties;  it is a way to resolve those disputes--but only those disputes--that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\"  Id. at 943, 115 S.Ct. at 1924.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, therefore, to the application of these principles.  As the parties agree, Brennan's claims, though they are expressed as manifold causes of action, all concern the university's denial of tenure to Brennan.  We therefore look to the contract to determine whether the parties have agreed to submit tenure decisions to arbitration, resolving any doubts arising from this interpretive enterprise in favor of arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have previously noted, Brennan's contract with Northeastern contains two arbitration provisions.  For non-tenure related grievances, the handbook establishes a grievance system potentially culminating in binding arbitration.  This general grievance scheme contemplates a comparatively broad arbitral authority for the resolution of faculty complaints of unfair or inequitable treatment or of misapplication of the handbook or other governing documents or regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grievance procedure with respect to tenure disputes is wholly separate and evinces no broad arbitral authority to resolve such disputes.  The handbook does allow for a proceeding within the tenure consideration process labeled \"binding arbitration.\"   But it is readily apparent that such arbitration as the handbook contemplates could not have resolved Brennan's dispute with the university.  To be sure, the handbook recites that an arbitral decision \"shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and the University.\"   But the scope of what is subject to arbitration is limited to \"procedural issues.\"   Although it is not at all clear what is embraced under the rubric of \"procedural issues,\" it is abundantly clear that among those things that the arbitrator is \"without power to\" do is to \"grant or deny tenure.\"   Evidently the arbitrator is confined to addressing non-substantive issues that may--but also may not--have some impact on the tenure decision ultimately made by the university's trustees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, to the extent that the arbitrator can be said to have authority to \"bind\" the parties, including the university, with respect to \"procedural issues,\" the narrowness of that authority is plain to see.  In what would be, for the university, the worst-case scenario--one in which the arbitrator \"is convinced that the Provost's decision [to transmit to the president a negative tenure recommendation notwithstanding the Appeals Committee's positive recommendation] is not reasonably supported by the record,\" all the arbitrator is empowered to do is require the \"Provost to transmit, to the President, the Standing Appeals Committee's positive recommendation in lieu of the Provost's own.\"   And both the president and the board of trustees remain entirely free to disregard the favorable Appeals Committee recommendation forwarded by the provost pursuant to the arbitrator's directive.  Consequently, the president will still receive nothing more than a recommendation, not a conclusive determination.  Thus the most that a tenure candidate can achieve through arbitration is the substitution of the Appeals Committee's positive recommendation for the provost's negative recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the contract manifest an intent that arbitration be the exclusive means for addressing a dispute over tenure.  The handbook speaks only of the candidate having a \"right\" to request arbitration.  It is true that there is authority for the proposition that in some circumstances courts have the power to enforce agreements that require arbitration even when such arbitration is nonbinding.  See AMF, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., 621 F.Supp. 456, 461 (E.D.N.Y.1985) (Weinstein, J.)  (holding an agreement requiring nonbinding arbitration enforceable under the FAA when there is a \"reasonable ... expectation [that] the dispute will be settled\" by the procedure).  In this case, however, the parties have made resort to arbitration the prerogative, but not the obligation, of the tenure candidate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Northeastern's arbitral procedure does not, therefore, provide a forum for the entire resolution of a tenure candidate's dispute with Northeastern.  It merely serves to provide a formal setting in which a candidate may seek reconsideration, on circumscribed \"procedural\" grounds, of a provost's negative recommendation.  Viewed closely, then, the arbitral procedure turns out to be an option that a candidate may invoke or not as he or she chooses--an option which, if invoked, has a very limited horizon.  It cannot be said that the employment contract crafted by Northeastern is one under which both the university and Brennan have committed themselves to arbitrate disputes about tenure.  Northeastern appears to have agreed that it would participate in a narrowly confined form of arbitral process had Brennan chosen to invoke the process.  But Brennan had no duty to make that choice.  Therefore the presumption of arbitrability is overcome by the terms of the contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have concluded that the Federal Arbitration Act did not require Brennan to invoke the arbitral aspect of Northeastern's grievance system.  We now turn to the question whether the Massachusetts Arbitration Act would call for a different result.  We conclude that it does not.  The Massachusetts Arbitration Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 251 &#167; 1 et seq. adopts the Uniform Arbitration Act, and its relevant language closely tracks that of the federal statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Massachusetts courts have interpreted this statute, as it relates to the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, in conformity with (and sometimes with reference to) federal authority.  See, e.g., Unisys Finance Corp. v. Allan R. Hackel Org., Inc., 42 Mass.App.Ct. 275, 676 N.E.2d 486, 489 (1997);  Town of Danvers v. Wexler Construction Co., Inc., 12 Mass.App.Ct. 160, 422 N.E.2d 782, 784 (1981).  Hence under Massachusetts arbitration law, we find a similar presumption of arbitrability, which can similarly be overcome by a showing that the particular dispute at issue is not subject to arbitration by the terms of the agreement.  See Unisys, 676 N.E.2d at 489 (quoting Hurlbut v. Gantshar, 674 F.Supp. 385, 390 (D.Mass.1987)(\"In the absence of an actual agreement to arbitrate a particular dispute or class of disputes, the Court cannot compel arbitration.\")).  Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the Massachusetts Arbitration Act did not require Brennan to arbitrate this dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Exhaustion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees also raise arguments that can be characterized as invoking exhaustion principles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Although neither appellees' brief nor appellant's brief separates the possible ingredients of the concept of \"exhaustion,\" we think that, for the purposes of coherent analysis, certain distinctions must be drawn.  First, appellees may be understood to be invoking familiar concepts of exhaustion of administrative remedies.  Alternatively (or additionally), they may be regarded as arguing that some source of law requires exhaustion of possible contractual remedies before bringing suit.  We will discuss each of these possibilities.  As it relates to Brennan's breach-of-contract claim, the contractual exhaustion issue merits independent consideration under state law and will accordingly be addressed separately below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>1. Brennan's Statutory and Constitutional Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider Brennan's claims alleging violation of federal and state anti-discrimination laws.  Brennan has alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 et seq., and several Massachusetts anti-discrimination provisions, Mass.  Const. art. 114 (prohibiting discrimination against handicapped persons);  Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1), (16) (prohibiting employment discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and disability);  Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 93, &#167; 103(a) (Massachusetts Equal Rights Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Brennan's claims under the ADA and under the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statutes are subject to the exhaustion doctrine, which requires a claimant to pursue administrative remedies before filing suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Brennan, however, fully pursued his discrimination claims with both the EEOC and the MCAD.  Appellees have not suggested that Brennan's pursuit of administrative remedies was in any way inadequate to fulfill the exhaustion requirements that obtain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees have, however, also sought to invoke the exhaustion doctrine in order to require Brennan to exhaust potential contractual remedies.  With respect to Brennan's federal and state civil rights claims, we find no ground to require this type of exhaustion.  The federal statutes and the Massachusetts constitutional and statutory provisions invoked by Brennan reveal no indication that potential contractual avenues of relief must be pursued prior to suit.  Furthermore, appellees have not cited, and we have not found, any cases suggesting that such a requirement inheres in the relevant federal or state provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees point out that the Supreme Court has required union members who have a grievance under a collective bargaining agreement to invoke the grievance and arbitration machinery established by that contract before resort to court.  See Republic Steel v. Maddox, 379 U.S. 650, 652, 85 S.Ct. 614, 616, 13 L.Ed.2d 580 (1965);  Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 184, 87 S.Ct. 903, 913-14, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967).  Stated another way, in the collective bargaining context, there is a requirement that union members exhaust available contractual remedies before bringing suit.  True as this is, it has no relevance to Brennan's federal and state statutory claims or his state constitutional claims.  The record does not suggest that Brennan is a member of a bargaining unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Appellees have pointed to no cases, nor have we found any, that extend the contractual exhaustion doctrine from federal labor law into the individual employment setting to bar litigation of statutory or constitutional civil rights claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that appellees' argument may be understood to invite us to make such an extension, we are unpersuaded.  Arbitration--as part of a contractual grievance procedure--is granted an especially privileged position in labor law because it is considered integral to the bargaining process and serves to avoid industrial conflict:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the commercial case, arbitration is the substitute for litigation.  Here arbitration is the substitute for industrial strife....  [Arbitration of labor disputes under collective bargaining agreements] is part and parcel of the collective bargaining process itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The collective bargaining agreement states the rights and duties of the parties.  It is more than a contract;  it is a generalized code to govern a myriad of cases which the draftsmen cannot wholly anticipate.  The collective bargaining agreement covers the whole employment relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... Arbitration is the means of solving the unforeseeable by molding a system of private law for all the problems which may arise and to provide for their solution in a way which will generally accord with the variant needs and desires of the parties.  The processing of disputes through the grievance machinery is actually a vehicle by which meaning and content are given to the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... The grievance procedure is, in other words, a part of the continuous collective bargaining process.  It, rather than a strike, is the terminal point of a disagreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 578-79, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1351-52, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960)(footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the exhaustion requirement in federal labor law serves to protect the integrity of collective bargaining as a whole.  No comparable interests would be served by enforcing an exhaustion requirement here.  Brennan is not seeking to vindicate contractual rights secured through the collective bargaining process;  rather, he is suing to vindicate individual rights conferred by federal and state law.  Furthermore, as the discussion in part II.B above demonstrates, the \"arbitration\" provided by the university's contract with Brennan is, with respect to tenure disputes, neither capable of rendering a binding judgment nor contractually mandatory.  Thus it does not share the usual features of the grievance and arbitration mechanisms typical of collective bargaining agreements.  The arbitration clause at issue here is not a vehicle for giving meaning to a \"generalized code,\" but a mechanism that can be fairly characterized as contemplating a purely advisory function within a narrowly circumscribed grant of jurisdiction.  Consequently, we conclude that Brennan was not bound to exhaust the arbitration aspect of the handbook procedure before bringing his discrimination claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>2. Brennan's State-Law Claim for Breach of Contract</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there is no source of law indicating that Brennan was bound to exhaust the contractual grievance mechanism prior to bringing suit on his federal and state statutory and his state constitutional claims, Massachusetts law does require, at least in some instances, that contractual grievance procedures be pursued before suit may be brought under the common law of Massachusetts for breach of an employment contract.  In O'Brien v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 422 Mass. 686, 664 N.E.2d 843, 849 (1996), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that when an employee manual constituting an enforceable contract of employment sets up a grievance procedure, an employee who refuses to use that procedure may not resort to a judicial forum to assert claims of wrongful discharge based on that manual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff in O'Brien sued for wrongful discharge, basing her claim upon an employee manual that set forth a four-step grievance procedure for claims \"that an employee has, in any manner, been unfairly treated.\"  Id. 664 N.E.2d at 849.   O'Brien, however, declined to invoke the manual's procedures and instead brought her wrongful discharge action in state court.  After O'Brien won a jury verdict, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts granted direct review and reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ruled that the manual not only created rights enforceable by the employee, but also obligations that bound the employee.  Id. at 848-49.   The court concluded that O'Brien was obligated to pursue the contractual grievance procedures set forth in the manual:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a collective bargaining agreement provides a grievance procedure, the general rule is that the remedies specified in the agreement be exhausted before an employee may resort to the courts.  ....   We see no justification for treating differently an employee asserting rights under a personnel manual that contains a grievance procedure....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grievance procedure provided a ready means by which O'Brien could have brought to the attention of management [a supervisor's] unfair treatment of her....  Pursuit of this available process might have demonstrated sufficient mitigating circumstances to rebut what management might otherwise have perceived as \"gross violations\" of rules or law that were \"cause for immediate discharge.\"Id. at 849.   Hence, we take O'Brien as a determination that, as a matter of Massachusetts employment law, one who alleges wrongful termination based upon a contract of employment which includes a grievance procedure cannot seek vindication of the claim in court without first invoking the contractual grievance procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Brennan's claims of common-law breach of contract are predicated upon a contract of employment containing a grievance procedure, we find that these claims are not meaningfully distinguishable from the claims pursued in O'Brien.   In light of the Supreme Judicial Court's ruling in O'Brien, then, we conclude that, under Massachusetts law, Brennan was required to pursue the grievance procedure outlined in his contract of employment before maintaining suit for breach of the employment contract, and we therefore affirm on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants is reversed with respect to Brennan's non-contractual claims.  The district court's judgment is affirmed as to Brennan's claims of breach of contract.  The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3.d of the tenure appeal procedure provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>2) If the Provost recommends against tenure although the Appeals Committee has recommended that tenure be granted, s/he shall communicate this to the candidate before sending the recommendations of the Committee and of the Provost to the President.

Since Brennan's employment did not involve interstate commerce in this narrow sense, the exclusion does not apply to Brennan's contract with Northeastern</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Section I.D of the handbook, entitled \"Faculty Grievance Procedure,\" describes a somewhat elaborate procedure governing grievances between faculty members and the university (other than tenure-related disputes).  The handbook defines a grievance as a \"complaint by a faculty member that he or she:  1) has been subject to a violation, misinterpretation or inequitable application of the Faculty Handbook, Academic Operations Manual, or other published University or unit regulations;  or 2) has otherwise been treated unfairly or inequitably.\"   The handbook provides a multi-step process for resolving such complaints.  The grievant is encouraged to seek informal resolution.  A formal grievance must, however, be filed within three months \"after the faculty member became aware of the grievable event.\"   The grievant may elect to secure \"early provostial review\" or may invoke the general procedure, which contemplates \"mediation by an ad hoc Faculty Committee.\"   Should the grievant be dissatisfied with the ad hoc committee's disposition, he or she may request arbitration.  However, the grievant is only entitled to arbitrate the grievance if the ad hoc faculty mediation committee decides that the grievance should be arbitrated.  With respect to the arbitrator's authority, the handbook provides:</p>\n        <p>The decision of the arbitrator, within the scope of his or her jurisdiction, shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and the University;  however, the arbitrator shall be without power to</p>\n        <p>a) make a decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law;</p>\n        <p>b) substitute his or judgment on the professional qualification of a faculty member for the judgment of the relevant academic committee, or</p>\n        <p>c) add to, subtract from, or modify the provisions of the Faculty Handbook, the Academic Operations Manual, or other relevant University documents.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Even if applicable here, the AMF approach would not compel a different outcome.  Because the contract at issue here imposes strict constraints on the scope of the arbitrator's authority and severely limits the effect of the arbitral decision, there is little ground for a \"reasonable ... expectation\" that the procedure will resolve the dispute.  Accord Harrison v. Nissan Motor Corp., 111 F.3d 343, 350 (3d Cir.1997)(applying the logic of AMF to determine that a nonbinding dispute resolution provision contained in a warranty--and labeled by the warranty's drafter as \"arbitration\"--\"does not constitute arbitration within the meaning of the FAA\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Appellees have urged that the policies underlying the Act require arbitration here.  We disagree.  To be sure, FAA jurisprudence is grounded in the \"liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.\"   See, e.g., Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Leland Stanford Junior University, 489 U.S. 468, 474, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1253, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989).  But the practical effect of this policy preference in the present setting is the application of the presumption of arbitrability, a presumption which is, as we have seen, overcome by the terms of the contract describing the arbitral aspect of the grievance process.  Thus, when a court is interpreting a putative agreement to arbitrate a dispute, the federal policy favoring arbitration is not a free-standing ground upon which to remit parties to arbitration, but one that informs the court's interpretation.  See First Options, 514 U.S. at 947, 115 S.Ct. at 1925 (\"[T]he basic objective in this area is not to resolve disputes in the quickest manner possible, no matter what the parties' wishes, but to ensure that commercial arbitration agreements, like other contracts, are enforced according to their terms.\")  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);  Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v.

Arbitration, when enforced pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, is more a substitute for than a precursor to judicial intervention.  See First Options, 514 U.S. at 942, 115 S.Ct. at 1923.   Once parties have been remitted to arbitration and an award is lawfully entered, no party may sue de novo.   An arbitral award is binding on the parties and may only be set aside on very narrow statutory grounds--such as fraud in relation to the arbitration agreement or corruption or partiality on the part of the arbitrator, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10--or on the ground that the arbitrator (who is not required to issue a written opinion) is found to have committed \"manifest disregard of the law.\"  First Options, 514 U.S. at 942, 115 S.Ct. at 1923</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The applicable provision of the ADA derives its procedural rules from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which requires exhaustion.

Plaintiff-appellant Michael Louis Brennan, a faculty member at Northeastern University, brought suit in federal court in Massachusetts against Northeastern, its trustees, president, and provost, the dean of Northeastern's College of Engineering, and the acting chair of the university's Department of Industrial Engineering and Information Systems.  Brennan alleged, inter alia, that defendants violated federal and state anti-discrimination laws and breached his contract of employment with Northeastern.  More specifically, Brennan contended that, as a tenure-track assistant professor, he was eligible for promotion to tenure rank but was denied tenure because he was gay and HIV-positive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground that Brennan had failed to pursue the grievance procedure governing adverse tenure decisions which was set out in the employee handbook and thereby incorporated into Brennan's employment contract.  Brennan then brought this appeal.  Brennan acknowledges that he did not invoke the specified grievance procedure, but he argues that the grievance procedure he bypassed was not a remedy he was bound to invoke before presenting his claims to a federal court.  With respect to Brennan's federal claims and the bulk of his state claims, we agree and, accordingly, reverse in part.  With respect to Brennan's claims of breach of contract, we hold that Massachusetts law required resort to contractual remedies before suit.  We will therefore affirm on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.  In 1988, appellant Brennan joined the Northeastern faculty as a tenure-track assistant professor of industrial engineering.  During the 1993-94 academic year, he applied for tenure and was turned down.  Because the university has a policy that limits non-tenured assistant professors to six years of employment, Brennan was given a final contract for the 1994-95 academic year, after which his employment was terminated.  Brennan's employment contract for 1993-94 expressly incorporated the terms of the Northeastern University Faculty Handbook for that year.  The handbook sets out (1) a general grievance procedure, which includes the possibility of \"binding arbitration,\" and (2) a separate grievance procedure, governing tenure appeals, which includes a form of arbitration characterized as \"binding\" but of limited scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Northeastern's Tenure Review and Appeals Procedures Tenure Review</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenure review at Northeastern is a multi-step process ultimately leading to a decision by the board of trustees.  Initially, the candidate's record is reviewed by at least three tenured members of his or her department.  This review leads to a departmental recommendation that is transmitted to the dean of the college.  The dean, in turn, makes a recommendation to the provost of the university.  The provost then makes a recommendation to the university president.  In the last stage of the process, the president makes a recommendation to the board of trustees, and the board then makes a final decision.  At no stage of the procedure is the recommendation of any evaluator binding upon the evaluator or decision-maker at the next stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenure Appeals.   The tenure appeals process is made available following a decision by the provost to recommend to the president that the candidate's tenure application be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise course of the tenure appeals process varies depending on whether the appellant makes a claim of, or including, \"discriminatory acts\" in connection with an adverse tenure recommendation.  If a tenure candidate's appeal does not involve a \"formal claim of discriminatory acts,\" the candidate must bring his or her appeal before the University Standing Appeals Committee on Tenure (\"the Appeals Committee\" or \"Committee\") within five days after the candidate learns of the provost's adverse decision.  The Appeals Committee is composed of tenured faculty members from various schools of the university.  Upon concluding its inquiry, the Committee makes a recommendation to the provost.  If the Committee recommends in favor of the candidate, but the provost continues to maintain that tenure should be denied, the handbook authorizes the candidate \"to submit procedural issues to binding arbitration\" within ten days of learning of the provost's decision to proceed with the negative recommendation.  The handbook specifies that \"[t]he decision of the arbitrator, within the scope of his or her jurisdiction, shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and the University;  however, the arbitrator shall be without power to ... (3) substitute his or her judgment on the professional qualification of a faculty member for the judgment of any academic committee or official, or (4) engage in a comparative review of the candidate's merits with those of other candidates, or (5) grant or deny tenure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the arbitrator \"is convinced that the Provost's decision is not reasonably supported by the record,\" the arbitrator can require the provost to transmit to the president the Appeals Committee's positive recommendation instead of the provost's negative one.  As with all tenure evaluations received from the provost, the president is not bound by such a recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the foregoing procedures generally govern the Appeals Committee's consideration of a tenure decision, the handbook provides a candidate with a different initial procedural route if his or her appeal presents, or includes, issues of discrimination.  The manual instructs that a tenure candidate who believes that he or she has been subject to discrimination \"should consult with\" the university's Office of Affirmative Action (\"OAA\").  In the event that a candidate institutes a tenure appeal, and the appeal involves \"formal claim[s] of discriminatory acts,\" the handbook directs that the candidate present those claims to the OAA before the candidate's case will be considered by the Appeals Committee.  The Appeals Committee will stay any issues not involving discrimination while the OAA conducts an investigation and makes findings.  If the OAA finds \"Reasonable Cause\"--that is, facts supporting the claim of discrimination--it will transmit this finding to the Appeals Committee, which will then consider the appeal.  (What weight this finding is to be given by the Appeals Committee is left entirely unclear).  If, on the other hand, the OAA does not find \"Reasonable Cause,\" the Appeals Committee is to dismiss the discrimination issues and proceed to examine issues that do not relate to discrimination (if any).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Thus, so long as any issues remain after the OAA makes its finding, the appeals process runs its course whether that finding is one of \"Reasonable Cause\" or not;  as explained above, the appeals process includes the candidate's option to request arbitration if:  (1) the Appeals Committee makes a recommendation favorable to the candidate, and (2) the provost nonetheless states an intention to adhere to the original unfavorable recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Course of Events in Brennan's Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Brennan received positive recommendations at the departmental and decanal levels of review, the provost informed Brennan that he intended to recommend against the granting of tenure.  Brennan, apparently on the advice of counsel, eschewed the university's tenure appeal process altogether.  That is to say, Brennan did not present his case to the Office of Affirmative Action or to the Appeals Committee.  (Not having sought Appeals Committee review, Brennan could not have elected to present his case to arbitration had he wished to do so).  Accordingly, the provost transmitted his negative recommendation to the president.  The president in turn submitted a negative recommendation to the board of trustees, and that body made the final decision to deny tenure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having been turned down at the highest level of university decision-making, Brennan filed complaints with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").  The MCAD issued a \"Lack of Probable Cause Finding,\" a decision that it affirmed on administrative appeal.  The EEOC also found no violation, and issued a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennan then commenced this suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 et seq., as well as several state-law claims, including breach of contract and violation of anti-discrimination provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution and Massachusetts statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The parties agree that all of Brennan's claims stem from his contention that he was denied tenure because of his sexual orientation and his HIV-positive status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Northeastern and its officials moved for dismissal or summary judgment on the ground that Brennan had failed to pursue the grievance procedure specified in his employment contract.  The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the university and its fellow defendants, giving particular weight to the \"[f]ederal policy favor[ing] arbitration agreements.\"  Memorandum and Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Brennan v. King, No. 96-11526, at 2 (D.Mass. Dec. 13, 1996).  \"[P]laintiff's contract,\" the court held, \"clearly commits tenure disputes to the University's grievance and arbitration process.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had federal question jurisdiction by virtue of appellant's ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.  The district court also had supplemental jurisdiction over appellant's state-law claims because they arise from the same operative facts.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a).  Because this is an appeal from entry of summary judgment, our review is de novo.   To the extent that any factual issues remain, we must resolve all such questions in the way most favorable to the non-moving party.  See Byrd v. Ronayne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196234\"><a href=\"/opinion/196234/byrd-v-ronayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1030 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In bringing this lawsuit, Brennan has undertaken to place in issue the question whether Northeastern University was justified in denying him tenure, or whether, as Brennan asserts, the denial of tenure was based upon unacceptable grounds--namely that Brennan was gay and HIV-positive.  But the district court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees, did not address the merits of Brennan's claims.  Rather, the district court concluded that Brennan was barred from coming to court because he had not traveled the entire path of the grievance procedure which, pursuant to Brennan's contract of employment with Northeastern, was available to him.  In particular, the district court, noting the strong federal policy favoring arbitration, faulted Brennan for pretermitting the arbitration aspect of the grievance procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennan contends that the district court erred in its ruling on the arbitration issue.  Brennan also argues that appellees have waived their arbitration defenses by not raising them in the EEOC and MCAD proceedings. For their part, appellees urge what appear to be two distinct grounds in support of affirmance:  (1) both federal and state arbitration law required that Brennan arbitrate his claims, and (2) some species of exhaustion doctrine required that Brennan utilize the university's grievance process before resorting to court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address Brennan's waiver arguments.  We then consider the principal questions in this case--whether the Federal Arbitration Act, or its Massachusetts counterpart, or exhaustion doctrine more broadly construed--required Brennan to pursue the grievance procedure, including arbitration, described in his contract of employment.  Finally, we turn to the question whether Brennan was required by Massachusetts common law to pursue the contractual grievance procedure before suing for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, we address Brennan's argument that appellees waived their arbitration defenses because appellees failed to raise them in the administrative proceedings before the EEOC and the MCAD.  The district court rejected this argument, finding that \"the University counsel's ... letter to the MCAD ... discusses this failure at great length.\"   Memorandum and Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, at 2 n. 2. In fact, the university's letter to the MCAD does mention, in at least two places, the fact that Brennan did not exhaust the university's grievance procedure prior to presenting his claim to the MCAD.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Brennan, however, urges that appellees' mere mention of the fact that he had not exhausted the procedure does not amount to raising the issue as a defense, and that it is the failure to raise the defense that constitutes waiver in this case.  Brennan contends that, having failed to characterize the issue as a matter of defense at the administrative agency level, appellees have forfeited their entitlement to raise the issue before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, true that a court charged with reviewing determinations of another tribunal will not ordinarily consider issues not raised in the earlier proceedings.  But that truism is without application here since it was no part of the responsibility of the district court to review the determinations of the EEOC or the MCAD.  Nor was it appellees' responsibility to raise arbitration as a defense in the administrative proceedings.  Appellees' arbitration arguments do not constitute relevant defenses before the EEOC.  As the Supreme Court recently noted, \"An individual ... claimant subject to an arbitration agreement will still be free to file a charge with the EEOC, even though the claimant is not able to institute a private judicial action.\"  Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1647</span></a></span>, 1653, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span> (1991).  We see no reason to suppose that the Massachusetts courts would treat Brennan's state-law discrimination claims differently.

As we have had occasion to observe, \"a party seeking to substitute an arbitral forum for a judicial forum must show, at a bare minimum, that the protagonists have agreed to arbitrate some claims.\"  McCarthy v.

This much appellees have shown.  The university's faculty handbook describes a \"regular grievance procedure\" committing issues other than tenure decisions to binding arbitration and a separate process for submitting to binding arbitration \"procedural issues\" relating to tenure review.  Therefore, we apply FAA principles to this dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the FAA is here implicated, we consider whether the dispute between Brennan and Northeastern that is the focus of this lawsuit is the sort of dispute that the parties agreed to arbitrate.  Although this is fundamentally an issue of contract interpretation--for which state law provides the basic interpretive rules--our inquiry is informed by FAA jurisprudence.  In FAA cases, Supreme Court precedents \"instruct courts to use a particular hermeneutic principle for interpreting the breadth of the agreement,\" viz., the presumption of arbitrability.  McCarthy, 22 F.3d at 355.   This presumption dictates that \"as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\"  Moses H.

At bottom, arbitration remains \"simply a matter of contract between the parties;  it is a way to resolve those disputes--but only those disputes--that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\"  Id. at 943, 115 S.Ct. at 1924.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, therefore, to the application of these principles.  As the parties agree, Brennan's claims, though they are expressed as manifold causes of action, all concern the university's denial of tenure to Brennan.  We therefore look to the contract to determine whether the parties have agreed to submit tenure decisions to arbitration, resolving any doubts arising from this interpretive enterprise in favor of arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have previously noted, Brennan's contract with Northeastern contains two arbitration provisions.  For non-tenure related grievances, the handbook establishes a grievance system potentially culminating in binding arbitration.  This general grievance scheme contemplates a comparatively broad arbitral authority for the resolution of faculty complaints of unfair or inequitable treatment or of misapplication of the handbook or other governing documents or regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grievance procedure with respect to tenure disputes is wholly separate and evinces no broad arbitral authority to resolve such disputes.  The handbook does allow for a proceeding within the tenure consideration process labeled \"binding arbitration.\"   But it is readily apparent that such arbitration as the handbook contemplates could not have resolved Brennan's dispute with the university.  To be sure, the handbook recites that an arbitral decision \"shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and the University.\"   But the scope of what is subject to arbitration is limited to \"procedural issues.\"   Although it is not at all clear what is embraced under the rubric of \"procedural issues,\" it is abundantly clear that among those things that the arbitrator is \"without power to\" do is to \"grant or deny tenure.\"   Evidently the arbitrator is confined to addressing non-substantive issues that may--but also may not--have some impact on the tenure decision ultimately made by the university's trustees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, to the extent that the arbitrator can be said to have authority to \"bind\" the parties, including the university, with respect to \"procedural issues,\" the narrowness of that authority is plain to see.  In what would be, for the university, the worst-case scenario--one in which the arbitrator \"is convinced that the Provost's decision [to transmit to the president a negative tenure recommendation notwithstanding the Appeals Committee's positive recommendation] is not reasonably supported by the record,\" all the arbitrator is empowered to do is require the \"Provost to transmit, to the President, the Standing Appeals Committee's positive recommendation in lieu of the Provost's own.\"   And both the president and the board of trustees remain entirely free to disregard the favorable Appeals Committee recommendation forwarded by the provost pursuant to the arbitrator's directive.  Consequently, the president will still receive nothing more than a recommendation, not a conclusive determination.  Thus the most that a tenure candidate can achieve through arbitration is the substitution of the Appeals Committee's positive recommendation for the provost's negative recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the contract manifest an intent that arbitration be the exclusive means for addressing a dispute over tenure.  The handbook speaks only of the candidate having a \"right\" to request arbitration.  It is true that there is authority for the proposition that in some circumstances courts have the power to enforce agreements that require arbitration even when such arbitration is nonbinding.  See AMF, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1368447\"><a href=\"/opinion/1368447/amf-inc-v-brunswick-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 461 (E.D.N.Y.1985) (Weinstein, J.)  (holding an agreement requiring nonbinding arbitration enforceable under the FAA when there is a \"reasonable ... expectation [that] the dispute will be settled\" by the procedure).  In this case, however, the parties have made resort to arbitration the prerogative, but not the obligation, of the tenure candidate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Northeastern's arbitral procedure does not, therefore, provide a forum for the entire resolution of a tenure candidate's dispute with Northeastern.  It merely serves to provide a formal setting in which a candidate may seek reconsideration, on circumscribed \"procedural\" grounds, of a provost's negative recommendation.  Viewed closely, then, the arbitral procedure turns out to be an option that a candidate may invoke or not as he or she chooses--an option which, if invoked, has a very limited horizon.  It cannot be said that the employment contract crafted by Northeastern is one under which both the university and Brennan have committed themselves to arbitrate disputes about tenure.  Northeastern appears to have agreed that it would participate in a narrowly confined form of arbitral process had Brennan chosen to invoke the process.  But Brennan had no duty to make that choice.  Therefore the presumption of arbitrability is overcome by the terms of the contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have concluded that the Federal Arbitration Act did not require Brennan to invoke the arbitral aspect of Northeastern's grievance system.  We now turn to the question whether the Massachusetts Arbitration Act would call for a different result.  We conclude that it does not.  The Massachusetts Arbitration Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 251 &#167; 1 et seq. adopts the Uniform Arbitration Act, and its relevant language closely tracks that of the federal statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Massachusetts courts have interpreted this statute, as it relates to the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, in conformity with (and sometimes with reference to) federal authority.  See, e.g., Unisys Finance Corp. v. Allan R. Hackel Org., Inc., 42 Mass.App.Ct. 275, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></span>, 489 (1997);  Town of Danvers v.

Hence under Massachusetts arbitration law, we find a similar presumption of arbitrability, which can similarly be overcome by a showing that the particular dispute at issue is not subject to arbitration by the terms of the agreement.  See Unisys, 676 N.E.2d at 489 (quoting Hurlbut v. Gantshar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521401\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521401/hurlbut-v-gantshar/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 390 (D.Mass.1987)(\"In the absence of an actual agreement to arbitrate a particular dispute or class of disputes, the Court cannot compel arbitration.\")).  Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the Massachusetts Arbitration Act did not require Brennan to arbitrate this dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Exhaustion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees also raise arguments that can be characterized as invoking exhaustion principles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Although neither appellees' brief nor appellant's brief separates the possible ingredients of the concept of \"exhaustion,\" we think that, for the purposes of coherent analysis, certain distinctions must be drawn.  First, appellees may be understood to be invoking familiar concepts of exhaustion of administrative remedies.  Alternatively (or additionally), they may be regarded as arguing that some source of law requires exhaustion of possible contractual remedies before bringing suit.  We will discuss each of these possibilities.  As it relates to Brennan's breach-of-contract claim, the contractual exhaustion issue merits independent consideration under state law and will accordingly be addressed separately below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>1. Brennan's Statutory and Constitutional Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider Brennan's claims alleging violation of federal and state anti-discrimination laws.  Brennan has alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 et seq., and several Massachusetts anti-discrimination provisions, Mass.  Const. art. 114 (prohibiting discrimination against handicapped persons);  Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1), (16) (prohibiting employment discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and disability);  Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 93, &#167; 103(a) (Massachusetts Equal Rights Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Brennan's claims under the ADA and under the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statutes are subject to the exhaustion doctrine, which requires a claimant to pursue administrative remedies before filing suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Brennan, however, fully pursued his discrimination claims with both the EEOC and the MCAD.  Appellees have not suggested that Brennan's pursuit of administrative remedies was in any way inadequate to fulfill the exhaustion requirements that obtain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees have, however, also sought to invoke the exhaustion doctrine in order to require Brennan to exhaust potential contractual remedies.  With respect to Brennan's federal and state civil rights claims, we find no ground to require this type of exhaustion.  The federal statutes and the Massachusetts constitutional and statutory provisions invoked by Brennan reveal no indication that potential contractual avenues of relief must be pursued prior to suit.  Furthermore, appellees have not cited, and we have not found, any cases suggesting that such a requirement inheres in the relevant federal or state provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees point out that the Supreme Court has required union members who have a grievance under a collective bargaining agreement to invoke the grievance and arbitration machinery established by that contract before resort to court.

Stated another way, in the collective bargaining context, there is a requirement that union members exhaust available contractual remedies before bringing suit.  True as this is, it has no relevance to Brennan's federal and state statutory claims or his state constitutional claims.  The record does not suggest that Brennan is a member of a bargaining unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Appellees have pointed to no cases, nor have we found any, that extend the contractual exhaustion doctrine from federal labor law into the individual employment setting to bar litigation of statutory or constitutional civil rights claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that appellees' argument may be understood to invite us to make such an extension, we are unpersuaded.

No comparable interests would be served by enforcing an exhaustion requirement here.  Brennan is not seeking to vindicate contractual rights secured through the collective bargaining process;  rather, he is suing to vindicate individual rights conferred by federal and state law.  Furthermore, as the discussion in part II.B above demonstrates, the \"arbitration\" provided by the university's contract with Brennan is, with respect to tenure disputes, neither capable of rendering a binding judgment nor contractually mandatory.  Thus it does not share the usual features of the grievance and arbitration mechanisms typical of collective bargaining agreements.  The arbitration clause at issue here is not a vehicle for giving meaning to a \"generalized code,\" but a mechanism that can be fairly characterized as contemplating a purely advisory function within a narrowly circumscribed grant of jurisdiction.  Consequently, we conclude that Brennan was not bound to exhaust the arbitration aspect of the handbook procedure before bringing his discrimination claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>2.

New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></span>, 849 (1996), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that when an employee manual constituting an enforceable contract of employment sets up a grievance procedure, an employee who refuses to use that procedure may not resort to a judicial forum to assert claims of wrongful discharge based on that manual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff in O'Brien sued for wrongful discharge, basing her claim upon an employee manual that set forth a four-step grievance procedure for claims \"that an employee has, in any manner, been unfairly treated.\"  Id. 664 N.E.2d at 849.   O'Brien, however, declined to invoke the manual's procedures and instead brought her wrongful discharge action in state court.  After O'Brien won a jury verdict, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts granted direct review and reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ruled that the manual not only created rights enforceable by the employee, but also obligations that bound the employee.  Id. at 848-49.   The court concluded that O'Brien was obligated to pursue the contractual grievance procedures set forth in the manual:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a collective bargaining agreement provides a grievance procedure, the general rule is that the remedies specified in the agreement be exhausted before an employee may resort to the courts.  ....   We see no justification for treating differently an employee asserting rights under a personnel manual that contains a grievance procedure....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grievance procedure provided a ready means by which O'Brien could have brought to the attention of management [a supervisor's] unfair treatment of her....  Pursuit of this available process might have demonstrated sufficient mitigating circumstances to rebut what management might otherwise have perceived as \"gross violations\" of rules or law that were \"cause for immediate discharge.\"Id. at 849.   Hence, we take O'Brien as a determination that, as a matter of Massachusetts employment law, one who alleges wrongful termination based upon a contract of employment which includes a grievance procedure cannot seek vindication of the claim in court without first invoking the contractual grievance procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Brennan's claims of common-law breach of contract are predicated upon a contract of employment containing a grievance procedure, we find that these claims are not meaningfully distinguishable from the claims pursued in O'Brien.   In light of the Supreme Judicial Court's ruling in O'Brien, then, we conclude that, under Massachusetts law, Brennan was required to pursue the grievance procedure outlined in his contract of employment before maintaining suit for breach of the employment contract, and we therefore affirm on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants is reversed with respect to Brennan's non-contractual claims.  The district court's judgment is affirmed as to Brennan's claims of breach of contract.  The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3.d of the tenure appeal procedure provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>2) If the Provost recommends against tenure although the Appeals Committee has recommended that tenure be granted, s/he shall communicate this to the candidate before sending the recommendations of the Committee and of the Provost to the President.

Since Brennan's employment did not involve interstate commerce in this narrow sense, the exclusion does not apply to Brennan's contract with Northeastern</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Section I.D of the handbook, entitled \"Faculty Grievance Procedure,\" describes a somewhat elaborate procedure governing grievances between faculty members and the university (other than tenure-related disputes).  The handbook defines a grievance as a \"complaint by a faculty member that he or she:  1) has been subject to a violation, misinterpretation or inequitable application of the Faculty Handbook, Academic Operations Manual, or other published University or unit regulations;  or 2) has otherwise been treated unfairly or inequitably.\"   The handbook provides a multi-step process for resolving such complaints.  The grievant is encouraged to seek informal resolution.  A formal grievance must, however, be filed within three months \"after the faculty member became aware of the grievable event.\"   The grievant may elect to secure \"early provostial review\" or may invoke the general procedure, which contemplates \"mediation by an ad hoc Faculty Committee.\"   Should the grievant be dissatisfied with the ad hoc committee's disposition, he or she may request arbitration.  However, the grievant is only entitled to arbitrate the grievance if the ad hoc faculty mediation committee decides that the grievance should be arbitrated.  With respect to the arbitrator's authority, the handbook provides:</p>\n        <p>The decision of the arbitrator, within the scope of his or her jurisdiction, shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and the University;  however, the arbitrator shall be without power to</p>\n        <p>a) make a decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law;</p>\n        <p>b) substitute his or judgment on the professional qualification of a faculty member for the judgment of the relevant academic committee, or</p>\n        <p>c) add to, subtract from, or modify the provisions of the Faculty Handbook, the Academic Operations Manual, or other relevant University documents.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Even if applicable here, the AMF approach would not compel a different outcome.  Because the contract at issue here imposes strict constraints on the scope of the arbitrator's authority and severely limits the effect of the arbitral decision, there is little ground for a \"reasonable ... expectation\" that the procedure will resolve the dispute.  Accord Harrison v. Nissan Motor Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739686\"><a href=\"/opinion/739686/fannie-harrison-v-nissan-motor-corporation-in-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 350 (3d Cir.1997)(applying the logic of AMF to determine that a nonbinding dispute resolution provision contained in a warranty--and labeled by the warranty's drafter as \"arbitration\"--\"does not constitute arbitration within the meaning of the FAA\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Appellees have urged that the policies underlying the Act require arbitration here.

Leland Stanford Junior University, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112212\"><a href=\"/opinion/112212/volt-info-sciences-inc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-leland-stanford-jr-u/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 474, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112212\"><a href=\"/opinion/112212/volt-info-sciences-inc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-leland-stanford-jr-u/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span> (1989).  But the practical effect of this policy preference in the present setting is the application of the presumption of arbitrability, a presumption which is, as we have seen, overcome by the terms of the contract describing the arbitral aspect of the grievance process.  Thus, when a court is interpreting a putative agreement to arbitrate a dispute, the federal policy favoring arbitration is not a free-standing ground upon which to remit parties to arbitration, but one that informs the court's interpretation.  See First Options, 514 U.S. at 947, 115 S.Ct. at 1925 (\"[T]he basic objective in this area is not to resolve disputes in the quickest manner possible, no matter what the parties' wishes, but to ensure that commercial arbitration agreements, like other contracts, are enforced according to their terms.\")  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);  Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v.

Exhaustion doctrine--generally confined to the administrative arena--requires that administrative processes be invoked before requesting judicial relief.  See, e.g., McKart v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107944\"><a href=\"/opinion/107944/mckart-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 193-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107944\"><a href=\"/opinion/107944/mckart-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Arbitration, when enforced pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, is more a substitute for than a precursor to judicial intervention.  See First Options, 514 U.S. at 942, 115 S.Ct. at 1923.   Once parties have been remitted to arbitration and an award is lawfully entered, no party may sue de novo.   An arbitral award is binding on the parties and may only be set aside on very narrow statutory grounds--such as fraud in relation to the arbitration agreement or corruption or partiality on the part of the arbitrator, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10--or on the ground that the arbitrator (who is not required to issue a written opinion) is found to have committed \"manifest disregard of the law.\"  First Options, 514 U.S. at 942, 115 S.Ct. at 1923</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The applicable provision of the ADA derives its procedural rules from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which requires exhaustion.
