Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Michael Lanza on brief pro se.\n     Gretchen Leah Witt, United States Attorney, and Peter E.\nPapps, First Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                      November 28, 2001\n\f              Per Curiam. After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties' submissions, we affirm.\n\n              Appellant Michael Lanza (\"Lanza\") was convicted of\n\none count of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371,\n\nand    four    counts       of   interstate     transportation       of   stolen\n\nproperty, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 2.                             The\n\nstolen      property        included,     inter     alia,    a     quantity     of\n\npharmaceuticals             equivalent    to      1,368.66        kilograms     of\n\nmarijuana.         Lanza appeals from the district court's denial\n\nof his petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 alleging\n\nineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.                           Lanza\n\nasserts       that   his     attorney    performed      deficiently       by   (1)\n\nfailing to assert more vigorously that Lanza intended to\n\nconsume rather than sell the stolen drugs, and (2) failing\n\nto argue that Lanza was entitled, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n\n5G1.3(b), to full credit on his federal sentence for the\n\ntime   he     had    served      in   state   prison    on   an    undischarged\n\nsentence for drug trafficking.\n\n              We     find    ample    support     in   the   record    for     the\n\ninference that Lanza did intend to sell at least a large\n\nportion of the stolen drugs, and Lanza has not produced or\n\noffered any evidence to support his assertion that all the\n\ndrugs were intended for personal use.                  Accordingly, we think\n\fthat    the   offense     level   was    appropriately        determined   by\n\napplying U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 pursuant to the cross-reference in\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(c)(1)(B).              Moreover, given that counsel\n\nwould have had to establish that petitioner consumed or\n\nintended to consume the equivalent of more than 368.66\n\nkilograms of marijuana to make any difference in the offense\n\nlevel   under    §   2D1.1, compare U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(c)(4) &\n\n(c)(5), we do not think counsel's failure to aggressively\n\nseek a reduction in the attributable drug weight at the plea\n\nnegotiation stage was unreasonable, particularly in light of\n\nthe fact that he later sought a downward departure based on\n\npersonal use.\n\n              Further, we think there is sufficient evidence in\n\nthe record to justify application of § 2D1.1 even without\n\nconsidering Lanza's state court drug trafficking conviction.\n\nAccordingly,      Lanza    was    not   prejudiced       by   his   counsel's\n\nfailure to argue for full credit for the undischarged state\n\ndrug    sentence     pursuant     to    U.S.S.G.     §    5G1.3(b).        See\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); United\n\nStates v. Caraballo, 200 F.3d 20, 28-29 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              Finally,    to   the   extent   Lanza      claims     that   his\n\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal\n\non his behalf, his challenge is based on his disagreement\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fwith his attorney's assessment of the issues.             Since Lanza\n\ndoes   not   dispute     that   his    attorney   consulted   with   him\n\nconcerning the potential for an appeal, and does not contend\n\nthat he ever instructed counsel to file a notice of appeal,\n\ndefense counsel's failure to appeal was not constitutionally\n\ndeficient.      See Roe v.      Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 478\n\n(2000).\n\n             Affirmed.    See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
