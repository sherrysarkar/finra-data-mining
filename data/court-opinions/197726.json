On appeal they raise issues\r\n\npertaining to the jury  instructions, the opinion testimony of  a\r\n\nwitness, and the  sufficiency of the  evidence.  Having  reviewed\r\n\nthe  defendants  arguments,  we affirm  the  convictions for  the\r\n\nreasons expressed below.\r\n\n                Factual and Procedural Background\r                          Factual and Procedural Background\r                                                           \r\n\n          We review the facts in  the light most favorable to the\r\n\nverdict.  See United  States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6,    , 1997 WL\r                                                 \r\n\n656296, *1 (1st Cir. Oct. 27,  1997); United States v. Wihbey, 75\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir. 1996).  On July 6, 1995, a police officer\r\n\nwith the Fajardo Drugs and  Narcotics Division of the Puerto Rico\r\n\nPolice  Department received two anonymous tips that a shipment of\r\n\ncocaine  was going  to be  delivered  in the  Fajardo area.   The\r\n\ngovernment  sent aloft a  United States Customs  Service aircraft\r\n\nequipped with radar and an  infrared night vision system known by\r\n\nthe acronym \"FLIR,\" which means \"forward looking infrared.\"   The\r\n\nFLIR  system allows objects to  be monitored in complete darkness\r\n\nbased on the heat of the objects.\r\n\n          The aircraft began patrolling  the area between Fajardo\r\n\nand the island of Culebra at an altitude of 1500 feet.  At  10:15\r\n\np.m.   Customs  Service  Agent  John  Alpers,  who  operated  the\r\n\naircraft's FLIR, located a marine  vessel northwest of Culebra at\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n1825 degrees  latitude and 6526  degrees longitude.   The vessel,\r\n\napproximately  thirty feet long and with  two engines, was moving\r\n\ntoward  Fajardo at  a high  rate of  speed with  its navigational\r\n\nlights out in violation of 19 U.S.C.   1703.  When first located,\r\n\nit was  approximately five miles  from the nearest land  point on\r\n\nUnited  States  territory.    During  subsequent  events,  Alpers\r\n\ntracked the vessel  with FLIR and radar,  but at no point  did he\r\n\nmake direct visual observations of the vessel or its occupants.\r\n\n          The  aircraft  lost  contact with  the  vessel,  but it\r\n\nreacquired  it  at  10:56  p.m.   At  that  point,  the  aircraft\r\n\ndescended to an altitude of 1000 feet and continued  to track the\r\n\nvessel from  a distance of  one-half to three-quarters of  a mile\r\n\naway.   At 11:02  p.m., Agent Alpers,  with the  aid of  the FLIR\r\n\nsystem,   observed  movements  of   people  on  the   vessel  who\r\n\n\"appear[ed] to throw  large objects\" overboard.   At that  point,\r\n\nthe  vessel was again  approximately five miles  from the nearest\r\n\nland point  on United States  territory.  After the  objects were\r\n\nthrown overboard, the  vessel departed and headed  toward Fajardo\r\n\nat  high   speed,  leaving  the   objects  in  the  water.     At\r\n\napproximately  11:20 p.m.,  the  vessel  beached  in  the  Cabeza\r\n\nChiquita area of Puerto Rico,  about nine nautical miles from the\r\n\nplace  where the  objects  were  thrown from  the  vessel.   Four\r\n\npersons then  ran from the vessel  into a remote  area dense with\r\n\nmangroves.   No other  boats were  in the  immediate area  of the\r\n\nvessel throughout this time.\r\n\n          The aircraft requested that a National Guard helicopter\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nfly  to and mark the area where  the objects had been dumped.  In\r\n\naddition,  it requested  the  assistance  of  other  officers  in\r\n\napprehending the  persons who had run from  the vessel.  A Puerto\r\n\nRico police helicopter, a National Guard helicopter, and a police\r\n\nboat arrived to  search the area for the persons who had fled the\r\n\nvessel.\r\n\n          One  of  the  helicopters  illuminated  the  area  with\r\n\nfloodlights to assist the law  enforcement officers on the ground\r\n\nin detaining the individuals.   Between 12:02 and 12:09 a.m., the\r\n\npolice arrested three persons.  Two of them are the defendants in\r\n\nthis  case.  Defendant Santana-Rosa was  found hiding under water\r\n\nwhile holding on to mangrove roots.  Defendant D az-Morla and the\r\n\nthird  individual were  hidden  about  ten  feet  from  defendant\r\n\nSantana-Rosa.   The fourth person observed leaving the vessel was\r\n\nnot apprehended.  Both defendants gave false names when arrested.\r\n\nDefendant  Santana-Rosa asked the  arresting officer why  so much\r\n\ngovernment force was being used to catch an illegal alien.\r\n\n          Police  recovered  twenty-seven   bales  of  ninety-one\r\n\npercent pure  cocaine weighing  970 kilograms  at the  site where\r\n\nAlpers  witnessed objects  being  dumped from  the  vessel.   The\r\n\ndefendants were  charged  with  a violation  of  46  U.S.C.  app.\r\n\n  1903(a), which makes it illegal, inter alia, to possess cocaine\r                                                       \r\n\nwith  intent to  distribute it  on  a vessel  within the  customs\r\n\nwaters of  the United  States.  See  46 U.S.C.A.  app.   1903(a),\r                                             \r\n\n(c)(1)(D)  (West Supp. 1997).   The defendants  were convicted by\r\n\njury after a five-day trial.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          At trial, the main defense was that there was a lack of\r\n\ndirect  evidence  establishing  that   the  defendants  were  the\r\n\nindividuals observed on the FLIR  system leaving the vessel.  One\r\n\nof the  defendants testified on  his own behalf, stating  that he\r\n\nwas  an  illegal  alien  seeking  to  avoid  detection.    Alpers\r\n\ntestified that the customs waters of the United States extend for\r\n\ntwelve miles from  any land  mass that is  part of United  States\r\n\nterritory  and that  he observed  the vessel  within the  customs\r\n\nwaters of the  United States.  Alpers also  testified on redirect\r\n\nover the objection  of counsel that, based on  his experience, in\r\n\nhis opinion  the individuals who  were arrested were the  ones he\r\n\nwitnessed  fleeing the vessel.   Following their  conviction, the\r\n\ndefendants filed a timely appeal.\r\n\n                            Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          The defendants allege that three errors in the district\r\n\ncourt proceedings require our attention.   They contend that: (1)\r\n\nthe trial  court erred  in failing  to instruct  the jury on  the\r\n\nmeaning of  the phrase \"within  the customs waters of  the United\r\n\nStates\";  (2) the  trial  court erred  in not  requiring pretrial\r\n\ndisclosure of the  testimony of Customs Service Agent Alpers; and\r\n\n(3) the evidence was legally insufficient to  establish that they\r\n\nwere the  persons on the vessel  who had dumped  cocaine into the\r\n\nocean.  The court discusses these claims seriatim.\r                                                           \r\n\n          A.  Jury Instruction on Customs Waters\r                                                          \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The statute  under which the defendants were convicted,\r\n\n46 U.S.C. app.   1903, makes it \"unlawful for any person . . . on\r\n\nboard a vessel  subject to the jurisdiction of  the United States\r\n\n. . . to knowingly or intentionally . . . possess  with intent to\r\n\n. . . distribute . . . a controlled substance.\"  46 U.S.C.A. app.\r\n\n  1903(a)  (West  Supp.  1997).    A vessel  is  subject  to  the\r\n\njurisdiction of  the  United  States,  inter  alia,  when  it  is\r                                                            \r\n\n\"located within  the customs waters  of the United States.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n  1903(c)(1)(D).   The  defendants allege  that  the trial  court\r\n\nerred  in failing  to instruct  the jury  on the  meaning of  the\r\n\nphrase \"within  the  customs  waters  of the  United  States,\"  a\r\n\nsubstantive element of the offense for which they were convicted.\r\n\nThe  defendants contend that,  because the  term has  a technical\r\n\nmeaning not within the expertise of the jury, the judge's failure\r\n\nto define it  meant that the government was not required to prove\r\n\nthis element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n          Because  the defendants failed  to object to  the trial\r\n\ncourt's instruction, our  review is for plain error.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Fulmer, 108  F.3d 1486, 1495  (1st Cir.  1997); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. And jar,  49 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 1995).1  The failure\r                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  We reject as without merit  the defendants' contention that we\r\nshould apply a more rigorous  standard of review.  The defendants\r\nhave  requested  that  we  adopt  a  rule  that  where  a  charge\r\nconference is not held in open court or on the record, it will be\r\npresumed  that a defendant  properly objected to  any instruction\r\nwhich  he or  she  wishes  to pursue  on  appeal.   However,  our\r\nprevious decisions establish that a party waives any objection it\r\nmight  have  to a  jury  instruction  by  failing to  enter  that\r\nobjection  into  the  record  immediately  after  the  judge  has\r\ninstructed the  jury and  before the  jury begins  deliberations.\r\nSee, e.g., Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc.,  69 F.3d 1205,\r                                                           \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nto give an instruction may be noticed as plain error when: (1) it\r\n\nis an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious; and (3) the error\r\n\naffected  the substantial rights of  the defendants.  See Johnson\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. United States,  117 S.

When plain\r               \r\n\nerror is  found, a reviewing  court has discretion to  correct it\r\n\nonly  when the error \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity\r\n\nor public reputation  of judicial proceedings.\"   Olano, 507 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  736 (quoting  United States  v.

We  thus review the\r                               \r\n\ncontext of the  charge as a whole to determine if it contains \"an\r\n\nerror  that threatens to  'undermine the fundamental  fairness of\r\n\nthe trial.'\"  Fulmer, 108 F.3d  at 1495 (quoting United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nJosleyn, 99  F.3d 1182,  1197 (1st Cir.  1996), cert.  denied sub\r                                                                           \r\n\nnom.

Let's  discuss those  statutes that\r\n          are charged in the indictment.  Let's discuss\r\n          46  U.S.C., Section  1903(a).    One  of  the\r\n          offenses charged  in the indictment  under 46\r\n          United  States  Code, Section  903(a)  [sic],\r\n          provides in the pertinent part as follows:\r\n\n            It  is unlawful for  any person on  board a\r\n          vessel  subject to  the  jurisdiction of  the\r\n          United States  to knowingly  or intentionally\r\n          possess   with   intent   to   distribute   a\r\n          controlled substance.\r\n\n            Section 1903(b) and (D), vessel of the U.S.\r\n          defined:  Definition  of  a  vessel  for  the\r\n          purpose  of this  section means  (D), capital\r\n          (D), parenthesis: A vessel located within the\r\n          customs waters of the United States.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          Despite the  omission of  a definition  of the  element\r\n\nfrom  the jury  instructions,  the jury  was not  left completely\r\n\nwithout  guidance  on  the  issue.    The  government  introduced\r\n\nunrebutted  testimony by  Alpers  as  to  both  what  constituted\r\n\ncustoms waters  and the  location of  the  vessel within  customs\r\n\nwaters.   At trial,  Alpers testified that  the vessel  was first\r\n\npicked up on  FLIR within five miles of  United States territory.\r\n\nHe also  testified that the  customs waters of the  United States\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            . . . .\r\n\n            Let's  discuss  the essential  elements  of\r\n          that  offense.   In  order  to establish  the\r\n          offense  proscribed by  Title 46,  U.S. Code,\r\n          Section 1903, the government  must prove each\r\n          of the following elements beyond a reasonable\r\n          doubt:\r\n\n            One, that  each  defendant was  on board  a\r\n          motor vessel located within the custom waters\r\n          of the United States.\r\n\n            . . . .\r\n\n            . . . .  The superseding indictment in this\r\n          case also charges that a vessel is subject to\r\n          the jurisdiction  of the  United States.   In\r\n          order to find defendants guilty in this case,\r\n          you  will  have  to  determine,  among  other\r\n          things,  if  the government  proved  beyond a\r\n          reasonable doubt that the vessel in  question\r\n          was  a vessel within the custom waters of the\r\n          United States.\r\n\n            Section  1903(b)  and  (D): Vessel  of  the\r\n          United  States  defined  means   --  for  the\r\n          purpose of this sections [sic] means a vessel\r\n          located  within  the  custom  waters  of  the\r\n          United States.\r\n\nTr. 706-08.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nextend for twelve miles from the territory of the United States.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4    Alpers'   complete  testimony  on  the  issue,   made  while\r\nillustrating his comments  with the aid  of a navigational  chart\r\ndepicting  the  area  in  question that  was  also  entered  into\r\nevidence, is as follows:\r\n\n          Q:   Now,   have  you   marked  the   initial\r\n               sighting in the map?\r\n\n          A:   Yes, sir, I have.\r\n\n          Q:   Would you -- using this pointer --\r\n\n          MR.

It's  right  here,  ladies  and\r\n               gentlemen,  right  in  this  area  here.\r\n               That's  when   we  first   acquired  the\r\n               vessel, again traveling lights-out, high\r\n               rate of speed, heading  260 towards this\r\n               area   here,   heading   this  direction\r\n               approximately here.\r\n\n          Q:   Now,  sir, were you  able to --  are you\r\n               able  to tell the members of the jury at\r\n               what coordinates was that boat --\r\n\n          A:   Yes, sir.\r\n\n          Q:   -- located at once you first locked into it?\r\n\n          A:   Right.    Approximate  coordinates, 1825\r\n               and 6526.  Again, that's a latitude  and\r\n               a longitude.   Again,  that was  in this\r\n               area right here.   You can  see Culebra,\r\n               of course  mainland Puerto Rico,  and it\r\n               was between both of those, north of this\r\n               small island chain here.\r\n\n          Q:   As a customs officer was that within the\r\n               customs waters of the United States?\r\n\n          A:   Yes,  sir.   That  was  within  the  U.S.  Customs\r\n               waters.\r\n\n          Q:   How far out do the customs waters of the\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nAlpers'  testimony did not, however, mention that the twelve-mile\r\n\nlimit can be modified by treaty.\r\n\n          Given  this testimony,  the defendants  have failed  to\r\n\nmeet their burden to show  that the omitted instruction  affected\r\n\ntheir substantial rights.  We  agree with the defendants that the\r\n\nterm  \"customs  waters  of  the  United States\"  is  outside  the\r\n\nexperience of lay jurors, and that in the usual case the district\r\n\ncourt must give  at least an instruction  concerning the ordinary\r\n\ndefinition of  that term, i.e., that the  defendants' vessel must\r\n\nhave been  within four  leagues or twelve  nautical miles  of the\r\n\nnearest land  territory of the  United States.   However, because\r\n\nthe evidence was  uncontroverted that the defendants'  vessel was\r\n\nwell within  this limit,  we cannot see  how this  omission could\r\n\nhave affected their substantial rights, as required under Olano.\r                                                                         \r\n\n          The defendants did not argue that the twelve-mile limit\r\n\nwas inapplicable  because their  vessel was covered  by a  treaty\r\n\nthat  contracted the  ordinary  limit.   In  fact, such  treaties\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n               United States extend from any land point\r\n               belonging to the United States?\r\n\n          A:   Twelve miles.\r\n\n          Q:   And  there  are  --  are how  many  land\r\n               points there  in that area that you know\r\n               of that belong to the United States?\r\n\n          A:   That  is all  U.S. territory.   Culebra,\r\n               the island chain, of course Puerto Rico.\r\n               And the vessel, when first acquired, was\r\n               approximately five miles north of a land\r\n               mass, thus in U.S. Customs waters.\r\n\nTr. Vol I, p. 67-69.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nordinarily  expand  the  twelve-mile limit.    See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Doe, 860  F.2d 488,  490 (1st Cir.  1988).   We do not\r                        \r\n\ndecide  under what  circumstances a  defendant  is entitled  upon\r\n\nproper  request to an instruction concerning the treaty exception\r\n\nto the twelve-mile  limit.  In  this case,  however, it is  clear\r\n\nthat such  an omission  cannot, at the  very least,  rise to  the\r\n\nlevel of  \"plain error.\"   Given  the failure  of the defense  to\r\n\nsuggest that the  exception was at all relevant,  the omission is\r\n\nnot \"plain  error\"; certainly it did not  \"seriously affect[] the\r\n\nfairness,   integrity   or    public   reputation   of   judicial\r\n\nproceedings.\"   United States v.  Johnson, 117 S. Ct.  1544, 1550\r                                                   \r\n\n(1997) (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 736) (internal quotation marks\r                               \r\n\nomitted).5\r\n\n          B.

Rogers,  94 F.3d 1519  (11th Cir.  1996), cert.\r                                                                           \r\ngranted in  part, 117 S.

However, in that  case the Supreme Court  certified only\r\nthe  following question: \"Whether  a district court's  failure to\r\ninstruct the jury on an  element of an offense is harmless  error\r\nwhere, at trial,  the defendant admitted that element.\"   Rogers,\r                                                                          \r\n117 S. Ct.  at 1841.  Because,  inter alia, that case  deals with\r                                                    \r\nharmless  error  rather than  plain  error,  we  do not  find  it\r\nnecessary or desirable to await the Court's opinion in that case.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfleeing the vessel.6  The defendants claim that Alpers' testimony\r\n\nwas expert testimony, and thus the government's failure to comply\r\n\nwith the  expert disclosure requirements constituted  a discovery\r\n\nviolation.   The government  contends that Alpers   testimony was\r\n\nnotexpert testimony,butrather constitutedapermissible layopinion.\r\n\n          The central issue  in the trial  was whether the  three\r\n\nmen who were  arrested were three of  the same four men  who fled\r\n\nthe vessel when they grounded  it.  On direct examination, Alpers\r\n\ntestified as to the events he witnessed  with the aid of the FLIR\r\n\nsystem.     On  cross-examination,  defense  counsel   sought  to\r\n\nundermine Alpers'  assertion that  the defendants  were the  same\r\n\npeople whom he had observed  on the vessel with the  FLIR system.\r\n\nOn redirect  examination, Alpers testified  over the  defendants'\r\n\nobjection that in his opinion and based on his experience, he had\r\n\nno doubt  that they  were the same  individuals.   The defendants\r\n\ncontend  that because Alpers'  opinion was based  not upon direct\r\n\nobservation but instead  upon images on the FLIR  this was expert\r\n\nrather than lay testimony.  Because the government did not reveal\r\n\nin its expert report that Alpers would give his opinion regarding\r\n\nthe identity of  the defendants as the men who left the boat, the\r\n\ndefendants  claim that the government violated discovery rules by\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  The defendants concede that, rather than outright reversal, on\r\nthe record in this case the error would entitle them at most to a\r\nremand to  the district  court to  determine whether a  discovery\r\nviolation  occurred  and  if so,  what  the  appropriate sanction\r\nshould be.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nintroducing the testimony.7\r\n\n          We  have rejected similar contentions in  the past.

Rivera-Santiago,  107 F.3d  960, 968 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1997),  the defendants  also  claimed  that  customs  agents  had\r\n\nimproperly testified as experts.  We stated:\r\n\n            In  United States  v.

We\r\n          further   explained   that   \"the  individual\r\n          experience and knowledge of a lay witness may\r\n          establish  his  or  her  competence,  without\r\n          qualification  as an  expert,  to express  an\r\n          opinion on a  particular subject outside  the\r\n          realm of  common  knowledge.\"    Id.;  accord\r                                                                 \r\n          United States v.

Here,  Alpers unquestionably\r                         \r\n\nhad  experience and knowledge in interpreting FLIR images outside\r\n\nthe realm of the jurors'  common knowledge.  Because he was  able\r\n\nto form  an opinion based  on his direct  observation and he  was\r\n\nsubject to cross-examination, it was permissible for him to offer\r\n\nhis  opinion  as a  lay  witness.    The defendants'  attempt  to\r\n\ndistinguish  Rivera-Santiago  is  unavailing.    Alpers  was  not\r                                      \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  Because  of the court's ruling that Alpers was not offering an\r\nexpert  opinion, the  court need  not  consider the  government's\r\ncontention  that it  effectively  complied  with  the  disclosure\r\nrequirements  by disclosing prior to trial a statement containing\r\nthe factual basis for Alpers' opinion.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\npresented as an expert and he did not testify as an expert.  Thus\r\n\nit was not  error for the  trial court to  allow him to  give his\r\n\nopinion  as  to the  identity  of  the  individuals whom  he  had\r\n\nobserved on the FLIR system.\r\n\n          C.

We review such\r\n\na contention  taking the  facts presented at  trial in  the light\r\n\nmost favorable to the verdict.  See United States  v. Rogers, 121\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  12, 15  (1st Cir. 1997);  United States v.

Undoubtedly, no single individual was\r\n\nable to  observe the defendants unimpeded and unassisted from the\r\n\ntime they left the vessel until they were arrested.  However, the\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence that the defendants were the ones who had\r\n\nfled the  vessel was  sufficient to allow  a reasonable  juror to\r\n\nconclude  that they  had  been  seen on  the  vessel dumping  the\r\n\ncocaine.   Four  individuals  were  witnessed  running  into  the\r\n\nmangroves.   Three individuals were arrested among the mangroves.\r\n\nNo other individuals were encountered  in the area, and there was\r\n\ntestimony that the area where  the vessel grounded was remote and\r\n\nuninhabited.  Alpers testified that,  in his opinion, the men who\r\n\nwere arrested were the ones who had fled the vessel.\r\n\n          The jury  was not  required to  credit the  defendants'\r\n\ntheory  that   they  were   illegal  aliens   seeking  to   evade\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\ndeportation.   The  only evidence  of this  was presented  by the\r\n\ndefendants themselves, and it was  within the scope of the jury's\r\n\nfactfinding  function to disregard this evidence entirely.  Thus,\r\n\ntaken in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was ample\r\n\nevidence, both direct and circumstantial, from which a reasonable\r\n\njuror could  have concluded that  the defendants had been  on the\r\n\nvessel, dumped cocaine from the vessel, grounded the vessel, fled\r\n\nto  the mangroves,  attempted  to  evade  detection  until  their\r\n\narrest, and  then provided a false explanation  of their behavior\r\n\nin  light  of  the  likely  repercussions of  their  acts.    The\r\n\ndefendants have failed  to show that they are  entitled to relief\r\n\nbased  on the  alleged  insufficiency  of  the  evidence  offered\r\n\nagainst them.\r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For  the reasons stated  above, the convictions  of the\r\n\ndefendants are affirmed.\r                         affirmed\r                                 \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n",

On appeal they raise issues pertaining to the jury instructions, the opinion testimony of a witness, and the sufficiency of the evidence.  Having reviewed the defendants' arguments, we affirm the convictions for the reasons expressed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 8-9 (1st Cir.1997); United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir.1996).  On July 6, 1995, a police officer with the Fajardo Drugs and Narcotics Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department received two anonymous tips that a shipment of cocaine was going to be delivered in the Fajardo area.  The government sent aloft a United States Customs Service aircraft equipped with radar and an infrared night vision system known by the acronym \"FLIR,\" which means \"forward looking infrared.\"   The FLIR system allows objects to be monitored in complete darkness based on the heat of the objects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aircraft began patrolling the area between Fajardo and the island of Culebra at an altitude of 1500 feet.  At 10:15 p.m. Customs Service Agent John Alpers, who operated the aircraft's FLIR, located a marine vessel northwest of Culebra at 1825 degrees latitude and 6526 degrees longitude.  The vessel, approximately thirty feet long and with two engines, was moving toward Fajardo at a high rate of speed with its navigational lights out in violation of 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1703.  When first located, it was approximately five miles from the nearest land point on United States territory.  During subsequent events, Alpers tracked the vessel with FLIR and radar, but at no point did he make direct visual observations of the vessel or its occupants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aircraft lost contact with the vessel, but it reacquired it at 10:56 p.m.  At that point, the aircraft descended to an altitude of 1000 feet and continued to track the vessel from a distance of one-half to three-quarters of a mile away.  At 11:02 p.m., Agent Alpers, with the aid of the FLIR system, observed movements of people on the vessel who \"appear[ed] to throw large objects\" overboard.  At that point, the vessel was again approximately five miles from the nearest land point on United States territory.  After the objects were thrown overboard, the vessel departed and headed toward Fajardo at high speed, leaving the objects in the water.  At approximately 11:20 p.m., the vessel beached in the Cabeza Chiquita area of Puerto Rico, about nine nautical miles from the place where the objects were thrown from the vessel.  Four persons then ran from the vessel into a remote area dense with mangroves.  No other boats were in the immediate area of the vessel throughout this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aircraft requested that a National Guard helicopter fly to and mark the area where the objects had been dumped.  In addition, it requested the assistance of other officers in apprehending the persons who had run from the vessel.  A Puerto Rico police helicopter, a National Guard helicopter, and a police boat arrived to search the area for the persons who had fled the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the helicopters illuminated the area with floodlights to assist the law enforcement officers on the ground in detaining the individuals.  Between 12:02 and 12:09 a.m., the police arrested three persons.  Two of them are the defendants in this case.  Defendant Santana-Rosa was found hiding under water while holding on to mangrove roots.  Defendant Daz-Morla and the third individual were hidden about ten feet from defendant Santana-Rosa.  The fourth person observed leaving the vessel was not apprehended.  Both defendants gave false names when arrested.  Defendant Santana-Rosa asked the arresting officer why so much government force was being used to catch an illegal alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police recovered twenty-seven bales of ninety-one percent pure cocaine weighing 970 kilograms at the site where Alpers witnessed objects being dumped from the vessel.  The defendants were charged with a violation of 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a), which makes it illegal, inter alia, to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it on a vessel within the customs waters of the United States.  See 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a), (c)(1)(D) (West Supp.1997).  The defendants were convicted by jury after a five-day trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the main defense was that there was a lack of direct evidence establishing that the defendants were the individuals observed on the FLIR system leaving the vessel.  One of the defendants testified on his own behalf, stating that he was an illegal alien seeking to avoid detection.  Alpers testified that the customs waters of the United States extend for twelve miles from any land mass that is part of United States territory and that he observed the vessel within the customs waters of the United States.  Alpers also testified on redirect over the objection of counsel that, based on his experience, in his opinion the individuals who were arrested were the ones he witnessed fleeing the vessel.  Following their conviction, the defendants filed a timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants allege that three errors in the district court proceedings require our attention.  They contend that:  (1) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"within the customs waters of the United States\";  (2) the trial court erred in not requiring pretrial disclosure of the testimony of Customs Service Agent Alpers;  and (3) the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that they were the persons on the vessel who had dumped cocaine into the ocean.  The court discusses these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jury Instruction on Customs Waters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute under which the defendants were convicted, 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903, makes it \"unlawful for any person ... on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States ... to knowingly or intentionally ... possess with intent to ... distribute ... a controlled substance.\"  46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a) (West Supp.1997).  A vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, inter alia, when it is \"located within the customs waters of the United States.\"  Id. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(D).  The defendants allege that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"within the customs waters of the United States,\" a substantive element of the offense for which they were convicted.  The defendants contend that, because the term has a technical meaning not within the expertise of the jury, the judge's failure to define it meant that the government was not required to prove this element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendants failed to object to the trial court's instruction, our review is for plain error.  See United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1495 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Andjar, 49 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The failure to give an instruction may be noticed as plain error when:  (1) it is an error;  (2) the error is clear or obvious;  and (3) the error affected the substantial rights of the defendants.  See Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1547, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997);  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508;  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  When plain error is found, a reviewing court has discretion to correct it only when the error \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936));  see Johnson, --- U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1550.   We thus review the context of the charge as a whole to determine if it contains \"an error that threatens to 'undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial.' \"  Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1495 (quoting United States v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1197 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied sub nom.  Billmyer v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 959, 136 L.Ed.2d 845 (1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute under which the defendants were convicted, 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903, is silent as to the definition of the term customs waters.  See 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(b)-(c) (West Supp.1997).  Other statutes make clear, however, that the customs waters of the United States extend for four leagues, or twelve miles, from United States territory unless another distance has been established by treaty.  See 19 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1401(j) (West 1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In this case, the judge instructed the jury that one element of the offense was that the vessel be within the \"customs waters of the United States\" but he failed to provide the jury with a further definition of the term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the omission of a definition of the element from the jury instructions, the jury was not left completely without guidance on the issue.  The government introduced unrebutted testimony by Alpers as to both what constituted customs waters and the location of the vessel within customs waters.  At trial, Alpers testified that the vessel was first picked up on FLIR within five miles of United States territory.  He also testified that the customs waters of the United States extend for twelve miles from the territory of the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Alpers' testimony did not, however, mention that the twelve-mile limit can be modified by treaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this testimony, the defendants have failed to meet their burden to show that the omitted instruction affected their substantial rights.  We agree with the defendants that the term \"customs waters of the United States\" is outside the experience of lay jurors, and that in the usual case the district court must give at least an instruction concerning the ordinary definition of that term, i.e., that the defendants' vessel must have been within four leagues or twelve nautical miles of the nearest land territory of the United States.  However, because the evidence was uncontroverted that the defendants' vessel was well within this limit, we cannot see how this omission could have affected their substantial rights, as required under Olano.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants did not argue that the twelve-mile limit was inapplicable because their vessel was covered by a treaty that contracted the ordinary limit.  In fact, such treaties ordinarily expand the twelve-mile limit.  See, e.g., United States v. Doe, 860 F.2d 488, 490 (1st Cir.1988).  We do not decide under what circumstances a defendant is entitled upon proper request to an instruction concerning the treaty exception to the twelve-mile limit.  In this case, however, it is clear that such an omission cannot, at the very least, rise to the level of \"plain error.\"   Given the failure of the defense to suggest that the exception was at all relevant, the omission is not \"plain error\";  certainly it did not \"seriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1550, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779) (internal quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Testimony of Customs Service Agent Alpers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants next contend that the trial court erred in not requiring pretrial disclosure of Alpers' opinion testimony that the defendants were the same individuals whom he observed fleeing the vessel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The defendants claim that Alpers' testimony was expert testimony, and thus the government's failure to comply with the expert disclosure requirements constituted a discovery violation.  The government contends that Alpers' testimony was not expert testimony, but rather constituted a permissible lay opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue in the trial was whether the three men who were arrested were three of the same four men who fled the vessel when they grounded it.  On direct examination, Alpers testified as to the events he witnessed with the aid of the FLIR system.  On cross-examination, defense counsel sought to undermine Alpers' assertion that the defendants were the same people whom he had observed on the vessel with the FLIR system.  On redirect examination, Alpers testified over the defendants' objection that in his opinion and based on his experience, he had no doubt that they were the same individuals.  The defendants contend that because Alpers' opinion was based not upon direct observation but instead upon images on the FLIR this was expert rather than lay testimony.  Because the government did not reveal in its expert report that Alpers would give his opinion regarding the identity of the defendants as the men who left the boat, the defendants claim that the government violated discovery rules by introducing the testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have rejected similar contentions in the past.  In United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 107 F.3d 960, 968 (1st Cir.1997), the defendants also claimed that customs agents had improperly testified as experts.  We stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148 (1st Cir.1989), we noted that the \"modern trend favors the admission of opinion testimony [from lay witnesses], provided it is well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible to cross-examination.\"  Id. at 157 (permitting drug user to express opinion that substance she found was cocaine).  We further explained that \"the individual experience and knowledge of a lay witness may establish his or her competence, without qualification as an expert, to express an opinion on a particular subject outside the realm of common knowledge.\"  Id.;  accord United States v. VonWillie, 59 F.3d 922, 929 (9th Cir.1995) (based on experience, police officer could testify as lay witness that it was common for drug traffickers to use weapons to protect drugs;  opinion was helpful to determination of whether defendant was involved in drug trafficking).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera-Santiago, 107 F.3d at 968.   Here, Alpers unquestionably had experience and knowledge in interpreting FLIR images outside the realm of the jurors' common knowledge.  Because he was able to form an opinion based on his direct observation and he was subject to cross-examination, it was permissible for him to offer his opinion as a lay witness.  The defendants' attempt to distinguish Rivera-Santiago is unavailing.  Alpers was not presented as an expert and he did not testify as an expert.  Thus it was not error for the trial court to allow him to give his opinion as to the identity of the individuals whom he had observed on the FLIR system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendants claim that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that they were the persons on the vessel who had dumped cocaine into the ocean.  We review such a contention taking the facts presented at trial in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v. Rogers, 121 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 778 (1st Cir.1994).  Undoubtedly, no single individual was able to observe the defendants unimpeded and unassisted from the time they left the vessel until they were arrested.  However, the circumstantial evidence that the defendants were the ones who had fled the vessel was sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that they had been seen on the vessel dumping the cocaine.  Four individuals were witnessed running into the mangroves.  Three individuals were arrested among the mangroves.  No other individuals were encountered in the area, and there was testimony that the area where the vessel grounded was remote and uninhabited.  Alpers testified that, in his opinion, the men who were arrested were the ones who had fled the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was not required to credit the defendants' theory that they were illegal aliens seeking to evade deportation.  The only evidence of this was presented by the defendants themselves, and it was within the scope of the jury's factfinding function to disregard this evidence entirely.  Thus, taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was ample evidence, both direct and circumstantial, from which a reasonable juror could have concluded that the defendants had been on the vessel, dumped cocaine from the vessel, grounded the vessel, fled to the mangroves, attempted to evade detection until their arrest, and then provided a false explanation of their behavior in light of the likely repercussions of their acts.  The defendants have failed to show that they are entitled to relief based on the alleged insufficiency of the evidence offered against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the convictions of the defendants are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We reject as without merit the defendants' contention that we should apply a more rigorous standard of review.  The defendants have requested that we adopt a rule that where a charge conference is not held in open court or on the record, it will be presumed that a defendant properly objected to any instruction which he or she wishes to pursue on appeal.  However, our previous decisions establish that a party waives any objection it might have to a jury instruction by failing to enter that objection into the record immediately after the judge has instructed the jury and before the jury begins deliberations.  See, e.g., Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 69 F.3d 1205, 1212-13 (1st Cir.1995) (civil context);  United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 160-61 (1st Cir.1993) (criminal context);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.

Having reviewed the defendants' arguments, we affirm the convictions for the reasons expressed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v. Cardoza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197618\"><a href=\"/opinion/197618/united-states-v-cardoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir.1997); United States v.

On July 6, 1995, a police officer with the Fajardo Drugs and Narcotics Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department received two anonymous tips that a shipment of cocaine was going to be delivered in the Fajardo area.  The government sent aloft a United States Customs Service aircraft equipped with radar and an infrared night vision system known by the acronym \"FLIR,\" which means \"forward looking infrared.\"   The FLIR system allows objects to be monitored in complete darkness based on the heat of the objects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aircraft began patrolling the area between Fajardo and the island of Culebra at an altitude of 1500 feet.  At 10:15 p.m. Customs Service Agent John Alpers, who operated the aircraft's FLIR, located a marine vessel northwest of Culebra at 1825 degrees latitude and 6526 degrees longitude.  The vessel, approximately thirty feet long and with two engines, was moving toward Fajardo at a high rate of speed with its navigational lights out in violation of 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1703.  When first located, it was approximately five miles from the nearest land point on United States territory.  During subsequent events, Alpers tracked the vessel with FLIR and radar, but at no point did he make direct visual observations of the vessel or its occupants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aircraft lost contact with the vessel, but it reacquired it at 10:56 p.m.  At that point, the aircraft descended to an altitude of 1000 feet and continued to track the vessel from a distance of one-half to three-quarters of a mile away.  At 11:02 p.m., Agent Alpers, with the aid of the FLIR system, observed movements of people on the vessel who \"appear[ed] to throw large objects\" overboard.  At that point, the vessel was again approximately five miles from the nearest land point on United States territory.  After the objects were thrown overboard, the vessel departed and headed toward Fajardo at high speed, leaving the objects in the water.  At approximately 11:20 p.m., the vessel beached in the Cabeza Chiquita area of Puerto Rico, about nine nautical miles from the place where the objects were thrown from the vessel.  Four persons then ran from the vessel into a remote area dense with mangroves.  No other boats were in the immediate area of the vessel throughout this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aircraft requested that a National Guard helicopter fly to and mark the area where the objects had been dumped.  In addition, it requested the assistance of other officers in apprehending the persons who had run from the vessel.  A Puerto Rico police helicopter, a National Guard helicopter, and a police boat arrived to search the area for the persons who had fled the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the helicopters illuminated the area with floodlights to assist the law enforcement officers on the ground in detaining the individuals.  Between 12:02 and 12:09 a.m., the police arrested three persons.  Two of them are the defendants in this case.  Defendant Santana-Rosa was found hiding under water while holding on to mangrove roots.  Defendant Daz-Morla and the third individual were hidden about ten feet from defendant Santana-Rosa.  The fourth person observed leaving the vessel was not apprehended.  Both defendants gave false names when arrested.  Defendant Santana-Rosa asked the arresting officer why so much government force was being used to catch an illegal alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police recovered twenty-seven bales of ninety-one percent pure cocaine weighing 970 kilograms at the site where Alpers witnessed objects being dumped from the vessel.  The defendants were charged with a violation of 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a), which makes it illegal, inter alia, to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it on a vessel within the customs waters of the United States.  See 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a), (c)(1)(D) (West Supp.1997).  The defendants were convicted by jury after a five-day trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the main defense was that there was a lack of direct evidence establishing that the defendants were the individuals observed on the FLIR system leaving the vessel.  One of the defendants testified on his own behalf, stating that he was an illegal alien seeking to avoid detection.  Alpers testified that the customs waters of the United States extend for twelve miles from any land mass that is part of United States territory and that he observed the vessel within the customs waters of the United States.  Alpers also testified on redirect over the objection of counsel that, based on his experience, in his opinion the individuals who were arrested were the ones he witnessed fleeing the vessel.  Following their conviction, the defendants filed a timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants allege that three errors in the district court proceedings require our attention.  They contend that:  (1) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"within the customs waters of the United States\";  (2) the trial court erred in not requiring pretrial disclosure of the testimony of Customs Service Agent Alpers;  and (3) the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that they were the persons on the vessel who had dumped cocaine into the ocean.  The court discusses these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jury Instruction on Customs Waters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute under which the defendants were convicted, 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903, makes it \"unlawful for any person ... on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States ... to knowingly or intentionally ... possess with intent to ... distribute ... a controlled substance.\"  46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a) (West Supp.1997).  A vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, inter alia, when it is \"located within the customs waters of the United States.\"  Id. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(D).  The defendants allege that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"within the customs waters of the United States,\" a substantive element of the offense for which they were convicted.  The defendants contend that, because the term has a technical meaning not within the expertise of the jury, the judge's failure to define it meant that the government was not required to prove this element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendants failed to object to the trial court's instruction, our review is for plain error.

See 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(b)-(c) (West Supp.1997).  Other statutes make clear, however, that the customs waters of the United States extend for four leagues, or twelve miles, from United States territory unless another distance has been established by treaty.  See 19 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1401(j) (West 1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In this case, the judge instructed the jury that one element of the offense was that the vessel be within the \"customs waters of the United States\" but he failed to provide the jury with a further definition of the term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the omission of a definition of the element from the jury instructions, the jury was not left completely without guidance on the issue.  The government introduced unrebutted testimony by Alpers as to both what constituted customs waters and the location of the vessel within customs waters.  At trial, Alpers testified that the vessel was first picked up on FLIR within five miles of United States territory.  He also testified that the customs waters of the United States extend for twelve miles from the territory of the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Alpers' testimony did not, however, mention that the twelve-mile limit can be modified by treaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this testimony, the defendants have failed to meet their burden to show that the omitted instruction affected their substantial rights.  We agree with the defendants that the term \"customs waters of the United States\" is outside the experience of lay jurors, and that in the usual case the district court must give at least an instruction concerning the ordinary definition of that term, i.e., that the defendants' vessel must have been within four leagues or twelve nautical miles of the nearest land territory of the United States.  However, because the evidence was uncontroverted that the defendants' vessel was well within this limit, we cannot see how this omission could have affected their substantial rights, as required under Olano.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants did not argue that the twelve-mile limit was inapplicable because their vessel was covered by a treaty that contracted the ordinary limit.  In fact, such treaties ordinarily expand the twelve-mile limit.  See, e.g., United States v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513417\"><a href=\"/opinion/513417/united-states-v-john-doe-aka-rafael-segundo-crespo-herrera-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 490 (1st Cir.1988).  We do not decide under what circumstances a defendant is entitled upon proper request to an instruction concerning the treaty exception to the twelve-mile limit.  In this case, however, it is clear that such an omission cannot, at the very least, rise to the level of \"plain error.\"   Given the failure of the defense to suggest that the exception was at all relevant, the omission is not \"plain error\";  certainly it did not \"seriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Johnson v.

On direct examination, Alpers testified as to the events he witnessed with the aid of the FLIR system.  On cross-examination, defense counsel sought to undermine Alpers' assertion that the defendants were the same people whom he had observed on the vessel with the FLIR system.  On redirect examination, Alpers testified over the defendants' objection that in his opinion and based on his experience, he had no doubt that they were the same individuals.  The defendants contend that because Alpers' opinion was based not upon direct observation but instead upon images on the FLIR this was expert rather than lay testimony.  Because the government did not reveal in its expert report that Alpers would give his opinion regarding the identity of the defendants as the men who left the boat, the defendants claim that the government violated discovery rules by introducing the testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have rejected similar contentions in the past.

Here, Alpers unquestionably had experience and knowledge in interpreting FLIR images outside the realm of the jurors' common knowledge.  Because he was able to form an opinion based on his direct observation and he was subject to cross-examination, it was permissible for him to offer his opinion as a lay witness.  The defendants' attempt to distinguish Rivera-Santiago is unavailing.  Alpers was not presented as an expert and he did not testify as an expert.  Thus it was not error for the trial court to allow him to give his opinion as to the identity of the individuals whom he had observed on the FLIR system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendants claim that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that they were the persons on the vessel who had dumped cocaine into the ocean.  We review such a contention taking the facts presented at trial in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v. Rogers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744604\"><a href=\"/opinion/744604/united-states-v-charles-rogers-jr-united-states-of-america-v-andrew-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Montas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195767\"><a href=\"/opinion/195767/united-states-v-felix-montas/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 778 (1st Cir.1994).  Undoubtedly, no single individual was able to observe the defendants unimpeded and unassisted from the time they left the vessel until they were arrested.  However, the circumstantial evidence that the defendants were the ones who had fled the vessel was sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that they had been seen on the vessel dumping the cocaine.  Four individuals were witnessed running into the mangroves.  Three individuals were arrested among the mangroves.  No other individuals were encountered in the area, and there was testimony that the area where the vessel grounded was remote and uninhabited.  Alpers testified that, in his opinion, the men who were arrested were the ones who had fled the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was not required to credit the defendants' theory that they were illegal aliens seeking to evade deportation.  The only evidence of this was presented by the defendants themselves, and it was within the scope of the jury's factfinding function to disregard this evidence entirely.  Thus, taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was ample evidence, both direct and circumstantial, from which a reasonable juror could have concluded that the defendants had been on the vessel, dumped cocaine from the vessel, grounded the vessel, fled to the mangroves, attempted to evade detection until their arrest, and then provided a false explanation of their behavior in light of the likely repercussions of their acts.  The defendants have failed to show that they are entitled to relief based on the alleged insufficiency of the evidence offered against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the convictions of the defendants are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We reject as without merit the defendants' contention that we should apply a more rigorous standard of review.  The defendants have requested that we adopt a rule that where a charge conference is not held in open court or on the record, it will be presumed that a defendant properly objected to any instruction which he or she wishes to pursue on appeal.  However, our previous decisions establish that a party waives any objection it might have to a jury instruction by failing to enter that objection into the record immediately after the judge has instructed the jury and before the jury begins deliberations.

Let's discuss those statutes that are charged in the indictment.  Let's discuss 46 U.S.C.  [App.], Section 1903(a).  One of the offenses charged in the indictment under 46 United States Code [App.], Section 903(a) [sic], provides in the pertinent part as follows:</p>\n        <p>It is unlawful for any person on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to knowingly or intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.</p>\n        <p>Section 1903(b) and [(c)(1)](D), vessel of the U.S. defined:  Definition of a vessel for the purpose of this section means (D), capital (D), parenthesis:  A vessel located within the customs waters of the United States.</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>Let's discuss the essential elements of that offense.  In order to establish the offense proscribed by Title 46, U.S.Code, Section 1903, the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n        <p>One, that each defendant was on board a motor vessel located within the custom waters of the United States.</p>\n        <p>....</p>\n        <p>....  The superseding indictment in this case also charges that a vessel is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.  In order to find defendants guilty in this case, you will have to determine, among other things, if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the vessel in question was a vessel within the custom waters of the United States.</p>\n        <p>Section 1903(b) and (D):  Vessel of the United States defined means--for the purpose of this sections [sic] means a vessel located within the custom waters of the United States.</p>\n        <p>Tr. 706-08.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Alpers' complete testimony on the issue, made while illustrating his comments with the aid of a navigational chart depicting the area in question that was also entered into evidence, is as follows:</p>\n        <p>Q: Now, have you marked the initial sighting in the map?</p>\n        <p>A: Yes, sir, I have.</p>\n        <p>Q: Would you--using this pointer--</p>\n        <p>MR. QUILES:  If I may approach the witness?</p>\n        <p>Q: (By Mr. Quiles)--show the jury when--where is it that you first sighted the boat.</p>\n        <p>A: Okay.  It's right here, ladies and gentlemen, right in this area here.  That's when we first acquired the vessel, again traveling lights-out, high rate of speed, heading 260 towards this area here, heading this direction approximately here.</p>\n        <p>Q: Now, sir, were you able to--are you able to tell the members of the jury at what coordinates was that boat--</p>\n        <p>A: Yes, sir.</p>\n        <p>Q: --located at once you first locked into it?</p>\n        <p>A: Right.  Approximate coordinates, 1825 and 6526.  Again, that's a latitude and a longitude.  Again, that was in this area right here.  You can see Culebra, of course mainland Puerto Rico, and it was between both of those, north of this small island chain here.</p>\n        <p>Q: As a customs officer was that within the customs waters of the United States?</p>\n        <p>A: Yes, sir.  That was within the U.S. Customs waters.</p>\n        <p>Q: How far out do the customs waters of the United States extend from any land point belonging to the United States?</p>\n        <p>A: Twelve miles.</p>\n        <p>Q: And there are--are how many land points there in that area that you know of that belong to the United States?</p>\n        <p>A: That is all U.S. territory.  Culebra, the island chain, of course Puerto Rico.  And the vessel, when first acquired, was approximately five miles north of a land mass, thus in U.S. Customs waters.</p>\n        <p>Tr.
