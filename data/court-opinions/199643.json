Claimant      Israel    Falcon-Cartagena\n\nappeals from a decision of the district court upholding the\n\nCommissioner's denial of disability and disability insurance\n\nbenefits under the Social Security Act.               After carefully\n\nreviewing    the    briefs   and   record    below,    we   affirm   the\n\nCommissioner's decision.\n\n            The issues on appeal center around two questions:\n\n(1) whether, as of September 30, 1997, the date he was last\n\ninsured, claimant had the exertional capability to perform\n\nsedentary work, and (2) whether the ALJ's reliance on the\n\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines (the \"Grid\"), 20 C.F.R. Part\n\n404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, was improper in light of his\n\nfinding     that      claimant      suffered     from       significant\n\nnonexertional limitations.         Claimant also contends that the\n\nALJ improperly discounted his subjective complaints of pain.\n\n\n\n\nI.          Exertional Limitations\n\n            We conclude that there was ample support in the\n\nrecord for the ALJ's assessment of appellant's exertional\n\ncapabilities.        Although      claimant's   treating      physician\n\nconcluded that he was disabled, that is an issue reserved\n\nfor the Commissioner.        20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e)(1); Irlanda\n\f Ortiz v.

Secretary of Health\n\n and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n Moreover, the treating doctor's opinion was inconsistent\n\n with other evidence in the record including treatment notes\n\n and    evaluations   performed        by    both   examining     and    non-\n\n examining physicians, and the record as a whole was adequate\n\n to support the findings.1            Ward v. Commissioner of Social\n\n Security, 211 F.3d 652, 655 (1st Cir. 2000); Rodriguez, 647\n\n F.2d at 222.\n\n            The   same    can    be   said    for   the   ALJ's   findings\n\n concerning the appellant's subjective complaints of pain.\n\n Although claimant suffered from \"a clinically determinable\n\n medical impairment\" -- tenosynovitis and myositis -- \"that\n\n can reasonably be expected to produce the pain alleged,\"\n\n Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d\n\n 19, 21 (1st Cir. 1986), there was also evidence to the\n\n contrary, and the ALJ personally observed claimant at the\n\n hearing.     \"[W]e      pay    particular     attention    to    an    ALJ's\n\n\n\n    1For the same reason, we reject claimant's contention that\nthe ALJ erred in failing to give controlling weight to his\ntreating physician's opinion.

Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices, 890 F.2d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1989) (citations and\n\ninternal quotations omitted).\n\n\n\nII.       Nonexertional Limitations\n\n          Claimant's nonexertional impairments present only\n\na   slightly    closer       question.          Where       a    claimant        has     a\n\nnonexertional impairment in addition to an exertional limit,\n\nthe   decision        to   rely     on        the    Grid       to     sustain         the\n\nCommissioner's burden of proof depends upon whether the\n\nclaimant's nonexertional impairments significantly affects\n\nhis   ability    to    perform      the       full   range      of     jobs      at    the\n\nrelevant exertional level.           See Rose v. Shalala, 34 F.3d 13,\n\n19 (1st Cir. 1994); Heggarty v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 996\n\n(1st Cir. 1991); Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 524.\n\n          Here,        the    ALJ     found          that       claimant         had     a\n\n\"significant\"         nonexertional           limitations            that     made      it\n\n\"impossible for him to perform tasks requiring constant\n\noverhead reaching and engage in complex, non routine and\n\nskilled tasks.\"        However, the ALJ determined that claimant's\n\ncapacity for the full range of (unskilled) sedentary work\n\nwas not significantly compromised, and, using Rule 201.23 of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe Grid as a \"framework,\" concluded that claimant was not\n\ndisabled.        Because   the    ALJ       reached    this   determination\n\nwithout taking any vocational testimony, he is deemed to\n\nhave relied exclusively on the Grid to show that jobs that\n\nclaimant could perform existed in the national economy.                    See\n\nOrtiz, 890 F.2d at 524 n.4.\n\n            A.     Mental Restriction\n\n            The relevant medical evidence shows that claimant\n\nsuffered    from    \"slight\"     or   \"mild\"     major    depression,      and\n\nexhibited    symptoms       of    nervousness,          anxiety,     somatic\n\ndifficulties, chest pain, and hypertension.                     Claimant's\n\ntreating physician noted that he frequently had trouble\n\nunderstanding instructions.             A treating psychiatrist and a\n\nconsulting psychiatrist evaluated claimant and reported that\n\nclaimant    had a relatively normal mental status except for\n\na depressed mood, poor concentration, poor recent memory,\n\nand   diminished     judgment     and       insight.     Psychiatric       RFC\n\nassessments and Psychiatric Review Technique Forms (\"PRTF\")\n\nrated claimant as moderately limited in his activities of\n\ndaily   living       and   in    several       work-related        areas    of\n\nfunctioning, but only slightly or not significantly limited\n\nin all other areas of functioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f             In his decision, the ALJ expressly adopted the\n\nopinions of the psychiatrists who rated claimant's abilities\n\nto do work-related activities.             To the extent claimant's\n\ntreating physician's opinion that claimant was unable to\n\nwork is inconsistent with those reports, we note that the\n\ntreating doctor is not a psychiatrist and that, in any case,\n\nher opinion on the ultimate issue of disability is not\n\ncontrolling.     20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e)(1); Irlanda Ortiz, 955\n\nF.2d at 769; Rodriguez, 647 F.2d at 222.             Accordingly, we\n\nthink that the ALJ was justified in relying on the expert\n\nmedical      opinions   of   the   state    psychiatrists,    and    his\n\ndecision demonstrates that he gave due consideration to the\n\neffect of claimant's mental impairment on his capacity for\n\nunskilled work.         Further, since the RFC and PRTF reports\n\nindicate that claimant was at the most moderately limited in\n\nareas   of    functioning     required     for   unskilled   work,    we\n\nconclude that they adequately substantiate the ALJ's finding\n\nthat claimant's mental impairment did not affect, more than\n\nmarginally, the relevant occupational base.\n\n\n\n             B. Reaching Restriction\n\n             Finally, with respect to claimant's limitation on\n\nreaching, we recognize that, since reaching is an activity\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\frequired      in       almost    all     unskilled    jobs,        significant\n\nlimitations on reaching may eliminate a large number of\n\noccupations        a    person   could    otherwise      do.       See   Social\n\nSecurity Ruling 85-15, Titles II and XVI--Capability to do\n\nOther Work--The Medical-Vocational Rules as a Framework for\n\nEvaluating Solely Nonexertional Impairments (S.S.A. 1985),\n\navailable in 1985 WL 56857.              In this case, the ALJ did not\n\nfind   that        claimant's     overall        ability    to     reach   was\n\nsignificantly affected.                Rather, the ALJ concluded that\n\nclaimant   was         unable    to    perform    only     tasks    requiring\n\n\"constant overhead reaching with the left arm.\"                     Since this\n\nspecific ability is only a narrow subset of the full range\n\nof reaching, and the evidence as a whole does not suggest\n\nthat the ALJ's characterization of claimant's limitation was\n\nunderstated,           we think the ALJ was justified in concluding\n\nthat claimant's reaching restriction had only a marginal\n\neffect on the relevant occupational base.                  Accordingly, the\n\nALJ's use of the Grid was proper and no further vocational\n\nevidence was required.\n\n           Affirmed.         Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f",

Mental Restriction\n\n            The relevant medical evidence shows that claimant\n\nsuffered    from    \"slight\"     or   \"mild\"     major    depression,      and\n\nexhibited    symptoms       of    nervousness,          anxiety,     somatic\n\ndifficulties, chest pain, and hypertension.

Psychiatric       RFC\n\nassessments and Psychiatric Review Technique Forms (\"PRTF\")\n\nrated claimant as moderately limited in his activities of\n\ndaily   living       and   in    several       work-related        areas    of\n\nfunctioning, but only slightly or not significantly limited\n\nin all other areas of functioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f             In his decision, the ALJ expressly adopted the\n\nopinions of the psychiatrists who rated claimant's abilities\n\nto do work-related activities.             To the extent claimant's\n\ntreating physician's opinion that claimant was unable to\n\nwork is inconsistent with those reports, we note that the\n\ntreating doctor is not a psychiatrist and that, in any case,\n\nher opinion on the ultimate issue of disability is not\n\ncontrolling.     20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e)(1); Irlanda Ortiz, 955\n\nF.2d at 769; Rodriguez, 647 F.2d at 222.             Accordingly, we\n\nthink that the ALJ was justified in relying on the expert\n\nmedical      opinions   of   the   state    psychiatrists,    and    his\n\ndecision demonstrates that he gave due consideration to the\n\neffect of claimant's mental impairment on his capacity for\n\nunskilled work.         Further, since the RFC and PRTF reports\n\nindicate that claimant was at the most moderately limited in\n\nareas   of    functioning     required     for   unskilled   work,    we\n\nconclude that they adequately substantiate the ALJ's finding\n\nthat claimant's mental impairment did not affect, more than\n\nmarginally, the relevant occupational base.\n\n\n\n             B. Reaching Restriction\n\n             Finally, with respect to claimant's limitation on\n\nreaching, we recognize that, since reaching is an activity\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\frequired      in       almost    all     unskilled    jobs,        significant\n\nlimitations on reaching may eliminate a large number of\n\noccupations        a    person   could    otherwise      do.       See   Social\n\nSecurity Ruling 85-15, Titles II and XVI--Capability to do\n\nOther Work--The Medical-Vocational Rules as a Framework for\n\nEvaluating Solely Nonexertional Impairments (S.S.A. 1985),\n\navailable in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">56857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.              In this case, the ALJ did not\n\nfind   that        claimant's     overall        ability    to     reach   was\n\nsignificantly affected.                Rather, the ALJ concluded that\n\nclaimant   was         unable    to    perform    only     tasks    requiring\n\n\"constant overhead reaching with the left arm.\"                     Since this\n\nspecific ability is only a narrow subset of the full range\n\nof reaching, and the evidence as a whole does not suggest\n\nthat the ALJ's characterization of claimant's limitation was\n\nunderstated,           we think the ALJ was justified in concluding\n\nthat claimant's reaching restriction had only a marginal\n\neffect on the relevant occupational base.                  Accordingly, the\n\nALJ's use of the Grid was proper and no further vocational\n\nevidence was required.\n\n           Affirmed.         Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f</pre>",
