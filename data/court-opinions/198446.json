Gannon, Attorney, Department of Justice, with whom\r\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Gerard B. Sullivan,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                 April 28, 1999\r\n                                           Per Curiam.  Defendant-appellant, Theodore Perry, appeals\r\nhis conviction for possessing a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n922(g)(1).  We affirm in all respects.\r\nWe set forth the facts as a reasonable jury could have\r\nfound them to be.  On July 3, 1997, uniformed Providence police\r\nofficer Anabel Bez was working in a marked police cruiser in\r\nProvidence's West End.  Bez received a call about two men who were\r\nsuspected of selling drugs.  Both were described as African-\r\nAmerican and wearing white T-shirts; one was wearing red pants, the\r\nother blue pants.  In response to the call, Bez radioed Officer\r\nEdward Gonzlez, met with him, and arranged to converge with him on\r\nthe Cranston-Dexter intersection.\r\nWhen Officer Bez arrived at the intersection, he saw the\r\ntwo men who had been described in the call.  Perry was one of the\r\nmen, and Wesley Lucas was the other.  As Bez parked his cruiser on\r\nCranston, he saw Officer Gonzlez's cruiser coming towards him\r\nalong Cranston.  Gonzlez parked his cruiser nose-to-nose to\r\nBez's, directly in front of the two men.\r\nThe men turned and began to walk away.  Officer Bez got\r\nout of his car and told the men to stop.  Lucas stopped, but Perry\r\nran away.  Officer Gonzlez pulled his cruiser around the corner\r\nonto Dexter Street and blocked Perry's escape. When Perry saw\r\nGonzlez blocking his path, he ducked into a clump of bushes and\r\ndiscarded a handgun.  Gonzlez shouted, \"Gun!\", but Bez did not\r\nhear him.  When Perry emerged from the bushes, he was directly in\r\nfront of Bez, who arrested him.\r\nOfficer Bez drove the cruiser around the corner to\r\nOfficer Gonzlez's car.  Gonzlez went into the bushes and located\r\nthe discarded handgun.  When Bez joined him there, he showed Bez\r\nthe gun on the ground deep in the bushes.  As the two officers were\r\nlooking at the handgun, they heard the sound of breaking glass. \r\nPerry had kicked out the back window of Bez's cruiser, and was\r\nrunning down Dexter Street.  Gonzlez chased him and recaptured him\r\nimmediately.  The officers called their sergeant and Detective\r\nRobert Badessa to the scene.  Badessa took photographs of the scene\r\nand seized the gun, a Bryco Jennings .380 caliber pistol.\r\nFollowing a jury trial in the United States District\r\nCourt for the District of Rhode Island, Perry was convicted of\r\npossessing a firearm as a previously convicted felon.  The district\r\ncourt sentenced him to a term of 77 months imprisonment to be\r\nfollowed by a three year period of supervised release.\r\nPerry's first argument is that the prosecutor committed\r\nreversible error in his closing argument by stating: (1) that the\r\ndefendant was a wife abuser, and (2) that the defendant testified\r\nto a different version of the truth.  At first blush, these\r\ncomments seem to fall within the pale: the \"wife abuser\" reference\r\nrelated to evidence of a prior conviction, and the second comment\r\nappears sufficiently neutral to avoid classification as\r\nimpermissible vouching.\r\nEven if we assume arguendo the validity of the\r\ndefendant's assertions, we are constrained by the fact that the\r\ndefendant did not interpose a contemporaneous objection to these\r\nstatements during the course of the prosecutor's closing argument. \r\nAccordingly, we review only for plain error.  Error rises to this\r\nlevel only when it \"so shocking that it seriously affected the\r\nfundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings\r\nconducted below.\"  United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\r\nHere, the statements complained of fall far short of the\r\nplain error threshold.  They do not in any way interfere with the\r\njury's ability to resolve the paramount issue in this case --\r\nwhether Perry possessed a firearm.  Moreover, they were followed by \r\ninstructions from the district court advising the jury: (1) that\r\nstatements by counsel are not evidence and are not to be considered\r\nin reaching a verdict, and (2) that it is the responsibility of the\r\njury to weigh the credibility of witnesses.  In light of this fact,\r\nand the overwhelming evidence of Perry's guilt, there is no basis\r\nfor this Court to conclude that the alleged erroneous statements by\r\nthe prosecutor in his closing argument resulted in a miscarriage of\r\njustice meriting a reversal.  See United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d\r\n120, 133 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 855 (1987).\r\nPerry's second argument is that he was denied his right\r\nto a fair trial because the district court refused to divulge the\r\nidentity of, or conduct an in camera examination of, the informant\r\nwho called the police.\r\n We review a district court's decision not to force the\r\nprosecution to divulge the identity of a confidential informant for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325,\r\n1335 (1st Cir. 1994). In this context, the abuse of discretion\r\nstandard is quite deferential:  the district court's resolution of\r\na disclosure request should be upheld as long as it comports with\r\nsome reasonable rendition of the record.  See United States v.\r\nRobinson, 144 F.3d 104, 106 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nThe Supreme Court first recognized a \"tattler's\r\nprivilege\" -- that is, a privilege to withhold the identity of an\r\ninformant -- in Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53 (1957).  See\r\nRobinson, 144 F.3d at 106.  The privilege is designed to protect\r\nthe government's sources and to shield citizens who contribute\r\ntheir knowledge to facilitate the prosecution of criminal acts.\r\nStill, the privilege is not absolute.  In determining whether\r\njustification for an exception exists, the nisi prius court must\r\nbalance the interests undergirding the privilege against the\r\naccused's fundamental right to a fair trial, and, in doing so, must\r\ntake into account the full set of relevant circumstances --\r\nincluding the nature of the crime charged, the contours of the\r\ndefenses asserted, the available means of proving the charges and\r\ndefenses, and the significance of the informant's role.  See id.\r\nTo further the policies behind the Roviaro rationale, the\r\ntrial court's analysis begins with a presumption favoring\r\nconfidentiality.  Thus, the defendant bears the burden of\r\npersuasion to show that disclosure is necessary to mount an\r\nadequate defense.  See id.  This burden is heavy, but not\r\ninsurmountable.  See id.  If, for example, the informant is the\r\nsole participant, other than the accused, in the transaction\r\ncharged, or if the informant is the only person who is in a\r\nposition to amplify or contradict crucial testimony of government\r\nwitnesses, then the court may order disclosure.  See id.\r\nHere, Perry moved for disclosure of the identity of the\r\nperson who called Officer Bez on July 3, 1997, to tell him about\r\ntwo African-American men suspected of selling drugs at the\r\nCranston-Dexter intersection.  At the hearing before the district\r\ncourt, the prosecutor stated that a detective had interviewed the\r\ninformant and confirmed that the informant saw neither the chase of\r\nPerry, nor his arrest, nor the discarding of the gun.  The district\r\ncourt noted that the informant had called the police to report\r\nsuspected drug dealing, but the crux of the case was whether or not\r\nPerry possessed a firearm.  Finding that the informant was akin to\r\na tipster, it denied Perry's motion to disclose the informant's\r\nidentity.\r\nIn this instance, because the government's informant\r\nneither participated in nor witnessed the events that inculpated\r\nthe defendant and led to his arrest, the informant is a mere\r\ntipster.  See id.  Tipsters, as opposed to informants who are\r\nactive participants in the crimes charged, generally deserve\r\nanonymity.  See United States v. Hemmer, 729 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir.\r\n1984). The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing\r\nto force the government to divulge the informant's identity.\r\nThird, Perry argues that the district court committed\r\nerror in interpreting the Sentencing Guidelines to the extent that\r\nPerry's sentence was imposed consecutively to his state sentence\r\nfor violating his state probation.\r\nAppellate review of a district court's application of the\r\nSentencing Guidelines involves a bifurcated inquiry.  We review de\r\nnovo a sentencing judge's assessment of a guideline's legal meaning\r\nand scope, but review the district court's factfinding only for\r\nclear error.  See United States v. Florence, 143 F.3d 11, 12 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  Within certain limits, a district court's decision to\r\nimpose a concurrent or consecutive sentence is reviewed for abuse\r\nof discretion.  See United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 536\r\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 479 (1996).\r\nSentencing Guidelines  5G1.3 governs the \"Imposition of\r\nSentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of\r\nImprisonment.\"  Most importantly, application note 6 to  5G1.3\r\nprovides in part that\r\n             [i]f the defendant was on federal or state\r\n  probation, parole, or supervised release\r\n  at the time of the instant offense, and\r\n  has had such probation, parole, or\r\n  supervised release revoked, the sentence\r\n  for the instant offense should be imposed\r\n  to run consecutive to the term imposed for\r\n  the violation of probation, parole, or\r\n  supervised release in order to provide an\r\n  incremental penalty for the violation of\r\n  probation, parole, or supervised release. \r\n  See  7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or\r\n  Supervised Release) (setting forth a\r\n  policy that any imprisonment penalty\r\n  imposed for violating probation or\r\n  supervised release should be consecutive\r\n  to any sentence of imprisonment being\r\n  served or subsequently imposed).\r\n\nHere, Perry was on state probation for a previous Rhode\r\nIsland offense at the time of his federal offense.  At the time of\r\nhis sentencing before the district court, his probation had been\r\nrevoked by the Rhode Island authorities.  Examining the application\r\nnote, the district court found it to be applicable, and sentenced\r\nPerry to 77 months imprisonment to be served consecutive to his\r\nstate sentence for violation of his probation.\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that commentary to the\r\nSentencing Guidelines must be given \"controlling weight unless it\r\nis plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\"  Stinson\r\nv. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 45 (1993) (quotation marks and\r\ncitations omitted).  Nothing in the application note quoted above,\r\nsee U.S.S.G.  5G1.3 (Commentary, note 6), is contrary to the\r\nSentencing Guidelines.  The district court correctly followed the\r\napplication note, and Perry was properly sentenced to a federal\r\nsentence to be served consecutive to his state term of\r\nimprisonment.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996).\r\nSentencing Guidelines  5G1.3 governs the \"Imposition of\r\nSentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of\r\nImprisonment.\"  Most importantly, application note 6 to  5G1.3\r\nprovides in part that\r\n             [i]f the defendant was on federal or state\r\n  probation, parole, or supervised release\r\n  at the time of the instant offense, and\r\n  has had such probation, parole, or\r\n  supervised release revoked, the sentence\r\n  for the instant offense should be imposed\r\n  to run consecutive to the term imposed for\r\n  the violation of probation, parole, or\r\n  supervised release in order to provide an\r\n  incremental penalty for the violation of\r\n  probation, parole, or supervised release. \r\n  See  7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or\r\n  Supervised Release) (setting forth a\r\n  policy that any imprisonment penalty\r\n  imposed for violating probation or\r\n  supervised release should be consecutive\r\n  to any sentence of imprisonment being\r\n  served or subsequently imposed).\r\n\nHere, Perry was on state probation for a previous Rhode\r\nIsland offense at the time of his federal offense.  At the time of\r\nhis sentencing before the district court, his probation had been\r\nrevoked by the Rhode Island authorities.  Examining the application\r\nnote, the district court found it to be applicable, and sentenced\r\nPerry to 77 months imprisonment to be served consecutive to his\r\nstate sentence for violation of his probation.\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that commentary to the\r\nSentencing Guidelines must be given \"controlling weight unless it\r\nis plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\"  Stinson\r\nv.

Nothing in the application note quoted above,\r\nsee U.S.S.G.  5G1.3 (Commentary, note 6), is contrary to the\r\nSentencing Guidelines.  The district court correctly followed the\r\napplication note, and Perry was properly sentenced to a federal\r\nsentence to be served consecutive to his state term of\r\nimprisonment.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
