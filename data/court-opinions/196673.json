We  must  decide\r                    SCHWARZER,  Senior  District  Judge.\r                                                       \r\n\nwhether   defendants   have   complied   with   various   federal\r\n\nenvironmental  laws that apply to the conversion of land on Pease\r\n\nAir  Force Base (Pease) in New Hampshire to civilian use incident\r\n\nto the base's closure.  The  United States Air Force entered into\r\n\na  long-term lease of a portion  of the base to Pease Development\r\n\nAuthority (PDA).   Concerned about the  resulting effects on  the\r\n\nclean up of hazardous wastes  on the base and the air  quality in\r\n\nthe area, the Conservation  Law Foundation (CLF) and the  Town of\r\n\nNewington, New Hampshire  (Newington) challenge  the Air  Force's\r\n\ndecision to lease the  property and the support of  that decision\r\n\nby  other federal agencies.   CLF and Newington  contend that the\r\n\nAir Force and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) violated\r\n\nsection  176(c) of the  Clean Air Act (CAA),  42 U.S.C.   7506(c)\r\n\n(Supp. III 1991), section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental\r\n\nPolicy Act (NEPA),  42 U.S.C.    4332(2)(C)  (1988), and  section\r\n\n120(h)(3)   of   the   Comprehensive    Environmental   Response,\r\n\nCompensation  and Liability Act  (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.   9620(h)(3)\r\n\n(1988).    PDA, the  State of  New  Hampshire, and  several other\r\n\ninterested parties have intervened and,  along with the Air Force\r\n\nand the EPA, oppose the relief sought.  \r\n\n          In  a lengthy  opinion  ruling on  the parties'  cross-\r\n\nmotions for summary judgment, the  district court found that  the\r\n\nAir Force had violated  NEPA and CERCLA and directed it to submit\r\n\na Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement (Supplemental\r\n\nFEIS),  including  a  remedial  design  for  contaminated parcels\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncovered  by  the lease.    The district  court  denied injunctive\r\n\nrelief,   however,   and   dismissed   all    remaining   claims.\r\n\nConservation  Law Found. v. Department  of the Air  Force, 864 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. 265 (D.N.H. 1994).\r\n\n          Plaintiffs have  appealed from the  dismissal of  their\r\n\nCAA  claims and  the denial  of injunctive  relief.   The federal\r\n\ndefendants  have   cross-appealed  from  the  finding  that  they\r\n\nviolated CERCLA, but have not appealed the district court's order\r\n\ndirecting them to prepare a Supplemental FEIS.  We have appellate\r\n\njurisdiction under 28  U.S.C.   1291.  We reverse the judgment in\r\n\nso  far as it  found a CERCLA  violation but affirm  in all other\r\n\nrespects.  \r\n\n          Also before us are petitions filed by CLF and Newington\r\n\nto review an order of  the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA)\r\n\napproving PDA's  airport development plan.   We have jurisdiction\r\n\nunder  49 U.S.C.  app.    1486(a)  and  deny the  petitions  with\r\n\nrespect  to the  CAA claim  and retain  jurisdiction of  the NEPA\r\n\nclaim pending completion of the Supplemental FEIS.\r\n\n                       I.  BACKGROUND FACTS\r                                 I.  BACKGROUND FACTS\r\n\n          Acting under  the Base  Closure and Realignment  Act of\r\n\n1988 (the Base  Closure Act), Pub. L. No. 100-526, 102 Stat. 2627\r\n\n(1988)  (codified as amended at 10 U.S.C.    2687 (1988 &amp; Supp. V\r\n\n1993)),  the Air  Force  closed Pease  in  March 1991.    Located\r\n\nadjacent  to Newington  and Portsmouth,  New Hampshire,  the base\r\n\noccupies some 4,200 acres and comprises extensive facilities that\r\n\nsupported  Air Force  operations, including  a  runway.   PDA was\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncreated  as an agency  of the State  of New Hampshire  to acquire\r\n\ncertain  parcels of  land  within the  base  and to  develop  and\r\n\nimplement a plan for their reuse.  It ultimately developed a plan\r\n\nenvisioning  a  commercial   airport,  light  industry,   various\r\n\ncommercial uses, retail space, and open space.\r\n\n          In preparation for the transfer of land to PDA, the Air\r\n\nForce in February  1990 launched  the process  of complying  with\r\n\napplicable  environmental  requirements.    The  details  of  the\r\n\nprocess  are set out at  length in the  district court's opinion,\r\n\nsee 864 F.  Supp. at 270-72, and a summary will suffice here.  In\r             \r\n\nFebruary  1991, the  Air  Force published  a Draft  Environmental\r\n\nImpact Statement  (DEIS)  on  which  CLF and  the  EPA  submitted\r\n\ncomments mainly addressing  air quality concerns.  In April 1991,\r\n\nthe  Air Force entered  into a  Federal Facility  Agreement (FFA)\r\n\nwith  the EPA  and the  State of New  Hampshire spelling  out its\r\n\nenvironmental  obligations incident  to  the transfer.   In  June\r\n\n1991,  the  Air  Force  prepared  a  Final  Environmental  Impact\r\n\nStatement  (FEIS).   The FEIS  stated that,  although development\r\n\nunder  the  plan,  including   the  increased  traffic  it  would\r\n\ngenerate,  would not result in violations of state or federal air\r\n\nquality standards,  it would have  an impact  on New  Hampshire's\r\n\nability to achieve the ozone precursor reductions required by the\r\n\nCAA.  To resolve  these air quality  concerns, PDA, the EPA,  and\r\n\nthe New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) on\r\n\nAugust 1, 1991, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\r\n\nThe  EPA then issued its comments on the FEIS, stating that while\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe  project  would reduce  New  Hampshire's  ability to  achieve\r\n\ncompliance  with  the  CAA,  the MOU  provided  a  framework  for\r\n\ncompliance.  \r\n\n          As required by the Base Closure Act, the Air Force then\r\n\nprepared its  initial Record  of Decision (ROD),  documenting its\r\n\ndecisions regarding the closure  of Pease and the disposition  of\r\n\nthe   property.     The  ROD   addressed,  among   other  things,\r\n\nenvironmental issues,  including the  CAA's requirement  that the\r\n\nproject conform with the  New Hampshire State Implementation Plan\r\n\n(SIP)  and  CERCLA's requirement  that  the  Air Force  undertake\r\n\ncertain remedial measures to clean up contaminated sites prior to\r\n\nthe transfer of those sites to  PDA.  See 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1);\r                                                   \r\n\n42 U.S.C.   9620(h)(3).\r\n\n          Because  the  PDA  plan  contemplated  civilian airport\r\n\noperations, FAA approval was  required under the Surplus Property\r\n\nAct  of  1944,  50 U.S.C.  app.     1622(g) (1988)  (subsequently\r\n\nrecodified at  49  U.S.C.      47151-47153  (Supp.  1994)).    In\r\n\nFebruary  1992, the FAA issued  an ROD approving  elements of the\r\n\nplan  and  recommending  that  the  Air  Force  proceed  with its\r\n\nproposed transfer of property to PDA.  \r\n\n          In March  1992, CLF filed  this action in  the district\r\n\ncourt, alleging that the  Air Force and the EPA had  violated the\r\n\nCAA and NEPA.  In June 1992, Newington filed its action asserting\r\n\nthe same claims, as well as  a claim under CERCLA.  These actions\r\n\nwere later consolidated.  CLF and  Newington also filed petitions\r\n\nin this court for review of the FAA's February 1992 ROD, alleging\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthat  the FAA  violated NEPA  and  the CAA.   The  petitions were\r\n\nstayed pending the outcome of  the district court proceedings and\r\n\nare now before us along with the appeals from the judgment below.\r\n\n          While  these  actions  were  pending,  the  Air   Force\r\n\ncontinued to pursue the administrative proceedings preparatory to\r\n\nthe transfer.   In  March 1992,  it issued a  Memorandum for  the\r\n\nRecord updating  its earlier conformity determination.   In April\r\n\n1992, it issued a Supplemental ROD in which it rendered its final\r\n\ndetermination  concerning  the  disposal  of the  Pease  parcels,\r\n\nincluding an acknowledgment that remedial action  on contaminated\r\n\nareas  had to be completed before it could transfer those parcels\r\n\nby deed.  The Air Force then prepared a Preliminary Environmental\r\n\nSurvey and,  on the basis of the survey, issued its Finding of No\r\n\nSignificant Impact (FONSI).  In April 1992, the Air Force entered\r\n\ninto a 55-year lease  and contract of conveyance to  PDA covering\r\n\nthese parcels.\r\n\n                       II.

THE CLEAN AIR ACT CLAIMS\r\n\n          The purpose of the CAA, as the district court observed,\r\n\nis  \"to protect and enhance the Nation's air quality, to initiate\r\n\nand  accelerate a  national program  of research  and development\r\n\ndesigned  to  control air  pollution,  to  provide technical  and\r\n\nfinancial assistance  to the States in the execution of pollution\r\n\ncontrol programs,  and to  encourage the development  of regional\r\n\npollution  control programs.\"  See 864 F.

Pursuant  to  the  Act,  the   EPA\r\n\nestablished  National  Ambient  Air  Quality   Standards  (NAAQS)\r\n\nreflecting  the   maximum  concentration  levels   of  particular\r\n\npollutants  (criteria pollutants)  allowable  to  protect  public\r\n\nhealth.   See 42 U.S.C.   7409 (Supp. III 1991).  Among them were\r                       \r\n\nNAAQS for ozone and  carbon monoxide, both of which  are relevant\r\n\nhere.   See 40 C.F.R.     50.8, 50.9 (1995).   Responsibility for\r                     \r\n\nachieving  and maintaining the  NAAQS falls on  the states, which\r\n\nare  required   to  submit  state  implementation   plans  (SIPs)\r\n\nspecifying the manner in which they will achieve and maintain the\r\n\nNAAQS for the various criteria pollutants.   See 42 U.S.C.   7407\r                                                          \r\n\n(1988 &amp; Supp. III 1991).  \r\n\n          The  EPA  and  the  states  have  designated  different\r\n\nregions  according to the  level of  criteria pollutants  in each\r\n\narea.   See 42 U.S.C.    7407(d)(1)(A).   A region which  has not\r                     \r\n\nattained the NAAQS for a certain criteria pollutant is designated\r\n\na  \"nonattainment\"   area;  a   region  about  which   there  are\r\n\ninsufficient  data  to determine  compliance  with  the NAAQS  is\r\n\ndesignated  \"unclassified\"  and  deemed  in  compliance  with the\r\n\nNAAQS.  See id.   At the time the decisions challenged  here were\r                         \r\n\nmade,  the  Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester  region, where  the  Pease\r\n\nproject is located, was designated a \"serious nonattainment\" area\r\n\nfor ozone and an \"unclassified\" area for carbon monoxide.  See 40\r                                                                        \r\n\nC.F.R.   81.330 (1991).  \r\n\n          For   serious  nonattainment   areas  for   ozone,  the\r\n\nstatutory  deadline for attaining the NAAQS is November 15, 1999.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n42  U.S.C.    7511(a)(1) (Supp.  III 1991).   To  ensure progress\r\n\ntoward that goal, the  1990 amendments to the CAA  require states\r\n\nto revise their SIPs in  a manner that will result in  attainment\r\n\nof both the ultimate  deadline and interim milestones established\r\n\nby the 1990  amendments.  See 42 U.S.C.    7511a(c)(2) (Supp. III\r                                       \r\n\n1991).\r\n\n          To  further  promote  attainment   of  the  NAAQS   for\r\n\ndifferent  criteria pollutants,  the 1990  amendments also  added\r\n\nspecific criteria to section 7506(c)(1) (section 176(c)(1) of the\r\n\nCAA), the conformity  provision of the  Act, to wit,  subsections\r\n\n(A) and (B)(i)-(iii).   See S. Rep. No. 101-228, 101st  Cong., 2d\r                                     \r\n\nSess.  28 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3385, 3414.  The\r                                        \r\n\nconformity provision prohibits federal agencies from approving or\r\n\nsupporting any activity which does not conform to  an SIP.  Under\r\n\nthe  new criteria,  conformity means  that the activity  will not\r\n\ncause  new  violations, increase  the  frequency  or severity  of\r\n\nviolations,   or   delay   attainment   of   various   standards,\r\n\nrequirements, and milestones.  See 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)(B).\r                                            \r\n\n          Plaintiffs claim that  the EPA, the  Air Force and  the\r\n\nFAA  violated the  conformity provision.   Plaintiffs  make three\r\n\narguments: (1) that no determination of conformity could  be made\r\n\nuntil NEPA had  been complied with;  (2) that  the EPA failed  to\r\n\nmake a conformity determination;  and (3) that the Air  Force and\r\n\nthe FAA  violated the substantive requirements  of the conformity\r\n\nprovision.  As  a preliminary  matter, however,  we must  address\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nPDA's contention  that the  district court lacked  subject matter\r\n\njurisdiction over plaintiffs' CAA claims.  \r\n\n A.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCate,  904 F. Supp. at  529.  The  conformity provision meets the\r              \r\n\nsecond prong; as a provision of the Act, it is clearly \"in effect\r\n\nunder the Act.\"  See CLF, 24 F.3d at 1477.   The sole question is\r                                  \r\n\nwhether the conformity provision  qualifies as (1) a  schedule or\r\n\ntimetable  of  compliance,  (2)  an emission  limitation,  (3)  a\r\n\nstandard of  performance, or (4)  an emission standard,  as these\r\n\nterms are defined by other provisions of the Act.  If it does not\r\n\nfall within one of these four cat categories, there is no citizen\r\n\nsuit jurisdiction over the conformity provision claims. \r\n\n            (i) Emission Limitation/Emission  Standard.   Section\r                      (i) Emission Limitation/Emission  Standard.\r                                                                 \r\n\n7602(k)  defines the  terms  \"emission  standard\"  and  \"emission\r\n\nlimitation\" to  mean \"a requirement  established by the  State or\r\n\nthe   Administrator  which   limits   the   quantity,  rate,   or\r\n\nconcentration  of emissions  of  air pollutants  on a  continuous\r\n\nbasis . . . .\"   42 U.S.C.    7602(k) (Supp. III 1991); see  also\r                                                                           \r\n\n40 C.F.R.   51.100(z) (1991) (EPA's regulations implementing  the\r\n\nCAA).  The conformity provision is not \"a requirement established\r\n\nby the State or the Administrator\";  it is a provision of the CAA\r\n\nenacted by Congress.   And  while the provision  seeks to  ensure\r\n\nconformity with  existing emission  standards or  limitations, it\r\n\ndoes  not itself limit emissions of air  pollutants.  Thus, it is\r\n\nnot an emissions limitation or standard.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n            (ii)    Standard  of Performance.    Section  7602(l)\r                      (ii)    Standard  of Performance.\r                                                       \r\n\ndefines \"standard of performance\" as \"a requirement of continuous\r\n\nemission  reduction,  including any  requirement relating  to the\r\n\noperation  or  maintenance  of  a  source  to  assure  continuous\r\n\nemission  reduction.\"   42  U.S.C.    7602(l)  (1988 &amp;  Supp. III\r\n\n1991).   CLF argues that  the conformity provision  constitutes a\r\n\n\"standard of  performance\" within the meaning  of section 7602(l)\r\n\nbecause it prohibits a federal agency from supporting an activity\r\n\nunless that activity is  \"consistent with 'reducing' the severity\r\n\nand number of  violations in  a nonattainment area  and will  not\r\n\ndelay timely attainment of any required emission reductions.\"  In\r\n\nsupport of its argument, CLF relies upon this court's decision in\r\n\nCLF, 24 F.3d 1465, to which we now turn.\r             \r\n\n          In that case plaintiff  challenged the Federal  Highway\r\n\nAdministration's  approval of  a highway  project on  the ground,\r\n\namong others, that it  violated the conformity provisions  of the\r\n\nCAA.    Unlike the  instant case,  CLF  involved conformity  of a\r                                                \r\n\ntransportation plan subject to section 7506(c)(3).  Under section\r\n\n7506(c)(3)(A)(iii),  a  transportation  plan  or  program  is  in\r\n\nconformity  if it  contributes to  annual emission  reductions in\r\n\namounts specified elsewhere in the CAA. \r\n\n          Referring to  \"  7506(c)(1)  &amp; (c)(3),\" the  court held\r                                                         \r\n\nthat  \"[t]hese  conformity  requirements  plainly  constitute  an\r\n\nemissions  'standard  of  performance.'\"  CLF, 24  F.3d  at  1477\r                                                       \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n(emphasis  added).2  In so holding, the court observed that those\r\n\nprovisions  \"mandate  that  defendants  demonstrate   that  their\r\n\ntransportation  projects 'would  contribute  to annual  emissions\r\n\nreductions  consistent with' the levels  set out in   7511a(b)(1)\r\n\nand    7512a(a)(7).\"  Id.   This language reveals that  the court\r                                   \r\n\nwas relying on    7506(c)(3) for its finding that  the conformity\r                                      \r\n\nrequirements constitute a standard of performance.  See 42 U.S.C.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  7506(c)(3)(A)(iii)  (to be in conformity,  transportation plans\r\n\nor programs in ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas must\r\n\n\"contribute   to  annual  emissions  reductions  consistent  with\r\n\nsections 7511a(b)(1) and 7512a(a)(7)\").\r\n\n          On further reflection, it appears to us that  the route\r\n\nto  section 7506(c)(3) lies through  section 7506(c)(1).  In CLF,\r                                                                          \r\n\nas in the case before us, plaintiffs  were challenging government\r\n\naction  in approving  an  activity that  did  not conform  to  an\r\n\napproved implementation  plan or other conformity  criteria.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at  1478.   While  subsection  (c)(3) spells  out  particular\r            \r\n\nconformity  criteria for  transportation plans,  the crux  of the\r\n\naction remained the noncompliance by a government agency, not the\r\n\nviolation  of an emission standard  by the activity  itself.  The\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The court also held that prior case law  limiting citizen suit\r\njurisdiction  to enforcement  of specific  measures, commitments,\r\nand strategies for ensuring compliance with air quality standards\r\ndid  not  preclude  citizen  suit  jurisdiction  over  conformity\r\nprovision  claims  because  the  requirements of  the  conformity\r\nprovision were sufficiently specific and objective.  CLF, 24 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\nat  1477-78.   While we  do not  disagree with  that part  of the\r\nanalysis,  we do not reach  the specificity issue  unless we find\r\nthat  the   conformity  provision  otherwise   falls  within  the\r\nstatutory definition of an \"emission standard or limitation.\"\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nfoundation of the plaintiffs' claims, both there and here, is the\r\n\nsubsection (c)(1) prohibition of the federal agency's approval or\r\n\nsupport of any activity  not in conformity with an  approved plan\r\n\nor other standards, requirements, or milestones.\r\n\n          As noted above, a standard of performance is defined as\r\n\n\"a requirement  of continuous emission  reduction .  . .  .\"   42\r                                                           \r\n\nU.S.C.   7602(l) (emphasis added).  Nothing in section 7506(c)(1)\r\n\nimposes  an  emissions  reduction   requirement.    That  section\r\n\nprohibits a federal agency from approving, supporting, or funding\r\n\nany activities that  do not \"conform\" to the provisions of an SIP\r\n\nor   other  standards,  emissions   reduction  requirements,  and\r\n\nmilestones.   The sources  of those standards,  requirements, and\r\n\nmilestones may  include the  NAAQS or standards  and requirements\r\n\nset  out in  an SIP  or provisions  of the  CAA itself.   Section\r\n\n7605(c)(1)(A) and (B)  define what  standards must be  met for  a\r\n\nproject to  be in conformity.   In  the case of  a transportation\r\n\nplan  or program,  such  as the  one  at  issue in  CLF,  section\r                                                                 \r\n\n7506(c)(3)  imposes additional standards.   Thus,  the conformity\r\n\nprovision    refers   to   or   involves   standards,   reduction\r                                                  \r\n\nrequirements, and milestones, in the  sense that a federal agency\r\n\nmust determine that a  project meets those standards in  order to\r\n\napprove or support  it.  However, the conformity provision itself\r\n\nimposes no such standards  or requirements.  It simply  imposes a\r\n\nduty on federal agencies  not to approve or support  any activity\r\n\nthat does  not meet  standards, requirements, and  milestones set\r\n\nout in an SIP or the CAA.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n            (iii)  Schedule or Timetable of Compliance.  Section\r                      (iii)  Schedule or Timetable of Compliance.\r                                                                 \r\n\n7602(p) defines a \"schedule and  timetable of compliance\" to mean\r\n\n\"a  schedule  of  required  measures   including  an  enforceable\r\n\nsequence  of actions or operations  leading to compliance with an\r\n\nemission limitation, other limitation, prohibition, or standard.\"\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    7602(p) (1988).     CLF argues  that the  conformity\r\n\nprovision  is  a  \"schedule  or timetable  of  compliance\"  under\r\n\nsection    7604(f)    because    the     \"[c]onformity    section\r\n\n176(c)(1)(B)(iii)  specifically  prohibits federal  agencies from\r\n\nsupporting any  activity if it will 'delay  timely attainment' of\r\n\nthe schedule of compliance set  for nonattainment states like New\r\n\nHampshire to reach 15% emission reduction milestones in  1996 and\r\n\nfull  ozone  attainment in  1999.\"   This  argument  is, however,\r\n\ninapposite.   The issue  is not whether  the conformity provision\r\n\nrequires the  federal agency to determine that a project complies\r\n\nwith  a  schedule or  timetable  of  compliance found  elsewhere;\r\n\nrather it  is  whether  the  conformity  provision  is  itself  a\r\n\nschedule or  timetable of  compliance.   Plaintiffs here  are not\r\n\nsuing  a polluter for violation  of the schedule  or timetable of\r\n\ncompliance  referenced  in  section  176(c)(1)(B)(iii);  they are\r\n\nsuing  three  federal agencies  for  approving  and supporting  a\r\n\nproject  that   may  violate   that  schedule  or   timetable  of\r\n\ncompliance. \r\n\n          It might be argued that the conformity provision itself\r\n\nconstitutes a \"schedule or timetable of compliance\" as defined by\r\n\nsection  7602(p) in that  it requires federal  agencies to follow\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n\"an enforceable sequence of  actions . . . leading  to compliance\r\n\nwith an  emission limitation,  other limitation,  prohibition, or\r\n\nstandard.\"   See 42 U.S.C.    7602(p).   The conformity provision\r                          \r\n\nrequires  federal agencies  to follow  a sequence  of  actions to\r\n\nensure a  project's conformity with limitations  and standards in\r\n\nan existing  SIP or with  the NAAQS.   Those actions,  though not\r\n\nspecified in  the statute, necessarily include analyses comparing\r\n\n\"the  most recent estimates of emissions\" in the proposed project\r\n\narea with the projected emissions in the area were the project to\r\n\ngo forward, an assessment whether the project meets the  specific\r\n\nstatutory criteria for conformity based  on those analyses, and a\r\n\ndetermination  whether to support or approve the project.  See 42\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   7506(c)(1);  see also Cate, 904 F. Supp. at 523 (finding\r                                             \r\n\nthat an  agreement  requiring gas  pipe line  company to  conduct\r\n\ncertain modeling and analyses for determining what measures would\r\n\neliminate violations of  the NAAQS  and to develop  and submit  a\r\n\nplan  specifying  corrective  measures  and milestone  dates  for\r\n\ninstituting  corrective  measures  constituted  a  \"schedule\"  of\r\n\ncompliance  within  the  meaning  of  42  U.S.C.      7604(f)(1),\r\n\n7602(p)).\r\n\n          We  reject this argument, however, on  the basis of the\r\n\nEPA's interpretation of \"compliance  schedule\" in its regulations\r\n\nimplementing  the CAA.    40 C.F.R.     51.100 (1991).    Section\r\n\n51.100(p)  defines \"compliance  schedule\"  to mean  \"the date  or\r\n\ndates  by which a  source or category  of sources  is required to\r                                                           \r\n\ncomply  with  specific  emission  limitations  contained  in   an\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nimplementation plan  and with  any increments of  progress toward\r\n\nsuch  compliance.\"   (Emphasis  added.)   40  C.F.R.    51.100(q)\r\n\ndefines \"increments of progress\" to mean \"steps toward compliance\r\n\nwhich will be  taken by  a specific source  . . .  .\"   (Emphasis\r                                                    \r\n\nadded.)    These  definitions  make  clear  that  a  schedule  of\r\n\ncompliance  is  a  sequence  of  actions  that  a  polluter  must\r                                                                     \r\n\nundertake  by  certain  specified   dates  in  order  to  achieve\r\n\ncompliance with relevant emissions limitations or standards.  The\r\n\nconformity  requirements  themselves  do  not  fall  within  that\r\n\ndefinition.\r\n\n          2.  Review under the APA, 5 U.S.C.   702\r                    2.

Supp. at 1355-57.  Other cases cited by defendants are equally\r\n\ninapposite since  none involve judicial review  of agency action.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Greenfield and Montague Transp. Area v.  Donovan, 758\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  22, 26  (1st  Cir. 1985)  (\"mere  existence of  a  disputed\r\n\nquestion  of  federal  law   does  not  confer  federal  question\r\n\njurisdiction\").\r\n\n          Finally,  we must  consider whether  42 U.S.C.  7607(b)\r\n\nbars  district   court  jurisdiction  under  the   APA  over  the\r\n\nconformity  provision claim  against  the EPA.   Section  7607(b)\r\n\nprovides for  judicial review of \"any  . . . final  action of the\r\n\nAdministrator\"  by the  filing  of a  petition  in the  court  of\r\n\nappeals.  In this case, plaintiffs complain that the EPA violated\r\n\nsection  7506  by  approving  and supporting  the  Pease  project\r\n\nwithout  making  the  requisite conformity  determination.    The\r\n\nobligation under  that section  runs to any  \"department, agency,\r\n\n[and] instrumentality of the Federal Government.\"   Action by the\r\n\nEPA to comply with section 7506 is not action taken by  it in its\r\n\ncapacity of administrator and  enforcer of the CAA.   The text of\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nthe  statute supports  this  distinction.    Where it  refers  to\r\n\nobligations  imposed  on the  EPA by  the  CAA, it  imposes those\r\n\nobligations  on   the  Administrator.    See,   e.g.,  42  U.S.C.\r                                                              \r\n\n  7506(c)(4)(A)(\"the Administrator shall promulgate  criteria and\r\n\nprocedures  for  determining conformity  .  .  .  of  . .  .  the\r\n\nactivities  referred to  in [section  7506(c)(1)])\"; 42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n7601(a)(1)(\"the  Administrator  is authorized  to  prescribe such\r\n\nregulations as  are necessary  to carry out  his functions  under\r\n\nthis chapter\").   And review  under section 7607(b)  is only  \"of\r\n\naction  of the  Administrator.\"   In summary,  plaintiffs' claims\r\n\nconcern  action  taken  by the  EPA  qua  agency  of the  federal\r\n\ngovernment,  not as  administrator  or enforcer  of the  CAA, and\r\n\nhence are not subject to review under section 7607(b).\r\n\nB.  Conformity Determination in Absence of NEPA Compliance\r          B.  Conformity Determination in Absence of NEPA Compliance\r                                                                    \r\n\n          Plaintiffs argue  that since  the district  court found\r\n\nthe air quality analyses  used by the federal  agencies deficient\r\n\nand not in compliance with NEPA, it should not have addressed the\r\n\nmerits of  the CAA claims.  Neither the agencies nor the district\r\n\ncourt,  the   argument  goes,  could   make  reasoned  conformity\r\n\ndeterminations under  the CAA  based on noncomplying  air quality\r\n\nanalyses.   The  argument  raises two  separate  issues:   Was  a\r\n\nconformity  determination precluded  as  a matter  of law  before\r\n\ncompletion of the NEPA process?   And, even if it was  not, could\r\n\nthe  Air Force and the  FAA reasonably make  such a determination\r\n\nbefore the NEPA process had been completed here?\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\n          We  can readily  dispose of the  first issue.   Section\r\n\n7506(c)(1)   sets  forth   its  own   standards  for   evaluating\r\n\nconformity.   Nothing  in that  section or  elsewhere in  the CAA\r\n\nrequires the  information on which a  conformity determination is\r\n\nbased to have been subject to review, analysis, or public comment\r\n\npursuant to NEPA.   Moreover,  regulations issued by  the EPA  in\r\n\n1993   prescribing   procedures  and   criteria   for  conformity\r\n\ndeterminations  suggest  no  connection   between  NEPA  and  CAA\r\n\ncompliance.  See 42  U.S.C.   7506(c)(4)(A);  40 C.F.R.  Part 51,\r                          \r\n\nSubpart W  (1994); 40 C.F.R. Part  93, Subpart B (1994).   To the\r\n\ncontrary,  they specify that  \"[w]here multiple  Federal agencies\r\n\nhave jurisdiction  for various aspects  of a  project, a  Federal\r\n\nagency may choose to adopt the analysis of another Federal agency\r\n\nor  develop  its own  analysis in  order  to make  its conformity\r\n\ndetermination.\"   40  C.F.R.    93.154  (1994).   And  40  C.F.R.\r\n\n  93.156(b) (1994) states that  the 30-day comment period  for an\r\n\nagency's draft conformity  determination \"may be concurrent  with\r\n\nany  other  public  involvement,  such  as  occurs  in  the  NEPA\r\n\nprocess.\"  We see no basis  for engrafting a requirement that the\r\n\nNEPA process be completed before a determination is made.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs next contend that the Air Force and  the FAA\r\n\ncould  not reasonably  make the  conformity determination  before\r\n\ncompleting  the NEPA process.  If the federal agencies had relied\r\n\nentirely  on  the  FEIS   as  the  basis  for  their   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations, and if  the district  court had  later found  the\r\n\nanalyses  in the FEIS deficient under NEPA on substantive grounds\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nthat would also have affected the conformity analysis required by\r\n\nthe CAA,  the CAA conformity  determination might also  have been\r\n\ndeficient.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Sigler,  695 F.2d 957, 980-\r                                                      \r\n\n83  (5th  Cir.),  reh'g denied,  704  F.2d  1251  (1983).   That,\r                                        \r\n\nhowever, is not what happened here.   The NEPA problem arose from\r\n\na failure to comply  with the public comment requirement  in that\r\n\nthe  agencies   relied  for  their  conformity  determination  on\r\n\ninformation and analyses that  they had failed to include  in the\r\n\nFEIS or a  Supplemental FEIS  for public comment.   The  district\r\n\ncourt  found that those materials were a sufficient basis for the\r\n\nconformity  determinations; they simply  should have been subject\r\n\nto  public review and comment  to meet the  requirements of NEPA.\r\n\nSee 864 F. Supp. at 284-85, 288.  Because such  public review and\r             \r\n\ncomment  are not required  under the conformity  provision of the\r\n\nCAA,  the NEPA  violation  did  not  affect  the  merits  of  the\r\n\nconformity determination and hence does not require that we defer\r\n\npassing on the conformity claims. \r\n\nC.  Conformity Determination by the EPA\r          C.  Conformity Determination by the EPA\r                                                 \r\n\n          \"In  accordance with [the EPA's] responsibilities under\r\n\n. . . [NEPA and CAA],\" the EPA issued a review of the Air Force's\r\n\nFEIS on August 14, 1991.  In that review, the EPA addressed air\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nquality concerns related to the Pease project.  It first reviewed\r\n\nits  earlier conclusions  that  the project's  air impacts  would\r\n\nhinder New Hampshire's ability  to achieve required reductions in\r\n\nozone precursor emissions  and would cause  violations of the  CO\r\n\nstandards.  The EPA then reviewed the terms of the MOU into which\r\n\nit had  entered with PDA  and NHDES  and concluded  that the  MOU\r\n\n\"provides  a framework  that,  if  successful,  gives  reasonable\r\n\nassurance that  the Pease  development can proceed  in compliance\r\n\nwith the CAA.\"  The MOU itself quotes the text of section 7506(c)\r\n\nand states  that its  purpose  is to  \"accommodate the  statutory\r\n\nresponsibilities of the Parties  and provide assurance of orderly\r\n\nand  phased development  in  compliance with  CAA  requirements.\"\r\n\nMoreover,  the commitments in the  MOU indicate that  the EPA was\r\n\nconsidering  the specific  statutory criteria  in  the conformity\r\n\nprovision.  For example, the MOU specifies that, in the event the\r\n\nCO air quality analysis  required by the MOU shows  that proposed\r\n\ntraffic increases from redevelopment  \"may cause or contribute to\r\n\na new violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS,\" PDA must implement\r\n\nmeasures necessary  to reduce projected  traffic increases and/or\r\n\nair emissions  impacts to a level which will not result in such a\r\n\ncondition.  See infra pp.  48-50.\r                               \r\n\n           Section 7506(c) does not specify the form a conformity\r\n\ndetermination must take; when the  agencies acted, they had  only\r\n\nthe  statute  to  guide them  because  the  regulations  were not\r\n\nadopted until 1993.  Taking that fact into  account, we think the\r\n\nEPA's  actions  sufficiently  reflect  that  it  considered   the\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nproject's  potential  impact  on  air  quality  in  light  of the\r\n\nconformity provision  and, based on  the commitments in  the MOU,\r\n\nsee infra pp. 48-54, determined that the project could be carried\r                   \r\n\nout in conformity with applicable air quality standards. \r\n\nD.  Agencies' Compliance with 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)\r          D.  Agencies' Compliance with 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)\r                                                              \r\n\n          Having found that the  EPA made the required conformity\r\n\ndetermination, we now consider  whether its determination and the\r\n\ndeterminations  made by the Air  Force and the  FAA complied with\r\n\nthe statute.   As noted,  the statute prohibits  federal agencies\r\n\nfrom  supporting  or  approving  a project  unless  that  project\r\n\n\"conforms to an implementation plan after it has been approved or\r\n\npromulgated  under  section 7410  of this  title.\"   42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n7506(c)(1). \"[C]onformity to an implementation plan means\"\r\n\n          (A)  conformity  to an  implementation plan's\r\n          purpose  of  eliminating   or  reducing   the\r\n          severity  and  number  of violations  of  the\r\n          national ambient air quality standards; and \r\n          (B) that such activities will not--\r\n            (I)   cause  or   contribute  to   any  new\r\n          violation of any standard in any area;\r\n            (ii)  increase the frequency or severity of\r\n          any existing violation of any standard in any\r\n          area; or \r\n            (iii)  delay  timely   attainment  of   any\r\n          standard  or  any  required interim  emission\r\n          reductions or other milestones in any area.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)(A),(B). \r\n\n          At  the outset  we  note  two relevant  considerations:\r\n\nFirst,  no regulations  interpreting  these  provisions had  been\r\n\npromulgated   when    the   agencies   made    their   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations; therefore, they had only the words of the statute\r\n\nto  guide them.  Second, a conformity determination is inherently\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nfact-intensive;  therefore,  what  constitutes  conformity  is  a\r\n\nfunction  of  the unique  characteristics  of  the project  being\r\n\napproved. \r\n\n          1.  Substance of the Conformity Determinations.\r                    1.  Substance of the Conformity Determinations.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          The EPA, the Air Force, and the FAA all determined that\r\n\nthe  transfer  and  redevelopment  of Pease  met  the  conformity\r\n\nrequirements of section 7506(c)(1).  As discussed above, evidence\r\n\nthat the EPA made a conformity  determination is found in the MOU\r\n\nand the EPA's review of the FEIS.   See supra pp. 33-35.  The Air\r                                                       \r\n\nForce's conformity determination  is contained in two  documents:\r\n\nits  ROD,  issued August  20, 1991,  and  its Memorandum  for the\r\n\nRecord,   issued  March   20,   1992.     The  FAA's   conformity\r\n\ndetermination is contained  in its ROD, issued February 26, 1992.\r\n\nThose  documents reveal  the bases  for the  agencies' conformity\r\n\ndeterminations.   We now examine those bases to determine whether\r\n\nthe agencies abused  their discretion  when they  found that  the\r\n\nPease  project  met   the  conformity  requirements  of   section\r\n\n7506(c)(1).\r\n\n          The  agencies relied  on  information  and  commitments\r\n\ncontained   in  various  documents  in  making  their  conformity\r\n\ndeterminations.    The  EPA,   as  previously  noted,  based  its\r\n\nconformity determination on the commitments made in the MOU.  The\r\n\nAir Force based its determination  on the MOU, post-FEIS  studies\r\n\nconducted by NHDES and  discussed in the letter of  certification\r\n\nwritten  by  Robert  W.  Varney, Commissioner  of  NHDES  (Varney\r\n\nletter), and the FAA's conditional approval of certain aspects of\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nthe  Pease  project.   Similarly,  the FAA  based  its conformity\r\n\ndetermination  on  the MOU,  the  NHDES  studies and  conclusions\r\n\ndiscussed  in  the  Varney   letter,  the  Governor's  letter  of\r\n\nassurance,3 and  its own conditional approval  of certain aspects\r\n\nof  the Pease  project.  Each  of  the  bases  of  the  agencies'\r\n\nconformity determinations is briefly summarized below.\r\n\n            a.   The  Memorandum of  Understanding.   Because the\r                      a.

Because  the\r\nGovernor's letter relied  primarily on the NHDES  studies and the\r\nVarney  letter as the grounds for its assurance of conformity, we\r\ndo not discuss it separately.\r\n\n4   Ozone  precursors include  nitrous oxide  (NOx) and  volatile\r\ncompounds  (VOCs)  such  as hydrocarbons  (HC).

NHDES Studies and the Varney Letter.\r                                                               \r\n\nletter  considered  two  possible   readings  of  the  conformity\r\n\nrequirements  of section  7506(c)(1)(B):  (1)  that \"the  federal\r\n\nagency need  only  determine that  the  proposed activity  is  in\r\n\nconformity with the terms of the existing SIP,\" and (2) that \"the\r\n\ndetermination  must  address  the  three elements  set  forth  in\r\n\n  [7506(c)(1)(B] . . . separately, regardless of the terms of the\r\n\nSIP.\"   The  letter  concluded that  Pease development  conformed\r\n\nunder  either reading.  This  conclusion was based  on studies of\r\n\nair emissions  completed  by NHDES  after  the FEIS  was  issued.\r\n\nThese studies compared baseline emissions from 1989 (during full-\r\n\nscale  military  operations  at Pease)  and  1990  (when the  CAA\r\n\namendments were enacted and some military operations at Pease had\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nalready ceased) with projected emissions to 1997.5  According  to\r\n\nthe Varney letter,  the emissions were not  projected beyond 1997\r\n\nbecause such projections would be too speculative and  because by\r\n\n1997 New Hampshire would adopt a new SIP to address any increases\r\n\nin emissions.\r\n\n          Based on these  studies, NHDES concluded,  with respect\r\n\nto  ozone,  that  by  1997  emissions  of  HCs,  ozone's  primary\r\n\nprecursor, would likely reach approximately 2.5 tons per day, the\r\n\nsame level  as Pease  emitted in  1990, when  military operations\r\n\nwere  less than full-scale.  At full-scale, HC emissions at Pease\r\n\nhad been  variously estimated at 3.3 to 4 tons per day, which was\r\n\nstill  in compliance with the existing SIP.  Overall ozone levels\r\n\ngenerated locally  were expected  to decline because  older cars,\r\n\nwhich  produce more HCs,  were slowly being  replaced and because\r\n\n\"stage  II  vapor  recovery  at gasoline  filling  stations\"  was\r\n\ncommencing.   For  these  reasons, projections  of overall  ozone\r\n\nlevels  generated by the Pease area were expected to remain below\r\n\nthe 1989 and 1990 levels through Phase I of redevelopment.\r\n\n          With respect  to CO emission levels,  the NHDES studies\r\n\nshowed that, comparing 1989 and 1990 to 1997, Pease redevelopment\r\n\nwould not result  in a  significant increase in  the air  quality\r\n\nregion.    And  improvement  of  the  intersection  at  Spaulding\r\n\nTurnpike  and  Gosling  Road  (Spaulding   Turnpike/Gosling  Road\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Projected emissions  to 1997 took  into account redevelopment\r\nthrough Phase I of the Pease project, i.e., the first five years.\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\ninterchange) would significantly lessen  CO levels locally during\r\n\nthe period studied.6\r\n\n          NHDES  ultimately  concluded  that Pease  redevelopment\r\n\nsatisfied  the  three  conformity  criteria set  out  in  section\r\n\n7506(c)(1)(B): that, through 1997, Pease redevelopment would  not\r\n\ncause  or contribute to any new  violation of any standard in any\r\n\narea;  increase  the  frequency   or  severity  of  any  existing\r\n\nviolation of any standard in any area; or delay attainment of any\r\n\nstandard  or any  required interim  emission reductions  or other\r\n\nmilestones in any area.\r\n\n          NHDES  also concluded that  Phase I redevelopment would\r\n\nnot  violate any specific provision  of the SIP  but rather would\r\n\n\"conform  to the  SIP's purpose  of eliminating  or  reducing the\r\n\nseverity  and number of  violations of  the national  ambient air\r\n\nquality standards,  and achieving expeditious attainment  of such\r\n\nstandards.\"  See  42 U.S.C.  7506(c)(1)(A).   NHDES reached  this\r                          \r\n\nconclusion  for  several  reasons:   (1)  the  existing  SIP  was\r\n\ndeveloped  when  Pease  was  fully  operational and  incorporated\r\n\nemissions from Pease  at that level of operation; (2)  Phase I of\r\n\nPease redevelopment was expected  to produce fewer emissions than\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Although the NHDES studies noted that the \"air quality region\"\r\nhad \"no  historic attainment  or maintenance problem  with carbon\r\nmonoxide\" NAAQS, the air  quality analysis in the FEIS  had shown\r\npresent and ongoing violations of the NAAQS for CO at the Gosling\r\nRoad/Spaulding  Turnpike  interchange, the  main  gate  to Pease.\r\nPost-FEIS supplemental  air quality  modeling of the  interchange\r\narea,  based  on corrected  data, showed  that  CO levels  at the\r\ninterchange would  stay  within  the  NAAQS through  Phase  I  of\r\nredevelopment upon  completion of scheduled  improvements at  the\r\ninterchange.\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nthe base produced during full operation; and (3) increased levels\r\n\nof emissions from later stages of development would be taken into\r\n\naccount in the future SIP.\r\n\n            c.

In its ROD, it approved each  of the items\r\n\nin  the   ALP,  either  unconditionally  or   conditionally,  and\r\n\nrecommended  that the Air Force proceed with its proposal to make\r\n\nproperty at Pease  available for use as  a civilian airport.   It\r\n\ngave unconditional  approval to  the minor,  interim and  Phase I\r\n\nredevelopment outlined in the ALP but, to ensure conformity, only\r\n\nconditional approval to key  items in the ALP.  It concluded that\r\n\nits approval \"conform[s] with the approved SIP.\"\r\n\n          Regarding the later phases  of the redevelopment, which\r\n\ncould have a significant impact on air quality, FAA approval will\r\n\nbe  required once plans for them  are made final and proposed for\r\n\nimplementation; that approval will be  granted only after the FAA\r\n\ndetermines  whether additional  air  quality analysis  and a  new\r\n\nconformity finding are  required.  Further, FAA  approval will be\r\n\nrequired  for any new projects not depicted in the ALP, providing\r\n\nadditional assurances of conformity.\r\n\n          2.

The  NHDES studies discussed in the Varney letter\r          Redevelopment.\r                        \r\n\nand the post-FEIS studies  on the Spaulding Turnpike/Gosling Road\r\n\ninterchange indicate  that Phase I redevelopment  activities will\r\n\nconform to the  section 7506(c)(1)(B)  criteria, as  long as  New\r\n\nHampshire   improves   the   Spaulding    Turnpike/Gosling   Road\r\n\ninterchange  as required.7    As discussed  above, NHDES  studies\r\n\nused  1989 and  1990  emissions  estimates  as the  baseline  for\r\n\nperforming  the conformity analyses.  The EPA, Air Force, and the\r\n\nFAA   adopted  those   studies   in   making   their   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   New  Hampshire  is  committed  to making  these  improvements\r\nbecause,   as   noted  above,   NHDES's  conclusion   that  Pease\r\nredevelopment through  Phase I meets the  conformity criteria was\r\nbased on the assumption that this  interchange would be improved.\r\nSee  supra   p.  42  n.6.     Similarly   the  FAA's   conformity\r                    \r\ndetermination was based  in part on improvement of  the Spaulding\r\nTurnpike/Gosling Road interchange. \r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\n          Section 7506(c)(1)(B) states that  \"[t]he determination\r\n\nof  conformity shall  be based  on the  most recent  estimates of\r\n\nemissions .  . . .\"   NHDES explained  that it selected  1989 and\r\n\n1990 rather than  1991 (the  year it performed  the analysis)  as\r\n\nbaseline years because 1989 was \r\n\n          \"the most recent year representative of full-\r\n          scale  military  operation  at  Pease.   This\r\n          appears  to   us  to  be  the  most  relevant\r\n          comparison,  since  Congress's  intention  in\r\n          Section [7506(c)] is clearly to  evaluate new\r\n          developments in the  context of  pre-existing\r\n          conditions . . . .   We assume  that Congress\r\n          did  not  intend that  a  project like  Pease\r\n          redevelopment   would   be  penalized   under\r\n          [7506(c)]  because there  is  a temporal  gap\r\n          between the federal government's  decision to\r\n          terminate  operations at Pease and the start-\r\n          up of the State's redevelopment of the  base,\r\n          during which  a  temporary reduction  in  the\r\n          emission  inventory occurred  as a  result of\r\n          activity phase-down.\" \r\n\nUse of 1991 as a baseline, it added, \"would unfairly penalize the\r\n\nPease redevelopment project, since 1991  emissions of CO, NOX and\r\n\nVOCs are significantly less than historical norms because  of the\r\n\nAir Force's cessation of activities at Pease.\"\r\n\n          Under the Chevron doctrine, an  agency's interpretation\r\n\nof a statute is entitled to  weight when the statute is silent or\r\n\nambiguous.

This appears to us to be one\r\n\nof  those rare  cases where  the plain  meaning would  lead to  a\r\n\nresult  that is irrational and at  odds with the intention of the\r\n\nlegislature.  Read  literally, the plain language  of the statute\r\n\nas  applied  in  base-closing  cases  would  require   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations to be based on  a wholly artificial situation, the\r\n\ninterval  during which  military  operations have  shut down  and\r\n\ncivilian  activities not yet started.   The likely consequence in\r\n\nmany cases would be to  preclude any economically beneficial  use\r\n\nof  a closed  military base.   Such  a result  is  irrational and\r\n\npresumably unintended by Congress.  In  view of Congress's strong\r\n\nsupport of  civilian redevelopment of closed  military bases, see\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\ninfra pp.  57-58,  it would  not  have wanted  to  erect a  major\r               \r\n\nobstacle to economically beneficial, post-closing uses of a base.\r\n\nThus, the agencies' reliance  on the NHDES studies based  on 1989\r\n\nand 1990 estimates was reasonable under the circumstances.

With respect to CO emissions, the FEIS indicated that\r\n\nby the  year 2010 redevelopment  was expected to  generate 68,000\r\n\ndaily  vehicle  trips into  the Pease  area.

Post-FEIS\r\n\nair quality  studies of  that intersection indicated  that, while\r\n\nconstruction  of   the   new  Spaulding   Turnpike/Gosling   Road\r\n\ninterchange by  NHDOT would bring  the area into  compliance with\r\n\nNAAQS  for  CO through  the end  of  the decade,  traffic volumes\r\n\nassociated with Pease  redevelopment and regional  growth through\r\n\nthe  full build-out  year  2010 could  cause violations  unless a\r\n\nsecond   entrance   interchange   to   Pease   was   constructed.\r\n\nRedevelopment would therefore contribute to new violations of the\r\n\nNAAQS for CO sometime after the turn of the century.\r\n\n          Similarly,  an  EPA  memorandum  dated  July 24,  1991,\r\n\nindicated that, while Phase I of Pease redevelopment was expected\r\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\nto  generate  only  2.5  tons  per  day  of  HCs  (a  major ozone\r\n\nprecursor),  Phase II extending to the year 2002 was estimated to\r\n\ngenerate 4.8  tons  per day.    At  that level,  Phase  II  would\r\n\nincrease existing violations, as well as delay attainment, of the\r\n\nNAAQS for ozone absent  some other changes or the  institution of\r\n\nmitigation measures.\r\n\n            b.  Mitigation Measures.  Plaintiffs contend that the\r                      b.  Mitigation Measures.\r                                              \r\n\nsupporting agencies  improperly shifted the burden  of compliance\r\n\nto  New Hampshire  and the  SIP process  and that  the mitigation\r\n\nmeasures  agreed to by the  parties failed to  meet the statutory\r\n\ncriteria of the conformity provision.\r\n\n            (i) Carbon  Monoxide.  With respect  to CO emissions,\r                      (i) Carbon  Monoxide.\r                                           \r\n\nthe  MOU requires PDA to  conduct a surface transportation study,\r\n\ndevelop  a  traffic model  and master  plan  for the  Pease area,\r\n\nconduct  intermittent  CO   analyses,  and  implement  mitigation\r\n\nmeasures  as  needed.     As  to  the  latter,  the   MOU  states\r\n\ncategorically that \"PDA, and if necessary in conjunction with any\r\n\nother appropriate state agency, will implement measures necessary\r                                                                 \r\n\nto  reduce  projected  traffic  increases  and/or  air  emissions\r\n\nimpacts to  a level which will not result in any violation of, or\r\n\nany  contribution  to  a  violation  of,  the  NAAQS  for  carbon\r\n\nmonoxide.\" (Emphasis added.) \r\n\n          These  commitments are sufficient  to ensure compliance\r\n\nwith the statutory requirement that Pease redevelopment \"will not\r\n\ncause  or contribute to  any new violation\" of  the NAAQS for CO,\r\n\nsee 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)(B)(I), for two reasons.\r             \r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\n          First,   PDA's   open-ended  commitment   to  implement\r\n\nnecessary  mitigation   measures   includes  by   implication   a\r\n\ncommitment   to  implement   the   mitigation  measures   already\r\n\nidentified  in the  area of  the Spaulding  Turnpike/Gosling Road\r\n\ninterchange.   Specifically,  it  includes a  commitment by  PDA,\r\n\nalong with NHDOT and other necessary state agencies, to build the\r\n\nsecond access  to Pease,  unless later studies  reveal preferable\r\n\nalternatives for satisfying the commitment.  See supra pp. 38-39.\r                                                                \r\n\n          Corroborating  this  commitment  is  a July  31,  1991,\r\n\nletter from PDA to the Air Force stating that compliance with the\r\n\nNAAQS would  require completion of improvements  to the Spaulding\r\n\nTurnpike/Gosling Road  interchange as  well as construction  of a\r\n\nsecond access to Pease prior to the time the improved interchange\r\n\nreaches maximum capacity.   To permit construction of the  second\r\n\naccess, PDA requested that a portion  of the golf course at Pease\r\n\nbe made available.   In  the Application and  Acceptance for  the\r\n\ntransfer of  airport property, the  Air Force agreed  to transfer\r\n\nthe needed portions of the golf course.\r\n\n          Second, the  agreement  requiring ongoing  studies  and\r\n\nanalyses and implementation of  mitigation measures as needed was\r\n\na reasonable  way to  ensure conformity under  the circumstances.\r\n\nThe  details of the redevelopment  project are not  fixed and its\r\n\ntime line is extended.   As the FAA pointed  out in its ROD,  air\r\n\nquality  impacts stemming  from  certain aspects  of the  airport\r\n\ndevelopment  were speculative when  the conformity determinations\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\nwere made because the project-specific design detail necessary to\r\n\nassess those impacts properly and  develop a range of alternative\r\n\nmitigation  measures  was lacking.    Similarly,  the nonaviation\r\n\nbusiness tenants at  the on-airport industrial  park had not  yet\r\n\nbeen  selected.   In  addition, over  the  20-year life  of Pease\r\n\nredevelopment, other environmental factors in the region, as well\r\n\nas technologies available  to address  them, may  change.   Given\r\n\nthese uncertainties,  a commitment to pursue  ongoing studies and\r\n\nanalyses and  to implement appropriate mitigation  measures based\r\n\non demonstrated needs  was a reasonable  approach to meeting  the\r\n\nstatutory requirement.     \r\n\n            (ii)  Ozone  Precursors.    With  respect  to   ozone\r                      (ii)  Ozone  Precursors.\r                                              \r\n\nstandards,   the  MOU  requires  NHDES   to  work  with  PDA  and\r\n\nincorporate projected emissions from Pease redevelopment into the\r\n\nSIP  revisions.8 Unless  and  until  the  new  SIP  is  approved,\r\n\nhowever,  it  bars PDA  from developing  Pease \"beyond  the level\r\n\nanticipated  to   generate  3.3  tons  per   day  of  hydrocarbon\r\n\nemissions\"--the level of emissions from Pease permitted under the\r\n\nexisting SIP.  Thus, the MOU does not place the  entire burden of\r\n\naddressing HC emissions on the SIP process. \r\n\n          To the extent that the MOU does rely on the SIP process\r\n\nto deal  with projected  increases in  HC emissions, however,  it\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  According to  the 1990 Amendments, New Hampshire  was required\r\nto revise  its SIP  to achieve  at least a  15% reduction  in VOC\r\nemissions (including HCs) from 1990  levels on or before November\r\nof  1996 (accounting for any growth in emissions after 1990), and\r\n3%  additional annual  reductions on  average thereafter  through\r\n1999.   See  42 U.S.C.    7511a(b)(1)(A)  &amp; (c)(2)(B)  (Supp. III\r                     \r\n1991).  \r\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\ndoes  so  properly  under  the  circumstances.    The  1990   CAA\r\n\namendments required  New Hampshire to  revise its SIP  to address\r\n\nVOC emissions (which  include HC emissions) within  approximately\r\n\nthree years.   See 42 U.S.C.     7511a(c), (b)(1).   See supra p.\r                                                                        \r\n\n14.   NHDES's  commitment to  consult  with PDA  and  incorporate\r\n\nemissions from  Pease development into required  revisions of the\r\n\nSIP is  consistent with the SIP  process and NHDES's  role as the\r\n\nstate agency responsible for  developing the SIP.  While  the EPA\r\n\nand the  legislature set ultimate standards  and goals--including\r\n\nthe NAAQS and deadlines  for attaining them--the state prescribes\r\n\nin its SIP  how it  will achieve those  goals.   See 42 U.S.C.   \r                                                              \r\n\n7407.   Thus, if NHDES  chooses to incorporate  into the required\r\n\nrevisions of the SIP  certain levels of emissions from  the Pease\r\n\nproject, that is its prerogative under the statutory SIP process.\r\n\n          By  agreeing to  incorporate Pease  emissions into  SIP\r\n\nrevisions that will  reduce overall ozone-precursor emissions  in\r\n\nthe region, NHDES has enabled  PDA to undertake the redevelopment\r\n\nwithout increasing the severity of or delaying attainment of  the\r\n\nNAAQS  for  ozone.   Presumably  New  Hampshire will  accommodate\r\n\nincreased HC  emissions from  Pease and achieve  interim required\r\n\nemissions reductions and timely attainment of the NAAQS for ozone\r\n\nby cutting VOC emissions in other areas.  This will permit  later\r\n\nstages of  Pease redevelopment  to go forward  without increasing\r\n\nexisting violations of the NAAQS for ozone or delaying attainment\r\n\n                               -44-\r\r\n\nof  the NAAQS  for  ozone  or  other  CAA  standards.  42  U.S.C.\r\n\n  7506(c)(1)(B)(ii), (iii).   \r\n\n          Unless and until a  new SIP incorporating higher levels\r\n\nof  emissions from Pease is  approved, however, the MOU prohibits\r\n\nredevelopment  of Pease beyond a level producing 3.3 tons per day\r\n\nof HC emissions.   While the cap is in  compliance with the terms\r\n\nof the existing SIP, it is not so clear it will ensure that Pease\r\n\nredevelopment  activities  will  not  increase  the  severity  of\r\n\nexisting  ozone  violations  and   delay  compliance  with  ozone\r\n\nstandards.   Whether redevelopment will increase  the severity of\r                                                          \r\n\nexisting violations  depends in  part on the  baseline emissions.\r\n\nWhen compared to 1989  emissions, 3.3 tons per day  represents no\r\n\nincrease  in the severity of  violations of the  NAAQS for ozone.\r\n\nBecause,  as  we  stated  earlier,  use  of   1989  estimates  is\r\n\nreasonable  under the  circumstances,  see supra  pp. 45-47,  and\r                                                          \r\n\nbecause the existing  SIP permits  this level  of emissions,  the\r\n\nprovisions of  the MOU satisfy the  conformity requirements under\r\n\nsection 7506(c)(1)(B)(ii).  \r\n\n          Regarding delaying attainment  of the ozone  standards,\r\n\nplaintiffs   appear  to   suggest  that   to  meet   the  section\r\n\n7506(c)(1)(B)(iii)  criteria, emissions  from  the Pease  project\r\n\nmust be consistent with  the VOC emissions reductions set  out in\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   7511a(c)(2).   Prior to incorporation into  a revised\r\n\nSIP, however, these reductions apply only in conformity decisions\r\n\nrelated  to  transportation  plans,  programs  and  projects  and\r\n\ntherefore   are    not   relevant   here.       See   42   U.S.C.\r                                                             \r\n\n                               -45-\r\r\n\n  7506(c)(3)(A)(iii); see also 136 Cong. Rec.

THE CERCLA CLAIM\r                                IV.  THE CERCLA CLAIM\r\n\n          Newington claims that the  Air Force's 55-year lease of\r\n\nportions  of Pease  to  PDA violates  section 120(h)(3)(B)(i)  of\r\n\nCERCLA (42  U.S.C.   9620(h)(3)(B)(I)).   The district  court had\r\n\njurisdiction over  the claim under  42 U.S.C.    9613(b)  (1988).\r\n\nSection 120  was  added  by the  1986  Superfund  Amendments  and\r\n\nReauthorization  Act (SARA), Pub.  L. No. 99-499,  100 Stat. 1613\r\n\n(1986),  to   address  issues   concerning  hazardous   waste  on\r\n\nfederally-owned sites.  Section  120(a) subjects federal agencies\r\n\nto CERCLA.   Subsections (b) through (f) outline  a comprehensive\r\n\nprogram   to  identify  and   remediate  hazardous  waste  sites.\r\n\nSubsection  (h)  deals  with   transfers  of  property  on  which\r\n\nhazardous substances are known to  have been released or disposed\r\n\nof.    Subsection  (h)(1)  requires  notice  of  such release  or\r\n\ndisposal in any contract \"for the sale  or other transfer of real\r\n\nproperty which is owned by the United States.\"\r\n\n          Subsection  (h)(3) addresses  the \"contents  of certain\r\n\ndeeds.\"  Before its recent amendment, it required that\r\n\n          .  . . in the case of any real property owned\r\n          by the  United States on which  any hazardous\r\n\n                               -46-\r\r\n\n          substance was  stored for  one year  or more,\r\n          known to have been released, or disposed  of,\r\n          each deed  entered into  for the  transfer of\r\n          such property  by the  United  States to  any\r\n          other person or entity shall contain--\r\n            (B) a covenant warranting that--\r\n            (i)  all  remedial   action  necessary   to\r\n          protect human health and the environment with\r\n          respect  to any  such substance  remaining on\r\n          the property  has been taken before  the date\r\n          of such transfer, . . . .\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   9620(h)(3).\r\n\n          Newington  argues that section  120(h)(3) prohibits the\r\n\nfederal government from  transferring contaminated property until\r\n\nit has constructed, installed and is successfully operating clean\r\n\nup  procedures  and  mechanisms  that  ensure  full  remediation.\r\n\nAlthough  section  120(h)(3)  by  its  terms  applies  to  deeds,\r\n\nNewington contends  that the substance of  the transaction should\r\n\ncontrol  and that the government should not be permitted to avoid\r\n\nthe mandate of the  statute by labeling the transaction  a lease.\r\n\nThe District Court  held that  the transfer  without an  approved\r\n\nremedial design violated  section 120(h) of CERCLA, and  that the\r\n\nfailure to disclose in the  FEIS the decision to transfer  by way\r\n\nof a  long-term lease rather  than deed  violated NEPA.   See 864\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.Supp. at  290.  Although the court  declined to hold the leases\r\n\nvoid,  it directed the Air  Force to prepare  a supplemental FEIS\r\n\ndelineating  the remedial  design.   Newington contends  that the\r\n\nrelief granted  is inadequate  to secure compliance  with section\r\n\n120(h).\r\n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\n          Any question about whether section 120(h)(3) applies to\r\n\nlong-term  leases has been laid to rest  by the 1996 amendment of\r\n\nthat section, adding the following language:\r\n\n            The  requirements of subparagraph (B) [of a\r\n          covenant   warranting   completion   of   all\r\n          necessary remedial action] shall not apply in\r\n          any  case  in  which   the  transfer  of  the\r\n          property occurs or has occurred by means of a\r\n          lease,  without regard to  whether the lessee\r\n          has   agreed  to  purchase  the  property  or\r\n          whether  the duration of  the lease is longer\r\n          than 55 years.\r\n\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  1996, Pub.

Senator  Bob Smith of New Hampshire,  the sponsor\r\n\nof the amendment, explained that the need for the amendment arose\r\n\nout of the District Court's decision  in this case which \"has . .\r\n\n. placed a cloud over redevelopment efforts at Pease .  . .

THE NEPA CLAIM\r\n\n          The  federal  defendants  do  not  appeal  the district\r\n\ncourt's  order  finding a  violation  of  \"the public  disclosure\r\n\nrequirements of NEPA\" and  directing the Air Force to  \"compile a\r\n\nSupplemental FEIS.\"  With  regard to the NEPA claims  against the\r\n\nFAA,  the FAA  adopted  the  FEIS  prepared  by  the  Air  Force;\r\n\ntherefore,  the  district  court's  decision that  the  FEIS  was\r\n\ndeficient under NEPA binds the  FAA.  The only NEPA  issue before\r\n\nus then is plaintiffs'  appeal of the district court's  denial of\r\n\ninjunctive relief for the NEPA violations.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs first attack the denial of injunctive relief\r\n\non the ground that the district court  failed to make findings of\r\n\nfact and conclusions of law  sufficient to meet the  requirements\r\n\nof Fed.

Although the  district court  did not  discuss its\r\n\nfactual  or legal reasons for concluding  that the plaintiffs did\r\n\nnot  suffer  irreparable harm,  its  lengthy  opinion provides  a\r\n\ndetailed  discussion  of  the  factual and  legal  bases  for its\r\n\nsubstantive  conclusions.    That   discussion,  along  with  the\r\n\nvoluminous  and undisputed  documentary evidence  in the  record,\r\n\nprovides  this  court with  sufficient  information  to determine\r\n\nwhether  the  district court  abused  its  discretion in  denying\r\n\ninjunctive relief;  thus, the omission of a  statement of reasons\r\n\nfor the denial of  injunctive relief was at most  harmless error.\r\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Associated Elec.

In  those  cases,  we  found\r\n\nirreparable harm  to exist when  agencies become entrenched  in a\r\n\ndecision uninformed by the proper NEPA  process because they have\r\n\nmade  commitments or  taken  action to  implement the  uninformed\r\n\ndecision.  See Watt, 716 F.2d  at 951-53; Marsh, 872 F.2d at 499-\r                                                         \r\n\n503. Our rationale  derived from the purpose  of NEPA:   \"NEPA is\r\n\ndesigned  to influence  the  decision making  process\" by  making\r\n\n\"governmental officials notice  environmental considerations  and\r\n\ntake them into account.\"   Watt, 716 F.2d at 952.   \"Thus, when a\r                                         \r\n\ndecision  to which NEPA  obligations attach  is made  without the\r\n\ninformed environmental consideration that NEPA requires, the harm\r\n\nthat NEPA intends to prevent has been suffered.\"  Id.   That harm\r                                                               \r\n\nis not  merely a procedural harm,  but is \"the added  risk to the\r\n\nenvironment  that takes place  when governmental  decision makers\r\n\nmake  up their minds without having before them an analysis (with\r\n\nprior public  comment) of  the likely  effects of  their decision\r\n\nupon the environment.\"  Marsh, 872 F.2d at 500.\r                                       \r\n\n          Plaintiffs   argue   that,   without   an   injunction,\r\n\ndevelopment  of Pease will continue and they will suffer the kind\r\n\nof  irreparable  harm we  described in  Watt  and Marsh.    As we\r                                                                 \r\n\nemphasized  there,  however, our  holdings did  not mean  \"that a\r\n\nlikely NEPA violation automatically  calls for an injunction; the\r\n\n                               -52-\r\r\n\nbalance  of harms may point the other  way.\"  See Marsh, 872 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 504 (quoting Watt,  716 F.2d at 952) (emphasis added). In Watt\r                                                                           \r\n\nand  Marsh,  plaintiffs moved  for  injunctions  in the  earliest\r                    \r\n\nstages  of  development of  the  projects  at  issue,  when  NEPA\r\n\ninjunctions could  implement the  statutory purpose in  the sense\r\n\nthat \"bureaucratic decision makers . . . are less  likely to tear\r\n\ndown a nearly completed  project than a barely  started project.\"\r\n\nMarsh, 872 F.2d at 500.   In contrast, plaintiff here, well aware\r               \r\n\nof the  defective FEIS, waited  nearly three years  before moving\r\n\nfor  injunctive relief.  CLF  filed its complaint  in March 1992,\r\n\nsome  six months after the  challenged FEIS and  ROD were issued;\r\n\nNewington  filed its  complaint  in June  1992.   Both complaints\r\n\nrecited requests  for permanent injunctions in  their prayers for\r\n\nrelief.   Despite  these  early references  to equitable  relief,\r\n\nhowever, neither  CLF nor  Newington ever  moved  to restrain  or\r\n\nenjoin any aspect of the project.  When the cases came before the\r\n\ndistrict court on cross-motions for summary judgment, plaintiffs'\r\n\nbriefs focused on the  merits of the substantive claims,  not the\r\n\nneed for injunctive relief.  Only  after the entry of the court's\r\n\norder granting summary judgment in  part did plaintiffs argue, in\r\n\na  motion to amend, that  they were entitled  to broad injunctive\r\n\nrelief.\r\n\n          To  be taken into  account in assessing  the balance of\r\n\nharms is the  fact that  between the time  when plaintiffs  filed\r\n\nsuit  and  when  they  ultimately moved  for  injunctive  relief,\r\n\nsignificant  commitments were  made to  the  Pease project.   The\r\n\n                               -53-\r\r\n\nState of New  Hampshire issued $8  million in general  obligation\r\n\nbonds to fund the  operation of PDA and $40 million in guaranteed\r\n\nbonds to help finance the location of two major tenants at Pease;\r\n\nconstruction  contracts aggregating $50  million were entered and\r\n\nfederal  grants of more than  $6 million received  to support the\r\n\nairport operations;  and more than 1,100  persons became employed\r\n\nby tenants and agencies  as a result of the  development project.\r\n\nThese commitments would be  placed at risk if an  injunction were\r\n\ngranted.\r\n\n          Thus, the  type of public and  private commitments with\r\n\nwhich Watt and Marsh were concerned had already been made here by\r                              \r\n\nthe  time plaintiffs sought injunctive relief.  If harm was done,\r\n\nit largely had been done, not by the court's denial of injunctive\r\n\nrelief, but by plaintiffs' failure  to timely seek it.  While  it\r\n\nis true that as development continues other actions will be taken\r\n\nto implement the project, their impact  will be only incremental.\r\n\nFuture risks  of environmental harm will  be minimized, moreover,\r\n\nby the district court's retention of jurisdiction under its order\r\n\nthat  the Air  Force  compile a  Supplemental  FEIS, by  the  Air\r\n\nForce's commitment to  this court that  it \"will use the  SEIS to\r\n\nreview  its August 1991 ROD and April 1992 Supplemental ROD,\" and\r\n\nby the continuing oversight responsibilities of the FAA under the\r\n\nSurplus Property Act and of the EPA under the CAA.\r\n\n          Under  these  circumstances, it  was  not  an abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion for the district  court to deny the  injunctive relief\r\n\nsought.  \r\n\n                               -54-\r\r\n\n                         VI.  CONCLUSION\r                                   VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  reverse  the  district  court's  determination that\r\n\ndefendants  violated CERCLA and affirm the  judgment below in all\r\n\nother respects.   Pending the completion of the Supplemental FEIS\r\n\non which the FAA is working in conjunction with the Air Force, we\r\n\nretain  jurisdiction  under  the  petitions of  the  NEPA  claims\r\n\nagainst the FAA but dismiss the CAA claims against it.\r\n\n          SO ORDERED.\r                              \r\n\n                               -55-\r\r\n",

We  must  decide\r                    SCHWARZER,  Senior  District  Judge.\r                                                       \r\n\nwhether   defendants   have   complied   with   various   federal\r\n\nenvironmental  laws that apply to the conversion of land on Pease\r\n\nAir  Force Base (Pease) in New Hampshire to civilian use incident\r\n\nto the base's closure.  The  United States Air Force entered into\r\n\na  long-term lease of a portion  of the base to Pease Development\r\n\nAuthority (PDA).   Concerned about the  resulting effects on  the\r\n\nclean up of hazardous wastes  on the base and the air  quality in\r\n\nthe area, the Conservation  Law Foundation (CLF) and the  Town of\r\n\nNewington, New Hampshire  (Newington) challenge  the Air  Force's\r\n\ndecision to lease the  property and the support of  that decision\r\n\nby  other federal agencies.   CLF and Newington  contend that the\r\n\nAir Force and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) violated\r\n\nsection  176(c) of the  Clean Air Act (CAA),  42 U.S.C.   7506(c)\r\n\n(Supp. III 1991), section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental\r\n\nPolicy Act (NEPA),  42 U.S.C.    4332(2)(C)  (1988), and  section\r\n\n120(h)(3)   of   the   Comprehensive    Environmental   Response,\r\n\nCompensation  and Liability Act  (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.   9620(h)(3)\r\n\n(1988).    PDA, the  State of  New  Hampshire, and  several other\r\n\ninterested parties have intervened and,  along with the Air Force\r\n\nand the EPA, oppose the relief sought.  \r\n\n          In  a lengthy  opinion  ruling on  the parties'  cross-\r\n\nmotions for summary judgment, the  district court found that  the\r\n\nAir Force had violated  NEPA and CERCLA and directed it to submit\r\n\na Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement (Supplemental\r\n\nFEIS),  including  a  remedial  design  for  contaminated parcels\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncovered  by  the lease.    The district  court  denied injunctive\r\n\nrelief,   however,   and   dismissed   all    remaining   claims.\r\n\nConservation  Law Found. v. Department  of the Air  Force, 864 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. 265 (D.N.H. 1994).\r\n\n          Plaintiffs have  appealed from the  dismissal of  their\r\n\nCAA  claims and  the denial  of injunctive  relief.   The federal\r\n\ndefendants  have   cross-appealed  from  the  finding  that  they\r\n\nviolated CERCLA, but have not appealed the district court's order\r\n\ndirecting them to prepare a Supplemental FEIS.  We have appellate\r\n\njurisdiction under 28  U.S.C.   1291.  We reverse the judgment in\r\n\nso  far as it  found a CERCLA  violation but affirm  in all other\r\n\nrespects.  \r\n\n          Also before us are petitions filed by CLF and Newington\r\n\nto review an order of  the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA)\r\n\napproving PDA's  airport development plan.   We have jurisdiction\r\n\nunder  49 U.S.C.  app.    1486(a)  and  deny the  petitions  with\r\n\nrespect  to the  CAA claim  and retain  jurisdiction of  the NEPA\r\n\nclaim pending completion of the Supplemental FEIS.\r\n\n                       I.  BACKGROUND FACTS\r                                 I.  BACKGROUND FACTS\r\n\n          Acting under  the Base  Closure and Realignment  Act of\r\n\n1988 (the Base  Closure Act), Pub. L. No. 100-526, 102 Stat. 2627\r\n\n(1988)  (codified as amended at 10 U.S.C.    2687 (1988 &amp; Supp. V\r\n\n1993)),  the Air  Force  closed Pease  in  March 1991.    Located\r\n\nadjacent  to Newington  and Portsmouth,  New Hampshire,  the base\r\n\noccupies some 4,200 acres and comprises extensive facilities that\r\n\nsupported  Air Force  operations, including  a  runway.   PDA was\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncreated  as an agency  of the State  of New Hampshire  to acquire\r\n\ncertain  parcels of  land  within the  base  and to  develop  and\r\n\nimplement a plan for their reuse.  It ultimately developed a plan\r\n\nenvisioning  a  commercial   airport,  light  industry,   various\r\n\ncommercial uses, retail space, and open space.\r\n\n          In preparation for the transfer of land to PDA, the Air\r\n\nForce in February  1990 launched  the process  of complying  with\r\n\napplicable  environmental  requirements.    The  details  of  the\r\n\nprocess  are set out at  length in the  district court's opinion,\r\n\nsee 864 F.  Supp. at 270-72, and a summary will suffice here.  In\r             \r\n\nFebruary  1991, the  Air  Force published  a Draft  Environmental\r\n\nImpact Statement  (DEIS)  on  which  CLF and  the  EPA  submitted\r\n\ncomments mainly addressing  air quality concerns.  In April 1991,\r\n\nthe  Air Force entered  into a  Federal Facility  Agreement (FFA)\r\n\nwith  the EPA  and the  State of New  Hampshire spelling  out its\r\n\nenvironmental  obligations incident  to  the transfer.   In  June\r\n\n1991,  the  Air  Force  prepared  a  Final  Environmental  Impact\r\n\nStatement  (FEIS).   The FEIS  stated that,  although development\r\n\nunder  the  plan,  including   the  increased  traffic  it  would\r\n\ngenerate,  would not result in violations of state or federal air\r\n\nquality standards,  it would have  an impact  on New  Hampshire's\r\n\nability to achieve the ozone precursor reductions required by the\r\n\nCAA.  To resolve  these air quality  concerns, PDA, the EPA,  and\r\n\nthe New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) on\r\n\nAugust 1, 1991, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\r\n\nThe  EPA then issued its comments on the FEIS, stating that while\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe  project  would reduce  New  Hampshire's  ability to  achieve\r\n\ncompliance  with  the  CAA,  the MOU  provided  a  framework  for\r\n\ncompliance.  \r\n\n          As required by the Base Closure Act, the Air Force then\r\n\nprepared its  initial Record  of Decision (ROD),  documenting its\r\n\ndecisions regarding the closure  of Pease and the disposition  of\r\n\nthe   property.     The  ROD   addressed,  among   other  things,\r\n\nenvironmental issues,  including the  CAA's requirement  that the\r\n\nproject conform with the  New Hampshire State Implementation Plan\r\n\n(SIP)  and  CERCLA's requirement  that  the  Air Force  undertake\r\n\ncertain remedial measures to clean up contaminated sites prior to\r\n\nthe transfer of those sites to  PDA.  See 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1);\r                                                   \r\n\n42 U.S.C.   9620(h)(3).\r\n\n          Because  the  PDA  plan  contemplated  civilian airport\r\n\noperations, FAA approval was  required under the Surplus Property\r\n\nAct  of  1944,  50 U.S.C.  app.     1622(g) (1988)  (subsequently\r\n\nrecodified at  49  U.S.C.      47151-47153  (Supp.  1994)).    In\r\n\nFebruary  1992, the FAA issued  an ROD approving  elements of the\r\n\nplan  and  recommending  that  the  Air  Force  proceed  with its\r\n\nproposed transfer of property to PDA.  \r\n\n          In March  1992, CLF filed  this action in  the district\r\n\ncourt, alleging that the  Air Force and the EPA had  violated the\r\n\nCAA and NEPA.  In June 1992, Newington filed its action asserting\r\n\nthe same claims, as well as  a claim under CERCLA.  These actions\r\n\nwere later consolidated.  CLF and  Newington also filed petitions\r\n\nin this court for review of the FAA's February 1992 ROD, alleging\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthat  the FAA  violated NEPA  and  the CAA.   The  petitions were\r\n\nstayed pending the outcome of  the district court proceedings and\r\n\nare now before us along with the appeals from the judgment below.\r\n\n          While  these  actions  were  pending,  the  Air   Force\r\n\ncontinued to pursue the administrative proceedings preparatory to\r\n\nthe transfer.   In  March 1992,  it issued a  Memorandum for  the\r\n\nRecord updating  its earlier conformity determination.   In April\r\n\n1992, it issued a Supplemental ROD in which it rendered its final\r\n\ndetermination  concerning  the  disposal  of the  Pease  parcels,\r\n\nincluding an acknowledgment that remedial action  on contaminated\r\n\nareas  had to be completed before it could transfer those parcels\r\n\nby deed.  The Air Force then prepared a Preliminary Environmental\r\n\nSurvey and,  on the basis of the survey, issued its Finding of No\r\n\nSignificant Impact (FONSI).  In April 1992, the Air Force entered\r\n\ninto a 55-year lease  and contract of conveyance to  PDA covering\r\n\nthese parcels.\r\n\n                       II.

Pursuant  to  the  Act,  the   EPA\r\n\nestablished  National  Ambient  Air  Quality   Standards  (NAAQS)\r\n\nreflecting  the   maximum  concentration  levels   of  particular\r\n\npollutants  (criteria pollutants)  allowable  to  protect  public\r\n\nhealth.   See 42 U.S.C.   7409 (Supp. III 1991).  Among them were\r                       \r\n\nNAAQS for ozone and  carbon monoxide, both of which  are relevant\r\n\nhere.   See 40 C.F.R.     50.8, 50.9 (1995).   Responsibility for\r                     \r\n\nachieving  and maintaining the  NAAQS falls on  the states, which\r\n\nare  required   to  submit  state  implementation   plans  (SIPs)\r\n\nspecifying the manner in which they will achieve and maintain the\r\n\nNAAQS for the various criteria pollutants.   See 42 U.S.C.   7407\r                                                          \r\n\n(1988 &amp; Supp. III 1991).  \r\n\n          The  EPA  and  the  states  have  designated  different\r\n\nregions  according to the  level of  criteria pollutants  in each\r\n\narea.   See 42 U.S.C.    7407(d)(1)(A).   A region which  has not\r                     \r\n\nattained the NAAQS for a certain criteria pollutant is designated\r\n\na  \"nonattainment\"   area;  a   region  about  which   there  are\r\n\ninsufficient  data  to determine  compliance  with  the NAAQS  is\r\n\ndesignated  \"unclassified\"  and  deemed  in  compliance  with the\r\n\nNAAQS.  See id.   At the time the decisions challenged  here were\r                         \r\n\nmade,  the  Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester  region, where  the  Pease\r\n\nproject is located, was designated a \"serious nonattainment\" area\r\n\nfor ozone and an \"unclassified\" area for carbon monoxide.  See 40\r                                                                        \r\n\nC.F.R.   81.330 (1991).  \r\n\n          For   serious  nonattainment   areas  for   ozone,  the\r\n\nstatutory  deadline for attaining the NAAQS is November 15, 1999.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n42  U.S.C.    7511(a)(1) (Supp.  III 1991).   To  ensure progress\r\n\ntoward that goal, the  1990 amendments to the CAA  require states\r\n\nto revise their SIPs in  a manner that will result in  attainment\r\n\nof both the ultimate  deadline and interim milestones established\r\n\nby the 1990  amendments.  See 42 U.S.C.    7511a(c)(2) (Supp. III\r                                       \r\n\n1991).\r\n\n          To  further  promote  attainment   of  the  NAAQS   for\r\n\ndifferent  criteria pollutants,  the 1990  amendments also  added\r\n\nspecific criteria to section 7506(c)(1) (section 176(c)(1) of the\r\n\nCAA), the conformity  provision of the  Act, to wit,  subsections\r\n\n(A) and (B)(i)-(iii).

The\r                                        \r\n\nconformity provision prohibits federal agencies from approving or\r\n\nsupporting any activity which does not conform to  an SIP.  Under\r\n\nthe  new criteria,  conformity means  that the activity  will not\r\n\ncause  new  violations, increase  the  frequency  or severity  of\r\n\nviolations,   or   delay   attainment   of   various   standards,\r\n\nrequirements, and milestones.

Plaintiffs  make three\r\n\narguments: (1) that no determination of conformity could  be made\r\n\nuntil NEPA had  been complied with;  (2) that  the EPA failed  to\r\n\nmake a conformity determination;  and (3) that the Air  Force and\r\n\nthe FAA  violated the substantive requirements  of the conformity\r\n\nprovision.  As  a preliminary  matter, however,  we must  address\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nPDA's contention  that the  district court lacked  subject matter\r\n\njurisdiction over plaintiffs' CAA claims.  \r\n\n A.

Defendants dispute  that\r\n\njurisdiction exists under either provision.  We address first the\r\n\nknotty question of whether  jurisdiction exists under the citizen\r\n\nsuit  provision;   if  it does,  jurisdiction  under the  APA  is\r\n\nprecluded.

Before  asking whether the conformity provision passes the\r\n\nspecificity test,  however, we must consider  the threshold issue\r\n\nwhether  the  conformity  provision   falls  within  one  of  the\r\n\nstatutory categories  of violations  for which citizen  suits are\r\n\nauthorized. \r\n\n            b.  Terms of the Statute.  The CAA permits any person\r                      b.

An \"emission standard or limitation\" is defined\r\n\nas \"a  schedule or timetable of  compliance, emission limitation,\r\n\nstandard  of performance or emission  standard . .  . which is in\r\n\neffect   under  this  chapter  .  .  .  or  under  an  applicable\r\n\nimplementation plan.\"   42 U.S.C.   7604(f)(1) (Supp.  III 1991).\r\n\nThe additional definitions  in subsections (2), (3),  and (4) are\r\n\nnot  applicable here.1   Thus, citizen  suit jurisdiction  over a\r\n\nviolation of the  conformity provision is subject  to a two-prong\r\n\ntest:  (1)  the  conformity  provision  must  be  a  schedule  or\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1    Subsections  (2)  and (3)  deal  with  controls, conditions,\r\nprohibitions  and requirements related to specific situations and\r\nprovisions  not  at  issue  here.    Subsection  (4)  deals  with\r\nconformity requirements under  an SIP and does  not apply because\r\nthe requirements were not  incorporated into New Hampshire's plan\r\nat the material times;  the only relevant conformity requirements\r\nwere those  in  effect  under the  Act  itself.   See  42  U.S.C.\r                                                               \r\n  7604(f)(2)-(4).\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ntimetable  of  compliance,   emission  limitation,  standard   of\r\n\nperformance, or emission standard,  and (2) it must be  in effect\r\n\nunder this  chapter or an  applicable implementation  plan.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCate,  904 F. Supp. at  529.  The  conformity provision meets the\r              \r\n\nsecond prong; as a provision of the Act, it is clearly \"in effect\r\n\nunder the Act.\"  See CLF, 24 F.3d at 1477.   The sole question is\r                                  \r\n\nwhether the conformity provision  qualifies as (1) a  schedule or\r\n\ntimetable  of  compliance,  (2)  an emission  limitation,  (3)  a\r\n\nstandard of  performance, or (4)  an emission standard,  as these\r\n\nterms are defined by other provisions of the Act.  If it does not\r\n\nfall within one of these four cat categories, there is no citizen\r\n\nsuit jurisdiction over the conformity provision claims. \r\n\n            (i) Emission Limitation/Emission  Standard.

The conformity provision is not \"a requirement established\r\n\nby the State or the Administrator\";  it is a provision of the CAA\r\n\nenacted by Congress.   And  while the provision  seeks to  ensure\r\n\nconformity with  existing emission  standards or  limitations, it\r\n\ndoes  not itself limit emissions of air  pollutants.  Thus, it is\r\n\nnot an emissions limitation or standard.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n            (ii)    Standard  of Performance.

CLF argues that  the conformity provision  constitutes a\r\n\n\"standard of  performance\" within the meaning  of section 7602(l)\r\n\nbecause it prohibits a federal agency from supporting an activity\r\n\nunless that activity is  \"consistent with 'reducing' the severity\r\n\nand number of  violations in  a nonattainment area  and will  not\r\n\ndelay timely attainment of any required emission reductions.\"  In\r\n\nsupport of its argument, CLF relies upon this court's decision in\r\n\nCLF, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670666\"><a href=\"/opinion/670666/conservation-law-foundation-v-federal-highway-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, to which we now turn.\r             \r\n\n          In that case plaintiff  challenged the Federal  Highway\r\n\nAdministration's  approval of  a highway  project on  the ground,\r\n\namong others, that it  violated the conformity provisions  of the\r\n\nCAA.    Unlike the  instant case,  CLF  involved conformity  of a\r                                                \r\n\ntransportation plan subject to section 7506(c)(3).  Under section\r\n\n7506(c)(3)(A)(iii),  a  transportation  plan  or  program  is  in\r\n\nconformity  if it  contributes to  annual emission  reductions in\r\n\namounts specified elsewhere in the CAA. \r\n\n          Referring to  \"  7506(c)(1)  &amp; (c)(3),\" the  court held\r                                                         \r\n\nthat  \"[t]hese  conformity  requirements  plainly  constitute  an\r\n\nemissions  'standard  of  performance.'\"  CLF, 24  F.3d  at  1477\r                                                       \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n(emphasis  added).2  In so holding, the court observed that those\r\n\nprovisions  \"mandate  that  defendants  demonstrate   that  their\r\n\ntransportation  projects 'would  contribute  to annual  emissions\r\n\nreductions  consistent with' the levels  set out in   7511a(b)(1)\r\n\nand    7512a(a)(7).\"  Id.   This language reveals that  the court\r                                   \r\n\nwas relying on    7506(c)(3) for its finding that  the conformity\r                                      \r\n\nrequirements constitute a standard of performance.  See 42 U.S.C.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  7506(c)(3)(A)(iii)  (to be in conformity,  transportation plans\r\n\nor programs in ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas must\r\n\n\"contribute   to  annual  emissions  reductions  consistent  with\r\n\nsections 7511a(b)(1) and 7512a(a)(7)\").\r\n\n          On further reflection, it appears to us that  the route\r\n\nto  section 7506(c)(3) lies through  section 7506(c)(1).  In CLF,\r                                                                          \r\n\nas in the case before us, plaintiffs  were challenging government\r\n\naction  in approving  an  activity that  did  not conform  to  an\r\n\napproved implementation  plan or other conformity  criteria.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at  1478.   While  subsection  (c)(3) spells  out  particular\r            \r\n\nconformity  criteria for  transportation plans,  the crux  of the\r\n\naction remained the noncompliance by a government agency, not the\r\n\nviolation  of an emission standard  by the activity  itself.  The\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The court also held that prior case law  limiting citizen suit\r\njurisdiction  to enforcement  of specific  measures, commitments,\r\nand strategies for ensuring compliance with air quality standards\r\ndid  not  preclude  citizen  suit  jurisdiction  over  conformity\r\nprovision  claims  because  the  requirements of  the  conformity\r\nprovision were sufficiently specific and objective.  CLF, 24 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\nat  1477-78.   While we  do not  disagree with  that part  of the\r\nanalysis,  we do not reach  the specificity issue  unless we find\r\nthat  the   conformity  provision  otherwise   falls  within  the\r\nstatutory definition of an \"emission standard or limitation.\"\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nfoundation of the plaintiffs' claims, both there and here, is the\r\n\nsubsection (c)(1) prohibition of the federal agency's approval or\r\n\nsupport of any activity  not in conformity with an  approved plan\r\n\nor other standards, requirements, or milestones.\r\n\n          As noted above, a standard of performance is defined as\r\n\n\"a requirement  of continuous emission  reduction .  . .  .\"   42\r                                                           \r\n\nU.S.C.   7602(l) (emphasis added).  Nothing in section 7506(c)(1)\r\n\nimposes  an  emissions  reduction   requirement.    That  section\r\n\nprohibits a federal agency from approving, supporting, or funding\r\n\nany activities that  do not \"conform\" to the provisions of an SIP\r\n\nor   other  standards,  emissions   reduction  requirements,  and\r\n\nmilestones.   The sources  of those standards,  requirements, and\r\n\nmilestones may  include the  NAAQS or standards  and requirements\r\n\nset  out in  an SIP  or provisions  of the  CAA itself.   Section\r\n\n7605(c)(1)(A) and (B)  define what  standards must be  met for  a\r\n\nproject to  be in conformity.   In  the case of  a transportation\r\n\nplan  or program,  such  as the  one  at  issue in  CLF,  section\r                                                                 \r\n\n7506(c)(3)  imposes additional standards.   Thus,  the conformity\r\n\nprovision    refers   to   or   involves   standards,   reduction\r                                                  \r\n\nrequirements, and milestones, in the  sense that a federal agency\r\n\nmust determine that a  project meets those standards in  order to\r\n\napprove or support  it.  However, the conformity provision itself\r\n\nimposes no such standards  or requirements.  It simply  imposes a\r\n\nduty on federal agencies  not to approve or support  any activity\r\n\nthat does  not meet  standards, requirements, and  milestones set\r\n\nout in an SIP or the CAA.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n            (iii)  Schedule or Timetable of Compliance.  Section\r                      (iii)  Schedule or Timetable of Compliance.\r                                                                 \r\n\n7602(p) defines a \"schedule and  timetable of compliance\" to mean\r\n\n\"a  schedule  of  required  measures   including  an  enforceable\r\n\nsequence  of actions or operations  leading to compliance with an\r\n\nemission limitation, other limitation, prohibition, or standard.\"\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    7602(p) (1988).     CLF argues  that the  conformity\r\n\nprovision  is  a  \"schedule  or timetable  of  compliance\"  under\r\n\nsection    7604(f)    because    the     \"[c]onformity    section\r\n\n176(c)(1)(B)(iii)  specifically  prohibits federal  agencies from\r\n\nsupporting any  activity if it will 'delay  timely attainment' of\r\n\nthe schedule of compliance set  for nonattainment states like New\r\n\nHampshire to reach 15% emission reduction milestones in  1996 and\r\n\nfull  ozone  attainment in  1999.\"   This  argument  is, however,\r\n\ninapposite.   The issue  is not whether  the conformity provision\r\n\nrequires the  federal agency to determine that a project complies\r\n\nwith  a  schedule or  timetable  of  compliance found  elsewhere;\r\n\nrather it  is  whether  the  conformity  provision  is  itself  a\r\n\nschedule or  timetable of  compliance.   Plaintiffs here  are not\r\n\nsuing  a polluter for violation  of the schedule  or timetable of\r\n\ncompliance  referenced  in  section  176(c)(1)(B)(iii);  they are\r\n\nsuing  three  federal agencies  for  approving  and supporting  a\r\n\nproject  that   may  violate   that  schedule  or   timetable  of\r\n\ncompliance. \r\n\n          It might be argued that the conformity provision itself\r\n\nconstitutes a \"schedule or timetable of compliance\" as defined by\r\n\nsection  7602(p) in that  it requires federal  agencies to follow\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n\"an enforceable sequence of  actions . . . leading  to compliance\r\n\nwith an  emission limitation,  other limitation,  prohibition, or\r\n\nstandard.\"   See 42 U.S.C.    7602(p).   The conformity provision\r                          \r\n\nrequires  federal agencies  to follow  a sequence  of  actions to\r\n\nensure a  project's conformity with limitations  and standards in\r\n\nan existing  SIP or with  the NAAQS.   Those actions,  though not\r\n\nspecified in  the statute, necessarily include analyses comparing\r\n\n\"the  most recent estimates of emissions\" in the proposed project\r\n\narea with the projected emissions in the area were the project to\r\n\ngo forward, an assessment whether the project meets the  specific\r\n\nstatutory criteria for conformity based  on those analyses, and a\r\n\ndetermination  whether to support or approve the project.  See 42\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   7506(c)(1);  see also Cate, 904 F. Supp. at 523 (finding\r                                             \r\n\nthat an  agreement  requiring gas  pipe line  company to  conduct\r\n\ncertain modeling and analyses for determining what measures would\r\n\neliminate violations of  the NAAQS  and to develop  and submit  a\r\n\nplan  specifying  corrective  measures  and milestone  dates  for\r\n\ninstituting  corrective  measures  constituted  a  \"schedule\"  of\r\n\ncompliance  within  the  meaning  of  42  U.S.C.      7604(f)(1),\r\n\n7602(p)).\r\n\n          We  reject this argument, however, on  the basis of the\r\n\nEPA's interpretation of \"compliance  schedule\" in its regulations\r\n\nimplementing  the CAA.    40 C.F.R.     51.100 (1991).    Section\r\n\n51.100(p)  defines \"compliance  schedule\"  to mean  \"the date  or\r\n\ndates  by which a  source or category  of sources  is required to\r                                                           \r\n\ncomply  with  specific  emission  limitations  contained  in   an\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nimplementation plan  and with  any increments of  progress toward\r\n\nsuch  compliance.\"   (Emphasis  added.)   40  C.F.R.    51.100(q)\r\n\ndefines \"increments of progress\" to mean \"steps toward compliance\r\n\nwhich will be  taken by  a specific source  . . .  .\"   (Emphasis\r                                                    \r\n\nadded.)    These  definitions  make  clear  that  a  schedule  of\r\n\ncompliance  is  a  sequence  of  actions  that  a  polluter  must\r                                                                     \r\n\nundertake  by  certain  specified   dates  in  order  to  achieve\r\n\ncompliance with relevant emissions limitations or standards.  The\r\n\nconformity  requirements  themselves  do  not  fall  within  that\r\n\ndefinition.\r\n\n          2.  Review under the APA, 5 U.S.C.   702\r                    2.

See,   e.g.,  42  U.S.C.\r                                                              \r\n\n  7506(c)(4)(A)(\"the Administrator shall promulgate  criteria and\r\n\nprocedures  for  determining conformity  .  .  .  of  . .  .  the\r\n\nactivities  referred to  in [section  7506(c)(1)])\"; 42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n7601(a)(1)(\"the  Administrator  is authorized  to  prescribe such\r\n\nregulations as  are necessary  to carry out  his functions  under\r\n\nthis chapter\").   And review  under section 7607(b)  is only  \"of\r\n\naction  of the  Administrator.\"   In summary,  plaintiffs' claims\r\n\nconcern  action  taken  by the  EPA  qua  agency  of the  federal\r\n\ngovernment,  not as  administrator  or enforcer  of the  CAA, and\r\n\nhence are not subject to review under section 7607(b).\r\n\nB.  Conformity Determination in Absence of NEPA Compliance\r          B.  Conformity Determination in Absence of NEPA Compliance\r                                                                    \r\n\n          Plaintiffs argue  that since  the district  court found\r\n\nthe air quality analyses  used by the federal  agencies deficient\r\n\nand not in compliance with NEPA, it should not have addressed the\r\n\nmerits of  the CAA claims.  Neither the agencies nor the district\r\n\ncourt,  the   argument  goes,  could   make  reasoned  conformity\r\n\ndeterminations under  the CAA  based on noncomplying  air quality\r\n\nanalyses.   The  argument  raises two  separate  issues:   Was  a\r\n\nconformity  determination precluded  as  a matter  of law  before\r\n\ncompletion of the NEPA process?   And, even if it was  not, could\r\n\nthe  Air Force and the  FAA reasonably make  such a determination\r\n\nbefore the NEPA process had been completed here?\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\n          We  can readily  dispose of the  first issue.   Section\r\n\n7506(c)(1)   sets  forth   its  own   standards  for   evaluating\r\n\nconformity.   Nothing  in that  section or  elsewhere in  the CAA\r\n\nrequires the  information on which a  conformity determination is\r\n\nbased to have been subject to review, analysis, or public comment\r\n\npursuant to NEPA.   Moreover,  regulations issued by  the EPA  in\r\n\n1993   prescribing   procedures  and   criteria   for  conformity\r\n\ndeterminations  suggest  no  connection   between  NEPA  and  CAA\r\n\ncompliance.  See 42  U.S.C.   7506(c)(4)(A);  40 C.F.R.  Part 51,\r                          \r\n\nSubpart W  (1994); 40 C.F.R. Part  93, Subpart B (1994).   To the\r\n\ncontrary,  they specify that  \"[w]here multiple  Federal agencies\r\n\nhave jurisdiction  for various aspects  of a  project, a  Federal\r\n\nagency may choose to adopt the analysis of another Federal agency\r\n\nor  develop  its own  analysis in  order  to make  its conformity\r\n\ndetermination.\"   40  C.F.R.    93.154  (1994).   And  40  C.F.R.\r\n\n  93.156(b) (1994) states that  the 30-day comment period  for an\r\n\nagency's draft conformity  determination \"may be concurrent  with\r\n\nany  other  public  involvement,  such  as  occurs  in  the  NEPA\r\n\nprocess.\"  We see no basis  for engrafting a requirement that the\r\n\nNEPA process be completed before a determination is made.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs next contend that the Air Force and  the FAA\r\n\ncould  not reasonably  make the  conformity determination  before\r\n\ncompleting  the NEPA process.  If the federal agencies had relied\r\n\nentirely  on  the  FEIS   as  the  basis  for  their   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations, and if  the district  court had  later found  the\r\n\nanalyses  in the FEIS deficient under NEPA on substantive grounds\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nthat would also have affected the conformity analysis required by\r\n\nthe CAA,  the CAA conformity  determination might also  have been\r\n\ndeficient.

Sigler,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411900\"><a href=\"/opinion/411900/sierra-club-v-james-m-sigler-etc-pelican-terminal-company-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 980-\r                                                      \r\n\n83  (5th  Cir.),  reh'g denied,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1983).   That,\r                                        \r\n\nhowever, is not what happened here.   The NEPA problem arose from\r\n\na failure to comply  with the public comment requirement  in that\r\n\nthe  agencies   relied  for  their  conformity  determination  on\r\n\ninformation and analyses that  they had failed to include  in the\r\n\nFEIS or a  Supplemental FEIS  for public comment.   The  district\r\n\ncourt  found that those materials were a sufficient basis for the\r\n\nconformity  determinations; they simply  should have been subject\r\n\nto  public review and comment  to meet the  requirements of NEPA.\r\n\nSee 864 F. Supp. at 284-85, 288.  Because such  public review and\r             \r\n\ncomment  are not required  under the conformity  provision of the\r\n\nCAA,  the NEPA  violation  did  not  affect  the  merits  of  the\r\n\nconformity determination and hence does not require that we defer\r\n\npassing on the conformity claims. \r\n\nC.  Conformity Determination by the EPA\r          C.  Conformity Determination by the EPA\r                                                 \r\n\n          \"In  accordance with [the EPA's] responsibilities under\r\n\n. . . [NEPA and CAA],\" the EPA issued a review of the Air Force's\r\n\nFEIS on August 14, 1991.  In that review, the EPA addressed air\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nquality concerns related to the Pease project.  It first reviewed\r\n\nits  earlier conclusions  that  the project's  air impacts  would\r\n\nhinder New Hampshire's ability  to achieve required reductions in\r\n\nozone precursor emissions  and would cause  violations of the  CO\r\n\nstandards.  The EPA then reviewed the terms of the MOU into which\r\n\nit had  entered with PDA  and NHDES  and concluded  that the  MOU\r\n\n\"provides  a framework  that,  if  successful,  gives  reasonable\r\n\nassurance that  the Pease  development can proceed  in compliance\r\n\nwith the CAA.\"  The MOU itself quotes the text of section 7506(c)\r\n\nand states  that its  purpose  is to  \"accommodate the  statutory\r\n\nresponsibilities of the Parties  and provide assurance of orderly\r\n\nand  phased development  in  compliance with  CAA  requirements.\"\r\n\nMoreover,  the commitments in the  MOU indicate that  the EPA was\r\n\nconsidering  the specific  statutory criteria  in  the conformity\r\n\nprovision.  For example, the MOU specifies that, in the event the\r\n\nCO air quality analysis  required by the MOU shows  that proposed\r\n\ntraffic increases from redevelopment  \"may cause or contribute to\r\n\na new violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS,\" PDA must implement\r\n\nmeasures necessary  to reduce projected  traffic increases and/or\r\n\nair emissions  impacts to a level which will not result in such a\r\n\ncondition.  See infra pp.  48-50.\r                               \r\n\n           Section 7506(c) does not specify the form a conformity\r\n\ndetermination must take; when the  agencies acted, they had  only\r\n\nthe  statute  to  guide them  because  the  regulations  were not\r\n\nadopted until 1993.  Taking that fact into  account, we think the\r\n\nEPA's  actions  sufficiently  reflect  that  it  considered   the\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nproject's  potential  impact  on  air  quality  in  light  of the\r\n\nconformity provision  and, based on  the commitments in  the MOU,\r\n\nsee infra pp. 48-54, determined that the project could be carried\r                   \r\n\nout in conformity with applicable air quality standards. \r\n\nD.  Agencies' Compliance with 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)\r          D.  Agencies' Compliance with 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)\r                                                              \r\n\n          Having found that the  EPA made the required conformity\r\n\ndetermination, we now consider  whether its determination and the\r\n\ndeterminations  made by the Air  Force and the  FAA complied with\r\n\nthe statute.   As noted,  the statute prohibits  federal agencies\r\n\nfrom  supporting  or  approving  a project  unless  that  project\r\n\n\"conforms to an implementation plan after it has been approved or\r\n\npromulgated  under  section 7410  of this  title.\"   42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n7506(c)(1). \"[C]onformity to an implementation plan means\"\r\n\n          (A)  conformity  to an  implementation plan's\r\n          purpose  of  eliminating   or  reducing   the\r\n          severity  and  number  of violations  of  the\r\n          national ambient air quality standards; and \r\n          (B) that such activities will not--\r\n            (I)   cause  or   contribute  to   any  new\r\n          violation of any standard in any area;\r\n            (ii)  increase the frequency or severity of\r\n          any existing violation of any standard in any\r\n          area; or \r\n            (iii)  delay  timely   attainment  of   any\r\n          standard  or  any  required interim  emission\r\n          reductions or other milestones in any area.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)(A),(B). \r\n\n          At  the outset  we  note  two relevant  considerations:\r\n\nFirst,  no regulations  interpreting  these  provisions had  been\r\n\npromulgated   when    the   agencies   made    their   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations; therefore, they had only the words of the statute\r\n\nto  guide them.  Second, a conformity determination is inherently\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nfact-intensive;  therefore,  what  constitutes  conformity  is  a\r\n\nfunction  of  the unique  characteristics  of  the project  being\r\n\napproved. \r\n\n          1.  Substance of the Conformity Determinations.\r                    1.  Substance of the Conformity Determinations.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          The EPA, the Air Force, and the FAA all determined that\r\n\nthe  transfer  and  redevelopment  of Pease  met  the  conformity\r\n\nrequirements of section 7506(c)(1).  As discussed above, evidence\r\n\nthat the EPA made a conformity  determination is found in the MOU\r\n\nand the EPA's review of the FEIS.   See supra pp. 33-35.  The Air\r                                                       \r\n\nForce's conformity determination  is contained in two  documents:\r\n\nits  ROD,  issued August  20, 1991,  and  its Memorandum  for the\r\n\nRecord,   issued  March   20,   1992.     The  FAA's   conformity\r\n\ndetermination is contained  in its ROD, issued February 26, 1992.\r\n\nThose  documents reveal  the bases  for the  agencies' conformity\r\n\ndeterminations.   We now examine those bases to determine whether\r\n\nthe agencies abused  their discretion  when they  found that  the\r\n\nPease  project  met   the  conformity  requirements  of   section\r\n\n7506(c)(1).\r\n\n          The  agencies relied  on  information  and  commitments\r\n\ncontained   in  various  documents  in  making  their  conformity\r\n\ndeterminations.    The  EPA,   as  previously  noted,  based  its\r\n\nconformity determination on the commitments made in the MOU.  The\r\n\nAir Force based its determination  on the MOU, post-FEIS  studies\r\n\nconducted by NHDES and  discussed in the letter of  certification\r\n\nwritten  by  Robert  W.  Varney, Commissioner  of  NHDES  (Varney\r\n\nletter), and the FAA's conditional approval of certain aspects of\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nthe  Pease  project.   Similarly,  the FAA  based  its conformity\r\n\ndetermination  on  the MOU,  the  NHDES  studies and  conclusions\r\n\ndiscussed  in  the  Varney   letter,  the  Governor's  letter  of\r\n\nassurance,3 and  its own conditional approval  of certain aspects\r\n\nof  the Pease  project.  Each  of  the  bases  of  the  agencies'\r\n\nconformity determinations is briefly summarized below.\r\n\n            a.   The  Memorandum of  Understanding.   Because the\r                      a.

Because  the\r\nGovernor's letter relied  primarily on the NHDES  studies and the\r\nVarney  letter as the grounds for its assurance of conformity, we\r\ndo not discuss it separately.\r\n\n4   Ozone  precursors include  nitrous oxide  (NOx) and  volatile\r\ncompounds  (VOCs)  such  as hydrocarbons  (HC).    See 40  C.F.R.\r                                                                \r\n  51.852  (1995)  (ozone precursors  include  NOX  and VOCs);  40\r\nC.F.R.   51.100(s)  (1995) (VOCs  include any compound  of carbon\r\nexcept those listed in regulation).\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nnet reductions of  15% in total  volatile organic compound  (VOC)\r\n\nemissions  by November  15, 1996,  and 3%  each year  thereafter,\r\n\nuntil the  region achieved compliance  with the NAAQS  for ozone.\r\n\nTo  ensure compliance  with the  CAA and the  SIP, PDA  and NHDES\r\n\ncommitted themselves, under the terms of the MOU, to take certain\r\n\nactions.  \r\n\n          With respect to carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, the MOU\r\n\nprovides that:\r\n\n            (1) PDA will undertake a surface transportation study\r\n\n          examining existing vehicle traffic  patterns, projected\r\n\n          vehicle traffic increases associated  with development,\r\n\n          and potential for alternative modes of transportation.\r\n\n            (2) Based on the results of the transportation study,\r\n\n          PDA  will  develop  a comprehensive  traffic  model and\r\n\n          surface transportation master plan  for the Pease area.\r\n\n            (3) Using the traffic model  and periodically updated\r\n\n          traffic  counts,  PDA  will undertake  intermittent  CO\r\n\n          analyses to determine compliance with the one and eight\r\n\n          hour CO NAAQS and report the results of all CO analyses\r\n\n          to EPA.\r\n\n            (4)  In the  event that  the CO  analyses demonstrate\r\n\n          that   a   proposed   traffic   increase   from   Pease\r\n\n          redevelopment  may  cause   or  contribute  to  a   new\r\n\n          violation of the NAAQS for CO, PDA, in conjunction with\r\n\n          any  other  state  agency  whose  participation  may be\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\n          necessary, \"will implement measures necessary to reduce\r\n\n          projected  traffic  increases   and/or  air   emissions\r\n\n          impacts  to  a  level  which  will  not  result in  any\r\n\n          violation of,  or any  contribution to a  violation of,\r\n\n          the NAAQS\" for CO.\r\n\n          With  respect to hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, PDA agreed\r\n\nnot to develop Pease  beyond a level anticipated to  generate 3.3\r\n\ntons  per day  of  HCs until  New Hampshire  revised  its SIP  to\r\n\naccommodate greater emissions and the EPA approved the new SIP.  \r\n\n          Finally, with respect to all emissions, NHDES agreed to\r\n\nconsult with PDA in preparing the revised SIP and to evaluate and\r\n\nincorporate into  the new  SIP projected emission  increases from\r\n\nPease redevelopment.\r\n\n            b.   NHDES Studies and the Varney Letter.  The Varney\r                      b.   NHDES Studies and the Varney Letter.\r                                                               \r\n\nletter  considered  two  possible   readings  of  the  conformity\r\n\nrequirements  of section  7506(c)(1)(B):  (1)  that \"the  federal\r\n\nagency need  only  determine that  the  proposed activity  is  in\r\n\nconformity with the terms of the existing SIP,\" and (2) that \"the\r\n\ndetermination  must  address  the  three elements  set  forth  in\r\n\n  [7506(c)(1)(B] . . . separately, regardless of the terms of the\r\n\nSIP.\"   The  letter  concluded that  Pease development  conformed\r\n\nunder  either reading.  This  conclusion was based  on studies of\r\n\nair emissions  completed  by NHDES  after  the FEIS  was  issued.\r\n\nThese studies compared baseline emissions from 1989 (during full-\r\n\nscale  military  operations  at Pease)  and  1990  (when the  CAA\r\n\namendments were enacted and some military operations at Pease had\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nalready ceased) with projected emissions to 1997.5  According  to\r\n\nthe Varney letter,  the emissions were not  projected beyond 1997\r\n\nbecause such projections would be too speculative and  because by\r\n\n1997 New Hampshire would adopt a new SIP to address any increases\r\n\nin emissions.\r\n\n          Based on these  studies, NHDES concluded,  with respect\r\n\nto  ozone,  that  by  1997  emissions  of  HCs,  ozone's  primary\r\n\nprecursor, would likely reach approximately 2.5 tons per day, the\r\n\nsame level  as Pease  emitted in  1990, when  military operations\r\n\nwere  less than full-scale.  At full-scale, HC emissions at Pease\r\n\nhad been  variously estimated at 3.3 to 4 tons per day, which was\r\n\nstill  in compliance with the existing SIP.  Overall ozone levels\r\n\ngenerated locally  were expected  to decline because  older cars,\r\n\nwhich  produce more HCs,  were slowly being  replaced and because\r\n\n\"stage  II  vapor  recovery  at gasoline  filling  stations\"  was\r\n\ncommencing.   For  these  reasons, projections  of overall  ozone\r\n\nlevels  generated by the Pease area were expected to remain below\r\n\nthe 1989 and 1990 levels through Phase I of redevelopment.\r\n\n          With respect  to CO emission levels,  the NHDES studies\r\n\nshowed that, comparing 1989 and 1990 to 1997, Pease redevelopment\r\n\nwould not result  in a  significant increase in  the air  quality\r\n\nregion.    And  improvement  of  the  intersection  at  Spaulding\r\n\nTurnpike  and  Gosling  Road  (Spaulding   Turnpike/Gosling  Road\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Projected emissions  to 1997 took  into account redevelopment\r\nthrough Phase I of the Pease project, i.e., the first five years.\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\ninterchange) would significantly lessen  CO levels locally during\r\n\nthe period studied.6\r\n\n          NHDES  ultimately  concluded  that Pease  redevelopment\r\n\nsatisfied  the  three  conformity  criteria set  out  in  section\r\n\n7506(c)(1)(B): that, through 1997, Pease redevelopment would  not\r\n\ncause  or contribute to any new  violation of any standard in any\r\n\narea;  increase  the  frequency   or  severity  of  any  existing\r\n\nviolation of any standard in any area; or delay attainment of any\r\n\nstandard  or any  required interim  emission reductions  or other\r\n\nmilestones in any area.\r\n\n          NHDES  also concluded that  Phase I redevelopment would\r\n\nnot  violate any specific provision  of the SIP  but rather would\r\n\n\"conform  to the  SIP's purpose  of eliminating  or  reducing the\r\n\nseverity  and number of  violations of  the national  ambient air\r\n\nquality standards,  and achieving expeditious attainment  of such\r\n\nstandards.\"  See  42 U.S.C.  7506(c)(1)(A).   NHDES reached  this\r                          \r\n\nconclusion  for  several  reasons:   (1)  the  existing  SIP  was\r\n\ndeveloped  when  Pease  was  fully  operational and  incorporated\r\n\nemissions from Pease  at that level of operation; (2)  Phase I of\r\n\nPease redevelopment was expected  to produce fewer emissions than\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Although the NHDES studies noted that the \"air quality region\"\r\nhad \"no  historic attainment  or maintenance problem  with carbon\r\nmonoxide\" NAAQS, the air  quality analysis in the FEIS  had shown\r\npresent and ongoing violations of the NAAQS for CO at the Gosling\r\nRoad/Spaulding  Turnpike  interchange, the  main  gate  to Pease.\r\nPost-FEIS supplemental  air quality  modeling of the  interchange\r\narea,  based  on corrected  data, showed  that  CO levels  at the\r\ninterchange would  stay  within  the  NAAQS through  Phase  I  of\r\nredevelopment upon  completion of scheduled  improvements at  the\r\ninterchange.\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nthe base produced during full operation; and (3) increased levels\r\n\nof emissions from later stages of development would be taken into\r\n\naccount in the future SIP.\r\n\n            c.

In its ROD, it approved each  of the items\r\n\nin  the   ALP,  either  unconditionally  or   conditionally,  and\r\n\nrecommended  that the Air Force proceed with its proposal to make\r\n\nproperty at Pease  available for use as  a civilian airport.   It\r\n\ngave unconditional  approval to  the minor,  interim and  Phase I\r\n\nredevelopment outlined in the ALP but, to ensure conformity, only\r\n\nconditional approval to key  items in the ALP.  It concluded that\r\n\nits approval \"conform[s] with the approved SIP.\"\r\n\n          Regarding the later phases  of the redevelopment, which\r\n\ncould have a significant impact on air quality, FAA approval will\r\n\nbe  required once plans for them  are made final and proposed for\r\n\nimplementation; that approval will be  granted only after the FAA\r\n\ndetermines  whether additional  air  quality analysis  and a  new\r\n\nconformity finding are  required.  Further, FAA  approval will be\r\n\nrequired  for any new projects not depicted in the ALP, providing\r\n\nadditional assurances of conformity.\r\n\n          2.

The  NHDES studies discussed in the Varney letter\r          Redevelopment.\r                        \r\n\nand the post-FEIS studies  on the Spaulding Turnpike/Gosling Road\r\n\ninterchange indicate  that Phase I redevelopment  activities will\r\n\nconform to the  section 7506(c)(1)(B)  criteria, as  long as  New\r\n\nHampshire   improves   the   Spaulding    Turnpike/Gosling   Road\r\n\ninterchange  as required.7    As discussed  above, NHDES  studies\r\n\nused  1989 and  1990  emissions  estimates  as the  baseline  for\r\n\nperforming  the conformity analyses.  The EPA, Air Force, and the\r\n\nFAA   adopted  those   studies   in   making   their   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   New  Hampshire  is  committed  to making  these  improvements\r\nbecause,   as   noted  above,   NHDES's  conclusion   that  Pease\r\nredevelopment through  Phase I meets the  conformity criteria was\r\nbased on the assumption that this  interchange would be improved.\r\nSee  supra   p.  42  n.6.     Similarly   the  FAA's   conformity\r                    \r\ndetermination was based  in part on improvement of  the Spaulding\r\nTurnpike/Gosling Road interchange. \r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\n          Section 7506(c)(1)(B) states that  \"[t]he determination\r\n\nof  conformity shall  be based  on the  most recent  estimates of\r\n\nemissions .  . . .\"   NHDES explained  that it selected  1989 and\r\n\n1990 rather than  1991 (the  year it performed  the analysis)  as\r\n\nbaseline years because 1989 was \r\n\n          \"the most recent year representative of full-\r\n          scale  military  operation  at  Pease.

We assume  that Congress\r\n          did  not  intend that  a  project like  Pease\r\n          redevelopment   would   be  penalized   under\r\n          [7506(c)]  because there  is  a temporal  gap\r\n          between the federal government's  decision to\r\n          terminate  operations at Pease and the start-\r\n          up of the State's redevelopment of the  base,\r\n          during which  a  temporary reduction  in  the\r\n          emission  inventory occurred  as a  result of\r\n          activity phase-down.\" \r\n\nUse of 1991 as a baseline, it added, \"would unfairly penalize the\r\n\nPease redevelopment project, since 1991  emissions of CO, NOX and\r\n\nVOCs are significantly less than historical norms because  of the\r\n\nAir Force's cessation of activities at Pease.\"\r\n\n          Under the Chevron doctrine, an  agency's interpretation\r\n\nof a statute is entitled to  weight when the statute is silent or\r\n\nambiguous.

This appears to us to be one\r\n\nof  those rare  cases where  the plain  meaning would  lead to  a\r\n\nresult  that is irrational and at  odds with the intention of the\r\n\nlegislature.  Read  literally, the plain language  of the statute\r\n\nas  applied  in  base-closing  cases  would  require   conformity\r\n\ndeterminations to be based on  a wholly artificial situation, the\r\n\ninterval  during which  military  operations have  shut down  and\r\n\ncivilian  activities not yet started.   The likely consequence in\r\n\nmany cases would be to  preclude any economically beneficial  use\r\n\nof  a closed  military base.   Such  a result  is  irrational and\r\n\npresumably unintended by Congress.  In  view of Congress's strong\r\n\nsupport of  civilian redevelopment of closed  military bases, see\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\ninfra pp.  57-58,  it would  not  have wanted  to  erect a  major\r               \r\n\nobstacle to economically beneficial, post-closing uses of a base.\r\n\nThus, the agencies' reliance  on the NHDES studies based  on 1989\r\n\nand 1990 estimates was reasonable under the circumstances.  Those\r\n\nstudies  support the  determination  that Phase  I  redevelopment\r\n\nmeets the statutory conformity criteria.\r\n\n            (ii)  Evidence  Regarding  Effects  of  Post-Phase  I\r                      (ii)  Evidence  Regarding  Effects  of  Post-Phase  I\r                                                                           \r\n\nRedevelopment.   Other  air quality  studies conducted  by NHDES,\r          Redevelopment.\r                        \r\n\nhowever, suggest  potential violation of the  conformity criteria\r\n\nin  later  phases  of  Pease   redevelopment,  absent  mitigation\r\n\nmeasures.   With respect to CO emissions, the FEIS indicated that\r\n\nby the  year 2010 redevelopment  was expected to  generate 68,000\r\n\ndaily  vehicle  trips into  the Pease  area.   The  main  area of\r\n\nconcern for traffic congestion causing emissions increases is the\r\n\nintersection of  Spaulding Turnpike and Gosling  Road.  Post-FEIS\r\n\nair quality  studies of  that intersection indicated  that, while\r\n\nconstruction  of   the   new  Spaulding   Turnpike/Gosling   Road\r\n\ninterchange by  NHDOT would bring  the area into  compliance with\r\n\nNAAQS  for  CO through  the end  of  the decade,  traffic volumes\r\n\nassociated with Pease  redevelopment and regional  growth through\r\n\nthe  full build-out  year  2010 could  cause violations  unless a\r\n\nsecond   entrance   interchange   to   Pease   was   constructed.\r\n\nRedevelopment would therefore contribute to new violations of the\r\n\nNAAQS for CO sometime after the turn of the century.\r\n\n          Similarly,  an  EPA  memorandum  dated  July 24,  1991,\r\n\nindicated that, while Phase I of Pease redevelopment was expected\r\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\nto  generate  only  2.5  tons  per  day  of  HCs  (a  major ozone\r\n\nprecursor),  Phase II extending to the year 2002 was estimated to\r\n\ngenerate 4.8  tons  per day.    At  that level,  Phase  II  would\r\n\nincrease existing violations, as well as delay attainment, of the\r\n\nNAAQS for ozone absent  some other changes or the  institution of\r\n\nmitigation measures.\r\n\n            b.

As  to  the  latter,  the   MOU  states\r\n\ncategorically that \"PDA, and if necessary in conjunction with any\r\n\nother appropriate state agency, will implement measures necessary\r                                                                 \r\n\nto  reduce  projected  traffic  increases  and/or  air  emissions\r\n\nimpacts to  a level which will not result in any violation of, or\r\n\nany  contribution  to  a  violation  of,  the  NAAQS  for  carbon\r\n\nmonoxide.\" (Emphasis added.) \r\n\n          These  commitments are sufficient  to ensure compliance\r\n\nwith the statutory requirement that Pease redevelopment \"will not\r\n\ncause  or contribute to  any new violation\" of  the NAAQS for CO,\r\n\nsee 42 U.S.C.   7506(c)(1)(B)(I), for two reasons.\r             \r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\n          First,   PDA's   open-ended  commitment   to  implement\r\n\nnecessary  mitigation   measures   includes  by   implication   a\r\n\ncommitment   to  implement   the   mitigation  measures   already\r\n\nidentified  in the  area of  the Spaulding  Turnpike/Gosling Road\r\n\ninterchange.   Specifically,  it  includes a  commitment by  PDA,\r\n\nalong with NHDOT and other necessary state agencies, to build the\r\n\nsecond access  to Pease,  unless later studies  reveal preferable\r\n\nalternatives for satisfying the commitment.  See supra pp. 38-39.\r                                                                \r\n\n          Corroborating  this  commitment  is  a July  31,  1991,\r\n\nletter from PDA to the Air Force stating that compliance with the\r\n\nNAAQS would  require completion of improvements  to the Spaulding\r\n\nTurnpike/Gosling Road  interchange as  well as construction  of a\r\n\nsecond access to Pease prior to the time the improved interchange\r\n\nreaches maximum capacity.   To permit construction of the  second\r\n\naccess, PDA requested that a portion  of the golf course at Pease\r\n\nbe made available.   In  the Application and  Acceptance for  the\r\n\ntransfer of  airport property, the  Air Force agreed  to transfer\r\n\nthe needed portions of the golf course.\r\n\n          Second, the  agreement  requiring ongoing  studies  and\r\n\nanalyses and implementation of  mitigation measures as needed was\r\n\na reasonable  way to  ensure conformity under  the circumstances.\r\n\nThe  details of the redevelopment  project are not  fixed and its\r\n\ntime line is extended.   As the FAA pointed  out in its ROD,  air\r\n\nquality  impacts stemming  from  certain aspects  of the  airport\r\n\ndevelopment  were speculative when  the conformity determinations\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\nwere made because the project-specific design detail necessary to\r\n\nassess those impacts properly and  develop a range of alternative\r\n\nmitigation  measures  was lacking.    Similarly,  the nonaviation\r\n\nbusiness tenants at  the on-airport industrial  park had not  yet\r\n\nbeen  selected.   In  addition, over  the  20-year life  of Pease\r\n\nredevelopment, other environmental factors in the region, as well\r\n\nas technologies available  to address  them, may  change.   Given\r\n\nthese uncertainties,  a commitment to pursue  ongoing studies and\r\n\nanalyses and  to implement appropriate mitigation  measures based\r\n\non demonstrated needs  was a reasonable  approach to meeting  the\r\n\nstatutory requirement.     \r\n\n            (ii)  Ozone  Precursors.    With  respect  to   ozone\r                      (ii)  Ozone  Precursors.\r                                              \r\n\nstandards,   the  MOU  requires  NHDES   to  work  with  PDA  and\r\n\nincorporate projected emissions from Pease redevelopment into the\r\n\nSIP  revisions.8 Unless  and  until  the  new  SIP  is  approved,\r\n\nhowever,  it  bars PDA  from developing  Pease \"beyond  the level\r\n\nanticipated  to   generate  3.3  tons  per   day  of  hydrocarbon\r\n\nemissions\"--the level of emissions from Pease permitted under the\r\n\nexisting SIP.  Thus, the MOU does not place the  entire burden of\r\n\naddressing HC emissions on the SIP process. \r\n\n          To the extent that the MOU does rely on the SIP process\r\n\nto deal  with projected  increases in  HC emissions, however,  it\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  According to  the 1990 Amendments, New Hampshire  was required\r\nto revise  its SIP  to achieve  at least a  15% reduction  in VOC\r\nemissions (including HCs) from 1990  levels on or before November\r\nof  1996 (accounting for any growth in emissions after 1990), and\r\n3%  additional annual  reductions on  average thereafter  through\r\n1999.   See  42 U.S.C.    7511a(b)(1)(A)  &amp; (c)(2)(B)  (Supp. III\r                     \r\n1991).  \r\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\ndoes  so  properly  under  the  circumstances.    The  1990   CAA\r\n\namendments required  New Hampshire to  revise its SIP  to address\r\n\nVOC emissions (which  include HC emissions) within  approximately\r\n\nthree years.   See 42 U.S.C.     7511a(c), (b)(1).   See supra p.\r                                                                        \r\n\n14.   NHDES's  commitment to  consult  with PDA  and  incorporate\r\n\nemissions from  Pease development into required  revisions of the\r\n\nSIP is  consistent with the SIP  process and NHDES's  role as the\r\n\nstate agency responsible for  developing the SIP.  While  the EPA\r\n\nand the  legislature set ultimate standards  and goals--including\r\n\nthe NAAQS and deadlines  for attaining them--the state prescribes\r\n\nin its SIP  how it  will achieve those  goals.   See 42 U.S.C.   \r                                                              \r\n\n7407.   Thus, if NHDES  chooses to incorporate  into the required\r\n\nrevisions of the SIP  certain levels of emissions from  the Pease\r\n\nproject, that is its prerogative under the statutory SIP process.\r\n\n          By  agreeing to  incorporate Pease  emissions into  SIP\r\n\nrevisions that will  reduce overall ozone-precursor emissions  in\r\n\nthe region, NHDES has enabled  PDA to undertake the redevelopment\r\n\nwithout increasing the severity of or delaying attainment of  the\r\n\nNAAQS  for  ozone.   Presumably  New  Hampshire will  accommodate\r\n\nincreased HC  emissions from  Pease and achieve  interim required\r\n\nemissions reductions and timely attainment of the NAAQS for ozone\r\n\nby cutting VOC emissions in other areas.  This will permit  later\r\n\nstages of  Pease redevelopment  to go forward  without increasing\r\n\nexisting violations of the NAAQS for ozone or delaying attainment\r\n\n                               -44-\r\r\n\nof  the NAAQS  for  ozone  or  other  CAA  standards.  42  U.S.C.\r\n\n  7506(c)(1)(B)(ii), (iii).   \r\n\n          Unless and until a  new SIP incorporating higher levels\r\n\nof  emissions from Pease is  approved, however, the MOU prohibits\r\n\nredevelopment  of Pease beyond a level producing 3.3 tons per day\r\n\nof HC emissions.   While the cap is in  compliance with the terms\r\n\nof the existing SIP, it is not so clear it will ensure that Pease\r\n\nredevelopment  activities  will  not  increase  the  severity  of\r\n\nexisting  ozone  violations  and   delay  compliance  with  ozone\r\n\nstandards.   Whether redevelopment will increase  the severity of\r                                                          \r\n\nexisting violations  depends in  part on the  baseline emissions.\r\n\nWhen compared to 1989  emissions, 3.3 tons per day  represents no\r\n\nincrease  in the severity of  violations of the  NAAQS for ozone.\r\n\nBecause,  as  we  stated  earlier,  use  of   1989  estimates  is\r\n\nreasonable  under the  circumstances,  see supra  pp. 45-47,  and\r                                                          \r\n\nbecause the existing  SIP permits  this level  of emissions,  the\r\n\nprovisions of  the MOU satisfy the  conformity requirements under\r\n\nsection 7506(c)(1)(B)(ii).  \r\n\n          Regarding delaying attainment  of the ozone  standards,\r\n\nplaintiffs   appear  to   suggest  that   to  meet   the  section\r\n\n7506(c)(1)(B)(iii)  criteria, emissions  from  the Pease  project\r\n\nmust be consistent with  the VOC emissions reductions set  out in\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   7511a(c)(2).   Prior to incorporation into  a revised\r\n\nSIP, however, these reductions apply only in conformity decisions\r\n\nrelated  to  transportation  plans,  programs  and  projects  and\r\n\ntherefore   are    not   relevant   here.       See   42   U.S.C.\r                                                             \r\n\n                               -45-\r\r\n\n  7506(c)(3)(A)(iii); see also 136 Cong. Rec.

THE CERCLA CLAIM\r                                IV.  THE CERCLA CLAIM\r\n\n          Newington claims that the  Air Force's 55-year lease of\r\n\nportions  of Pease  to  PDA violates  section 120(h)(3)(B)(i)  of\r\n\nCERCLA (42  U.S.C.   9620(h)(3)(B)(I)).   The district  court had\r\n\njurisdiction over  the claim under  42 U.S.C.    9613(b)  (1988).\r\n\nSection 120  was  added  by the  1986  Superfund  Amendments  and\r\n\nReauthorization  Act (SARA), Pub.  L. No. 99-499,  100 Stat. 1613\r\n\n(1986),  to   address  issues   concerning  hazardous   waste  on\r\n\nfederally-owned sites.  Section  120(a) subjects federal agencies\r\n\nto CERCLA.   Subsections (b) through (f) outline  a comprehensive\r\n\nprogram   to  identify  and   remediate  hazardous  waste  sites.\r\n\nSubsection  (h)  deals  with   transfers  of  property  on  which\r\n\nhazardous substances are known to  have been released or disposed\r\n\nof.    Subsection  (h)(1)  requires  notice  of  such release  or\r\n\ndisposal in any contract \"for the sale  or other transfer of real\r\n\nproperty which is owned by the United States.\"\r\n\n          Subsection  (h)(3) addresses  the \"contents  of certain\r\n\ndeeds.\"  Before its recent amendment, it required that\r\n\n          .  . . in the case of any real property owned\r\n          by the  United States on which  any hazardous\r\n\n                               -46-\r\r\n\n          substance was  stored for  one year  or more,\r\n          known to have been released, or disposed  of,\r\n          each deed  entered into  for the  transfer of\r\n          such property  by the  United  States to  any\r\n          other person or entity shall contain--\r\n            (B) a covenant warranting that--\r\n            (i)  all  remedial   action  necessary   to\r\n          protect human health and the environment with\r\n          respect  to any  such substance  remaining on\r\n          the property  has been taken before  the date\r\n          of such transfer, . . . .\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   9620(h)(3).\r\n\n          Newington  argues that section  120(h)(3) prohibits the\r\n\nfederal government from  transferring contaminated property until\r\n\nit has constructed, installed and is successfully operating clean\r\n\nup  procedures  and  mechanisms  that  ensure  full  remediation.\r\n\nAlthough  section  120(h)(3)  by  its  terms  applies  to  deeds,\r\n\nNewington contends  that the substance of  the transaction should\r\n\ncontrol  and that the government should not be permitted to avoid\r\n\nthe mandate of the  statute by labeling the transaction  a lease.\r\n\nThe District Court  held that  the transfer  without an  approved\r\n\nremedial design violated  section 120(h) of CERCLA, and  that the\r\n\nfailure to disclose in the  FEIS the decision to transfer  by way\r\n\nof a  long-term lease rather  than deed  violated NEPA.   See 864\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.Supp. at  290.  Although the court  declined to hold the leases\r\n\nvoid,  it directed the Air  Force to prepare  a supplemental FEIS\r\n\ndelineating  the remedial  design.   Newington contends  that the\r\n\nrelief granted  is inadequate  to secure compliance  with section\r\n\n120(h).\r\n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\n          Any question about whether section 120(h)(3) applies to\r\n\nlong-term  leases has been laid to rest  by the 1996 amendment of\r\n\nthat section, adding the following language:\r\n\n            The  requirements of subparagraph (B) [of a\r\n          covenant   warranting   completion   of   all\r\n          necessary remedial action] shall not apply in\r\n          any  case  in  which   the  transfer  of  the\r\n          property occurs or has occurred by means of a\r\n          lease,  without regard to  whether the lessee\r\n          has   agreed  to  purchase  the  property  or\r\n          whether  the duration of  the lease is longer\r\n          than 55 years.\r\n\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  1996, Pub.

In  those  cases,  we  found\r\n\nirreparable harm  to exist when  agencies become entrenched  in a\r\n\ndecision uninformed by the proper NEPA  process because they have\r\n\nmade  commitments or  taken  action to  implement the  uninformed\r\n\ndecision.  See Watt, 716 F.2d  at 951-53; Marsh, 872 F.2d at 499-\r                                                         \r\n\n503. Our rationale  derived from the purpose  of NEPA:   \"NEPA is\r\n\ndesigned  to influence  the  decision making  process\" by  making\r\n\n\"governmental officials notice  environmental considerations  and\r\n\ntake them into account.\"   Watt, 716 F.2d at 952.   \"Thus, when a\r                                         \r\n\ndecision  to which NEPA  obligations attach  is made  without the\r\n\ninformed environmental consideration that NEPA requires, the harm\r\n\nthat NEPA intends to prevent has been suffered.\"  Id.   That harm\r                                                               \r\n\nis not  merely a procedural harm,  but is \"the added  risk to the\r\n\nenvironment  that takes place  when governmental  decision makers\r\n\nmake  up their minds without having before them an analysis (with\r\n\nprior public  comment) of  the likely  effects of  their decision\r\n\nupon the environment.\"  Marsh, 872 F.2d at 500.\r                                       \r\n\n          Plaintiffs   argue   that,   without   an   injunction,\r\n\ndevelopment  of Pease will continue and they will suffer the kind\r\n\nof  irreparable  harm we  described in  Watt  and Marsh.    As we\r                                                                 \r\n\nemphasized  there,  however, our  holdings did  not mean  \"that a\r\n\nlikely NEPA violation automatically  calls for an injunction; the\r\n\n                               -52-\r\r\n\nbalance  of harms may point the other  way.\"  See Marsh, 872 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 504 (quoting Watt,  716 F.2d at 952) (emphasis added). In Watt\r                                                                           \r\n\nand  Marsh,  plaintiffs moved  for  injunctions  in the  earliest\r                    \r\n\nstages  of  development of  the  projects  at  issue,  when  NEPA\r\n\ninjunctions could  implement the  statutory purpose in  the sense\r\n\nthat \"bureaucratic decision makers . . . are less  likely to tear\r\n\ndown a nearly completed  project than a barely  started project.\"\r\n\nMarsh, 872 F.2d at 500.   In contrast, plaintiff here, well aware\r               \r\n\nof the  defective FEIS, waited  nearly three years  before moving\r\n\nfor  injunctive relief.  CLF  filed its complaint  in March 1992,\r\n\nsome  six months after the  challenged FEIS and  ROD were issued;\r\n\nNewington  filed its  complaint  in June  1992.   Both complaints\r\n\nrecited requests  for permanent injunctions in  their prayers for\r\n\nrelief.   Despite  these  early references  to equitable  relief,\r\n\nhowever, neither  CLF nor  Newington ever  moved  to restrain  or\r\n\nenjoin any aspect of the project.  When the cases came before the\r\n\ndistrict court on cross-motions for summary judgment, plaintiffs'\r\n\nbriefs focused on the  merits of the substantive claims,  not the\r\n\nneed for injunctive relief.  Only  after the entry of the court's\r\n\norder granting summary judgment in  part did plaintiffs argue, in\r\n\na  motion to amend, that  they were entitled  to broad injunctive\r\n\nrelief.\r\n\n          To  be taken into  account in assessing  the balance of\r\n\nharms is the  fact that  between the time  when plaintiffs  filed\r\n\nsuit  and  when  they  ultimately moved  for  injunctive  relief,\r\n\nsignificant  commitments were  made to  the  Pease project.   The\r\n\n                               -53-\r\r\n\nState of New  Hampshire issued $8  million in general  obligation\r\n\nbonds to fund the  operation of PDA and $40 million in guaranteed\r\n\nbonds to help finance the location of two major tenants at Pease;\r\n\nconstruction  contracts aggregating $50  million were entered and\r\n\nfederal  grants of more than  $6 million received  to support the\r\n\nairport operations;  and more than 1,100  persons became employed\r\n\nby tenants and agencies  as a result of the  development project.\r\n\nThese commitments would be  placed at risk if an  injunction were\r\n\ngranted.\r\n\n          Thus, the  type of public and  private commitments with\r\n\nwhich Watt and Marsh were concerned had already been made here by\r                              \r\n\nthe  time plaintiffs sought injunctive relief.  If harm was done,\r\n\nit largely had been done, not by the court's denial of injunctive\r\n\nrelief, but by plaintiffs' failure  to timely seek it.  While  it\r\n\nis true that as development continues other actions will be taken\r\n\nto implement the project, their impact  will be only incremental.\r\n\nFuture risks  of environmental harm will  be minimized, moreover,\r\n\nby the district court's retention of jurisdiction under its order\r\n\nthat  the Air  Force  compile a  Supplemental  FEIS, by  the  Air\r\n\nForce's commitment to  this court that  it \"will use the  SEIS to\r\n\nreview  its August 1991 ROD and April 1992 Supplemental ROD,\" and\r\n\nby the continuing oversight responsibilities of the FAA under the\r\n\nSurplus Property Act and of the EPA under the CAA.\r\n\n          Under  these  circumstances, it  was  not  an abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion for the district  court to deny the  injunctive relief\r\n\nsought.  \r\n\n                               -54-\r\r\n\n                         VI.  CONCLUSION\r                                   VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  reverse  the  district  court's  determination that\r\n\ndefendants  violated CERCLA and affirm the  judgment below in all\r\n\nother respects.   Pending the completion of the Supplemental FEIS\r\n\non which the FAA is working in conjunction with the Air Force, we\r\n\nretain  jurisdiction  under  the  petitions of  the  NEPA  claims\r\n\nagainst the FAA but dismiss the CAA claims against it.\r\n\n          SO ORDERED.\r                              \r\n\n                               -55-\r\r\n</pre>",
