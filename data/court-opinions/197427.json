(\"CFI\"),   a  Massachusetts-based   processor  and\r\n\ndistributor  of  milk, operates  a  chain  of convenience  stores\r\n\nthroughout the  northeastern states.   In  this case, it  asserts\r\n\nthat  a milk  handling surcharge  imposed by  the State  of Maine\r\n\nviolates  the   Commerce  Clause.    The   defendants  are  state\r\n\nofficials, sued  as such (collectively, \"Maine\"  or \"the State\").\r\n\nIn their  view, the milk handling  surcharge is indistinguishable\r\n\nfor  Commerce Clause  purposes  from a  sales  tax and  does  not\r\n\ndiscriminate against interstate commerce either on its face or in\r\n\nits  purpose  and effect.   Because  the  Tax Injunction  Act, 28\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341 (1994), deprives the federal courts (other than the\r\n\nSupreme  Court)  of jurisdiction  to  decide the  merits  of this\r\n\ndifficult  (and  interesting)  question, we  vacate  the judgment\r\n\nbelow and remand with instructions to dismiss the case.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          Our tale begins with the Maine Dairy Farm Stabilization\r\n\nAct (\"the  DFS Act\"), Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 36,     4541-4547\r\n\n(repealed  1995).  The  DFS Act had  two components.   On the one\r\n\nhand, it  imposed a  tax on  packaged fluid  milk  sold in  Maine\r\n\n(whether produced in  or out of  state).  On  the other hand,  it\r\n\nprovided a rebate  of the  funds so collected  to in-state  dairy\r\n\nfarmers.    The first  handler in  Maine  bore the  obligation of\r\n\ncollecting and paying the  tax, regardless of whether  such first\r\n\nhandler  was a wholesaler or a retailer selling milk packaged out\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nof state.  See id. at 4543(1).\r                            \r\n\n          The  tax  imposed  by  the   DFS  Act  had  an  unusual\r\n\nstructure,  better suited  to price  maintenance than  to revenue\r\n\naugmentation.  The amount of the tax varied between 0  and 5  per\r\n\nquart of  milk and increased  as the  \"basic price\" of  milk fell\r\n\nbelow the target price of $16.00 per hundredweight (later changed\r\n\nto $16.50  per hundredweight).1    See id.  at    4543(2).    The\r                                                    \r\n\nstatute directed  the State  Treasurer to segregate  the proceeds\r\n\nfrom this tax and distribute 94% of the funds so collected to in-\r\n\nstate  dairy farmers in proportion to their milk production.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at    4544(2)(A).   This  tax-and-subsidy scheme  enabled in-\r             \r\n\nstate milk producers to  receive the target price for  their milk\r\n\ncome  what may   first, they received  the basic price from their\r\n\ncustomers,  and then  they  received the  difference between  the\r\n\ntarget price and the basic price as a rebate from the State   and\r\n\nthus shielded them from out-of-state competition.\r\n\n          The  Supreme Court threw a monkey wrench into the gears\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In  this context, \"basic price\" is a  term of art.  See Me.\r                                                                       \r\nRev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 7,   2954.  The  Maine Milk Commission sets\r\nthe basic  price of milk, which is the minimum price that must be\r\npaid by milk dealers in Maine (other than those who are federally\r\nregulated) to Maine  dairy farmers.  The basic price is geared to\r\nthe price of  milk established for the Boston zone  under the New\r\nEngland Federal Milk Marketing Order No. 1.  See 7  C.F.R.   1001\r                                                          \r\net seq. (1997).   The DFS Act provided that  when the basic price\r                 \r\nwas $16.00 or  more per  hundredweight (cwt), a  handler paid  no\r\ntax.   When  the basic price  was $15.50  to $15.99  per cwt, the\r\nhandler paid  a tax of  1  per quart.   When the  basic price was\r\n$15.00  to $15.49 per cwt,  the tax rose to  2  per quart, and so\r\non.   Since  there are about  46.5 quarts  of milk  per cwt, this\r\nmechanism tended to guarantee price stability by keeping  the sum\r\nof  the basic price  plus the tax  in the vicinity  of $16.00 per\r\ncwt.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nof the DFS Act when it decided West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,\r                                                                          \r\n\n512  U.S.  186  (1994).   In  that  case, the  Court  addressed a\r\n\nMassachusetts  pricing  order   which  was   tailored  to   serve\r\n\nsubstantially the same ends as the DFS Act.  The order imposed an\r\n\nassessment  on fluid  milk  sold by  Massachusetts retailers  and\r\n\ndirected distribution of  the amounts collected  to Massachusetts\r\n\ndairy farmers.   See  id. at  190-91.  Finding  that the  order's\r                                   \r\n\npurpose  and effect  were  \"to enable  higher cost  Massachusetts\r\n\ndairy farmers to compete  with lower cost dairy farmers  in other\r\n\nStates,\"    the   Court   declared   the   arrangement   \"clearly\r\n\nunconstitutional.\"  Id. at 194.\r                                 \r\n\n          In the  aftermath of West Lynn  Creamery, we considered\r                                                            \r\n\nCFI's constitutional  challenge  to  the DFS  Act.    Finding  no\r\n\nsignificant constitutional distinction between  that Act and  the\r\n\nMassachusetts law  invalidated in  West Lynn Creamery,  we struck\r                                                               \r\n\ndown Maine's scheme.   See Cumberland Farms, Inc. v.  LaFaver, 33\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (Cumberland I).\r                                                           \r\n\n          The   Maine   legislature  responded   with  remarkable\r\n\nalacrity.  In January of 1995, it enacted \"An Act to Continue the\r\n\nFee  on the Handling  of Milk,\" Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 36,   \r\n\n4771-4773  (\"the 1995  Act\").   The  preamble to  the legislation\r\n\nrecited  that  \"the  State  and  its  citizens  are  experiencing\r\n\neconomic difficulties and significant  fiscal problems\" such that\r\n\n\"revenues are  necessary to the  State's ability to  address such\r\n\ndifficulties  and  problems.\"   1995  Me. Laws  ch.  2, Emergency\r\n\nPreamble.  The  1995 Act  assesses a surcharge  on milk  handlers\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat is nearly identical  to that previously mandated by  the DFS\r\n\nAct2  but directs that the revenues generated are to be deposited\r\n\ninto Maine's  general fund.  See  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 36,  \r                                          \r\n\n4772(8).\r\n\n          Shortly after the effective date  of the 1995 Act,  the\r\n\nplot thickened.   The  state legislature began  systematically to\r\n\nensure continued subsidization of Maine's dairy farmers.  As part\r\n\nof three successive omnibus  spending bills for state government,\r\n\nthe   legislature  appropriated   to   in-state  milk   producers\r\n\n$1,500,000 for the period March 1995 to June 1996, $4,050,000 for\r\n\nthe  period July to September 1996, and $3,150,000 for the period\r\n\nJuly 1996 to  June 1997.  See 1995 Me. Laws  ch. 5,   A-1; id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\nch. 368,   B-1; id. at ch. 665,   KK-1.\r                             \r\n\n          CFI  believed  that  this legislative  patchwork  was a\r\n\nthinly-veiled contrivance aimed at  circumventing the decision in\r\n\nCumberland I and that the new legislation, taken in its entirety,\r                      \r\n\nshared  the same constitutional infirmity which led to the demise\r\n\nof  the DFS  Act.  Consequently,  it brought suit  in the federal\r\n\ndistrict  court seeking  injunctive,  declaratory,  and  monetary\r\n\nrelief.  In due season, the district court rejected CFI's plaint.\r\n\nAlthough  the  court  believed  that the  state  legislature,  in\r\n\npassing the 1995 legislative  package (that is, the 1995  Act and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The 1995 Act imposes a surcharge that ranges between 0  and\r\n6   per quart of milk.  When the basic price is $16.50 per cwt or\r\nmore, there  is no charge.   When  the basic price  is $16.00  to\r\n$16.49 per  cwt,  the charge  is  1   per quart.    This  pattern\r\ncontinues  until the basic price  drops below $14.00  per cwt, at\r\nwhich point  the maximum  surcharge (6  per  quart) is  achieved.\r\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36,   4772(2).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nthe  ensuing appropriation  bills), \"intended  to circumvent  the\r\n\nCourt's decision  in West Lynn  Creamery by simply  pulling apart\r                                                  \r\n\nthe  two  components  of  the  [DFS]  Act,\"  it nonetheless  felt\r\n\ncompelled  to  unwrap the  package  and  analyze  each  piece  of\r\n\nlegislation separately.  Cumberland Farms, Inc. v. Mahany, 943 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp.  83, 87  (D.  Me. 1996).   The  court concluded  that, when\r\n\nexamined  independently,  both the  revenue-raising  and spending\r\n\nbills passed muster under the Commerce Clause.  See id. at 88-90.\r                                                                 \r\n\nAccordingly, it granted summary judgment  in Maine's favor.  This\r\n\nappeal followed.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                             Analysis\r                                       Analysis\r                                               \r\n\n          Federal  courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and\r\n\nthus must  take  pains to  act only  within the  margins of  that\r\n\njurisdiction.  See National  Ass'n of Social Workers v.  Harwood,\r                                                                          \r\n\n69 F.3d 622, 628 n.6 (1st Cir. 1995).  Here, Maine interposes the\r\n\nTax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.   1341 (\"the TIA\"), as a defense to\r\n\nCFI's suit.  Although Maine  did not raise this point  below, the\r\n\nTIA's commands  are jurisdictional in nature and  are not subject\r\n\nto waiver.  See  Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v.  Rivera Vasquez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n977 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1992).  Thus, we start   and finish   our\r\n\nanalysis by discussing this facet of the State's defense.\r\n\n          The TIA provides in  relevant part that \"[t]he district\r\n\ncourts  shall not  enjoin, suspend,  or restrain  the assessment,\r\n\nlevy  or collection of  any tax  under State  law where  a plain,\r\n\nspeedy  and efficient  remedy may  be had in  the courts  of such\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nState.\"   28 U.S.C.   1341.   In one respect, the TIA sweeps more\r\n\nbroadly than the letter of its text suggests.  As authoritatively\r\n\nconstrued,  the TIA forbids not only  injunctive relief, but also\r\n\ndeclaratory  and monetary  relief.   See  National Private  Truck\r                                                                           \r\n\nCouncil,  Inc.  v. Oklahoma  Tax Comm'n,  115  S. Ct.  2351, 2354\r                                                 \r\n\n(1995).   Hence, the TIA,  if it applies  in this instance,  is a\r\n\ncomplete  bar  to maintaining  the  instant action  in  a federal\r\n\nforum.  We turn, then, to the question of its applicability.\r\n\n          Two conditions  must be  satisfied before the  TIA will\r\n\ndeprive a  federal court of jurisdiction:   first, the challenged\r\n\nimpost  must constitute a tax; and second, the State must furnish\r\n\nan  adequate alternative to a federal-court remedy.  Here, we are\r\n\nconcerned only with the first condition, for CFI does not dispute\r\n\nthat Maine  affords  a plain,  speedy, and  efficient anodyne  to\r\n\npersons putatively aggrieved by the operation of the 1995 Act.3\r\n\n          The  question  is whether,  for  purposes  of the  TIA,\r\n\nMaine's  milk handling surcharge is a tax (which would defeat the\r\n\nexercise of federal jurisdiction) or a fee (which would allow the\r\n\nexercise of federal jurisdiction).

Comm'n, 967 F.2d  683 (1st  Cir. 1992),  we set\r                                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3In  all events, CFI could not mount a credible challenge on\r\nthis  point.  Under Maine law, CFI can  apply for a refund of any\r\nmonies due pursuant  to the 1995 Act within  three years from the\r\ntime a return  is filed  or two years  from the time  the tax  is\r\npaid.  See Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36,    144.  If a  refund is\r                    \r\ndenied, CFI can seek judicial review in the state superior court,\r\nsee id. at   151, and any refund obtained would include interest,\r                 \r\nsee id. at    186.   This remedy is sufficiently  \"plain, speedy,\r                 \r\nand efficient\" to satisfy  the second condition of the  TIA.  See\r                                                                           \r\nCalifornia v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 413-15 (1982).\r                                             \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nforth  the standard  that  guides  our  analysis of  this  issue.\r\n\nThere, after surveying the case law, we stated that:\r\n\n          [Courts]  have  sketched  a spectrum  with  a\r\n          paradigmatic   tax   at   one   end   and   a\r\n          paradigmatic  fee at the  other.  The classic\r\n          \"tax\" is imposed by  a legislature upon many,\r\n          or  all,   citizens.     It   raises   money,\r\n          contributed to a general  fund, and spent for\r\n          the benefit  of the  entire  community.   The\r\n          classic \"regulatory  fee\"  is imposed  by  an\r\n          agency  upon those subject to its regulation.\r\n          It may serve regulatory purposes directly by,\r\n          for   example,    deliberately   discouraging\r\n          particular   conduct   by   making  it   more\r\n          expensive.   Or  it may  serve such  purposes\r\n          indirectly  by,  for  example, raising  money\r\n          placed in  a special fund to  help defray the\r\n          agency's regulation-related expenses.\r\n\n          Courts facing cases that  lie near the middle\r\n          of  this  spectrum  have  tended  .  .  .  to\r\n          emphasize the revenue's ultimate  use, asking\r\n          whether  it provides a general benefit to the\r\n          public, of a sort often financed by a general\r\n          tax,  or  whether  it  provides  more  narrow\r\n          benefits  to  regulated companies  or defrays\r\n          [an] agency's cost of regulation.\r\n\nId.   at  685   (citations  omitted).     This   formulation  for\r             \r\n\ndistinguishing taxes from fees  has found favor with a  number of\r\n\nother appellate  courts.  See,  e.g., Bidart Bros.  v.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nVarrasso  v. Varrasso,  37 F.3d  760, 763 (1st  Cir. 1994).

The fact\r                                                       \r\n\nthat  the  milk  handling  surcharge was  imposed  by  the  state\r\n\nlegislature rather than by an administrative agency suggests that\r\n\nit is a tax rather than a fee.  See Bidart Bros., 73 F.3d at 931;\r                                                          \r\n\nSan Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d  at 685.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nTravelers Ins., 14  F.3d at 713;  San Juan Cellular, 967  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n685.\r\n\n          There is  more.  The  fact that the  responsibility for\r\n\nadministering  the statute is assigned to  the State Tax Assessor\r\n\ncuts  in  the  same direction.    So  too  does  the  fact  that,\r\n\nthroughout the body of the 1995 Act, the legislature consistently\r\n\nrefers to its milk surcharge as a tax.  See, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat.\r                                                           \r\n\nAnn. tit. 36,   4772 (caption);  id. at   4772(1) (describing the\r                                              \r\n\nsurcharge as  \"[a]n excise  tax\"); id. at    4772(2)  (discussing\r                                                \r\n\n\"[t]he rate of  the tax  levied\"); id. at    4772(3)  (discussing\r                                                \r\n\n\"[c]alculation  of   tax\").

This is  a relevant factor\r\n\nin deciding  the \"tax versus fee\"  question.  See Chicago  &amp; N.W.\r                                                                           \r\n\nTransp.

Still, we\r                                              \r\n\nrecognize that the inverted structure of the surcharge furthers a\r\n\nregulatory purpose   to ensure  stable (if elevated) milk pricing\r\n\n   and thus  pulls the  other  way.   Finally,  the surcharge  is\r\n\nimposed only on handlers of milk, not on all citizens (or even on\r\n\nall  businesses); in this aspect, the  surcharge more resembles a\r\n\nfee.   See Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d  at 6; San Juan Cellular, 967\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 685.\r\n\n          As  we indicated in San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685,\r                                                         \r\n\nthe characterization of a  governmental assessment as a tax  or a\r\n\nfee is  rarely a choice  between black and  white.   Many imposts\r\n\nfall into the gray area in the center of  the spectrum.  So it is\r\n\nhere.  While the question is  close, we believe that Maine's milk\r\n\nhandling  surcharge falls nearer to  the tax end  of the spectrum\r\n\nthan to  the fee end.   As San  Juan Cellular suggests,  the most\r                                                       \r\n\nsalient factor in  the decisional mix concerns the destination of\r\n\nthe  revenues raised by  the impost    and here, the  revenues go\r\n\ninto  Maine's general fund.   Although this element  alone is not\r\n\nalways decisive, it is particularly important where, as here, the\r\n\nstated purpose of the impost is to garner revenue.  See Hager, 84\r                                                                       \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nF.3d at 870-71.   In the circumstances of  this case, this factor\r\n\nis  sufficient to outweigh the few straws  in the wind that point\r\n\nin the opposite direction.\r\n\n          CFI  attempts  to  derail  this  result  by  using  its\r\n\n\"merits\"  argument as a jurisdictional  foil.  It  tells us that,\r\n\ndespite the  legislature's declaration,  the purpose of  the milk\r\n\nhandling  surcharge  is  not  to augment  general  revenues,  but\r\n\ninstead \"to impose an exaction, akin to a regulatory fee, for the\r\n\nsole benefit of  Maine dairy farmers.\"   In order  to reach  this\r\n\nconclusion, however,  we would  have  to view  the milk  handling\r\n\nsurcharge in conjunction with the  later subsidies to Maine dairy\r\n\nfarmers  as a  single, integrated  scheme, and  we would  have to\r\n\ndisregard  the Maine  legislature's statement  of purpose.   This\r\n\nextraordinary  step  might  be  appropriate on  the  merits  in a\r                                    \r\n\nCommerce  Clause case.  See  West Lynn Creamery,  512 U.S. at 201\r                                                         \r\n\n(\"Our  Commerce Clause  jurisprudence is  not so  rigid as  to be\r\n\ncontrolled  by the  form  by which  a  State erects  barriers  to\r\n\ncommerce.\").    But  there  is  neither  any  precedent  nor  any\r\n\nplausible jurisprudential  basis for analyzing  separate tax  and\r\n\nsubsidy statutes as  an integrated unit under  the Tax Injunction\r\n\nAct.   Moreover,  the need  for doing  so, while arguable  in the\r\n\nCommerce Clause context, is  chimerical in the TIA context:   the\r\n\nrisk is infinitesimal that a  state legislature will contrive  an\r\n\ningenious  scheme  in  order to  deny  lower  federal  courts the\r\n\njurisdiction  to  adjudicate  the  legality  of state  exactions.\r\n\nSince aggrieved taxpayers may  raise all their claims in  a state\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nforum, subject to  eventual review by  the United States  Supreme\r\n\nCourt, the game obviously would not be worth the candle.\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r                                            \r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          We  can go no further.  The Commerce Clause question is\r\n\nfor  the Maine  state  courts (and,  perhaps,  the United  States\r\n\nSupreme  Court)  to  decide.   Because  the  TIA  deprives us  of\r\n\njurisdiction to  determine the constitutionality of  Maine's milk\r\n\nhandling surcharge, the judgment of the district court is vacated\r\n\nand  the case  is remanded  with instructions  to enter  an order\r\n\ndismissing the  action  without prejudice  to  appropriate  state\r\n\nproceedings.\r\n\nVacated and remanded with instructions.

(\"CFI\"), a Massachusetts-based processor and distributor of milk, operates a chain of convenience stores throughout the northeastern states.  In this case, it asserts that a milk handling surcharge imposed by the State of Maine violates the Commerce Clause.  The defendants are state officials, sued as such (collectively, \"Maine\" or \"the State\").  In their view, the milk handling surcharge is indistinguishable for Commerce Clause purposes from a sales tax and does not discriminate against interstate commerce either on its face or in its purpose and effect. Because the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (1994), deprives the federal courts (other than the Supreme Court) of jurisdiction to decide the merits of this difficult (and interesting) question, we vacate the judgment below and remand with instructions to dismiss the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our tale begins with the Maine Dairy Farm Stabilization Act (\"the DFS Act\"), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167;&#167; 4541-4547 (repealed 1995).  The DFS Act had two components.  On the one hand, it imposed a tax on packaged fluid milk sold in Maine (whether produced in or out of state).  On the other hand, it provided a rebate of the funds so collected to in-state dairy farmers.  The first handler in Maine bore the obligation of collecting and paying the tax, regardless of whether such first handler was a wholesaler or a retailer selling milk packaged out of state.  See id. at 4543(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax imposed by the DFS Act had an unusual structure, better suited to price maintenance than to revenue augmentation.  The amount of the tax varied between 0cents and 5cents per quart of milk and increased as the \"basic price\" of milk fell below the target price of $16.00 per hundredweight (later changed to $16.50 per hundredweight).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See id. at &#167; 4543(2).  The statute directed the State Treasurer to segregate the proceeds from this tax and distribute 94% of the funds so collected to in-state dairy farmers in proportion to their milk production.  See id. at &#167; 4544(2)(A).  This tax-and-subsidy scheme enabled in-state milk producers to receive the target price for their milk come what may--first, they received the basic price from their customers, and then they received the difference between the target price and the basic price as a rebate from the State--and thus shielded them from out-of-state competition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court threw a monkey wrench into the gears of the DFS Act when it decided West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 114 S.Ct. 2205, 129 L.Ed.2d 157 (1994).  In that case, the Court addressed a Massachusetts pricing order which was tailored to serve substantially the same ends as the DFS Act.  The order imposed an assessment on fluid milk sold by Massachusetts retailers and directed distribution of the amounts collected to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  See id. at 190-91, 114 S.Ct. at 2209-10.   Finding that the order's purpose and effect were \"to enable higher cost Massachusetts dairy farmers to compete with lower cost dairy farmers in other States,\" the Court declared the arrangement \"clearly unconstitutional.\"  Id. at 194, 114 S.Ct. at 2211-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aftermath of West Lynn Creamery, we considered CFI's constitutional challenge to the DFS Act.  Finding no significant constitutional distinction between that Act and the Massachusetts law invalidated in West Lynn Creamery, we struck down Maine's scheme.  See Cumberland Farms, Inc. v. LaFaver, 33 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam) (Cumberland I ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine legislature responded with remarkable alacrity.  In January of 1995, it enacted \"An Act to Continue the Fee on the Handling of Milk,\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167;&#167; 4771-4773 (\"the 1995 Act\").

The 1995 Act assesses a surcharge on milk handlers that is nearly identical to that previously mandated by the DFS Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but directs that the revenues generated are to be deposited into Maine's general fund.

The state legislature began systematically to ensure continued subsidization of Maine's dairy farmers.  As part of three successive omnibus spending bills for state government, the legislature appropriated to in-state milk producers $1,500,000 for the period March 1995 to June 1996, $4,050,000 for the period July to September 1996, and $3,150,000 for the period July 1996 to June 1997.  See 1995 Me.  Laws ch. 5, &#167; A-1;  id. at ch. 368, &#167; B-1;  id. at ch. 665, &#167; KK-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CFI believed that this legislative patchwork was a thinly-veiled contrivance aimed at circumventing the decision in Cumberland I and that the new legislation, taken in its entirety, shared the same constitutional infirmity which led to the demise of the DFS Act.  Consequently, it brought suit in the federal district court seeking injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief.  In due season, the district court rejected CFI's plaint.  Although the court believed that the state legislature, in passing the 1995 legislative package (that is, the 1995 Act and the ensuing appropriation bills), \"intended to circumvent the Court's decision in West Lynn Creamery by simply pulling apart the two components of the [DFS] Act,\" it nonetheless felt compelled to unwrap the package and analyze each piece of legislation separately.  Cumberland Farms, Inc. v. Mahany, 943 F.Supp. 83, 87 (D.Me.1996).  The court concluded that, when examined independently, both the revenue-raising and spending bills passed muster under the Commerce Clause.  See id. at 88-90.   Accordingly, it granted summary judgment in Maine's favor.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and thus must take pains to act only within the margins of that jurisdiction.  See National Ass'n of Social Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 628 n. 6 (1st Cir.1995).  Here, Maine interposes the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (\"the TIA\"), as a defense to CFI's suit.  Although Maine did not raise this point below, the TIA's commands are jurisdictional in nature and are not subject to waiver.  See Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1992).  Thus, we start--and finish--our analysis by discussing this facet of the State's defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TIA provides in relevant part that \"[t]he district courts shall not enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.  In one respect, the TIA sweeps more broadly than the letter of its text suggests.  As authoritatively construed, the TIA forbids not only injunctive relief, but also declaratory and monetary relief.  See National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 515 U.S. 582, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2351, 2354, 132 L.Ed.2d 509 (1995).  Hence, the TIA, if it applies in this instance, is a complete bar to maintaining the instant action in a federal forum.  We turn, then, to the question of its applicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two conditions must be satisfied before the TIA will deprive a federal court of jurisdiction:  first, the challenged impost must constitute a tax;  and second, the State must furnish an adequate alternative to a federal-court remedy.  Here, we are concerned only with the first condition, for CFI does not dispute that Maine affords a plain, speedy, and efficient anodyne to persons putatively aggrieved by the operation of the 1995 Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether, for purposes of the TIA, Maine's milk handling surcharge is a tax (which would defeat the exercise of federal jurisdiction) or a fee (which would allow the exercise of federal jurisdiction).  In San Juan Cellular Tel. Co. v. Public Serv.  Comm'n, 967 F.2d 683 (1st Cir.1992), we set forth the standard that guides our analysis of this issue.  There, after surveying the case law, we stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[Courts] have sketched a spectrum with a paradigmatic tax at one end and a paradigmatic fee at the other.  The classic \"tax\" is imposed by a legislature upon many, or all, citizens.  It raises money, contributed to a general fund, and spent for the benefit of the entire community.  The classic \"regulatory fee\" is imposed by an agency upon those subject to its regulation.  It may serve regulatory purposes directly by, for example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by making it more expensive.  Or it may serve such purposes indirectly by, for example, raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency's regulation-related expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Courts facing cases that lie near the middle of this spectrum have tended ... to emphasize the revenue's ultimate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a general tax, or whether it provides more narrow benefits to regulated companies or defrays [an] agency's cost of regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 685 (citations omitted).  This formulation for distinguishing taxes from fees has found favor with a number of other appellate courts.  See, e.g., Bidart Bros. v. California Apple Comm'n, 73 F.3d 925, 930 (9th Cir.1996);  Hager v. City of W. Peoria, 84 F.3d 865, 870 (7th Cir.1996);  Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, 14 F.3d 708, 713 (2d Cir.1994).  We adhere to it today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The classification of an impost for purposes of the TIA--\"tax\" versus \"fee\"--presents a question of law appropriate for resolution on a properly developed summary judgment record.  See In re Varrasso, 37 F.3d 760, 763 (1st Cir.1994).  Our task, then, is to apply the San Juan Cellular standard.  The fact that the milk handling surcharge was imposed by the state legislature rather than by an administrative agency suggests that it is a tax rather than a fee.  See Bidart Bros., 73 F.3d at 931;  San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.   The fact that the revenues raised from the surcharge go into Maine's general fund and are thus spent for the benefit of the citizenry as a whole also favors a finding that the milk handling surcharge is a tax.  See Travelers Ins., 14 F.3d at 713;  San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is more.  The fact that the responsibility for administering the statute is assigned to the State Tax Assessor cuts in the same direction.  So too does the fact that, throughout the body of the 1995 Act, the legislature consistently refers to its milk surcharge as a tax.  See, e.g., Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167; 4772 (caption);  id. at &#167; 4772(1) (describing the surcharge as \"[a]n excise tax\");  id. at &#167; 4772(2) (discussing \"[t]he rate of the tax levied\");  id. at &#167; 4772(3) (discussing \"[c]alculation of tax\").  Although such labels are not conclusive, see Keleher v. New Eng.  Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 947 F.2d 547, 549 (2d Cir.1991), they are entitled to some weight in the calculus of characterization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that the surcharge's stated purpose is tax-like;  in enacting it, the state legislature described it as a means of raising general revenues.  This is a relevant factor in deciding the \"tax versus fee\" question.  See Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co. v. Webster County Bd. of Supervisors, 71 F.3d 265, 267 (8th Cir.1995);  Travelers Ins., 14 F.3d at 713.   Still, we recognize that the inverted structure of the surcharge furthers a regulatory purpose--to ensure stable (if elevated) milk pricing--and thus pulls the other way.  Finally, the surcharge is imposed only on handlers of milk, not on all citizens (or even on all businesses);  in this aspect, the surcharge more resembles a fee.  See Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 6;  San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we indicated in San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685, the characterization of a governmental assessment as a tax or a fee is rarely a choice between black and white.  Many imposts fall into the gray area in the center of the spectrum.  So it is here.  While the question is close, we believe that Maine's milk handling surcharge falls nearer to the tax end of the spectrum than to the fee end.  As San Juan Cellular suggests, the most salient factor in the decisional mix concerns the destination of the revenues raised by the impost--and here, the revenues go into Maine's general fund.  Although this element alone is not always decisive, it is particularly important where, as here, the stated purpose of the impost is to garner revenue.  See Hager, 84 F.3d at 870-71.   In the circumstances of this case, this factor is sufficient to outweigh the few straws in the wind that point in the opposite direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CFI attempts to derail this result by using its \"merits\" argument as a jurisdictional foil.  It tells us that, despite the legislature's declaration, the purpose of the milk handling surcharge is not to augment general revenues, but instead \"to impose an exaction, akin to a regulatory fee, for the sole benefit of Maine dairy farmers.\"   In order to reach this conclusion, however, we would have to view the milk handling surcharge in conjunction with the later subsidies to Maine dairy farmers as a single, integrated scheme, and we would have to disregard the Maine legislature's statement of purpose.  This extraordinary step might be appropriate on the merits in a Commerce Clause case.  See West Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 201, 114 S.Ct. at 2215 (\"Our Commerce Clause jurisprudence is not so rigid as to be controlled by the form by which a State erects barriers to commerce.\").  But there is neither any precedent nor any plausible jurisprudential basis for analyzing separate tax and subsidy statutes as an integrated unit under the Tax Injunction Act.  Moreover, the need for doing so, while arguable in the Commerce Clause context, is chimerical in the TIA context:  the risk is infinitesimal that a state legislature will contrive an ingenious scheme in order to deny lower federal courts the jurisdiction to adjudicate the legality of state exactions.  Since aggrieved taxpayers may raise all their claims in a state forum, subject to eventual review by the United States Supreme Court, the game obviously would not be worth the candle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can go no further.  The Commerce Clause question is for the Maine state courts (and, perhaps, the United States Supreme Court) to decide.  Because the TIA deprives us of jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of Maine's milk handling surcharge, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions to enter an order dismissing the action without prejudice to appropriate state proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded with instructions.

See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &#167; 2954.  The Maine Milk Commission sets the basic price of milk, which is the minimum price that must be paid by milk dealers in Maine (other than those who are federally regulated) to Maine dairy farmers.  The basic price is geared to the price of milk established for the Boston zone under the New England Federal Milk Marketing Order No. 1.See 7 C.F.R. &#167; 1001 et seq.  (1997).  The DFS Act provided that when the basic price was $16.00 or more per hundredweight (cwt), a handler paid no tax.  When the basic price was $15.50 to $15.99 per cwt, the handler paid a tax of 1cents per quart.  When the basic price was $15.00 to $15.49 per cwt, the tax rose to 2cents per quart, and so on.  Since there are about 46.5 quarts of milk per cwt, this mechanism tended to guarantee price stability by keeping the sum of the basic price plus the tax in the vicinity of $16.00 per cwt</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The 1995 Act imposes a surcharge that ranges between 0cents and 6cents per quart of milk.  When the basic price is $16.50 per cwt or more, there is no charge.  When the basic price is $16.00 to $16.49 per cwt, the charge is 1cents per quart.  This pattern continues until the basic price drops below $14.00 per cwt, at which point the maximum surcharge (6cents per quart) is achieved.  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167; 4772(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In all events, CFI could not mount a credible challenge on this point.  Under Maine law, CFI can apply for a refund of any monies due pursuant to the 1995 Act within three years from the time a return is filed or two years from the time the tax is paid.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167; 144.  If a refund is denied, CFI can seek judicial review in the state superior court, see id. at &#167; 151, and any refund obtained would include interest, see id. at &#167; 186.  This remedy is sufficiently \"plain, speedy, and efficient\" to satisfy the second condition of the TIA.  See California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 413-15, 102 S.Ct. 2498, 2510-12, 73 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The weight is reduced in this instance because the Maine legislature, although using the word \"tax\" roughly three dozen times in the body of the statute and not using the word \"fee\" at all, described the legislation, in the Emergency Preamble, as \"An Act to Continue the Fee on the Handling of Milk.\"  See 1995 Me.

(\"CFI\"), a Massachusetts-based processor and distributor of milk, operates a chain of convenience stores throughout the northeastern states.  In this case, it asserts that a milk handling surcharge imposed by the State of Maine violates the Commerce Clause.  The defendants are state officials, sued as such (collectively, \"Maine\" or \"the State\").  In their view, the milk handling surcharge is indistinguishable for Commerce Clause purposes from a sales tax and does not discriminate against interstate commerce either on its face or in its purpose and effect. Because the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (1994), deprives the federal courts (other than the Supreme Court) of jurisdiction to decide the merits of this difficult (and interesting) question, we vacate the judgment below and remand with instructions to dismiss the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our tale begins with the Maine Dairy Farm Stabilization Act (\"the DFS Act\"), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167;&#167; 4541-4547 (repealed 1995).  The DFS Act had two components.  On the one hand, it imposed a tax on packaged fluid milk sold in Maine (whether produced in or out of state).  On the other hand, it provided a rebate of the funds so collected to in-state dairy farmers.  The first handler in Maine bore the obligation of collecting and paying the tax, regardless of whether such first handler was a wholesaler or a retailer selling milk packaged out of state.  See id. at 4543(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax imposed by the DFS Act had an unusual structure, better suited to price maintenance than to revenue augmentation.  The amount of the tax varied between 0cents and 5cents per quart of milk and increased as the \"basic price\" of milk fell below the target price of $16.00 per hundredweight (later changed to $16.50 per hundredweight).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See id. at &#167; 4543(2).  The statute directed the State Treasurer to segregate the proceeds from this tax and distribute 94% of the funds so collected to in-state dairy farmers in proportion to their milk production.  See id. at &#167; 4544(2)(A).  This tax-and-subsidy scheme enabled in-state milk producers to receive the target price for their milk come what may--first, they received the basic price from their customers, and then they received the difference between the target price and the basic price as a rebate from the State--and thus shielded them from out-of-state competition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court threw a monkey wrench into the gears of the DFS Act when it decided West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.

In that case, the Court addressed a Massachusetts pricing order which was tailored to serve substantially the same ends as the DFS Act.  The order imposed an assessment on fluid milk sold by Massachusetts retailers and directed distribution of the amounts collected to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  See id. at 190-91, 114 S.Ct. at 2209-10.   Finding that the order's purpose and effect were \"to enable higher cost Massachusetts dairy farmers to compete with lower cost dairy farmers in other States,\" the Court declared the arrangement \"clearly unconstitutional.\"  Id. at 194, 114 S.Ct. at 2211-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aftermath of West Lynn Creamery, we considered CFI's constitutional challenge to the DFS Act.

The preamble to the legislation recited that \"the State and its citizens are experiencing economic difficulties and significant fiscal problems\" such that \"revenues are necessary to the State's ability to address such difficulties and problems.\"   1995 Me.  Laws ch. 2, Emergency Preamble.  The 1995 Act assesses a surcharge on milk handlers that is nearly identical to that previously mandated by the DFS Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but directs that the revenues generated are to be deposited into Maine's general fund.

The state legislature began systematically to ensure continued subsidization of Maine's dairy farmers.  As part of three successive omnibus spending bills for state government, the legislature appropriated to in-state milk producers $1,500,000 for the period March 1995 to June 1996, $4,050,000 for the period July to September 1996, and $3,150,000 for the period July 1996 to June 1997.  See 1995 Me.

Consequently, it brought suit in the federal district court seeking injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief.  In due season, the district court rejected CFI's plaint.  Although the court believed that the state legislature, in passing the 1995 legislative package (that is, the 1995 Act and the ensuing appropriation bills), \"intended to circumvent the Court's decision in West Lynn Creamery by simply pulling apart the two components of the [DFS] Act,\" it nonetheless felt compelled to unwrap the package and analyze each piece of legislation separately.

The court concluded that, when examined independently, both the revenue-raising and spending bills passed muster under the Commerce Clause.  See id. at 88-90.   Accordingly, it granted summary judgment in Maine's favor.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and thus must take pains to act only within the margins of that jurisdiction.  See National Ass'n of Social Workers v. Harwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707518\"><a href=\"/opinion/707518/national-association-of-social-workers-v-john-b-harwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 628 n. 6 (1st Cir.1995).  Here, Maine interposes the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (\"the TIA\"), as a defense to CFI's suit.  Although Maine did not raise this point below, the TIA's commands are jurisdictional in nature and are not subject to waiver.  See Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592212\"><a href=\"/opinion/592212/trailer-marine-transport-corp-v-carmen-m-rivera-vazquez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1992).  Thus, we start--and finish--our analysis by discussing this facet of the State's defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TIA provides in relevant part that \"[t]he district courts shall not enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.  In one respect, the TIA sweeps more broadly than the letter of its text suggests.  As authoritatively construed, the TIA forbids not only injunctive relief, but also declaratory and monetary relief.  See National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117961\"><a href=\"/opinion/117961/national-private-truck-council-inc-v-oklahoma-tax-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117961\"><a href=\"/opinion/117961/national-private-truck-council-inc-v-oklahoma-tax-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2351</span></a></span>, 2354, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117961\"><a href=\"/opinion/117961/national-private-truck-council-inc-v-oklahoma-tax-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span> (1995).  Hence, the TIA, if it applies in this instance, is a complete bar to maintaining the instant action in a federal forum.  We turn, then, to the question of its applicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two conditions must be satisfied before the TIA will deprive a federal court of jurisdiction:  first, the challenged impost must constitute a tax;  and second, the State must furnish an adequate alternative to a federal-court remedy.  Here, we are concerned only with the first condition, for CFI does not dispute that Maine affords a plain, speedy, and efficient anodyne to persons putatively aggrieved by the operation of the 1995 Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether, for purposes of the TIA, Maine's milk handling surcharge is a tax (which would defeat the exercise of federal jurisdiction) or a fee (which would allow the exercise of federal jurisdiction).  In San Juan Cellular Tel. Co. v. Public Serv.  Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585778\"><a href=\"/opinion/585778/san-juan-cellular-telephone-company-etc-v-public-service-commission-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992), we set forth the standard that guides our analysis of this issue.  There, after surveying the case law, we stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[Courts] have sketched a spectrum with a paradigmatic tax at one end and a paradigmatic fee at the other.  The classic \"tax\" is imposed by a legislature upon many, or all, citizens.  It raises money, contributed to a general fund, and spent for the benefit of the entire community.  The classic \"regulatory fee\" is imposed by an agency upon those subject to its regulation.  It may serve regulatory purposes directly by, for example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by making it more expensive.  Or it may serve such purposes indirectly by, for example, raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency's regulation-related expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Courts facing cases that lie near the middle of this spectrum have tended ... to emphasize the revenue's ultimate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a general tax, or whether it provides more narrow benefits to regulated companies or defrays [an] agency's cost of regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 685 (citations omitted).  This formulation for distinguishing taxes from fees has found favor with a number of other appellate courts.  See, e.g., Bidart Bros. v. California Apple Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710937\"><a href=\"/opinion/710937/bidart-brothers-a-california-corporation-v-the-california-apple/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span>, 930 (9th Cir.1996);  Hager v. City of W. Peoria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718642\"><a href=\"/opinion/718642/donald-j-hager-dba-hager-performance-tire-specialists-and-albert-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>, 870 (7th Cir.1996);  Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661453\"><a href=\"/opinion/661453/the-travelers-insurance-company-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 713 (2d Cir.1994).  We adhere to it today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The classification of an impost for purposes of the TIA--\"tax\" versus \"fee\"--presents a question of law appropriate for resolution on a properly developed summary judgment record.  See In re Varrasso, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195673\"><a href=\"/opinion/195673/varrasso-v-desmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, 763 (1st Cir.1994).  Our task, then, is to apply the San Juan Cellular standard.  The fact that the milk handling surcharge was imposed by the state legislature rather than by an administrative agency suggests that it is a tax rather than a fee.  See Bidart Bros., 73 F.3d at 931;  San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.   The fact that the revenues raised from the surcharge go into Maine's general fund and are thus spent for the benefit of the citizenry as a whole also favors a finding that the milk handling surcharge is a tax.  See Travelers Ins., 14 F.3d at 713;  San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is more.  The fact that the responsibility for administering the statute is assigned to the State Tax Assessor cuts in the same direction.  So too does the fact that, throughout the body of the 1995 Act, the legislature consistently refers to its milk surcharge as a tax.  See, e.g., Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167; 4772 (caption);  id. at &#167; 4772(1) (describing the surcharge as \"[a]n excise tax\");  id. at &#167; 4772(2) (discussing \"[t]he rate of the tax levied\");  id. at &#167; 4772(3) (discussing \"[c]alculation of tax\").  Although such labels are not conclusive, see Keleher v. New Eng.  Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570485\"><a href=\"/opinion/570485/brendan-s-keleher-treasurer-of-the-city-of-burlington-vermont-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 549 (2d Cir.1991), they are entitled to some weight in the calculus of characterization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that the surcharge's stated purpose is tax-like;  in enacting it, the state legislature described it as a means of raising general revenues.  This is a relevant factor in deciding the \"tax versus fee\" question.  See Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co. v. Webster County Bd. of Supervisors, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709065\"><a href=\"/opinion/709065/no-95-1969/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 267 (8th Cir.1995);  Travelers Ins., 14 F.3d at 713.   Still, we recognize that the inverted structure of the surcharge furthers a regulatory purpose--to ensure stable (if elevated) milk pricing--and thus pulls the other way.  Finally, the surcharge is imposed only on handlers of milk, not on all citizens (or even on all businesses);  in this aspect, the surcharge more resembles a fee.  See Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 6;  San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we indicated in San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685, the characterization of a governmental assessment as a tax or a fee is rarely a choice between black and white.  Many imposts fall into the gray area in the center of the spectrum.  So it is here.  While the question is close, we believe that Maine's milk handling surcharge falls nearer to the tax end of the spectrum than to the fee end.  As San Juan Cellular suggests, the most salient factor in the decisional mix concerns the destination of the revenues raised by the impost--and here, the revenues go into Maine's general fund.  Although this element alone is not always decisive, it is particularly important where, as here, the stated purpose of the impost is to garner revenue.  See Hager, 84 F.3d at 870-71.   In the circumstances of this case, this factor is sufficient to outweigh the few straws in the wind that point in the opposite direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CFI attempts to derail this result by using its \"merits\" argument as a jurisdictional foil.  It tells us that, despite the legislature's declaration, the purpose of the milk handling surcharge is not to augment general revenues, but instead \"to impose an exaction, akin to a regulatory fee, for the sole benefit of Maine dairy farmers.\"   In order to reach this conclusion, however, we would have to view the milk handling surcharge in conjunction with the later subsidies to Maine dairy farmers as a single, integrated scheme, and we would have to disregard the Maine legislature's statement of purpose.  This extraordinary step might be appropriate on the merits in a Commerce Clause case.  See West Lynn Creamery, 512 U.S. at 201, 114 S.Ct. at 2215 (\"Our Commerce Clause jurisprudence is not so rigid as to be controlled by the form by which a State erects barriers to commerce.\").  But there is neither any precedent nor any plausible jurisprudential basis for analyzing separate tax and subsidy statutes as an integrated unit under the Tax Injunction Act.  Moreover, the need for doing so, while arguable in the Commerce Clause context, is chimerical in the TIA context:  the risk is infinitesimal that a state legislature will contrive an ingenious scheme in order to deny lower federal courts the jurisdiction to adjudicate the legality of state exactions.  Since aggrieved taxpayers may raise all their claims in a state forum, subject to eventual review by the United States Supreme Court, the game obviously would not be worth the candle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can go no further.  The Commerce Clause question is for the Maine state courts (and, perhaps, the United States Supreme Court) to decide.  Because the TIA deprives us of jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of Maine's milk handling surcharge, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions to enter an order dismissing the action without prejudice to appropriate state proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded with instructions.  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this context, \"basic price\" is a term of art.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &#167; 2954.  The Maine Milk Commission sets the basic price of milk, which is the minimum price that must be paid by milk dealers in Maine (other than those who are federally regulated) to Maine dairy farmers.  The basic price is geared to the price of milk established for the Boston zone under the New England Federal Milk Marketing Order No. 1.See 7 C.F.R. &#167; 1001 et seq.  (1997).  The DFS Act provided that when the basic price was $16.00 or more per hundredweight (cwt), a handler paid no tax.  When the basic price was $15.50 to $15.99 per cwt, the handler paid a tax of 1cents per quart.  When the basic price was $15.00 to $15.49 per cwt, the tax rose to 2cents per quart, and so on.  Since there are about 46.5 quarts of milk per cwt, this mechanism tended to guarantee price stability by keeping the sum of the basic price plus the tax in the vicinity of $16.00 per cwt</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The 1995 Act imposes a surcharge that ranges between 0cents and 6cents per quart of milk.  When the basic price is $16.50 per cwt or more, there is no charge.  When the basic price is $16.00 to $16.49 per cwt, the charge is 1cents per quart.  This pattern continues until the basic price drops below $14.00 per cwt, at which point the maximum surcharge (6cents per quart) is achieved.  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167; 4772(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In all events, CFI could not mount a credible challenge on this point.  Under Maine law, CFI can apply for a refund of any monies due pursuant to the 1995 Act within three years from the time a return is filed or two years from the time the tax is paid.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &#167; 144.  If a refund is denied, CFI can seek judicial review in the state superior court, see id. at &#167; 151, and any refund obtained would include interest, see id. at &#167; 186.  This remedy is sufficiently \"plain, speedy, and efficient\" to satisfy the second condition of the TIA.  See California v. Grace Brethren Church, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110749\"><a href=\"/opinion/110749/california-v-grace-brethren-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 413-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110749\"><a href=\"/opinion/110749/california-v-grace-brethren-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
