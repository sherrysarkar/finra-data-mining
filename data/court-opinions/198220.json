Suarez for appellants.\r\n\n   Enrique Peral, with whom Muoz, Boneta, Gonzalez, Arbona, Benitez\r\n&amp; Peral were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\n                                       \r\n\n                    December 1, 1998\r\n\n                          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.  In these consolidated cases, two\r\nPuerto Rico corporations, Ceramica Europa II, Inc. and Ceramica\r\nEuropa Hato Rey, Inc. (collectively \"defendants\"), appeal from\r\nthe denial of their motions to set aside default judgments\r\nunder Rules 55(c) and 60(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure.    We affirm, finding no abuse of discretion in the\r\ncourt's denial of the Rule 55(c) motion and no error in the\r\ncourt's denial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motions.\r\n   In the spring of 1996, Sea-Land Service, Inc. and\r\nTAG/ICIB Services, Inc. (collectively \"Sea-Land\") filed two\r\nsuits against the defendants seeking to recover freight charges\r\n(the \"freight case\") and demurrage charges (the \"demurrage\r\ncase\").  Professional process servers hired by Sea-Land first\r\nattempted to deliver summons to Marco Barbarossa, the president\r\nof both defendant corporations, at his place of business.  When\r\nthat proved unsuccessful, the servers examined records filed\r\nwith the Puerto Rico Department of State and determined that\r\nthe resident agent for both corporations was Barbarossa's wife,\r\nMyrna Ortiz.  They then served Myrna Ortiz at her home on July\r\n19, 1996.  \r\n   On August 23, 1996, after default had been entered in\r\nboth cases, the defendants moved to quash the summons, arguing\r\nthat service was improper because the summons had been left at\r\nBarbarossa's home rather than delivered personally to him.    On\r\nSeptember 17, 1996, the defendants made the same argument in a\r\nRule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a default judgment that had\r\nbeen entered in the demurrage case.  The court found the\r\naffidavits of the process servers to be worthy of credence and\r\ndenied the motions to quash and the Rule 60(b)(4) motion.  On\r\nJanuary 3, 1997, after default judgment had also been entered\r\nin the freight case, the defendants filed two additional Rule\r\n60(b)(4) motions, this time arguing in both the freight and\r\ndemurrage cases that Ortiz was not served and that in any case\r\nOrtiz was not the resident agent for one of the corporations,\r\nCeramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc.  The district court, addressing\r\nonly the first argument, rejected the motions because it found\r\nthe affidavits of the process servers to be more believable\r\nthan Ortiz's sworn statement.  The defendants did not appeal\r\nfrom that order.\r\n     In August and September 1997, the defendants attempted\r\nonce again to have the default judgments set aside.  They filed\r\na motion under Rule 55(c) to set aside the default judgment in\r\nthe freight case because Sea-Land had failed to provide notice\r\nof its application for a default judgment.  Ceramica Europa\r\nHato Rey, Inc. also filed motions under Rule 60(b)(4) in both\r\ncases, arguing once again that it had not been properly served\r\nbecause Ortiz was not its resident agent.  The district court\r\ndenied both the Rule 55(c) motion and the Rule 60(b)(4) motions\r\non various grounds, and this appeal ensued.\r\n     We address first the denial of the defendants' motion\r\nunder Rule 55(c).  District courts enjoy broad discretion in\r\ndeciding motions to set aside a judgment under this rule, seeUnited States v. One Urban Lot Located at 1 Street A-1,\r\nValparaiso, Bayamon, Puerto Rico, 885 F.2d 994, 997 (1st Cir.\r\n1989), and we review such rulings only for abuse of discretion, \r\nsee Key Bank of Maine v. Tablecloth Textile Co., 74 F.3d 349,\r\n352 (1st Cir. 1996).  We find no abuse of discretion here.  The\r\ndistrict court acknowledged that the defendants did not receive\r\nthe notice required by Rule 55(b)(2),   but concluded that there\r\nwas nonetheless no \"good cause\" to set aside the judgment under\r\nRule 55(c).     The purpose of the notice requirement in Rule\r\n55(b)(2) is to permit a party to show cause for its failure to\r\ntimely appear.  Since the defendants had already tried, and\r\nfailed, to effectively explain their failure to timely appear\r\nin their earlier motion to set aside the judgment, it would\r\nhave been senseless for the court to vacate the default\r\njudgment in order to give the defendants yet another\r\nopportunity.  The court's refusal to engage in such a fruitless\r\nexercise can hardly be considered an abuse of discretion.\r\n   Our review of the denial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motions\r\nproceeds along slightly different lines.  Normally the decision\r\nto grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion lies within the discretion\r\nof the district court, and review is for abuse of discretion\r\nonly.  See Cotto v. United States, 993 F.2d 274, 277 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).  However, the First Circuit has held that the district\r\ncourt does not have discretion to deny a Rule 60(b)(4) motion\r\nif the challenged judgment was void for lack of personal\r\njurisdiction.  See Echevarria-Gonzalez v. Gonzalez-Chapel, 849\r\nF.2d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"If the judgment is void, the\r\ndistrict court has no discretion but to set aside the entry of\r\ndefault judgment.\").  This suggests that denial of such a\r\nmotion should be given de novo review.  Although the First\r\nCircuit has not expressly adopted this standard of review for\r\nthe denial of Rule 60(b)(4) motions, a number of other circuits\r\nhave.  See Carter v. Fenner, 136 F.3d 1000, 1005 (5th Cir.\r\n1998), petition for cert. filed, 67 U.S.L.W. 3271 (U.S. July\r\n21, 1998) (No. 98-571) (adopting de novo standard); Wilmer v.\r\nBoard of County Comm'rs, 69 F.3d 406, 409 (10th Cir. 1995)\r\n(same); United States v. Indoor Cultivation Equip. from High\r\nTech Indoor Garden Supply, 55 F.3d 1311, 1317 (7th Cir. 1995)\r\n(same); Export Group v. Reef Industries, Inc., 54 F.3d 1466,\r\n1469 (9th Cir. 1995) (same); Page v. Schweiker, 786 F.2d 150,\r\n152 (3rd Cir. 1986) (same).  Because the parties did not\r\naddress the question of standard of review, we will not decide\r\nthe question here.  Rather, we will assume arguendo that the\r\nstricter de novo standard applies, while noting that our\r\naffirmance under that standard necessarily entails that there\r\nwas no abuse of discretion. \r\n   As an initial matter, our precedent establishes that\r\nRule 60(b)(4) motions cannot be denied on the procedural ground\r\nthat they were not brought within a \"reasonable time\" as\r\nrequired under Rule 60(b).  Although the language of Rule 60(b)\r\nliterally applies even to motions alleging lack of personal\r\njurisdiction, this court has held that motions to set aside a\r\njudgment for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 60(b)(4)\r\nmay be made at any time.  See United States v. Boch Oldsmobile,\r\nInc., 909 F.2d 657, 661 (1st Cir. 1990); Precision Etchings &amp;\r\nFindings, Inc. v. LGP Gem, Ltd., 953 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir.\r\n1992). See generally 11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice\r\n&amp; Procedure  2862, 2866 (1995) (explaining exception).  Thus,\r\nthe defendant's unreasonable delay in bringing the instant Rule\r\n60(b)(4) motions nearly one year after the entry of default\r\njudgments and nearly nine months after filing the second set of\r\nRule 60(b) motions does not alone provide a basis for denial.   \r\n   This delay does, though, lend support to the district\r\ncourt's rejection on the merits of the claim that Ortiz was not\r\nthe resident agent for one of the two defendant corporations. \r\nIf Ortiz were truly not the resident agent for Ceramica Europa\r\nHato Rey, Inc., it was reasonable to think the defendant would\r\nhave made this argument in its motions to quash the summons and\r\nin its first Rule 60(b) motion.  It appears in any event that\r\nSea-Land properly served both defendants under Section 12.01 of\r\nthe Puerto Rico Corporations Law of 1995, P. R. Laws Ann. Tit.\r\n14, Section 3126, which permits service of process on\r\ncorporations by leaving copies of the summons and complaint at\r\nthe dwelling of any officer, director, or registered agent of\r\nthe corporation -- in this case, the dwelling of the president\r\nof both corporations, Marco Barbarossa.  Thus, we find that the\r\ncourt correctly denied the Rule 60(b)(4) motions because\r\nCeramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc. was properly served under\r\neither, or both, Rule 4(h)(1) and Rule 4(e)(1).\r\n   But even if service were not proper, we would affirm\r\nfor a separate reason: the fact that the defendant had already\r\nraised this issue in the second set of Rule 60(b)(4) motions\r\n(filed January 3, 1997) and did not appeal the denial.  It is\r\nwell settled that Rule 60(b) motions may not be used as a\r\nsubstitute for timely appeal.  See Cotto, 993 F.2d at 278.  The\r\nsame principle applies here: if Ceramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc.\r\nwished to challenge the district court's rejection of (or the\r\ncourt's failure to consider) the argument that Ortiz was not\r\nits resident agent, it should have appealed the denial of the\r\nmotions in which it first made those arguments.  Having chosen\r\nnot to appeal (or even to move for reconsideration), it cannot\r\nexpect to be able to reopen this issue in a successive Rule\r\n60(b) motion.\r\n   Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",

(collectively \"defendants\"), appeal from the denial of their motions to set aside default judgments under Rules 55(c) and 60(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We affirm, finding no abuse of discretion in the court's denial of the Rule 55(c) motion and no error in the court's denial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1996, Sea-Land Service, Inc. and TAG/ICIB Services, Inc.  (collectively \"Sea-Land\") filed two suits against the defendants seeking to recover freight charges (the \"freight case\") and demurrage charges (the \"demurrage case\").  Professional process servers hired by Sea-Land first attempted to deliver summons to Marco Barbarossa, the president of both defendant corporations, at his place of business.  When that proved unsuccessful, the servers examined records filed with the Puerto Rico Department of State and determined that the resident agent for both corporations was Barbarossa's wife, Myrna Ortiz.  They then served Myrna Ortiz at her home on July 19, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 23, 1996, after default had been entered in both cases, the defendants moved to quash the summons, arguing that service was improper because the summons had been left at Barbarossa's home rather than delivered personally to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On September 17, 1996, the defendants made the same argument in a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a default judgment that had been entered in the demurrage case.  The court found the affidavits of the process servers to be worthy of credence and denied the motions to quash and the Rule 60(b)(4) motion.  On January 3, 1997, after default judgment had also been entered in the freight case, the defendants filed two additional Rule 60(b)(4) motions, this time arguing in both the freight and demurrage cases that Ortiz was not served and that in any case Ortiz was not the resident agent for one of the corporations, Ceramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc. The district court, addressing only the first argument, rejected the motions because it found the affidavits of the process servers to be more believable than Ortiz's sworn statement.  The defendants did not appeal from that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August and September 1997, the defendants attempted once again to have the default judgments set aside.  They filed a motion under Rule 55(c) to set aside the default judgment in the freight case because Sea-Land had failed to provide notice of its application for a default judgment.  Ceramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc. also filed motions under Rule 60(b)(4) in both cases, arguing once again that it had not been properly served because Ortiz was not its resident agent.  The district court denied both the Rule 55(c) motion and the Rule 60(b)(4) motions on various grounds, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first the denial of the defendants' motion under Rule 55(c).  District courts enjoy broad discretion in deciding motions to set aside a judgment under this rule, see United States v. One Urban Lot Located at 1 Street A-1, Valparaiso, Bayamon, Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529716\"><a href=\"/opinion/529716/united-states-v-one-urban-lot-located-at-1-street-a-1-valparaiso/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 997 (1st Cir.1989), and we review such rulings only for abuse of discretion, see Key Bank of Maine v. Tablecloth Textile Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196538\"><a href=\"/opinion/196538/key-bank-of-me-v-tablecloth-textile/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.1996).  We find no abuse of discretion here.  The district court acknowledged that the defendants did not receive the notice required by Rule 55(b)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> but concluded that there was nonetheless no \"good cause\" to set aside the judgment under Rule 55(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The purpose of the notice requirement in Rule 55(b)(2) is to permit a party to show cause for its failure to timely appear.  Since the defendants had already tried, and failed, to effectively explain their failure to timely appear in their earlier motion to set aside the judgment, it would have been senseless for the court to vacate the default judgment in order to give the defendants yet another opportunity.  The court's refusal to engage in such a fruitless exercise can hardly be considered an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the denial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motions proceeds along slightly different lines.  Normally the decision to grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion lies within the discretion of the district court, and review is for abuse of discretion only.  See Cotto v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606662\"><a href=\"/opinion/606662/evelyn-cotto-and-edwin-torres-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 277 (1st Cir.1993).  However, the First Circuit has held that the district court does not have discretion to deny a Rule 60(b)(4) motion if the challenged judgment was void for lack of personal jurisdiction.  See Echevarria-Gonzalez v. Gonzalez-Chapel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507353\"><a href=\"/opinion/507353/aurelio-echevarria-gonzalez-v-antonio-gonzalez-chapel-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1988) (\"If the judgment is void, the district court has no discretion but to set aside the entry of default judgment.\").  This suggests that denial of such a motion should be given de novo review.  Although the First Circuit has not expressly adopted this standard of review for the denial of Rule 60(b)(4) motions, a number of other circuits have.  See Carter v. Fenner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751706\"><a href=\"/opinion/751706/nicole-marie-carter-as-administratrix-of-and-the-estate-of-vergil-braud/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1005 (5th Cir.1998), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the parties did not address the question of standard of review, we will not decide the question here.  Rather, we will assume arguendo that the stricter de novo standard applies, while noting that our affirmance under that standard necessarily entails that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, our precedent establishes that Rule 60(b)(4) motions cannot be denied on the procedural ground that they were not brought within a \"reasonable time\" as required under Rule 60(b).  Although the language of Rule 60(b) literally applies even to motions alleging lack of personal jurisdiction, this court has held that motions to set aside a judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 60(b)(4) may be made at any time.  See United States v. Boch Oldsmobile, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545488\"><a href=\"/opinion/545488/united-states-v-boch-oldsmobile-inc-boch-toyota-inc-and-ernest-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span>, 661 (1st Cir.1990);  Precision Etchings &amp; Findings, Inc. v. LGP Gem, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575212\"><a href=\"/opinion/575212/precision-etchings-findings-inc-v-lgp-gem-ltd-maurice-c-feiger/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1992).  See generally 11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167;&#167; 2862, 2866 (1995) (explaining exception).  Thus, the defendant's unreasonable delay in bringing the instant Rule 60(b)(4) motions nearly one year after the entry of default judgments and nearly nine months after filing the second set of Rule 60(b) motions does not alone provide a basis for denial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This delay does, though, lend support to the district court's rejection on the merits of the claim that Ortiz was not the resident agent for one of the two defendant corporations.  If Ortiz were truly not the resident agent for Ceramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc., it was reasonable to think the defendant would have made this argument in its motions to quash the summons and in its first Rule 60(b) motion.  It appears in any event that Sea-Land properly served both defendants under Section 12.01 of the Puerto Rico Corporations Law of 1995, P.R. Laws Ann.  Tit. 14, Section 3126, which permits service of process on corporations by leaving copies of the summons and complaint at the dwelling of any officer, director, or registered agent of the corporation--in this case, the dwelling of the president of both corporations, Marco Barbarossa.  Thus, we find that the court correctly denied the Rule 60(b)(4) motions because Ceramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc. was properly served under either, or both, Rule 4(h)(1) and Rule 4(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if service were not proper, we would affirm for a separate reason:  the fact that the defendant had already raised this issue in the second set of Rule 60(b)(4) motions (filed January 3, 1997) and did not appeal the denial.  It is well settled that Rule 60(b) motions may not be used as a substitute for timely appeal.  See Cotto, 993 F.2d at 278.   The same principle applies here:  if Ceramica Europa Hato Rey, Inc. wished to challenge the district court's rejection of (or the court's failure to consider) the argument that Ortiz was not its resident agent, it should have appealed the denial of the motions in which it first made those arguments.  Having chosen not to appeal (or even to move for reconsideration), it cannot expect to be able to reopen this issue in a successive Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
