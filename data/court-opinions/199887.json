Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Eileen F. Shapiro, by Appointment of the Court, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nStephanie S. Browne, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Margaret E.\nCurran, United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 26, 2002\n\f       COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.           Appellant Aldrin Diaz seeks\n\nreversal of his conviction for being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).                He asserts that the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error by placing the burden on him\n\nto prove his defense of justification. He alternatively challenges\n\nthe district court's decision to depart upward from the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.       We find no plain error in the instruction, but detect\n\nflaws    in   the   sentencing     that    require   reconsideration         of   the\n\ndeparture.     We therefore affirm the conviction, vacate the term of\n\nimprisonment, and remand for re-sentencing.\n                             I. Factual Background\n\n       Although certain particulars of the episode underlying this\nappeal are disputed, the differences are largely irrelevant to the\nissues before us.        The essential facts, as the jury could have\n\nfound them, are as follows.         In the early morning hours of January\n28, 2000, appellant and his girlfriend, Christa Calder, dropped off\ntwo friends at a fast-food restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island,\n\nso they could use the restroom.             When appellant and Calder drove\nback to the restaurant a few minutes later, they found the two\nwomen, Brenda Ruiz and Jenny Vazquez, involved in a dispute with\n\ntwo other women in the restaurant's vestibule.                 Appellant stepped\nfrom the car and placed himself between the two pairs of women.\nRuiz    reached     around   him   and    struck   one   of    the   other   women,\n\nStephanie Zoglio, in the face.            Ruiz held a broken glass and also\nmay have possessed a pen with a concealed knife inside it.                   Zoglio\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fmay have possessed a box cutter, although appellant testified that\n\nhe never saw it.\n\n     Unsuccessful    in   his   efforts    to    separate   the   combatants,\nappellant moved back toward Calder's car.              Shortly thereafter,\n\nsomeone -- perhaps the fourth woman, Diana Villafane -- threw two\n\nobjects that hit the car's hood.1         At that point, appellant walked\nover to Villafane and shoved her, causing her to fall backward.             A\n\nfriend of Villafane's, Wayne Pemberton, responded by rushing at\n\nappellant. During the ensuing struggle, Pemberton pushed appellant\n\nonto the hood of Calder's car and fell onto the hood himself.\n\nAppellant rolled onto the ground and yelled to Calder for her gun.\n\nCalder retrieved the loaded gun from the car's glove compartment\n\nand handed it to him.      Appellant waved the gun at the crowd that\nhad gathered, yelling several times \"you better run.\"               Pemberton\n\nslipped behind a nearby truck, while making motions suggesting that\n\nhe, too, was reaching for a weapon, although he did not have one.\nCalder testified that the scene was chaotic, the noise level was\n\nloud, and both Ruiz and Vazquez had blood on them.\n\n     Appellant, Calder, and their two friends got back into the\n\ncar, with appellant at the wheel while holding the gun.2            Before he\n\ncould drive off, uniformed Providence police officers arrived and\n\ndirected appellant to drop the gun.             He tossed it onto Calder's\n\nlap, complied with the officers' instructions to get on the ground,\n\n\n     1\n         The objects apparently were a bottle and a barbell.\n     2\n       Appellant testified that he had cocked the gun after he saw\nPemberton reach for a weapon.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fand began crawling toward the police.              At about the same time,\n\nCornell Young, an off-duty police officer in plain clothes, emerged\n\nfrom the restaurant with his gun drawn.            The uniformed officers --\napparently not recognizing Young as a fellow officer -- also\n\nordered him to drop his weapon.        He was fatally shot when he failed\n\nto comply.\n      The gun wielded by appellant was purchased by Calder in Gray,\n\nMaine, in November 1999.       She testified that appellant had pointed\n\nthe gun at her during an argument in their apartment on January 26,\n\n2000 -- two days before the restaurant incident -- and also had\n\ntaken the gun to his mother's house on or about January 7.\n\n      At trial, appellant sought to justify his use of the weapon\n\nduring the fracas at the restaurant as an attempt to break up the\nescalating fight. He testified that he felt surrounded, dazed from\n\nhaving been punched in the face, and in fear for his life because\n\nhe thought he saw Pemberton reaching for a gun.           The district court\ncharged   the    jury   that   appellant     had    asserted   a   defense    of\n\njustification and that he was obliged to prove the defense by a\n\nfair preponderance of the evidence.          When discussing the issue at\n\nthe   charging   conference,     the    judge   specifically       referred   to\n\nconflicting precedent on whether the defendant or government bore\n\nthe burden of proof on the justification defense, concluding that\n\ncircuit and Supreme Court precedent required that affirmative\n\ndefenses be proven by the defendant.            Neither the government nor\n\ndefense counsel objected to the instruction, either at the charging\n\nconference or after the actual charge was given to the jury.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f     Appellant was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 120 months\n\nin prison.   The district court relied on three separate guidelines\n\nprovisions for a four-level departure in the base offense level,\nwhich represented an increase of at least thirty-three months in\n\nappellant's sentence.\n\n     On appeal, appellant first claims that the district court\nerred in placing the burden on him to prove justification.                He\n\nacknowledges   that,   having   failed   to   object   at   trial   to   the\n\ninstruction, he must demonstrate that the error was plain.           If he\n\nfails to meet this standard, he seeks review of his sentence,\n\nasserting that the district court had no legitimate basis to depart\n\nupward from the guidelines.     We address these issues in sequence.\n\n             II. Justification and the Burden of Proof\n\n     Appellant's effort to set aside his conviction based on the\n\ndistrict court's justification instruction is severely hampered by\n\nhis failure to interpose a contemporaneous objection. To vault the\nhigh hurdle imposed by the plain error standard, appellant must\n\ndemonstrate that an error occurred and that it was clear or\nobvious.   United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993); United\n\nStates v. Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d 242, 246 (lst Cir. 2001).3             To\n\nobtain relief from his conviction, therefore, appellant must show\n\nnot only that the justification instruction was incorrect but also\n\n\n\n     3\n       The four-part test also requires a showing that the error\naffected substantial rights and \"so seriously impaired the\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings as to\nthreaten a miscarriage of justice.\" Paniagua-Ramos, 252 F.3d at\n246.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthat it was obviously so.     The state of the law forecloses such a\n\nconclusion.\n\n     Three circuit courts have explicitly considered whether the\nprosecution or defense bears the burden of proof on a justification\n\ndefense to a felon-in-possession charge, and they have reached\n\ndifferent conclusions.      See United States v. Dodd, 225 F.3d 340,\n\n350 (3d Cir. 2000); United States v. Deleveaux, 205 F.3d 1292, 1300\n\n(11th Cir. 2000); United States v. Talbott, 78 F.3d 1183, 1186 (7th\n\nCir. 1996) (per curiam). The Third and Eleventh Circuits held that\n\nthe defendant must prove the defense by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, while the Seventh Circuit ruled that the government must\n\nnegate the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.            If a circuit\n\nconflict exists on a question, and the law is unsettled in the\ncircuit in which the appeal was taken, any error cannot be plain or\n\nobvious.   United States v. Gerrow, 232 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir.\n\n2000); see United States v. Gilberg, 75 F.3d 15, 21-22 (lst Cir.\n1996).\n\n     Appellant    asserts   that   this   sudden-death   principle   is\ninapplicable here because First Circuit law is settled in his\n\nfavor.   He invokes two decisions that involved a defense of duress\n\nto drug charges, United States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d 444, 448 (lst\n\nCir. 1996), and United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 291 (lst\n\nCir. 1992).      We held in Amparo that if the defendant produces\n\nsufficient evidence to warrant a duress instruction, the government\n\nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's criminal\n\nacts were not in fact the product of duress.     See 961 F.2d at 291.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fThe same result was reached in Arthurs, in reliance on Amparo.                See\n\n73 F.3d at 448.      Appellant cites, in addition, the First Circuit's\n\npattern jury instructions, which state that the government has the\nburden of disproving the defenses of self-defense and duress once\n\nthey have been properly raised.              First Circuit Pattern Criminal\n\nJury       Instructions   §§   5.04   and    5.05   (1998)    (\"First    Circuit\nInstructions\").\n\n       While these First Circuit authorities seem facially apropos to\n\nappellant's position, closer scrutiny reveals their shortcomings.\n\nThe    court    in   Amparo    explicitly     limited   its   holding    on   the\n\ngovernment's burden of disproving duress to those cases in which\n\n\"the charged crime requires mens rea,\" 961 F.2d at 291.                  In both\n\nAmparo and Arthurs, the defendants were charged, inter alia, with\n\"knowingly or intentionally\" possessing cocaine with the intent to\n\ndistribute it.       The pattern jury instructions reflect a similar\n\nlimitation; although some portions of the instructions express a\nbroader proposition,4 the Comment to the provision on \"Duress,\"\n\n§ 5.05, echoes the Amparo qualification that \"[t]he burden of\n\npersuasion remains with the government, at least if the charged\n\ncrime requires mens rea.\" This allocation of the burden is logical\n\n\n\n       4\n       For example, the           Introductory      Comment   on   the   section\ncovering defenses states:\n\n       Except for the insanity defense, the defendant need only\n       meet a burden of production, in which event the burden of\n       persuasion is on the prosecution to negate the defense\n       beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nFirst Circuit Instructions § 5, intro. cmt.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fin light of the government's obligation to prove all elements of a\n\ncrime, including the specified criminal intent.5\n\n     Whether Amparo's articulation of the burden extends to a case\nin which the only charge is possession of a firearm by a felon --\n\na strictly worded crime without a specific mens rea -- is at least\n\ndebatable in light of its qualifying language.      Indeed, were we to\nreach the merits, we think it problematic whether Amparo's holding\n\nwould survive in this different context.      We particularly note the\n\nthoughtful analyses of the Third and Eleventh circuits, which led\n\nthose courts to conclude that the burden to prove justification\n\nconstitutionally   and   pragmatically   is   properly   placed   on   the\n\ndefendant in a felon-in-possession case.        See Dodd, 225 F.3d at\n\n343-350; Deleveaux, 205 F.3d at 1298-1301.6      It strikes us as good\nsense to examine both the particular crime and the particular\n\ndefense at issue in assigning the burden of proof.        See Dodd, 225\n\nF.3d at 349 (noting the \"diversity of analytical solutions that the\nappellate courts have reached with respect to various affirmative\n\n     5\n       Indeed, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nrequires the government to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt any\ndefenses that negate an element of the charged offense. See\nPatterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210 (1977).\n     6\n       Both courts initially noted that there was no constitutional\nbar to placing the burden on the defendant. See Dodd, 225 F.3d at\n344; Deleveaux, 205 F.3d at 1298-99.        Both also pointed to\nCongress's intent to broadly prohibit possession of firearms by\nconvicted felons, see Dodd, 225 F.3d at 350; Deleveaux, 205 F.3d at\n1300, and they recognized that the defendant \"will usually be best-\nsituated to produce evidence relating to each element of this\naffirmative defense,\" Deleveaux, 205 F.3d at 1300 (quoted in Dodd,\n225 F.3d at 347, 350). The Third Circuit further observed that\nplacing the burden on the defendant was consistent with the common\nlaw, which placed the burden on the defendant to prove all\naffirmative defenses. See Dodd, 225 F.3d at 348.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fdefenses,\" and rejecting the argument that consistency required the\n\ncourt to follow entrapment precedents that place the burden on the\n\ngovernment).\n     We need delve no further into the merits of the issue.                      What\n\nwe have said thus far suffices to show that the law is unsettled,\n\nboth within    and      outside    the    First    Circuit,    and    appellant    is\ntherefore unable to meet the plain error standard.               Even if it were\n\nerror to place the burden of proving justification on appellant --\n\na   proposition    we     doubt    --     any   such   error    was     not   plain.\n\nConsequently, we affirm the judgment of conviction.\n\n                         III. Sentencing Departures\n\n     The district court invoked three provisions of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines to increase appellant's sentence from the term specified\nfor his base offense level and criminal history category -- a range\n\nof 70 to 87 months7 -- to the statutory maximum of 120 months.\n\nThis represented an upward departure of four levels.                  We review de\nnovo whether      the   district     court      utilized   a   proper    basis    for\n\ndeparture, United States v. Chapman, 241 F.3d 57, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2001),   but   apply      the     clear    error    standard    to    the     court's\n\ndetermination that the circumstances \"warrant[ed] the departure in\n\nthe case at hand,\" id.          The extent of the departure will be upheld\n\nas reasonable unless it reflects a manifest abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Amirault, 224 F.3d 9, 14 (lst Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n     7\n       This calculation included a separate two-level enhancement\nfor obstruction of justice, bringing appellant's base offense level\nto 20.\n\n                                          -9-\n\f      As we discuss below, the district court's erroneous reliance\n\non one basis for departure, combined with lack of advance notice of\n\nits   use    of   a   second   departure    provision   and   the   uncertain\nsufficiency of the third provision as the sole basis for the\n\ndeparture, requires that the case be remanded for re-sentencing.\n\nWe explain our conclusion by addressing each of the three relevant\nprovisions of the guidelines.\n\n      A. The Departure under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, p.s.\n\n      This provision allows a district court to depart from the\n\notherwise applicable sentencing range \"[i]f reliable information\n\nindicates that the criminal history category does not adequately\n\nreflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or\n\nthe likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes . . . .\"\nAppellant's criminal history score of 19 gave him six points more\n\nthan the threshold for Criminal History Category VI, the highest\n\ncategory in the guidelines.         In such a case, a court seeking to\nimpose a sentence appropriate for the defendant's record may depart\n\nfrom the guideline range by moving down the sentencing table to a\n\nhigher offense level. U.S.S.G § 4A1.3, p.s.; see Chapman, 241 F.3d\n\nat 63.      In other words, when the criminal history category cannot\n\nbe adjusted upward to account for a defendant's score because he\n\nalready is in the top category, a court \"may instead adjust upward\n\nthe offense level in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence.\"\n\nChapman, 241 F.3d at 63.         Based on this provision, the district\n\ncourt moved two levels from offense level 20 to offense level 22,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fwhich provided a sentencing range of 84 to 105 months, an increase\n\nof eighteen months at the maximum end of the range.\n\n      Appellant challenges this departure on two fronts.        First, he\ncontends that his criminal history was not sufficiently \"egregious\"\n\nto trigger § 4A1.3. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, p.s. (allowing departure\n\nin the case of \"an egregious, serious criminal record\").          Second,\nhe argues that he is entitled to a remand because he received no\n\nnotice that the district court intended to depart on this basis --\n\nwhich, as acknowledged by the government, was a violation of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 6A1.3(a), p.s. and Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1).        See Burns\n\nv. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 138-39 (1991); United States v.\n\nMartin, 221 F.3d 52, 55-56 (lst Cir. 2000).          He asserts that the\n\nomission was not harmless, as the lack of notice deprived him of\nthe   opportunity   to   fully   demonstrate   why   this   departure   was\n\nunwarranted.   He further argues that the record fails to show that\n\nthe court would have imposed a four-level upward departure even if\n§ 4A1.3 were not considered.\n\n      We need not evaluate the egregiousness of appellant's record\n\nbecause we find his notice argument to be dispositive.          The court\n\ndeparted a total of four levels based on three provisions.              Two\n\nlevels were attributed explicitly to § 4A1.3 -- the basis for which\n\nappellant received no notice.         The other departures were not\n\nassigned any particular increase; the court simply moved up to the\n\nstatutory maximum in reliance on the two additional provisions. To\n\nfind harmless error, as indeed the government argues, we would have\n\nto conclude that the court inevitably would have departed upward by\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\ffour levels based solely on those two other factors.           See Williams\n\nv.   United   States,   503   U.S.   193,   204   (1992)   (\"[A]   remand   is\n\nappropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as\na whole . . . that the error did not affect the district court's\n\nselection of the sentence imposed.\").8            One of those provisions,\n\nhowever, we find inapplicable.       See Section B infra.     We cannot say\nwith assurance, based on the factual circumstances, that the court\n\nwould have ordered the same upward departure in reliance solely on\n\nthe other.    See Section C infra.     Consequently, we must remand for\n\nre-sentencing.\n\n      B.   The Departure under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1\n\n      This provision, which governs firearms offenses, establishes\n\na range of penalties depending upon the particulars of the crime\nand the defendant's criminal background.          Application Note 16 to §\n\n2K2.1 states that an upward departure may be warranted in four\n\nalternative circumstances: (1) the number of firearms significantly\nexceeded fifty; (2) the offense involved multiple military assault\n\n      8\n       In United States v. Jackson, 32 F.3d 1101, 1110 (7th Cir.\n1994), the court noted that the harmless error doctrine in lack-of-\nnotice cases \"requires that we decide whether the same sentence\nwould have been imposed if the district court either: (1) had not\nrelied on the factor for which no notice was given, or (2) had\ngiven adequate notice.\" Appellant's criminal background was not so\nextensive or serious that we can say that the court certainly would\nhave imposed the departure, regardless of a fully prepared\nobjection from appellant. Cf. Chapman, 241 F.3d at 64 (thirty-six\ncriminal history points deemed \"extreme,\" along with immediate\nrecidivism and violent crimes); United States v. McKinley, 84 F.3d\n904, 910-11 (7th Cir. 1996) (forty points warranted departure);\nUnited States v. Carillo-Alvarez, 3 F.3d 316, 320-23 (9th Cir.\n1993) (nineteen points -- the same number as appellant --\ninsufficient to support departure). We thus must consider whether\nthe court would have imposed the same sentence without reliance on\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.3.\n\n                                     -12-\n\ftype weapons or similarly destructive guns and other devices; (3)\n\nthe offense involved large quantities of armor-piercing ammunition,\n\nor (4) \"the offense posed a substantial risk of death or bodily\ninjury to multiple individuals.\"   U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, cmt. n.16; see\n\ngenerally United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 952-53 (lst\n\nCir. 1995).\n     The district court concluded that a departure was appropriate\n\nunder the fourth clause of Note 16 because appellant \"had a firearm\n\ncocked and pointed, thus posing a substantial risk of death or\n\nbodily injury to a multitude of individuals who were out in front\n\nof that restaurant that night.\"    The judge noted that \"[j]ust a\n\nlittle action on the trigger would have caused the bullet to be\n\nejected toward a crowd of people and someone could have been\nkilled.\"\n\n     Appellant asserts that the district court improperly invoked\n\nApplication Note 16 for two reasons.   First, he contends that his\ncircumstances do not fit into the category of uniquely dangerous\n\nfirearms crimes covered by Note 16.      Each of the first three\n\nclauses reflects a concern about extraordinary threats to public\n\nsafety based on either the quantity or nature of the firearms at\n\nissue. The fourth clause, he maintains, reflects a similar concern\n\nthat is inapplicable to his brandishing of a single .22-caliber\n\npistol capable of firing only one bullet at a time.        Second,\n\nappellant argues that the threat posed by his display of the gun\n\nalready was taken into account in computing his sentence.       The\n\ncourt imposed a four-level upward adjustment in his offense level\n\n\n                               -13-\n\funder § 2K2.1(b)(5), which provides for such an increase when a\n\nfirearm was used or possessed in connection with another felony\n\noffense.    The district court explained the basis for this upward\nadjustment as follows:\n\n     He clearly possessed this firearm in connection with\n     another felony offense, in fact, multiple felony\n     offenses.   He assaulted a number of people with this\n     firearm by holding this crowd at bay with the firearm and\n     cocking the firearm ready to fire.        It's a wonder\n     somebody wasn't killed at that point.\n\nBecause    the   court's   expressed   rationale   for   the   four-level\n\nadjustment was essentially the same as his reason for imposing a\n\ndeparture under Note 16, appellant argues that the departure\n\nconstituted impermissible double-counting.\n     We are persuaded that the court's use of Note 16 as a basis\n\nfor departure was in error.      We agree with appellant that clause\n\nfour of the Note, when read in context with the three provisions\nthat precede it, is reasonably interpreted to authorize departure\n\nfor conduct that is dangerous to an extraordinary degree.             The\n\nother prerequisites of Note 16 -- firearms exceeding fifty in\n\nnumber, use of military assault type weapons, or large quantities\n\nof armor-piercing ammunition -- indicate to us an intent that the\n\nthreat to multiple individuals of death or bodily injury be more\n\nobvious and potent than the present record reveals.            Here, the\n\ncourt noted the crowd and observed that \"someone could have been\n\nkilled\" had defendant discharged the cocked weapon, but we conclude\n\nthat brandishing a single small weapon in a single episode, with no\n\nevidence of an intent to fire, is insufficient to support a\n\ndeparture aimed at punishing conduct that puts multiple individuals\n\n                                  -14-\n\fat substantial risk of injury or death.              By contrast, in Diaz-\n\nMartinez, 71 F.3d at 952-53, we affirmed a Note 16 departure where\n\nthe defendant had engaged in a shootout in a congested shopping\ncenter parking lot and had rammed his car into another vehicle.\n\nSurrounding vehicles were riddled with bullet holes.                    See also\n\nUnited States v. Brunet, 178 F. Supp. 2d 342, 344-45 (S.D.N.Y.),\naff'd, 275 F.3d 215 (2d Cir. 2001) (applying Note 16(4) where\n\nagents retrieved, inter alia, a block of explosives that could have\n\ndestroyed several buildings if detonated); United States v. Alers,\n\n852 F. Supp. 310, 314-16 (D.N.J.), aff'd, 40 F.3d 1241 (3d Cir.\n\n1994) (applying Note 16(4) where defendant caused more than 400\n\nguns to be distributed in the drug underworld).\n\n     Thus, even if the reckless brandishing of this type of loaded\nhandgun could in other circumstances support use of Note 16(4), the\n\nprovision's   applicability      to   a   limited    category     of    unusually\n\ndangerous firearms crimes renders it inapposite here.                    Although\nsome increase beyond the standard sentence for possession of a\n\nfirearm by a felon was warranted based on the risk posed by\n\nappellant's   reckless     conduct,       Note   16(4)     was   not    in    these\n\ncircumstances an available path to reach that result.                   The court\n\ntook advantage of an appropriate alternative when it imposed the\n\nfour-level adjustment under § 2K2.1(b)(5).               To notch it up again\n\npursuant to Note 16 would overstate the severity of appellant's\n\ncriminal activity by equating it with the extraordinarily dangerous\n\nconduct   reflected   in   the   other       subsections    of   Note   16.      We\n\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\ftherefore conclude that the departure under Note 16 of § 2K2.1 was\n\nimproper.\n\n       C. The Departure under § 5K2.1, p.s.\n\n       This   provision    of    the    guidelines    is     a   policy     statement\n\nproviding for an upward departure when death results from the\n\ndefendant's criminal activity. Among the factors to be considered\nin evaluating whether such a departure is warranted are (1) the\n\ndefendant's     state     of    mind,    (2)   the   degree       of     planning   or\n\npreparation, (3) whether multiple deaths resulted, and (4) the\n\nmeans by which life was taken.            U.S.S.G. § 5K2.1, p.s.\n\n       The district court found the provision applicable because\n\nappellant\n\n       set in motion a whole series of events which ultimately\n       led to the death of Officer Young. If he hadn't drawn\n       that pistol, if he hadn't brandished that firearm,\n       Officer Young would be alive today. The police officers\n       would not have drawn their weapons.      Officer Young\n       undoubtedly would not have drawn a weapon. This whole\n       tragedy would have been avoided. So there's a basis for\n       upward departure.\n\n       Appellant    argues      that     Officer     Young's       death     was    an\n\nunpredictable occurrence insufficiently related to his criminal\nconduct to justify prolonging his term of imprisonment.                      He notes\n\nthat none of the factors cited in the policy statement weigh toward\n\ndeparture -- not only was his offense conduct spontaneous, but it\n\nalso   was    unforeseeable      that    Officer     Young       would    neither   be\n\nrecognized by fellow officers nor respond to their command that he\n\ndrop his gun.      In sum, he argues, the circumstances do not warrant\n\npunishment based on the unfortunate, but completely chance, death\n\nof the officer.\n\n                                        -16-\n\f       Although we can agree that appellant's culpability is at the\n\nlow end of the spectrum contemplated by the policy statement, in\n\nthat he was an indirect cause of Officer Young's death, we are\nunable to conclude that he is outside its scope.                        By using a\n\nweapon,        appellant     invited   weapon    use   by   others.      Unintended\n\nconsequences are often the result of reckless behavior, and while\nhe could not have anticipated the particular sequence of events,\n\nappellant should have foreseen the possibility of serious harm as\n\na result of his waving a cocked and loaded gun at a crowd of\n\npeople.        We see no basis for foreclosing departure under § 5K2.1\n\nwhen a defendant puts into motion a chain of events that risks\n\nserious injury or death, even when an intent to harm is entirely\n\nabsent and the defendant was not directly responsible for the\ndeath. See United States v. Fortier, 242 F.3d 1224, 1232-33 (10th\n\nCir. 2001) (an increased sentence may be imposed for \"harms that\n\nwere       a   'reasonably    foreseeable'      consequence    of   a   defendant's\nconduct even where a defendant did not directly cause the specified\n\nharm\") (citation omitted).\n       Ameliorating factors may, of course, lead some trial judges to\n\nrefrain from a departure under § 5K2.1, and, in any event, such\n\nfactors should bear on the extent of the departure.                      Here, the\n\nevidence supports appellant's claim that he had no intent to use\n\nthe gun other than as a show of force designed to permit his and\n\nhis friends' escape from an escalating confrontation.9                    At about\n\n       9\n       Although the evidence was not entirely consistent, most of\nthe witnesses testified that appellant pointed the gun in the air\nwhen confronting the onlookers.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fthe time of the fatal shooting, appellant had released the weapon\n\nand was complying with law enforcement orders that he get down on\n\nthe   ground    and   move   toward    them.     The    death     itself   was   an\nunfortunate       tragedy     of      mis-identification.          Given     these\n\ncircumstances, we think it unlikely that the court would have\n\ndeparted upward four levels based solely on § 5K2.1.                       This is\nparticularly so because, as noted above, the risk of serious injury\n\nfrom appellant's conduct already was reflected in the four-level\n\nadjustment under § 2K2.1(b)(5).\n\n      The government suggests that the district court would have\n\nincreased      appellant's   sentence    to    the   statutory     maximum    even\n\nwithout reliance on the three separate departure provisions, citing\n\nthe judge's statement that he \"would depart upward beyond the\nstatutory maximum if I had that power.\"              At the time he made that\n\ncomment, however, the judge believed he had multiple grounds for\n\ndeparture.        Moreover,    the     statement       reflects     the    court's\nunderstandable frustration with appellant's allocution, in which\n\nappellant denied any responsibility for Officer Young's death and\n\nrepeatedly ignored the judge's and marshal's directives that he\n\nstop his rambling, offensive personal comments, which included\n\nreferences to the judge's son and brother.\n\n      The record therefore does not permit us to conclude that the\n\nlack of notice regarding § 4A1.3 and the error in applying Note 16\n\nof § 2K2.1 were harmless.          With the one valid ground of departure\n\nhaving limited force in the particular circumstances, the sentence\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\finevitably reflects reliance on the other two provisions. A remand\n\nfor re-sentencing is required.10\n\n                                IV. Conclusion\n\n      We affirm appellant's conviction, rejecting his claim that the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error by instructing the jury that\n\nhe bore the burden of proving that his firearm possession was\njustified.     The circuits are split on the burden of proving\n\njustification in a felon-in-possession case, and First Circuit law\n\non that particular question is unsettled.                   The case must be\n\nremanded to the district court for re-sentencing, however, because\n\ntwo   of   three   provisions    on   which   the   court    based   an   upward\n\ndeparture were utilized improperly.\n\n      The judgment of conviction is affirmed, the sentence is\n\nvacated, and the case is remanded for re-sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n        We note that the court's signed judgment states that the\n\"Total Offense Level\" is 20 and lists only Note 16 of § 2K2.1 and\n§ 5K2.1 as the bases for departure -- apparently omitting the two-\nlevel departure based on § 4A1.3, the provision for which appellant\nlacked notice. Neither appellant nor the government address the\nseeming discrepancy, and because both assume that the sentence\nreflected reliance on that provision, we do likewise.        In any\nevent, the lack of clarity further confirms the need for a remand.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f",

Browne, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Margaret E.

He asserts that the district court committed plain error by placing the burden on him to prove his defense of justification. He alternatively challenges the district court's decision to depart upward from the Sentencing Guidelines. We find no plain error in the instruction, but detect flaws in the sentencing that require reconsideration of the departure. We therefore affirm the conviction, vacate the term of imprisonment, and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although certain particulars of the episode underlying this appeal are disputed, the differences are largely irrelevant to the issues before us. The essential facts, as the jury could have found them, are as follows. In the early morning hours of January 28, 2000, appellant and his girl-friend, Christa Calder, dropped off two friends at a fast-food restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island, so they could use the restroom. When appellant and Calder drove back to the restaurant a few minutes later, they found the two women, Brenda Ruiz and Jenny Vazquez, involved in a dispute with two other women in the restaurant's vestibule. Appellant stepped from the car and placed himself between the two pairs of women. Ruiz reached around him and struck one of the other women, Stephanie Zoglio, in the face. Ruiz held a broken glass and also may have possessed a pen with a concealed knife inside it. Zoglio may have possessed a box cutter, although appellant testified that he never saw it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unsuccessful in his efforts to separate the combatants, appellant moved back toward Calder's car. Shortly thereafter, someone&#8212;perhaps the fourth woman, Diana Villafane&#8212;threw two objects that hit the car's hood.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At that point, appellant walked over to Villafane and shoved her, causing her to fall backward. A friend of Villafane's, Wayne Pemberton, responded by rushing at appellant. During the ensuing struggle, Pemberton pushed appellant onto the hood of Calder's car and fell onto the hood himself. Appellant rolled onto the ground and yelled to Calder for her gun. Calder retrieved the loaded gun from the car's glove compartment and handed it to him. Appellant waved the gun at the crowd that had gathered, yelling several times \"you better run.\" Pemberton slipped behind a nearby truck, while making motions suggesting that he, too, was reaching for a weapon, although he did not have one. Calder testified that the scene was chaotic, the noise level was loud, and both Ruiz and Vazquez had blood on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, Calder, and their two friends got back into the car, with appellant at the wheel while holding the gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Before he could drive off, uniformed Providence police officers arrived and directed appellant to drop the gun. He tossed it onto Calder's lap, complied with the officers' instructions to get on the ground, and began crawling toward the police. At about the same time, Cornell Young, an off-duty police officer in plain clothes, emerged from the restaurant with his gun drawn. The uniformed officers&#8212;apparently not recognizing Young as a fellow officer&#8212;also ordered him to drop his weapon. He was fatally shot when he failed to comply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gun wielded by appellant was purchased by Calder in Gray, Maine, in November 1999. She testified that appellant had pointed the gun at her during an argument in their apartment on January 26, 2000&#8212;two days before the restaurant incident&#8212;and also had taken the gun to his mother's house on or about January 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, appellant sought to justify his use of the weapon during the fracas at the restaurant as an attempt to break up the escalating fight. He testified that he felt surrounded, dazed from having been punched in the face, and in fear for his life because he thought he saw Pemberton reaching for a gun. The district court charged the jury that appellant had asserted a defense of justification and that he was obliged to prove the defense by a fair preponderance of the evidence. When discussing the issue at the charging conference, the judge specifically referred to conflicting precedent on whether the defendant or government bore the burden of proof on the justification defense, concluding that circuit and Supreme Court precedent required that affirmative defenses be proven by the defendant. Neither the government nor defense counsel objected to the instruction, either at the charging conference or after the actual charge was given to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 120 months in prison. The district court relied on three separate guidelines provisions for a four-level departure in the base offense level, which represented an increase of at least thirty-three months in appellant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant first claims that the district court erred in placing the burden on him to prove justification. He acknowledges that, having failed to object at trial to the instruction, he must demonstrate that the error was plain. If he fails to meet this standard, he seeks review of his sentence, asserting that the district court had no legitimate basis to depart upward from the guidelines. We address these issues in sequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Justification and the Burden of Proof</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's effort to set aside his conviction based on the district court's justification instruction is severely hampered by his failure to interpose a contemporaneous objection. To vault the high hurdle imposed by the plain error standard, appellant must demonstrate that an error occurred and that it was clear or obvious. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> To obtain relief from his conviction, therefore, appellant must show not only that the justification instruction was incorrect but also that it was obviously so. The state of the law forecloses such a conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three circuit courts have explicitly considered whether the prosecution or defense bears the burden of proof on a justification defense to a felon-in-possession charge, and they have reached different conclusions. <i>See United States v. Dodd,</i> 225 F.3d 340, 350 (3d Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d 1292, 1300 (11th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Talbott,</i> 78 F.3d 1183, 1186 (7th Cir.1996) (per curiam). The Third and Eleventh Circuits held that the defendant must prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence, while the Seventh Circuit ruled that the government must negate the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. If a circuit conflict exists on a question, and the law is unsettled in the circuit in which the appeal was taken, any error cannot be plain or obvious. <i>United States v. Gerrow,</i> 232 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir.2000); <i>see United States v. Gilberg,</i> 75 F.3d 15, 21-22 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that this sudden-death principle is inapplicable here because First Circuit law is settled in his favor. He invokes two decisions that involved a defense of duress to drug charges, <i>United States v. Arthurs,</i> 73 F.3d 444, 448 (1st Cir.1996), and <i>United States v. Amparo,</i> 961 F.2d 288, 291 (1st Cir.1992). We held in <i>Amparo</i> that if the defendant produces sufficient evidence to warrant a duress instruction, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's criminal acts were not in fact the product of duress. <i>See</i> 961 F.2d at 291. The same result was reached in <i>Arthurs,</i> in reliance on <i>Amparo. See</i> 73 F.3d at 448. Appellant cites, in addition, the First Circuit's pattern jury instructions, which state that the government has the burden of disproving the defenses of self-defense and duress once they have been properly raised. <i>First Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions</i> &#167;&#167; 5.04 and 5.05 (1998) (\"First Circuit Instructions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these First Circuit authorities seem facially apropos to appellant's position, closer scrutiny reveals their shortcomings. The court in <i>Amparo</i> explicitly limited its holding on the government's burden of disproving duress to those cases in which \"the charged crime requires <i>mens rea,\"</i> 961 F.2d at 291. In both <i>Amparo</i> and <i>Arthurs,</i> the defendants were charged, <i>inter alia,</i> with \"knowingly or intentionally\" possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute it. The pattern jury instructions reflect a similar limitation; although some portions of the instructions express a broader proposition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the Comment to the provision on \"Duress,\" &#167; 5.05, echoes the <i>Amparo</i> qualification that \"[t]he burden of persuasion remains with the government, at least if the charged crime requires <i>mens rea.\"</i> This allocation of the burden is logical in light of the government's obligation to prove all elements of a crime, including the specified criminal intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether <i>Amparo</i>'s articulation of the burden extends to a case in which the only charge is possession of a firearm by a felon&#8212;a strictly worded crime without a specific <i>mens rea</i>&#8212;is at least debatable in light of its qualifying language. Indeed, were we to reach the merits, we think it problematic whether <i>Amparo</i>'s holding would survive in this different context. We particularly note the thoughtful analyses of the Third and Eleventh circuits, which led those courts to conclude that the burden to prove justification constitutionally and pragmatically is properly placed on the defendant in a felon-in-possession case. <i>See Dodd,</i> 225 F.3d at 343-350; <i>Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1298-1301.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It strikes us as good sense to examine both the particular crime and the particular defense at issue in assigning the burden of proof. <i>See Dodd,</i> 225 F.3d at 349 (noting the \"diversity of analytical solutions that the appellate courts have reached with respect to various affirmative defenses,\" and rejecting the argument that consistency required the court to follow entrapment precedents that place the burden on the government).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need delve no further into the merits of the issue. What we have said thus far suffices to show that the law is unsettled, both within and outside the First Circuit, and appellant is therefore unable to meet the plain error standard. Even if it were error to place the burden of proving justification on appellant&#8212;a proposition we doubt&#8212;any such error was not plain. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Sentencing Departures</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court invoked three provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines to increase appellant's sentence from the term specified for his base offense level and criminal history category&#8212;a range of 70 to 87 months<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>&#8212;to the statutory maximum of 120 months. This represented an upward departure of four levels. We review de novo whether the district court utilized a proper basis for departure, <i>United States v. Chapman,</i> 241 F.3d 57, 63 (1st Cir.2001), but apply the clear error standard to the court's determination that the circumstances \"warrant[ed] the departure in the case at hand,\" <i>id.</i> The extent of the departure will be upheld as reasonable unless it reflects a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Amirault,</i> 224 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we discuss below, the district court's erroneous reliance on one basis for departure, combined with lack of advance notice of its use of a second departure provision and the uncertain sufficiency of the third provision as the sole basis for the departure, requires that the case be remanded for re-sentencing. We explain our conclusion by addressing each of the three relevant provisions of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision allows a district court to depart from the otherwise applicable sentencing range \"[i]f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes....\" Appellant's criminal history score of 19 gave him six points more than the threshold for Criminal History Category VI, the highest category in the guidelines. In such a case, a court seeking to impose a sentence appropriate for the defendant's record may depart from the guideline range by moving down the sentencing table to a higher offense level. U.S.S.G &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.; <i>see Chapman,</i> 241 F.3d at 63. In other words, when the criminal history category cannot be adjusted upward to account for a defendant's score because he already is in the top category, a court \"may instead adjust upward the offense level in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence.\" <i>Chapman,</i> 241 F.3d at 63. Based on this provision, the district court moved two levels from offense level 20 to offense level 22, which provided a sentencing range of 84 to 105 months, an increase of eighteen months at the maximum end of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges this departure on two fronts. First, he contends that his criminal history was not sufficiently \"egregious\" to trigger &#167; 4A1.3. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s. (allowing departure in the case of \"an egregious, serious criminal record\"). Second, he argues that he is entitled to a remand because he received no notice that the district court intended to depart on this basis&#8212;which, as acknowledged by the government, was a violation of U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a), p.s. and Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1). <i>See Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991); <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 221 F.3d 52, 55-56 (1st Cir.2000). He asserts that the omission was not harmless, as the lack of notice deprived him of the opportunity to fully demonstrate why this departure was unwarranted. He further argues that the record fails to show that the court would have imposed a four-level upward departure even if &#167; 4A1.3 were not considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not evaluate the egregiousness of appellant's record because we find his notice argument to be dispositive. The court departed a total of four levels based on three provisions. Two levels were attributed explicitly to &#167; 4A1.3&#8212;the basis for which appellant received no notice. The other departures were not assigned any particular increase; the court simply moved up to the statutory maximum in reliance on the two additional provisions. To find harmless error, as indeed the government argues, we would have to conclude that the court inevitably would have departed upward by four levels based solely on those two other factors. <i>See Williams v. United States,</i> 503 U.S. 193, 204, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (\"[A] remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole ... that the error did not affect the district court's selection of the sentence imposed.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> One of those provisions, however, we find inapplicable. <i>See</i> Section B <i>infra.</i> We cannot say with assurance, based on the factual circumstances, that the court would have ordered the same upward departure in reliance solely on the other. <i>See</i> Section C <i>infra.</i> Consequently, we must remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision, which governs firearms offenses, establishes a range of penalties depending upon the particulars of the crime and the defendant's criminal background. Application Note 16 to &#167; 2K2.1 states that an upward departure may be warranted in four alternative circumstances: (1) the number of firearms significantly exceeded fifty; (2) the offense involved multiple military assault type weapons or similarly destructive guns and other devices; (3) the offense involved large quantities of armor-piercing ammunition, or (4) \"the offense posed a substantial risk of death or bodily injury to multiple individuals.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1, <i>cmt.</i> n. 16; <i>see generally United States v. Diaz-Martinez,</i> 71 F.3d 946, 952-53 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that a departure was appropriate under the fourth clause of Note 16 because appellant \"had a firearm cocked and pointed, thus posing a substantial risk of death or bodily injury to a multitude of individuals who were out in front of that restaurant that night.\" The judge noted that \"[j]ust a little action on the trigger would have caused the bullet to be ejected toward a crowd of people and someone could have been killed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that the district court improperly invoked Application Note 16 for two reasons. First, he contends that his circumstances do not fit into the category of uniquely dangerous firearms crimes covered by Note 16. Each of the first three clauses reflects a concern about extraordinary threats to public safety based on either the quantity or nature of the firearms at issue. The fourth clause, he maintains, reflects a similar concern that is inapplicable to his brandishing of a single .22-caliber pistol capable of firing only one bullet at a time. Second, appellant argues that the threat posed by his display of the gun already was taken into account in computing his sentence. The court imposed a four-level upward adjustment in his offense level under &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5), which provides for such an increase when a firearm was used or possessed in connection with another felony offense. The district court explained the basis for this upward adjustment as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He clearly possessed this firearm in connection with another felony offense, in fact, multiple felony offenses. He assaulted a number of people with this firearm by holding this crowd at bay with the firearm and cocking the firearm ready to fire. It's a wonder somebody wasn't killed at that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court's expressed rationale for the four-level adjustment was essentially the same as his reason for imposing a departure under Note 16, appellant argues that the departure constituted impermissible double-counting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that the court's use of Note 16 as a basis for departure was in error. We agree with appellant that clause four of the Note, when read in context with the three provisions that precede it, is reasonably interpreted to authorize departure for conduct that is dangerous to an extraordinary degree. The other prerequisites of Note 16&#8212;firearms exceeding fifty in number, use of military assault type weapons, or large quantities of armor-piercing ammunition&#8212;indicate to us an intent that the threat to multiple individuals of death or bodily injury be more obvious and potent than the present record reveals. Here, the court noted the crowd and observed that \"someone could have been killed\" had defendant discharged the cocked weapon, but we conclude that brandishing a single small weapon in a single episode, with no evidence of an intent to fire, is insufficient to support a departure aimed at punishing conduct that puts multiple individuals at substantial risk of injury or death. By contrast, in <i>Diaz-Martinez,</i> 71 F.3d at 952-53, we affirmed a Note 16 departure where the defendant had engaged in a shootout in a congested shopping center parking lot and had rammed his car into another vehicle. Surrounding vehicles were riddled with bullet holes. <i>See also United States v. Brunet,</i> 178 F.Supp.2d 342, 344-45 (S.D.N.Y.), <i>aff'd,</i> 275 F.3d 215 (2d Cir.2001) (applying Note 16(4) where agents retrieved, <i>inter alia,</i> a block of explosives that could have destroyed several buildings if detonated); <i>United States v. Alers,</i> 852 F.Supp. 310, 314-16 (D.N.J.), <i>aff'd,</i> 40 F.3d 1241 (3d Cir.1994) (applying Note 16(4) where defendant caused more than 400 guns to be distributed in the drug underworld).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even if the reckless brandishing of this type of loaded handgun could in other circumstances support use of Note 16(4), the provision's applicability to a limited category of unusually dangerous firearms crimes renders it inapposite here. Although some increase beyond the standard sentence for possession of a firearm by a felon was warranted based on the risk posed by appellant's reckless conduct, Note 16(4) was not in these circumstances an available path to reach that result. The court took advantage of an appropriate alternative when it imposed the four-level adjustment under &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5). To notch it up again pursuant to Note 16 would overstate the severity of appellant's criminal activity by equating it with the extraordinarily dangerous conduct reflected in the other subsections of Note 16. We therefore conclude that the departure under Note 16 of &#167; 2K2.1 was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Departure under &#167; 5K2.1, p.s.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision of the guidelines is a policy statement providing for an upward departure when death results from the defendant's criminal activity. Among the factors to be considered in evaluating whether such a departure is warranted are (1) the defendant's state of mind, (2) the degree of planning or preparation, (3) whether multiple deaths resulted, and (4) the means by which life was taken. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.1, p.s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the provision applicable because appellant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">set in motion a whole series of events which ultimately led to the death of Officer Young. If he hadn't drawn that pistol, if he hadn't brandished that firearm, Officer Young would be alive today. The police officers would not have drawn their weapons. Officer Young undoubtedly would not have drawn a weapon. This whole tragedy would have been avoided. So there's a basis for upward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that Officer Young's death was an unpredictable occurrence insufficiently related to his criminal conduct to justify prolonging his term of imprisonment. He notes that none of the factors cited in the policy statement weigh toward departure &#8212; not only was his offense conduct spontaneous, but it also was unforeseeable that Officer Young would neither be recognized by fellow officers nor respond to their command that he drop his gun. In sum, he argues, the circumstances do not warrant punishment based on the unfortunate, but completely chance, death of the officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we can agree that appellant's culpability is at the low end of the spectrum contemplated by the policy statement, in that he was an indirect cause of Officer Young's death, we are unable to conclude that he is outside its scope. By using a weapon, appellant invited weapon use by others. Unintended consequences are often the result of reckless behavior, and while he could not have anticipated the particular sequence of events, appellant should have foreseen the possibility of serious harm as a result of his waving a cocked and loaded gun at a crowd of people. We see no basis for foreclosing departure under &#167; 5K2.1 when a defendant puts into motion a chain of events that risks serious injury or death, even when an intent to harm is entirely absent and the defendant was not directly responsible for the death. <i>See United States v. Fortier,</i> 242 F.3d 1224, 1232-33 (10th Cir.2001) (an increased sentence may be imposed for \"harms that were a `reasonably foreseeable' consequence of a defendant's conduct even where a defendant did not directly cause the specified harm\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ameliorating factors may, of course, lead some trial judges to refrain from a departure under &#167; 5K2.1, and, in any event, such factors should bear on the extent of the departure. Here, the evidence supports appellant's claim that he had no intent to use the gun other than as a show of force designed to permit his and his friends' escape from an escalating confrontation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> At about the time of the fatal shooting, appellant had released the weapon and was complying with law enforcement orders that he get down on the ground and move toward them. The death itself was an unfortunate tragedy of mis-identification. Given these circumstances, we think it unlikely that the court would have departed upward four levels based solely on &#167; 5K2.1. This is particularly so because, as noted above, the risk of serious injury from appellant's conduct already was reflected in the four-level adjustment under &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that the district court would have increased appellant's sentence to the statutory maximum even without reliance on the three separate departure provisions, citing the judge's statement that he \"would depart upward beyond the statutory maximum if I had that power.\" At the time he made that comment, however, the judge believed he had multiple grounds for departure. Moreover, the statement reflects the court's understandable frustration with appellant's allocution, in which appellant denied any responsibility for Officer Young's death and repeatedly ignored the judge's and marshal's directives that he stop his rambling, offensive personal comments, which included references to the judge's son and brother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record therefore does not permit us to conclude that the lack of notice regarding &#167; 4A1.3 and the error in applying Note 16 of &#167; 2K2.1 were harmless. With the one valid ground of departure having limited force in the particular circumstances, the sentence inevitably reflects reliance on the other two provisions. A remand for re-sentencing is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm appellant's conviction, rejecting his claim that the district court committed plain error by instructing the jury that he bore the burden of proving that his firearm possession was justified. The circuits are split on the burden of proving justification in a felon-in-possession case, and First Circuit law on that particular question is unsettled. The case must be remanded to the district court for re-sentencing, however, because two of three provisions on which the court based an upward departure were utilized improperly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment of conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for re-sentencing.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The objects apparently were a bottle and a barbell</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellant testified that he had cocked the gun after he saw Pemberton reach for a weapon</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The four-part test also requires a showing that the error affected substantial rights and \"so seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings as to threaten a miscarriage of justice.\"<i>Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d at 246.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For example, the Introductory Comment on the section covering defenses states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Except for the insanity defense, the defendant need only meet a burden of production, in which event the burden of persuasion is on the prosecution to negate the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First Circuit Instructions &#167; 5, intro. cmt.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the government to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt any defenses that negate an element of the charged offense<i>See Patterson v.

The Third Circuit further observed that placing the burden on the defendant was consistent with the common law, which placed the burden on the defendant to prove all affirmative defenses. <i>See Dodd,</i> 225 F.3d at 348.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> This calculation included a separate two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, bringing appellant's base offense level to 20</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In<i>United States v.

Chapman,</i> 241 F.3d at 64 (thirty-six criminal history points deemed \"extreme,\" along with immediate recidivism and violent crimes); <i>United States v. McKinley,</i> 84 F.3d 904, 910-11 (7th Cir.1996) (forty points warranted departure); <i>United States v.

We find no plain error in the instruction, but detect flaws in the sentencing that require reconsideration of the departure. We therefore affirm the conviction, vacate the term of imprisonment, and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although certain particulars of the episode underlying this appeal are disputed, the differences are largely irrelevant to the issues before us. The essential facts, as the jury could have found them, are as follows. In the early morning hours of January 28, 2000, appellant and his girl-friend, Christa Calder, dropped off two friends at a fast-food restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island, so they could use the restroom. When appellant and Calder drove back to the restaurant a few minutes later, they found the two women, Brenda Ruiz and Jenny Vazquez, involved in a dispute with two other women in the restaurant's vestibule. Appellant stepped from the car and placed himself between the two pairs of women. Ruiz reached around him and struck one of the other women, Stephanie Zoglio, in the face. Ruiz held a broken glass and also may have possessed a pen with a concealed knife inside it. Zoglio may have possessed a box cutter, although appellant testified that he never saw it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unsuccessful in his efforts to separate the combatants, appellant moved back toward Calder's car. Shortly thereafter, someone&#8212;perhaps the fourth woman, Diana Villafane&#8212;threw two objects that hit the car's hood.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At that point, appellant walked over to Villafane and shoved her, causing her to fall backward. A friend of Villafane's, Wayne Pemberton, responded by rushing at appellant. During the ensuing struggle, Pemberton pushed appellant onto the hood of Calder's car and fell onto the hood himself. Appellant rolled onto the ground and yelled to Calder for her gun. Calder retrieved the loaded gun from the car's glove compartment and handed it to him. Appellant waved the gun at the crowd that had gathered, yelling several times \"you better run.\" Pemberton slipped behind a nearby truck, while making motions suggesting that he, too, was reaching for a weapon, although he did not have one. Calder testified that the scene was chaotic, the noise level was loud, and both Ruiz and Vazquez had blood on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, Calder, and their two friends got back into the car, with appellant at the wheel while holding the gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Before he could drive off, uniformed Providence police officers arrived and directed appellant to drop the gun. He tossed it onto Calder's lap, complied with the officers' instructions to get on the ground, and began crawling toward the police. At about the same time, Cornell Young, an off-duty police officer in plain clothes, emerged from the restaurant with his gun drawn. The uniformed officers&#8212;apparently not recognizing Young as a fellow officer&#8212;also ordered him to drop his weapon. He was fatally shot when he failed to comply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gun wielded by appellant was purchased by Calder in Gray, Maine, in November 1999. She testified that appellant had pointed the gun at her during an argument in their apartment on January 26, 2000&#8212;two days before the restaurant incident&#8212;and also had taken the gun to his mother's house on or about January 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, appellant sought to justify his use of the weapon during the fracas at the restaurant as an attempt to break up the escalating fight. He testified that he felt surrounded, dazed from having been punched in the face, and in fear for his life because he thought he saw Pemberton reaching for a gun. The district court charged the jury that appellant had asserted a defense of justification and that he was obliged to prove the defense by a fair preponderance of the evidence. When discussing the issue at the charging conference, the judge specifically referred to conflicting precedent on whether the defendant or government bore the burden of proof on the justification defense, concluding that circuit and Supreme Court precedent required that affirmative defenses be proven by the defendant. Neither the government nor defense counsel objected to the instruction, either at the charging conference or after the actual charge was given to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 120 months in prison. The district court relied on three separate guidelines provisions for a four-level departure in the base offense level, which represented an increase of at least thirty-three months in appellant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant first claims that the district court erred in placing the burden on him to prove justification. He acknowledges that, having failed to object at trial to the instruction, he must demonstrate that the error was plain. If he fails to meet this standard, he seeks review of his sentence, asserting that the district court had no legitimate basis to depart upward from the guidelines. We address these issues in sequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Justification and the Burden of Proof</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's effort to set aside his conviction based on the district court's justification instruction is severely hampered by his failure to interpose a contemporaneous objection. To vault the high hurdle imposed by the plain error standard, appellant must demonstrate that an error occurred and that it was clear or obvious. <i>United States v.

He invokes two decisions that involved a defense of duress to drug charges, <i>United States v. Arthurs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196518\"><a href=\"/opinion/196518/united-states-v-arthurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 448 (1st Cir.1996), and <i>United States v.

We held in <i>Amparo</i> that if the defendant produces sufficient evidence to warrant a duress instruction, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's criminal acts were not in fact the product of duress. <i>See</i> 961 F.2d at 291. The same result was reached in <i>Arthurs,</i> in reliance on <i>Amparo. See</i> 73 F.3d at 448. Appellant cites, in addition, the First Circuit's pattern jury instructions, which state that the government has the burden of disproving the defenses of self-defense and duress once they have been properly raised. <i>First Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions</i> &#167;&#167; 5.04 and 5.05 (1998) (\"First Circuit Instructions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these First Circuit authorities seem facially apropos to appellant's position, closer scrutiny reveals their shortcomings. The court in <i>Amparo</i> explicitly limited its holding on the government's burden of disproving duress to those cases in which \"the charged crime requires <i>mens rea,\"</i> 961 F.2d at 291. In both <i>Amparo</i> and <i>Arthurs,</i> the defendants were charged, <i>inter alia,</i> with \"knowingly or intentionally\" possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute it. The pattern jury instructions reflect a similar limitation; although some portions of the instructions express a broader proposition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the Comment to the provision on \"Duress,\" &#167; 5.05, echoes the <i>Amparo</i> qualification that \"[t]he burden of persuasion remains with the government, at least if the charged crime requires <i>mens rea.\"</i> This allocation of the burden is logical in light of the government's obligation to prove all elements of a crime, including the specified criminal intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether <i>Amparo</i>'s articulation of the burden extends to a case in which the only charge is possession of a firearm by a felon&#8212;a strictly worded crime without a specific <i>mens rea</i>&#8212;is at least debatable in light of its qualifying language. Indeed, were we to reach the merits, we think it problematic whether <i>Amparo</i>'s holding would survive in this different context. We particularly note the thoughtful analyses of the Third and Eleventh circuits, which led those courts to conclude that the burden to prove justification constitutionally and pragmatically is properly placed on the defendant in a felon-in-possession case. <i>See Dodd,</i> 225 F.3d at 343-350; <i>Deleveaux,</i> 205 F.3d at 1298-1301.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It strikes us as good sense to examine both the particular crime and the particular defense at issue in assigning the burden of proof. <i>See Dodd,</i> 225 F.3d at 349 (noting the \"diversity of analytical solutions that the appellate courts have reached with respect to various affirmative defenses,\" and rejecting the argument that consistency required the court to follow entrapment precedents that place the burden on the government).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need delve no further into the merits of the issue. What we have said thus far suffices to show that the law is unsettled, both within and outside the First Circuit, and appellant is therefore unable to meet the plain error standard. Even if it were error to place the burden of proving justification on appellant&#8212;a proposition we doubt&#8212;any such error was not plain. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Sentencing Departures</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court invoked three provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines to increase appellant's sentence from the term specified for his base offense level and criminal history category&#8212;a range of 70 to 87 months<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>&#8212;to the statutory maximum of 120 months. This represented an upward departure of four levels. We review de novo whether the district court utilized a proper basis for departure, <i>United States v.

Amirault,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799753\"><a href=\"/opinion/799753/united-states-v-alan-lee-amirault/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we discuss below, the district court's erroneous reliance on one basis for departure, combined with lack of advance notice of its use of a second departure provision and the uncertain sufficiency of the third provision as the sole basis for the departure, requires that the case be remanded for re-sentencing. We explain our conclusion by addressing each of the three relevant provisions of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision allows a district court to depart from the otherwise applicable sentencing range \"[i]f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes....\" Appellant's criminal history score of 19 gave him six points more than the threshold for Criminal History Category VI, the highest category in the guidelines. In such a case, a court seeking to impose a sentence appropriate for the defendant's record may depart from the guideline range by moving down the sentencing table to a higher offense level. U.S.S.G &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.; <i>see Chapman,</i> 241 F.3d at 63. In other words, when the criminal history category cannot be adjusted upward to account for a defendant's score because he already is in the top category, a court \"may instead adjust upward the offense level in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence.\" <i>Chapman,</i> 241 F.3d at 63. Based on this provision, the district court moved two levels from offense level 20 to offense level 22, which provided a sentencing range of 84 to 105 months, an increase of eighteen months at the maximum end of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges this departure on two fronts. First, he contends that his criminal history was not sufficiently \"egregious\" to trigger &#167; 4A1.3. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s. (allowing departure in the case of \"an egregious, serious criminal record\"). Second, he argues that he is entitled to a remand because he received no notice that the district court intended to depart on this basis&#8212;which, as acknowledged by the government, was a violation of U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a), p.s. and Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1). <i>See Burns v.

He asserts that the omission was not harmless, as the lack of notice deprived him of the opportunity to fully demonstrate why this departure was unwarranted. He further argues that the record fails to show that the court would have imposed a four-level upward departure even if &#167; 4A1.3 were not considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not evaluate the egregiousness of appellant's record because we find his notice argument to be dispositive. The court departed a total of four levels based on three provisions. Two levels were attributed explicitly to &#167; 4A1.3&#8212;the basis for which appellant received no notice. The other departures were not assigned any particular increase; the court simply moved up to the statutory maximum in reliance on the two additional provisions. To find harmless error, as indeed the government argues, we would have to conclude that the court inevitably would have departed upward by four levels based solely on those two other factors. <i>See Williams v.

First, he contends that his circumstances do not fit into the category of uniquely dangerous firearms crimes covered by Note 16. Each of the first three clauses reflects a concern about extraordinary threats to public safety based on either the quantity or nature of the firearms at issue. The fourth clause, he maintains, reflects a similar concern that is inapplicable to his brandishing of a single .22-caliber pistol capable of firing only one bullet at a time. Second, appellant argues that the threat posed by his display of the gun already was taken into account in computing his sentence. The court imposed a four-level upward adjustment in his offense level under &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5), which provides for such an increase when a firearm was used or possessed in connection with another felony offense. The district court explained the basis for this upward adjustment as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He clearly possessed this firearm in connection with another felony offense, in fact, multiple felony offenses. He assaulted a number of people with this firearm by holding this crowd at bay with the firearm and cocking the firearm ready to fire. It's a wonder somebody wasn't killed at that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court's expressed rationale for the four-level adjustment was essentially the same as his reason for imposing a departure under Note 16, appellant argues that the departure constituted impermissible double-counting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that the court's use of Note 16 as a basis for departure was in error. We agree with appellant that clause four of the Note, when read in context with the three provisions that precede it, is reasonably interpreted to authorize departure for conduct that is dangerous to an extraordinary degree. The other prerequisites of Note 16&#8212;firearms exceeding fifty in number, use of military assault type weapons, or large quantities of armor-piercing ammunition&#8212;indicate to us an intent that the threat to multiple individuals of death or bodily injury be more obvious and potent than the present record reveals. Here, the court noted the crowd and observed that \"someone could have been killed\" had defendant discharged the cocked weapon, but we conclude that brandishing a single small weapon in a single episode, with no evidence of an intent to fire, is insufficient to support a departure aimed at punishing conduct that puts multiple individuals at substantial risk of injury or death. By contrast, in <i>Diaz-Martinez,</i> 71 F.3d at 952-53, we affirmed a Note 16 departure where the defendant had engaged in a shootout in a congested shopping center parking lot and had rammed his car into another vehicle. Surrounding vehicles were riddled with bullet holes. <i>See also United States v.

Although some increase beyond the standard sentence for possession of a firearm by a felon was warranted based on the risk posed by appellant's reckless conduct, Note 16(4) was not in these circumstances an available path to reach that result. The court took advantage of an appropriate alternative when it imposed the four-level adjustment under &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5). To notch it up again pursuant to Note 16 would overstate the severity of appellant's criminal activity by equating it with the extraordinarily dangerous conduct reflected in the other subsections of Note 16. We therefore conclude that the departure under Note 16 of &#167; 2K2.1 was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Departure under &#167; 5K2.1, p.s.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision of the guidelines is a policy statement providing for an upward departure when death results from the defendant's criminal activity. Among the factors to be considered in evaluating whether such a departure is warranted are (1) the defendant's state of mind, (2) the degree of planning or preparation, (3) whether multiple deaths resulted, and (4) the means by which life was taken. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.1, p.s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the provision applicable because appellant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">set in motion a whole series of events which ultimately led to the death of Officer Young. If he hadn't drawn that pistol, if he hadn't brandished that firearm, Officer Young would be alive today. The police officers would not have drawn their weapons. Officer Young undoubtedly would not have drawn a weapon. This whole tragedy would have been avoided. So there's a basis for upward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that Officer Young's death was an unpredictable occurrence insufficiently related to his criminal conduct to justify prolonging his term of imprisonment. He notes that none of the factors cited in the policy statement weigh toward departure &#8212; not only was his offense conduct spontaneous, but it also was unforeseeable that Officer Young would neither be recognized by fellow officers nor respond to their command that he drop his gun. In sum, he argues, the circumstances do not warrant punishment based on the unfortunate, but completely chance, death of the officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we can agree that appellant's culpability is at the low end of the spectrum contemplated by the policy statement, in that he was an indirect cause of Officer Young's death, we are unable to conclude that he is outside its scope. By using a weapon, appellant invited weapon use by others. Unintended consequences are often the result of reckless behavior, and while he could not have anticipated the particular sequence of events, appellant should have foreseen the possibility of serious harm as a result of his waving a cocked and loaded gun at a crowd of people. We see no basis for foreclosing departure under &#167; 5K2.1 when a defendant puts into motion a chain of events that risks serious injury or death, even when an intent to harm is entirely absent and the defendant was not directly responsible for the death. <i>See United States v. Fortier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160860\"><a href=\"/opinion/160860/united-states-v-fortier/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1224</span></a></span>, 1232-33 (10th Cir.2001) (an increased sentence may be imposed for \"harms that were a `reasonably foreseeable' consequence of a defendant's conduct even where a defendant did not directly cause the specified harm\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ameliorating factors may, of course, lead some trial judges to refrain from a departure under &#167; 5K2.1, and, in any event, such factors should bear on the extent of the departure. Here, the evidence supports appellant's claim that he had no intent to use the gun other than as a show of force designed to permit his and his friends' escape from an escalating confrontation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> At about the time of the fatal shooting, appellant had released the weapon and was complying with law enforcement orders that he get down on the ground and move toward them. The death itself was an unfortunate tragedy of mis-identification. Given these circumstances, we think it unlikely that the court would have departed upward four levels based solely on &#167; 5K2.1. This is particularly so because, as noted above, the risk of serious injury from appellant's conduct already was reflected in the four-level adjustment under &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that the district court would have increased appellant's sentence to the statutory maximum even without reliance on the three separate departure provisions, citing the judge's statement that he \"would depart upward beyond the statutory maximum if I had that power.\" At the time he made that comment, however, the judge believed he had multiple grounds for departure. Moreover, the statement reflects the court's understandable frustration with appellant's allocution, in which appellant denied any responsibility for Officer Young's death and repeatedly ignored the judge's and marshal's directives that he stop his rambling, offensive personal comments, which included references to the judge's son and brother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record therefore does not permit us to conclude that the lack of notice regarding &#167; 4A1.3 and the error in applying Note 16 of &#167; 2K2.1 were harmless. With the one valid ground of departure having limited force in the particular circumstances, the sentence inevitably reflects reliance on the other two provisions. A remand for re-sentencing is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm appellant's conviction, rejecting his claim that the district court committed plain error by instructing the jury that he bore the burden of proving that his firearm possession was justified. The circuits are split on the burden of proving justification in a felon-in-possession case, and First Circuit law on that particular question is unsettled. The case must be remanded to the district court for re-sentencing, however, because two of three provisions on which the court based an upward departure were utilized improperly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment of conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for re-sentencing.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The objects apparently were a bottle and a barbell</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellant testified that he had cocked the gun after he saw Pemberton reach for a weapon</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The four-part test also requires a showing that the error affected substantial rights and \"so seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings as to threaten a miscarriage of justice.\"<i>Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d at 246.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For example, the Introductory Comment on the section covering defenses states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Except for the insanity defense, the defendant need only meet a burden of production, in which event the burden of persuasion is on the prosecution to negate the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First Circuit Instructions &#167; 5, intro. cmt.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the government to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt any defenses that negate an element of the charged offense<i>See Patterson v.
