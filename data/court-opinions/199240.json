Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n                   Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Celeste Bourgeois on brief pro se.\n     Sheldon Whitehouse, Attorney General and J.O. Alston,\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          January 10, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam.    After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm, essentially for\n\nthe reasons set out by the magistrate judge in his report\n\nand recommendation, dated August 5, 1999.         We add only that\n\neven if judgment had not been entered previously by the\n\nstate court, appellant received everything she was entitled\n\nto receive under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-25-6(b) (1993); no\n\nalleged promises by state officials or others can change\n\nthat,   and   her   misunderstanding   of   the    terms   of   the\n\nsettlement cannot alter our analysis.             Given this, any\n\nalleged error by the district court in ordering certain\n\nsubpoenas quashed is harmless at best.      Despite appellant’s\n\nreasonable criticisms of the adequacy and speed of the\n\nvictim’s compensation system in Rhode Island, this court is\n\nobligated to affirm.\n\n          Affirmed.     See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\f",
