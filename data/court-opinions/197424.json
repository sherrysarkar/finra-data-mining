The appeal\r                                       \r\n\ncenters  upon a  novel government  motion for  downward departure\r\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0, which  the district court  rejected.

See 8  U.S.C.    1326(b)(2) (1995).   After\r                                   \r\n\nClase entered a guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend a\r\n\ndownward  departure under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0 in return for a stipu-\r\n\nlation of  alienage and deportability following  his release from\r\n\nprison, as well  as waivers  of any deportation  hearing and  any\r\n\nappeal from the deportation order. \r\n\n          At sentencing, after Clase represented that he would so\r\n\nstipulate,  the  government   recommended  a  two-level  downward\r\n\ndeparture on the ground  that the stipulation constituted conduct\r\n\nnot contemplated by the  Sentencing Guidelines (or \"Guidelines\").\r\n\nSee generally  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.   After rejecting  the requested\r                       \r\n\nsection 5K2.0 departure as  beyond its power, the  district court\r\n\nincreased  the base offense  level (\"BOL\") from  eight to twenty-\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nfour, pursuant to  U.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2)  (1995), on the  ground\r\n\nthat  the  1994 deportation  had  followed  a conviction  for  an\r\n\naggravated felony.  \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Clase  appeals  the  resulting forty-six  month  prison\r\n\nsentence,  challenging both the sixteen-level enhancement imposed\r\n\npursuant  to U.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2) and the district court ruling\r\n\nthat it  lacked authority to depart under  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.  The\r\n\ngovernment  supports the  section  2L1.2(b)(2)  enhancement,  but\r\n\njoins  Clase in opposition to the district court ruling denying a\r\n\nsection 5K2.0 departure. \r\n\nA.   \"Aggravated Felony\" Enhancement (U.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2))\r          A.   \"Aggravated Felony\" Enhancement (U.S.S.G.   2L1.2(b)(2))\r                                                                      \r\n\n          The  prior state  conviction was  ruled  an \"aggravated\r\n\nfelony,\"  for  section   2L1.2(b)(2)  purposes,  because  cocaine\r\n\npossession is a felony under Texas  law, see Tex.

(n.7), defines \"aggravated felony\"\r\n\nas, inter alia, \"any drug  trafficking crime . . . defined  in 18\r                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   924(c)(2).\"  Section 924(c)(2) defines \"drug trafficking\r\n\ncrime\"  as, inter  alia, \"any  felony punishable  under  the Con-\r                                 \r\n\ntrolled Substances Act.\"1  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Clase  argues that  Congress  cannot have  intended that  a\r\nstate  felony conviction  for  mere drug  possession satisfy  the\r\n\"aggravated felony\"  requirement under    2L1.2(b)(2),  since the\r\nterm  \"drug trafficking  offense\"  clearly excludes  simple  drug\r\npossession.  As this claim was never raised below, we review only\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          Clase acknowledges  that our recent decision  in United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

As\r\n\nRestrepo-Aguilar directly controls,  and Clase offers  no tenable\r                          \r\n\nbasis for disregarding stare  decisis, we decline to  revisit the\r                                               \r\n\nmatter.

Since this court has\r                                                     \r\nalready rejected the very contention asserted by Clase on appeal,\r\nsee  United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d 361, 364 n.5 (1st\r                                                \r\nCir. 1996), we are  in no position to conclude that  the district\r\ncourt ruling constituted \"plain error\"  in these parts.  Olivier-\r                                                                           \r\nDiaz,  13  F.3d  at  5.    The  remaining  challenges  to  the   \r              \r\n2L1.1(b)(2) ruling merit no discussion.\r\n\n     2Although a refusal to  depart is not ordinarily appealable,\r\nsee United States v. Tucker, 892 F.2d 8, 11 (1st  Cir. 1989), the\r                                     \r\nrule is otherwise if, as here, the district court refused  on the\r\nground that it lacked the authority to depart.  See United States\r                                                                           \r\nv.

The  Memorandum indicates  that a\r\n\ndownward departure based on such cooperative conduct on  the part\r\n\nof  alien  criminal defendants  is  permissible because  it  is a\r\n\n\"mitigating circumstance  of a kind,  or .  . . degree,  not ade-\r\n\nquately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission . .\r\n\n. .\").\r\n\n          The United  States Attorney for the  District of Massa-\r\n\nchusetts accordingly  recommended a two-level  downward departure\r\n\nunder  section 5K2.0 based on the agreement by Clase to stipulate\r\n\nto  deportation and waive any related appeal.  The district court\r\n\nrejected the recommendation. \r\n\n               I   am  not  satisfied  that  there  are\r\n          grounds within Section 5K2.0 to permit depar-\r\n          ture based upon .  . . a representation [that\r\n          Clase would stipulate to  deportation, etc.].\r\n          I make that determination as a matter of law.\r                                                                \r\n          If I have such  power, then I need to  be in-\r\n          structed that I do  by another court . .  . .\r\n          [U]pon  my  own independent  determination, I\r\n          find  the use  of Section  5K2.0 to  permit a\r\n          downward departure on the  basis of the  con-\r\n          cession of deportability and an agreement not\r\n          to contest it is not  a matter that was  left\r                                                                 \r\n          unconsidered  by  the Sentencing  Commission.\r                                \r\n          Certainly, the specific factual circumstances\r\n          were not considered by the Sentencing Commis-\r\n          sion, but the larger issue of deportation and\r\n          the mechanisms for deportation, agreements to\r\n          ameliorate the difficulties that are adminis-\r\n          trative  burdens for the government, are mat-\r\n          ters  within  the  scope of  the  \"heartland\"\r\n          calculations  of  the Sentencing  Commission,\r\n          generally,  and  in connection  with deporta-\r\n          tion.\r\n\n               I view the  Attorney General's  willing-\r                                                                 \r\n          ness, in  certain circumstances, to  agree to\r                                                                 \r\n          such a  downward departure to be  in the form\r                                                                 \r\n          of  a  shadow sentencing  guideline, unautho-\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          rized  by  relevant  law[,]  which  allocates\r                                            \r\n          responsibilities  in this  area and  [is] not\r\n          entitled to any particular weight.  (Emphasis\r\n          added.)3\r\n\n          As posed by  the parties and addressed by  the district\r\n\ncourt, therefore, the  question before us turns  upon an abstract\r\n\nlegal principle:  whether the stipulation and waiver relating  to\r\n\nalienage and deportability permit a section 5K2.0 departure based\r\n\non the conclusory departure  rationale propounded in the Memoran-\r\n\ndum.\r\n\n          The government and the  defendant insist on appeal that\r\n\nthe stipulation and waiver relating to alienage and deportability\r\n\nremove  the  case from  the \"heartland.\"    See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRivera,  994 F.2d  942, 947 (1st  Cir. 1993) (Breyer,  C.J.).

However, were  downward depar-\r\n\ntures permitted  simply on the conclusory  representations in the\r\n\nMemorandum, without regard to whether  the alien defendant has  a\r\n\nnonfrivolous  defense  to  deportation, individualized  guideline\r\n\nsentencing indeed could be undermined by  what the district court\r\n\naptly termed a \"shadow guideline\" that would erode the prescribed\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nBOL in  any alien-criminal defendant's case to  which the govern-\r\n\nment chose to apply the Memorandum, simpliciter.7 \r                                                         \r\n\n          The district court prudently recognized that sentencing\r\n\ncourts may not defer to unsubstantiated prosecutorial recommenda-\r\n\ntions  as adequate grounds for section 5K2.0 departures.  We note\r\n\nas  well that  even  the indispensable  government  motion for  a\r\n\n\"substantial  assistance\" departure under U.S.S.G.   5K1.1 simply\r\n\npresents the matter for judicial consideration.  See Mariano, 983\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 1155 (\"[T]he decision whether to depart after the govern-\r\n\nment  has made such a [  5K1.1 substantial assistance] motion . .\r\n\n.  falls squarely within the  district court's domain.

After Clase entered a guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend a downward departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 in return for a stipulation of alienage and deportability following his release from prison, as well as waivers of any deportation hearing and any appeal from the deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, after Clase represented that he would so stipulate, the government recommended a two-level downward departure on the ground that the stipulation constituted conduct not contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines (or \"Guidelines\").

The Memorandum indicates that a downward departure based on such cooperative conduct on the part of alien criminal defendants is permissible because it is a (\"mitigating circumstance of a kind, or ... degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts accordingly recommended a two-level downward departure under section 5K2.0 based on the agreement by Clase to stipulate to deportation and waive any related appeal.

[U]pon my own independent determination, I find the use of Section 5K2.0 to permit a downward departure on the basis of the concession of deportability and an agreement not to contest it is not a matter that was left unconsidered by the Sentencing Commission.  Certainly, the specific factual circumstances were not considered by the Sentencing Commission, but the larger issue of deportation and the mechanisms for deportation, agreements to ameliorate the difficulties that are administrative burdens for the government, are matters within the scope of the \"heartland\" calculations of the Sentencing Commission, generally, and in connection with deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I view the Attorney General's willingness, in certain circumstances, to agree to such a downward departure to be in the form of a shadow sentencing guideline, unauthorized by relevant law [,] which allocates responsibilities in this area and [is] not entitled to any particular weight.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0;  United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 115 (1st Cir.1990).  We are loath to presume, as a general matter, that the Commission either overlooked or inadequately considered the statutory and regulatory structures upon which an informed sentencing treatment of immigration offenses significantly depended.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2 comment.  (citing to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326);  id. comment.  (n.4) (describing 16-level enhancement for alien previously deported after conviction for aggravated felony).  Rather, given its mandate, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994, as well as its institutional expertise and experience, see id. &#167; 995, we think it is quite clear that the Commission would have considered that an alien defendant, particularly one convicted of unlawful reentry subsequent to deportation for an aggravated felony, almost certainly would be deported again.  See 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1251(a)(1)(B) (alien who has entered without inspection), &#167; 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (alien convicted of aggravated felony after admission) (1996) (amended sections presently codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227 (1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we believe it would be farfetched to suppose that the Commission overlooked the central reality that in all likelihood deportation would occur by normal operation of law as a matter of course--irrespective of the alien defendant's consent--following a conviction for illegal reentry subsequent to deportation for an aggravated felony.  Cf. United States v. Restrepo, 999 F.2d 640, 647 (2d Cir.)  (even absent any indication in the Guidelines that Congress or the Commission \"considered the interplay between deportability and sentencing provisions,\" deportability is not a ground for departure because, among other reasons, \"it is difficult to believe that the Commission was not conscious that a large number of defendants sentenced in the federal courts are aliens\"), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 954, 114 S.Ct. 405, 126 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993);  United States v. Ceja-Hernandez, 895 F.2d 544, 545 (9th Cir.1990) (per curiam ) (\"When setting the offense level for entry after deportation, the Sentencing Commission would certainly have been aware of the practice of promptly deporting aliens after they serve such sentences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the facilitative nature of stipulated deportations does not strike us as a circumstance \"of a kind\" left unconsidered by the Commission.  Several guidelines treat stipulated deportations in the same manner as formal deportations for purposes of subsequent prosecution.  For example, sections 2L1.1(b)(3) and 2L2.2(b)(1) identify a prior deportation, whether voluntary or involuntary, as a \"specific offense\" characteristic.  See also U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 196 (1995) (likewise discussing voluntary as well as involuntary deportations).  Although these provisions simply indicate that prior deportations, voluntary as well as involuntary, are aggravating \"specific offense\" characteristics, their presence in the Guidelines conspicuously demonstrates Commission awareness not only that numerous illegal aliens become enmeshed in the criminal justice system, but that many are expelled from the United States without ever undergoing formal deportation proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, given the large numbers of illegal aliens expelled from the United States each year without undergoing formal deportation proceedings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we consider it exceedingly improbable that the Commission either overlooked stipulated expulsions altogether or regarded their facilitative value to be \"of a kind\" warranting a downward departure.  These analogous data indicate that an alien criminal defendant with no plausible basis for contesting deportation--particularly one convicted of illegal reentry subsequent to deportation for an aggravated felony--does not meet the atypicality requirement for a section 5K2.0 departure simply by relying upon whatever administrative convenience presumably may result from a stipulated deportation.  Cf. United States v. Barber, 93 F.3d 1200, 1205 (4th Cir.1996) (vacating upward departure for using firearm to effect second degree murder, because \"Commission could not have failed to take into account ... that that offense is commonly committed by use of a gun....  No scenario could be more typical, more within the heartland, of second-degree murder than death by one weapon or another, especially by firearm.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that the Sentencing Commission was fully cognizant that virtually all alien criminal defendants, convicted under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2, would be subjected to deportation and that many undoubtedly would stipulate to deportation.  Accordingly, we hold, at least in the absence of a colorable, nonfrivolous defense to deportation, that the proffered ground for departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 does not constitute a mitigating circumstance of a kind not adequately considered by the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1154 (1st Cir.1993) (&#167; 5K2.0 serves as a \"safety valve\" for \"important, atypical\" factors which remove the case from the \"heartland\");  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 115 n. 7 (proffered circumstance \"must have weight ... it must be sufficiently portentous to move the case out of the heartland for the offense of conviction.\");  United States v. Williams, 891 F.2d 962, 967 (1st Cir.1989) (\"departures must be based upon meaningful atypicality;  ...  judges can always flyspeck individual cases to find some sort of idiosyncracy....  If the guidelines are to provide a coherent system of criminal sentencing, the trial court's right to depart, up or down, must be restricted to those few instances where some substantial atypicality can be demonstrated.\")  (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent some mitigating circumstance not suggested here, no substantial atypicality is demonstrated where an alien defendant simply stipulates to deportation and no nonfrivolous defense to deportation is discernible.  Compare United States v. Khan, 920 F.2d 1100, 1107 (2d Cir.1990) (discussing potential downward departure for saving government informant's life), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 969, 111 S.Ct. 1606, 113 L.Ed.2d 669 (1991).  As the district court noted, the government's conclusory departure recommendation, simpliciter, does not purport to demonstrate that the facilitative conduct relied upon even constituted substantial assistance warranting sentencing leniency.  Cf. United States v. Cardenas, 896 F.2d 317, 320 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that government's acknowledgement that defendant accepted personal responsibility does not control sentencing determination);  United States v. Nunley, 873 F.2d 182, 187 &amp; n. 6 (8th Cir.1989) (same);  United States v. Forbes, 888 F.2d 752, 754 (11th Cir.1989) (sentencing court not bound by government stipulation that defendant was minor participant).  Consequently, there is no indication that any administrative convenience to the government constituted a mitigating circumstance \"to a degree\" not adequately considered by the Commission.  See United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 24-25 (1st Cir.1991);  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 115.   More to the present point, the stipulation in this case must be considered de minimis from the standpoint of its assistance in alleviating any administrative burden upon the government, since Clase has no discernible defense to deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the parties essentially are left with their implicit contention that any stipulated deportation constitutes an extraordinary mitigating circumstance, for no other reason than that it bears the government's endorsement and dispenses with an administrative hearing.  However, were downward departures permitted simply on the conclusory representations in the Memorandum, without regard to whether the alien defendant has a nonfrivolous defense to deportation, individualized guideline sentencing indeed could be undermined by what the district court aptly termed a \"shadow guideline\" that would erode the prescribed BOL in any alien-criminal defendant's case to which the government chose to apply the Memorandum, simpliciter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court prudently recognized that sentencing courts may not defer to unsubstantiated prosecutorial recommendations as adequate grounds for section 5K2.0 departures.  We note as well that even the indispensable government motion for a \"substantial assistance\" departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1 simply presents the matter for judicial consideration.  See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1155 (\"[T]he decision whether to depart after the government has made such a [&#167; 5K1.1 substantial assistance] motion ... falls squarely within the district court's domain.  The district court is not obligated to depart downward simply because a grateful prosecutor prefers a lighter sentence.\").  The district court correctly determined that it lacked authority to depart on the ground that the stipulated deportation constituted mitigation to a degree neither readily envisioned nor often seen in connection with such an offender or offense of conviction.  See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1154;  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 115 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With no record indication that this case is meaningfully atypical in any material respect, see id. at 115, the section 5K2.0 departure recommendation lacked a cognizable legal basis.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary to determine whether a stipulation of alienage and deportability, accompanied by the attendant waivers, may ever serve as an adequate ground for downward departure under section 5K2.0.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2051 (\"with few exceptions, departure factors should not be ruled out on a categorical basis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Clase argues that Congress cannot have intended that a state felony conviction for mere drug possession satisfy the \"aggravated felony\" requirement under &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2), since the term \"drug trafficking offense\" clearly excludes simple drug possession.

After Clase entered a guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend a downward departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 in return for a stipulation of alienage and deportability following his release from prison, as well as waivers of any deportation hearing and any appeal from the deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, after Clase represented that he would so stipulate, the government recommended a two-level downward departure on the ground that the stipulation constituted conduct not contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines (or \"Guidelines\").

Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 115 (1st Cir.1990).  We are loath to presume, as a general matter, that the Commission either overlooked or inadequately considered the statutory and regulatory structures upon which an informed sentencing treatment of immigration offenses significantly depended.  See, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2 comment.  (citing to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326);  id. comment.  (n.4) (describing 16-level enhancement for alien previously deported after conviction for aggravated felony).  Rather, given its mandate, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994, as well as its institutional expertise and experience, see id. &#167; 995, we think it is quite clear that the Commission would have considered that an alien defendant, particularly one convicted of unlawful reentry subsequent to deportation for an aggravated felony, almost certainly would be deported again.  See 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1251(a)(1)(B) (alien who has entered without inspection), &#167; 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (alien convicted of aggravated felony after admission) (1996) (amended sections presently codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227 (1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we believe it would be farfetched to suppose that the Commission overlooked the central reality that in all likelihood deportation would occur by normal operation of law as a matter of course--irrespective of the alien defendant's consent--following a conviction for illegal reentry subsequent to deportation for an aggravated felony.  Cf. United States v. Restrepo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612089\"><a href=\"/opinion/612089/united-states-v-jorge-restrepo/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 647 (2d Cir.)  (even absent any indication in the Guidelines that Congress or the Commission \"considered the interplay between deportability and sentencing provisions,\" deportability is not a ground for departure because, among other reasons, \"it is difficult to believe that the Commission was not conscious that a large number of defendants sentenced in the federal courts are aliens\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ceja-Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536116\"><a href=\"/opinion/536116/united-states-v-ramon-ceja-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 545 (9th Cir.1990) (per curiam ) (\"When setting the offense level for entry after deportation, the Sentencing Commission would certainly have been aware of the practice of promptly deporting aliens after they serve such sentences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the facilitative nature of stipulated deportations does not strike us as a circumstance \"of a kind\" left unconsidered by the Commission.  Several guidelines treat stipulated deportations in the same manner as formal deportations for purposes of subsequent prosecution.  For example, sections 2L1.1(b)(3) and 2L2.2(b)(1) identify a prior deportation, whether voluntary or involuntary, as a \"specific offense\" characteristic.  See also U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 196 (1995) (likewise discussing voluntary as well as involuntary deportations).  Although these provisions simply indicate that prior deportations, voluntary as well as involuntary, are aggravating \"specific offense\" characteristics, their presence in the Guidelines conspicuously demonstrates Commission awareness not only that numerous illegal aliens become enmeshed in the criminal justice system, but that many are expelled from the United States without ever undergoing formal deportation proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, given the large numbers of illegal aliens expelled from the United States each year without undergoing formal deportation proceedings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we consider it exceedingly improbable that the Commission either overlooked stipulated expulsions altogether or regarded their facilitative value to be \"of a kind\" warranting a downward departure.  These analogous data indicate that an alien criminal defendant with no plausible basis for contesting deportation--particularly one convicted of illegal reentry subsequent to deportation for an aggravated felony--does not meet the atypicality requirement for a section 5K2.0 departure simply by relying upon whatever administrative convenience presumably may result from a stipulated deportation.  Cf. United States v. Barber, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725013\"><a href=\"/opinion/725013/united-states-v-anthony-d-barber-united-states-of-america-v-david-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span>, 1205 (4th Cir.1996) (vacating upward departure for using firearm to effect second degree murder, because \"Commission could not have failed to take into account ... that that offense is commonly committed by use of a gun....  No scenario could be more typical, more within the heartland, of second-degree murder than death by one weapon or another, especially by firearm.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that the Sentencing Commission was fully cognizant that virtually all alien criminal defendants, convicted under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a) and sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2, would be subjected to deportation and that many undoubtedly would stipulate to deportation.  Accordingly, we hold, at least in the absence of a colorable, nonfrivolous defense to deportation, that the proffered ground for departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 does not constitute a mitigating circumstance of a kind not adequately considered by the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Compare United States v. Khan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552776\"><a href=\"/opinion/552776/united-states-v-mohammad-wazir-khan/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span>, 1107 (2d Cir.1990) (discussing potential downward departure for saving government informant's life), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></span> (1991).  As the district court noted, the government's conclusory departure recommendation, simpliciter, does not purport to demonstrate that the facilitative conduct relied upon even constituted substantial assistance warranting sentencing leniency.  Cf. United States v. Cardenas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536571\"><a href=\"/opinion/536571/united-states-v-miguel-cardenas/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 320 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that government's acknowledgement that defendant accepted personal responsibility does not control sentencing determination);  United States v. Nunley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521999\"><a href=\"/opinion/521999/united-states-v-helen-faye-nunley/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 187 &amp; n. 6 (8th Cir.1989) (same);  United States v.

Consequently, there is no indication that any administrative convenience to the government constituted a mitigating circumstance \"to a degree\" not adequately considered by the Commission.  See United States v. Romolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563790\"><a href=\"/opinion/563790/united-states-v-christopher-j-romolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.1991);  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 115.   More to the present point, the stipulation in this case must be considered de minimis from the standpoint of its assistance in alleviating any administrative burden upon the government, since Clase has no discernible defense to deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the parties essentially are left with their implicit contention that any stipulated deportation constitutes an extraordinary mitigating circumstance, for no other reason than that it bears the government's endorsement and dispenses with an administrative hearing.  However, were downward departures permitted simply on the conclusory representations in the Memorandum, without regard to whether the alien defendant has a nonfrivolous defense to deportation, individualized guideline sentencing indeed could be undermined by what the district court aptly termed a \"shadow guideline\" that would erode the prescribed BOL in any alien-criminal defendant's case to which the government chose to apply the Memorandum, simpliciter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court prudently recognized that sentencing courts may not defer to unsubstantiated prosecutorial recommendations as adequate grounds for section 5K2.0 departures.  We note as well that even the indispensable government motion for a \"substantial assistance\" departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1 simply presents the matter for judicial consideration.  See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1155 (\"[T]he decision whether to depart after the government has made such a [&#167; 5K1.1 substantial assistance] motion ... falls squarely within the district court's domain.  The district court is not obligated to depart downward simply because a grateful prosecutor prefers a lighter sentence.\").  The district court correctly determined that it lacked authority to depart on the ground that the stipulated deportation constituted mitigation to a degree neither readily envisioned nor often seen in connection with such an offender or offense of conviction.  See Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1154;  Sklar, 920 F.2d at 115 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With no record indication that this case is meaningfully atypical in any material respect, see id. at 115, the section 5K2.0 departure recommendation lacked a cognizable legal basis.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary to determine whether a stipulation of alienage and deportability, accompanied by the attendant waivers, may ever serve as an adequate ground for downward departure under section 5K2.0.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2051 (\"with few exceptions, departure factors should not be ruled out on a categorical basis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Clase argues that Congress cannot have intended that a state felony conviction for mere drug possession satisfy the \"aggravated felony\" requirement under &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2), since the term \"drug trafficking offense\" clearly excludes simple drug possession.
