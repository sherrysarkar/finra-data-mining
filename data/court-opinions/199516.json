Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jose R.

(“Otoki”) appeals from the\n\ndistrict court’s order dismissing its complaint for failure to\n\ncomply with a court order.         Otoki argues on appeal that the\n\ndistrict     court   erred   in   not   remanding    its   case   to   the\n\nCommonwealth court in Puerto Rico, because the court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over its case.          Otoki further argues\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n    A district court has inherent authority to manage its docket\n\nand may impose sanctions when it finds that its process has been\n\nabused even in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction.             Cf.\n\nUnanue-Casal v. Unanue-Casal, 898 F.2d 839, 841 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(imposing Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 sanctions after dismissing a petition\n\nfor removal to federal court).           Thus, we decline to decide\n\nwhether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction,\n\nbecause, in the present circumstances where appellant has not\n\nshown that filing a new action in Commonwealth court is barred\n\nby the statute of limitations, see 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5303, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndismissing Otoki’s complaint without prejudice as a sanction for\n\nOtoki’s failure to comply with the district court’s order that\n\nOtoki file a status report.       See John’s Insulation, Inc. v. L.\n\nAddison and Associates, Inc., 156 F.3d 101, 108 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nAccordingly, appellant’s motion requesting adjudication on its\n\fbrief without oral argument, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 34(f) is\n\ngranted and the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\f",
