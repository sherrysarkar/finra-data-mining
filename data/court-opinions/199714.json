Emilson Muñoz (\"Muñoz\") appeals from\n\n his conviction by guilty plea for possession with intent to\n\n distribute heroin, claiming that he was denied his Sixth\n\n Amendment    right   to   conflict-free       counsel.     The   alleged\n\n conflict stems from the fact that Muñoz and his co-defendant\n\n Sandra    Mercado-González     (\"Mercado-González\")           were   both\n\n represented by the Federal Public Defender's Office, though\n\n different attorneys in the office handled their respective\n\n cases.    We conclude that the conviction should be vacated.\n\n                                  I.\n\n             On March 23, 2000, a federal grand jury returned\n\n a two count indictment charging Muñoz and Mercado-González\n\n with     aiding   and     abetting     each    other     in    importing\n\n approximately 3,814 grams of heroin, see 21 U.S.C. § 952(a);\n\n 18 U.S.C. § 2 (count one), and with aiding and abetting each\n\n other in possessing with intent to distribute the same\n\n amount of heroin, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2\n\n (count two).      The court appointed an Assistant Federal\n\n Public Defender to represent Mercado-González.                A private\n\n attorney was appointed to represent Muñoz.             Mercado-González\n\n and Muñoz both entered pleas of not guilty.\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            On June 9, 2000, co-defendant Mercado-González pled\n\nguilty to count two.         Muñoz was also scheduled to plead\n\nguilty,    but   his    change   of    plea    hearing   was   cancelled.\n\nShortly thereafter, counsel for Muñoz filed a motion to\n\nwithdraw citing irreconcilable differences with his client.\n\nThe motion to withdraw was allowed, and the court appointed\n\na different Assistant Federal Public Defender to represent\n\nMuñoz.     A trial date was set for August 3, 2000.\n\n            On July 18, 2000, the Federal Public Defender's\n\nOffice moved to withdraw as counsel for Muñoz alleging a\n\nconflict of interest in the office's joint representation of\n\nMuñoz and co-defendant Mercado-González.             The motion stated\n\nthat   Mercado-González       had     provided    information     to   the\n\ngovernment detrimental to the interests of Muñoz, namely,\n\nthat Muñoz had hired Mercado-González to act as a drug\n\ncourier.     The motion also stated that Mercado-González had\n\nexpressed a willingness to cooperate with the government,\n\nand that, although the government had indicated that it had\n\nno present intent to call her as a trial witness, Mercado-\n\nGonzález remained a potential witness against Muñoz.                   The\n\nFederal    Public      Defender's     Office    represented     that   the\n\nprosecutor shared its concerns about a conflict of interest.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           On July 21, 2000, the district judge denied the\n\nmotion to withdraw by margin order without hearing.               The\n\norder stated that \"[a]s long as Sandra Mercado is not a\n\nwitness in this case, the alleged conflict is too tenuous to\n\nrequire discharging the FPD from representing E. Muñoz.\"\n\nFollowing the denial of the motion to withdraw, Muñoz pled\n\nguilty to count two of the indictment.        On October 17, 2000,\n\nMercado-González was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve\n\nmonths and one day followed by a supervised release term of\n\nfour years.     On November 13, 2000, Muñoz was sentenced to\n\nseventy months imprisonment followed by a supervised release\n\nterm of five years.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           The first question is whether the district judge\n\nhad a duty to make inquiry into the alleged conflict over\n\nand above the inquiry he made.          We conclude that he did.\n\nThere was more than just a question here of whether the two\n\ndefendants could be represented by the same federal public\n\ndefender   office.     Both   sides    had   asserted   a   potential\n\nconflict of interest, namely, the fact that Mercado-González\n\nwas   willing   to   cooperate   and   had   provided   information\n\ndetrimental to the interests of Muñoz.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f             The   district      judge       seemingly   thought     that    the\n\nconcerns     raised      were     answered      by    the   fact    that     the\n\ngovernment did not intend to call Mercado-González as a\n\ntrial witness.          However, the import of the Federal Public\n\nDefender's explanation was also that Mercado-González was in\n\na position to provide testimony that might be useful at\n\nsentencing and that might work to Muñoz's disadvantage and\n\nher own advantage.             Obviously, a single lawyer could not\n\nproperly      represent          both        defendants        under       these\n\ncircumstances.\n\n             We    do    not    have    to    consider      now    whether    an\n\nartificial separation within the Federal Public Defender's\n\nOffice could have eliminated the possibility of a conflict.\n\nNo such suggestion was made here, and the issue is not\n\nbefore us.    While joint representation by the same office is\n\nnot as potentially dangerous as joint representation by a\n\nsingle attorney, the fact remains that the two defendants in\n\nthis case were in antagonistic positions, that neither case\n\nhad   been   completely         resolved,      that   client      confidential\n\ninformation may have been disclosed within the office, and\n\nthat either defendant was in a position to gain an advantage\n\nby turning on the other, possibly at trial, and, if not, at\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fsentencing.         Perhaps the apparent conflict could have been\n\nresolved with an inquiry, but an inquiry was required.\n\n                                    III.\n\n             The second question is what to do now that we have\n\nfound a substantial possibility of a conflict and a failure\n\non the part of the district judge to make adequate inquiry.\n\nThe    law     in     this   area     may   be     open     to    different\n\ninterpretations.\n\n             Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 484-91 (1978),\n\nseems to say that a reversal is required, at least where one\n\ncounsel represents several defendants, whenever there was a\n\ntimely conflict objection and a failure to make adequate\n\ninquiry.     While such a ruling was arguably unnecessary in\n\nHolloway since there was an actual conflict manifest in the\n\nrecord, the case has sometimes been read as establishing a\n\nrule of automatic reversal.           See, e.g., Selsor v. Kaiser, 22\n\nF.3d   1029,      1033   (10th    Cir.   1994)    (\"Under   the       Holloway\n\nstandard, the trial court's failure to appoint separate\n\ncounsel,     or     adequately    inquire   into    the   possibility       of\n\nconflict, in the face of a timely objection by defense\n\ncounsel,     demonstrates        ineffective     assistance      of    counsel\n\nwithout a showing of actual conflict of interest.\").                       But\n\nsee Garcia v. Bunnell, 33 F.3d 1193, 1198 (9th Cir. 1994)\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f(stating that even on the assumption that defendant timely\n\nobjected, Holloway did not require a reversal since there\n\nwas no actual conflict).\n\n            By contrast, Cuyler            v.   Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335\n\n(1980), establishes a much more demanding test where there\n\nwas no conflict objection and the trial court was under no\n\nduty   to   make     inquiry.        Under      these   circumstances,     a\n\ndefendant    must    demonstrate      that      \"an   actual   conflict   of\n\ninterest adversely affected his lawyer's performance\" in\n\norder to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.                Cuyler, 446\n\nU.S. at 348.       However, if the defendant meets this test, he\n\nneed not demonstrate prejudice to obtain relief.                      Id. at\n\n349-50.\n\n            It can be argued that Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261\n\n(1981), modified Holloway because in Wood the Court failed\n\nto make inquiry into a possible conflict of interest, even\n\nthough the conflict issue had been raised by the State, and\n\nthe Court instead of vacating the conviction remanded for a\n\nfinding of whether there was an actual conflict.                See    Wood,\n\n450 U.S. at 272-73; Mountjoy v. Warden, 245 F.3d 31, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).       We note that Wood involved an objection to a\n\npossible conflict raised by the prosecutor, while Holloway\n\ninvolved    the     assertion   of    a    conflict     made   by   defense\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcounsel.    It can further be argued that if, on remand, it\n\ncan   be   established   that    no   actual   conflict   existed,    a\n\ndefendant    should   not   be    entitled     to   vacation   of   his\n\nconviction--at least in the absence of some showing that the\n\nfailure to make inquiry otherwise prejudiced him.\n\n            We have concluded that we do not need to resolve\n\nthe question whether Wood modified Holloway.           The government\n\nhas done nothing to argue the point other than to suggest\n\nthat it would not oppose a remand or any other remedy that\n\nthis court deems proper.         The defendant is asking that the\n\nconviction be vacated.      We do not see much prospect that a\n\nremand to explore the conflict issue would be likely to\n\nresult in a finding of no actual conflict, dissipate the\n\nuncertainty whether defendant's guilty plea was in some way\n\naffected by counsel's perception that he was operating under\n\na conflict of interest, or dispel the inference that at\n\nleast some communication occurred between Mercado-González's\n\nattorney and Muñoz's.       Finally, this is a case where the\n\ngovernment has direct evidence and is hardly likely to be\n\nprejudiced by a need to present the evidence afresh.\n\n            Accordingly, we vacate the conviction and sentence,\n\nset aside the guilty plea, and remand the case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f-9-\n\f",

Kaiser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668634\"><a href=\"/opinion/668634/michael-b-selsor-v-stephen-w-kaiser/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,      1033   (10th    Cir.   1994)    (\"Under   the       Holloway\n\nstandard, the trial court's failure to appoint separate\n\ncounsel,     or     adequately    inquire   into    the   possibility       of\n\nconflict, in the face of a timely objection by defense\n\ncounsel,     demonstrates        ineffective     assistance      of    counsel\n\nwithout a showing of actual conflict of interest.\").

Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110256\"><a href=\"/opinion/110256/cuyler-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1980), establishes a much more demanding test where there\n\nwas no conflict objection and the trial court was under no\n\nduty   to   make     inquiry.        Under      these   circumstances,     a\n\ndefendant    must    demonstrate      that      \"an   actual   conflict   of\n\ninterest adversely affected his lawyer's performance\" in\n\norder to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.                Cuyler, 446\n\nU.S. at 348.       However, if the defendant meets this test, he\n\nneed not demonstrate prejudice to obtain relief.                      Id. at\n\n349-50.\n\n            It can be argued that Wood v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110425\"><a href=\"/opinion/110425/wood-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1981), modified Holloway because in Wood the Court failed\n\nto make inquiry into a possible conflict of interest, even\n\nthough the conflict issue had been raised by the State, and\n\nthe Court instead of vacating the conviction remanded for a\n\nfinding of whether there was an actual conflict.                See    Wood,\n\n450 U.S. at 272-73; Mountjoy v. Warden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199348\"><a href=\"/opinion/199348/mountjoy-v-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).       We note that Wood involved an objection to a\n\npossible conflict raised by the prosecutor, while Holloway\n\ninvolved    the     assertion   of    a    conflict     made   by   defense\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcounsel.    It can further be argued that if, on remand, it\n\ncan   be   established   that    no   actual   conflict   existed,    a\n\ndefendant    should   not   be    entitled     to   vacation   of   his\n\nconviction--at least in the absence of some showing that the\n\nfailure to make inquiry otherwise prejudiced him.\n\n            We have concluded that we do not need to resolve\n\nthe question whether Wood modified Holloway.           The government\n\nhas done nothing to argue the point other than to suggest\n\nthat it would not oppose a remand or any other remedy that\n\nthis court deems proper.         The defendant is asking that the\n\nconviction be vacated.      We do not see much prospect that a\n\nremand to explore the conflict issue would be likely to\n\nresult in a finding of no actual conflict, dissipate the\n\nuncertainty whether defendant's guilty plea was in some way\n\naffected by counsel's perception that he was operating under\n\na conflict of interest, or dispel the inference that at\n\nleast some communication occurred between Mercado-González's\n\nattorney and Muñoz's.       Finally, this is a case where the\n\ngovernment has direct evidence and is hardly likely to be\n\nprejudiced by a need to present the evidence afresh.\n\n            Accordingly, we vacate the conviction and sentence,\n\nset aside the guilty plea, and remand the case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f-9-\n\f</pre>",
