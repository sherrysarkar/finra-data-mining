We relate  the facts in the light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the verdict.   See United States  v. Wihbey, 75\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 761, 764  (1st Cir.  1996).  Between  December 1985  and\r\n\nMarch  1991, defendant  conspired  with James  Smith,  Robert\r\n\nCohen, and  Ambrose Devaney  to defraud two  separate lending\r\n\ninstitutions,  the Barnstable Community  Federal Credit Union\r\n\n(\"BCCU\")  and  the  Digital Employees  Federal  Credit  Union\r\n\n(\"Digital\").   Defendant, president of Digital  and a founder\r\n\nof BCCU,  and Smith, a real estate developer and a founder of\r\n\nBCCU, were the primary organizers of the fraud.  Robert Cohen\r\n\nwas  general counsel to both  credit unions.  Ambrose Devaney\r\n\nwas a  real estate  developer on  Cape Cod.     This  court's\r\n\naffirmance of  the convictions and sentences  of Smith, Cohen\r\n\nand Devaney is found at United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d  1223\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 176 (1995).\r                                    \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Defendant and Smith used their control over the two\r\n\ncredit  unions to obtain tens of millions of dollars in loans\r\n\nfor their  own speculative real  estate ventures.   The loans\r\n\nwere  used in part to finance the purchase of commercial real\r\n\nestate  on Cape Cod, usually motel properties or raw land for\r\n\nresidential subdivisions.  The loans were, in many instances,\r\n\nfunded in amounts far in excess of the purchase price of  the\r\n\nproperty,  with much of  the excess  going directly  into the\r\n\npockets  of defendant, Smith, and Devaney.  In order to avoid\r\n\nthe credit  union's policies restricting  \"insider\" loans  as\r\n\nwell as policies limiting maximum borrowing by an individual,\r\n\nthe conspirators formed over a dozen nominee trusts to create\r\n\nthe  fiction  that the  loans  were going  to  many different\r\n\nborrowers.     As president of Digital, which had experienced\r\n\nexplosive  growth  since  its  founding  in  1980,  defendant\r\n\nenjoyed  the  confidence  of  that credit  union's  board  of\r\n\ndirectors and staff.  Defendant was therefore  able to induce\r\n\nDigital   to   allocate    approximately   $20,000,000    for\r\n\n\"investment\"   in  participation  loans  with  BCCU,  without\r\n\ndisclosing the  fact that  defendant himself was  one of  the\r\n\nultimate borrowers of those funds.   All of the participation\r\n\nloans were made to  trusts owned by defendant and  Smith (and\r\n\nin most cases Devaney).   In each instance, the participation\r\n\nloans  were funded  in amounts  far in  excess of  the actual\r\n\npurchase  price of  the  commercial property.   These  excess\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nfunds,  known  as \"pie,\"  were siphoned  off and  diverted to\r\n\naccounts  controlled  by  defendant  or  Smith   for  further\r\n\ndistribution.  The  amount of \"pie\" varied  but was generally\r\n\nbetween $75,000 and $200,000 per partner per loan.\r\n\n          For  all of  the participation  loans and  for many\r\n\nadditional loans, defendant and his co-conspirators concealed\r\n\ntheir ownership interests by  placing in BCCU's and Digital's\r\n\nfiles  phony  certificates  of  beneficial  interest, falsely\r\n\nnaming  certain individuals as  beneficiaries of  the trusts.\r\n\nIn order to obtain loans well in excess of the purchase price\r\n\nof  the  property, defendant  and  Smith  forged and  altered\r\n\npurchase and sale agreements,  often inflating prices by over\r\n\none million dollars.   For most  of the participation  loans,\r\n\ndefendant,  Smith,  and  Lynn Vasapolle,  an  unindicted  co-\r\n\nconspirator, prepared fake financial statements to create the\r\n\nfalse impression that the putative borrowers (the \"trustees\")\r\n\nwere wealthy individuals capable  of repaying the loans being\r\n\nextended.\r\n\n          Most  of the  participation  loans  were  initially\r\n\nclosed  between December 1985 and October 1988, and were made\r\n\nwith \"interest  only\" notes  for relatively short  terms (1-2\r\n\nyears), with a balloon payment of the full principal due upon\r\n\nexpiration.  When they were  unable to find legitimate buyers\r\n\nto whom they could sell the properties at a profit sufficient\r\n\nto  cover both  the original  purchase price  and  the excess\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n\"pie\" they  had received,  the conspirators began  to pyramid\r\n\ntheir loans.\r\n\n          Beginning in 1986, as loans came due on subdivision\r\n\nproperties, Cohen would draw up papers \"selling\" a portion of\r\n\nthe original subdivision to a newly created trust.  Defendant\r\n\nand Smith  would then cause  BCCU to make  a loan to  the new\r\n\ntrust to finance the  purchase.  The new loan  proceeds would\r\n\nthen be used to  pay off the proportionate share of the prior\r\n\nloan.  Purchase \"prices\"  were again artificially inflated so\r\n\nas  to provide cash which was used to cover interest payments\r\n\non  the new  loans  and  to help  with  debt  service on  the\r\n\nexisting  loans.  By March 1991,  when BCCU was seized by the\r\n\nNational Credit Union Administration, the outstanding balance\r\n\nof the Mangone-Smith-Devaney loans  amounted to between forty\r\n\nand sixty million dollars.  \r\n\n          On September 12, 1992, defendant, Smith, Cohen, and\r\n\nDevaney  were indicted for  conspiracy (18  U.S.C.    371) to\r\n\ncommit  bank fraud  (18 U.S.C.    1344); unlawful  receipt of\r\n\nmonies  by a  credit union  officer (18  U.S.C.    1006); and\r\n\nmoney laundering (18 U.S.C.   1957).  The case was tried on a\r\n\nredacted indictment  that included a conspiracy  count, seven\r\n\nbank  fraud  counts, seven  parallel unlawful  receipt counts\r\n\n(which  concerned defendant alone)  and the  money laundering\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncharges.  Defendant was convicted on  all counts.1  Defendant\r\n\nfled prior to  sentencing and remained at large  for eighteen\r\n\nmonths  before  he  surrendered.    On  September  12,  1995,\r\n\ndefendant was sentenced to twenty-four years of incarceration\r\n\nafter the  district court departed  upward by two  years from\r\n\nthe maximum sentence under the Guidelines.  \r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n                       The Bruton Error\r                                   The Bruton Error\r                                                   \r\n\n          Defendant appeals  his conviction  on the basis  of\r\n\nalleged error  under Bruton  v. United  States, 391  U.S. 123\r                                                          \r\n\n(1968).    This  issue   has  already  been  decided  against\r\n\ndefendant's  co-conspirator Smith,  who asserted  a factually\r\n\nidentical claim of Bruton error in his appeal, which we found\r                                     \r\n\nto  have been  harmless error.   Smith,  46 F.3d  at 1229-30.\r                                                  \r\n\nAlthough we could dispose of defendant's  claim on the ground\r\n\nof stare decisis, we provide a brief analysis.\r                            \r\n\n          The Supreme  Court held in Bruton  that, because of\r                                                       \r\n\nthe substantial  risk that the jury,  despite instructions to\r\n\nthe  contrary,  will look  to  a  codefendant's incriminating\r\n\nextrajudicial statement in determining the defendant's guilt,\r\n\nadmission  of  a codefendant's  statement  in  a joint  trial\r\n\nviolates the defendant's right of cross-examination under the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Smith  was  also convicted  on  all  counts.   Cohen  was\r\nconvicted  on all  counts  except for  four money  laundering\r\ncharges.   Devaney was convicted of  conspiracy, three counts\r\nof bank fraud and  one count of money laundering.   Smith, 46\r                                                                     \r\nF.3d at 1227.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nConfrontation  Clause of  the Sixth  Amendment.   Bruton, 391\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at 126.  The  evidentiary basis for the Bruton  claim is\r                                                               \r\n\nas follows. \r\n\n          On  the last  day of trial  testimony, co-defendant\r\n\nCohen  called  to  the  stand  Professor  Richard  Huber,  an\r\n\nauthority on the  professional responsibilities of attorneys.\r\n\nTestifying  under the  district court's  limiting instruction\r\n\nthat the testimony  was relevant  as to Cohen  only, and  had\r\n\nnothing to  do with  any of Cohen's  co-defendants, Professor\r\n\nHuber  reiterated the events of April 4, 1991, when Cohen met\r\n\nwith him  to obtain  advice concerning his  representation of\r\n\nBCCU,  which by  that  time  was  in  the  hands  of  federal\r\n\nregulators.  Huber testified that Cohen explained to him that\r\n\nCohen's  clients, \"a  former officer  of the  bank, a  former\r\n\ndirector of the bank, and a bank manager came in and spoke to\r\n\n[Cohen] . .  . concerning activities  that involved them  and\r\n\ntheir work  at the bank.\"  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1228.  According\r                                            \r\n\nto  Huber,  Cohen stated  that  \"certain  documents had  been\r\n\nchanged, the  information had been changed,  figures had been\r\n\nchanged, data had been changed, [and] that this had been done\r\n\nafter  preparation  by Mr.  Cohen  and  after they  had  been\r\n\npresumptively completed.\"  Id.  \r                                          \r\n\n          Like  Smith  before  him,  defendant  asserts  that\r\n\nHuber's testimony constitutes reversible Bruton error because\r                                                           \r\n\nit  \"expressly implicate[s]  the defendant, leaving  no doubt\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthat it would prove powerfully incriminating.\"  Id. (internal\r                                                               \r\n\nquotation   marks   and   citations  omitted)(alteration   in\r\n\noriginal).   In Smith, we  assumed without deciding  that the\r                                 \r\n\nadmission  of Huber's testimony constituted Bruton error, but\r                                                              \r\n\nheld that  any such  error was  harmless beyond  a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.  46 F.3d at 1229. \r\n\n          Relying  on  Chapman  v. California,  386  U.S.  18\r                                                         \r\n\n(1967), and related cases, defendant  argues strenuously that\r\n\nthe  error was  not  harmless.    We  disagree.    We  remain\r\n\nconvinced that any Bruton error that may have occurred below2\r                                     \r\n\nwas harmless for the reasons stated in Smith: \r                                                        \r\n\n          The jury convicted  all the defendants on\r\n          the  conspiracy count, and  Cohen on most\r\n          of the  substantive counts.  Even  if the\r\n          jury threw the  curative instructions  to\r\n          the  wind  and  considered  the  stricken\r\n          testimony as evidence against [Mangone],3\r\n          the scenario which implicates  Bruton, it\r                                                           \r\n          could  not  have  believed Cohen's  claim\r\n          that the unnamed clients confessed to him\r                                                        \r\n          at the  close of the conspiracy.   No one\r\n          confesses to a partner in crime.\r\n\n               Admittedly, Cohen's  statement might\r\n          tend to incriminate [Mangone] and Devaney\r\n          by showing that the coconspirators met to\r\n          discuss damage  control.  In  this sense,\r\n          however, the statement falls  far outside\r\n          the     pale    of     the    \"powerfully\r\n          incriminating\"  evidence   that  produces\r\n          Bruton  errors.    Vasapolle had  already\r                            \r\n          testified     in     detail    to     the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  As  we did in Smith, we \"assume without deciding that the\r                                   \r\ndistrict   court  correctly  found   that  Bruton  error  had\r                                                             \r\noccurred.\"  Smith, 46 F.3d  at 1229.  \r                             \r\n\n3.

Thus,  once Cohen's\r\n          statement  is   considered  as  something\r\n          other    than    an   account    of   the\r\n          codefendants'  confessions,   it  becomes\r\n          merely  cumulative  of  the  government's\r\n          case and could  not have produced  Bruton\r                                                               \r\n          error.\r\n\n               The  right of  confrontation ensures\r\n          that  a  criminal  defendant  can  cross-\r\n          examine his  or her accusers.   Had Cohen\r\n          testified  to   the  confession  himself,\r\n          [Mangone's]  cross-examination  of  Cohen\r\n          would   have  sought  to   show  that  no\r\n          confession ever occurred.   The  verdicts\r\n          suggest that  the jury, if  it considered\r\n          this  evidence,  found  just  that.   The\r\n          jury, even if it disregarded the limiting\r\n          instructions,  plainly  did  not  believe\r\n          Cohen's claim that  his codefendants  had\r\n          confessed   to   him.     It   is  clear,\r\n          therefore,  that  any  Bruton  error  was\r                                                   \r\n          harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n46 F.3d at 1229-30 (footnote and citations omitted).

Defendant appeals this departure  on\r\n\ntwo grounds:  (1)  that the district court failed  to provide\r\n\nhim  with notice of its planned  departure, as required under\r\n\nFederal  Rule of  Criminal  Procedure 32,  as interpreted  in\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nBurns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129 (1991); and (2) that the\r                                  \r\n\nupward  departure was impermissible as  a matter of  law.  We\r\n\nbegin our analysis with a  recitation of the district court's\r\n\nprocedure at sentencing.\r\n\n          Indicating   that  it  was   following  its  \"usual\r\n\nprocedure,\"  the  district court  stated  that  it would  \"go\r\n\nthrough  mathematically  the requirements  of  the Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines, and if  anyone, government or defense,  disagrees\r\n\nwith the  numbers as I state them . .  . we will then discuss\r\n\nand  resolve  the differences  right  at that  time.\"   After\r\n\nhaving verified  that the  defendant had read  and understood\r\n\nthe Presentence Report (PSR), the district court proceeded to\r\n\ncalculate  the  applicable   Guidelines  sentence,   assisted\r\n\nthroughout by both  the government and defense  counsel.  The\r\n\ndistrict court  scrupulously determined the  applicability of\r\n\neach  guideline and  made  certain that  both government  and\r\n\ndefense agreed on the accuracy of the court's calculations.  \r\n\n          The court then turned  to the question of departure\r\n\nfrom the Guidelines, inviting  argument from both  government\r\n\nand defense.  The government urged an upward departure of two\r\n\nyears on the basis  of defendant's eighteen-month flight from\r\n\njustice.  Defense counsel  argued against departing upward on\r\n\nthe basis of flight, suggesting  that modest credit should be\r\n\ngiven to  defendant for surrendering,  and that consideration\r\n\nshould  be given  to  defendant's age  in weighing  departure\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nupward from an already lengthy sentence.   The district court\r\n\nthen provided  defendant with  an opportunity to  address the\r\n\ncourt,  during  which  defendant  expressed  remorse  for his\r\n\nactions.  The district court then announced the sentence:\r\n\n          [T]his court  sentences you to a total of\r\n          24 years  in  the custody  of the  United\r\n          States Attorney General . . . .\r\n\n               The  total  sentence  of   24  years\r\n          exceeds the maximum on the various counts\r\n          of  which  you  stand  convicted.    And,\r\n          therefore,  it's  appropriate to  explain\r\n          the manner in which the sentence  will be\r\n          calculated and  the  counts on  which  it\r\n          will be calculated.\r\n\n          . . . .\r\n\n               I  depart upward  not on  the ground\r\n          that the government has adverted to; I do\r\n          not punish  you for  a crime,  though you\r\n          admit it  here, for which  you have never\r\n          been  indicted,  and  never been  brought\r\n          before a jury  and never had  the process\r\n          of law.  I depart  upward solely because,\r\n          in my judgment, having presided over this\r\n          case, the egregiousness, evilness of your\r\n          conduct,   on   each   of  the   criteria\r\n          considered  by the  Sentencing Guidelines\r\n          taken in their entirety, takes you out of\r\n          the heartland of the guidelines.\r\n\n               I  adopt  the   argument  that,   in\r\n          effect, you max  out under the guidelines\r\n          at a sentence that undervalues the actual\r\n          criminality of  your conduct if  it is an\r\n          appropriate goal of the  criminal justice\r\n          system to punish.\r\n\n          . . . .\r\n\n               Mr. Mangone,  you've ruined people's\r\n          lives;  lots of  lives, people  you don't\r\n          even know.  Being  sorry to these various\r\n          financial institutions isn't the  half of\r\n          it.  That's  the sentence  of the  Court.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          At the same  time I'm not insensitive  to\r\n          the Draconian nature of this sentence.  I\r\n          believe    it's   appropriate    in   the\r\n          circumstances  and  I arrive  at  it only\r\n          after  most  careful reflection.   That's\r\n          the sentence of the Court.\r\n\n                            Notice\r                                        Notice\r                                              \r\n\n          The PSR  contains  no information  which  could  be\r\n\nconstrued to provide  notice to the defendant that  the court\r\n\nwas   contemplating  an  upward  departure  based  upon  this\r\n\nparticular ground.   In fact, when  the district court  asked\r\n\nthe  government about  the  possibility  that the  Guidelines\r\n\nsentence undervalued defendant's criminality,  the government\r\n\nexpressly stated that \"the guidelines  adequately address the\r\n\nenormity of the offense here.\"\r\n\n          In Burns  the precise question was  whether Fed.

This notice\r\n          must specifically identify the  ground on\r\n          which the district court is contemplating\r\n          an upward departure.\r\n\nId.  at 138-39 (footnote omitted).

As  stated  supra, Burns  requires  that  \"before  a\r                                             \r\n\ndistrict court  can depart upward on a  ground not identified\r\n\nas a  ground for upward  departure either in  the presentence\r\n\nreport or in a prehearing submission by the Government, . . .\r\n\nthe district court [must]  give the parties reasonable notice\r\n\nthat it is  contemplating such a ruling.\"   501 U.S.  at 138.\r\n\nThis rule was completely ignored.\r\n\n          We reject the government's contention that, because\r\n\nthe  PSR  contained  a  full recitation  of  the  defendant's\r\n\ncriminal conduct, this put defendant on notice of the factors\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\non which  the court relied  for the upward departure.   If we\r\n\naccepted the government's theory,  all defendants would be on\r\n\nnotice  as to  any  sua  sponte  departure  so  long  as  the\r                                           \r\n\ndeparture was based  on facts  contained in the  PSR.   Under\r\n\nthat  theory  the  Court's  holding  in  Burns  would  become\r                                                          \r\n\nmeaningless.  \r\n\n          It is  worth noting that the  sentencing facts here\r\n\nare  remarkably similar to those in Burns.   In Burns, at the\r                                                                 \r\n\nconclusion of  the  sentencing hearing,  the  district  court\r\n\nannounced that  it was  departing upward from  the Guidelines\r\n\nsentencing  range,  despite  a  statement  in  the  PSR  that\r\n\n\"'[t]here are  no factors  that would warrant  departure from\r\n\nthe guideline sentence.'\"   Id. at 131 (quoting PSR).   There\r                                           \r\n\nwas a similar statement in the PSR in this case.  \r\n\n          The next question is  whether the rule was \"waived\"\r\n\nor \"forfeited.\"   Olano  teaches that \"[w]aiver  is different\r                                   \r\n\nfrom forfeiture.  Whereas forfeiture  is the failure to  make\r\n\nthe timely assertion of  a right, waiver is the  'intentional\r\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of  a known right.'\"   507 U.S.\r\n\nat 733 (quoting Johnson v.

We  think the error\r                                           \r\n\nhere easily fits within the definition of plain error.\r\n\n          Our  next  inquiry  is   whether  the  plain  error\r\n\naffected  the substantial rights  of the  defendant.

An increase  of two years  in time\r\n\nspent  behind bars  cannot help  but affect  one of  the most\r\n\nprecious  rights  an  individual  has, to  live  in  freedom.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  find  that  the  district  court's  plainly\r\n\nerroneous  departure  affected the    defendant's substantial\r\n\nrights.

Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517,\r                                                           \r\n\n531 (1st Cir.  1996) (finding  a case in  which \"the  claimed\r\n\nerror  could well have an impact on the length of defendant's\r\n\nincarceration\"  to  present  a  \"compelling  case\"  for   the\r\n\napplication of the plain error doctrine).\r\n\n          Our  final  step  in   the  Olano  analysis  is  to\r                                                       \r\n\ndetermine  whether  we  should,   in  our  discretion,  order\r\n\ncorrection  of  this  plain error  that  affects  substantial\r\n\nrights.   As Olano points out, \"Rule 52(b) is permissive, not\r                              \r\n\nmandatory.\"  507 U.S. at 735.  The standard that should guide\r\n\nus  in the exercise of our remedial discretion is whether the\r\n\nerror \"'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nreputation of  judicial proceedings.'\"   Id. at  736 (quoting\r                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States  v.

When  a  district court  fails to  follow a  rule\r\n\nestablished by  the Supreme  Court, even though  such failure\r\n\nwas not intentional, there  is bound to be an  adverse effect\r\n\non the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial\r\n\nproceedings.   Prior  notice is  one  of the  most  zealously\r\n\nguarded rights of criminal defendants.  It is embodied in the\r\n\nDue Process Clause  of the  Fifth Amendment.   In Burns,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\nCourt stated,   \"In this  case, were  we to read  Rule 32  to\r\n\ndispense  with notice,  we would  then have  to confront  the\r\n\nserious question  whether notice in this  setting is mandated\r\n\nby the Due Process Clause.\"   501 U.S. at 138.   The singular\r\n\nimportance of  such notice in  the criminal arena  means that\r\n\ndisregard for it cannot help but have a denigrating effect on\r\n\nthe fairness,  integrity, and public  reputation of  judicial\r\n\nproceedings.\r\n\n          It must be noted  that the district court expressly\r\n\nrefused to depart  upward on the basis of  defendant's flight\r\n\nbefore sentencing.  This was within his discretion.\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing   reasons  the  conviction   is\r\n\naffirmed and the sentence of the district court is reduced by\r\n\ntwo years, the amount of additional time imposed  pursuant to\r\n\nthe  unlawful  upward  departure.    The  total  sentence  of\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nincarceration to be served is twenty-two years.

We relate the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir.1996).  Between December 1985 and March 1991, defendant conspired with James Smith, Robert Cohen, and Ambrose Devaney to defraud two separate lending institutions, the Barnstable Community Federal Credit Union (\"BCCU\") and the Digital Employees Federal Credit Union (\"Digital\").  Defendant, president of Digital and a founder of BCCU, and Smith, a real estate developer and a founder of BCCU, were the primary organizers of the fraud.  Robert Cohen was general counsel to both credit unions.  Ambrose Devaney was a real estate developer on Cape Cod.  This court's affirmance of the convictions and sentences of Smith, Cohen and Devaney is found at United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 176, 133 L.Ed.2d 116 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and Smith used their control over the two credit unions to obtain tens of millions of dollars in loans for their own speculative real estate ventures.  The loans were used in part to finance the purchase of commercial real estate on Cape Cod, usually motel properties or raw land for residential subdivisions.  The loans were, in many instances, funded in amounts far in excess of the purchase price of the property, with much of the excess going directly into the pockets of defendant, Smith, and Devaney.  In order to avoid the credit union's policies restricting \"insider\" loans as well as policies limiting maximum borrowing by an individual, the conspirators formed over a dozen nominee trusts to create the fiction that the loans were going to many different borrowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As president of Digital, which had experienced explosive growth since its founding in 1980, defendant enjoyed the confidence of that credit union's board of directors and staff.  Defendant was therefore able to induce Digital to allocate approximately $20,000,000 for \"investment\" in participation loans with BCCU, without disclosing the fact that defendant himself was one of the ultimate borrowers of those funds.  All of the participation loans were made to trusts owned by defendant and Smith (and in most cases Devaney).  In each instance, the participation loans were funded in amounts far in excess of the actual purchase price of the commercial property.  These excess funds, known as \"pie,\" were siphoned off and diverted to accounts controlled by defendant or Smith for further distribution.  The amount of \"pie\" varied but was generally between $75,000 and $200,000 per partner per loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of the participation loans and for many additional loans, defendant and his co-conspirators concealed their ownership interests by placing in BCCU's and Digital's files phony certificates of beneficial interest, falsely naming certain individuals as beneficiaries of the trusts.  In order to obtain loans well in excess of the purchase price of the property, defendant and Smith forged and altered purchase and sale agreements, often inflating prices by over one million dollars.  For most of the participation loans, defendant, Smith, and Lynn Vasapolle, an unindicted co-conspirator, prepared fake financial statements to create the false impression that the putative borrowers (the \"trustees\") were wealthy individuals capable of repaying the loans being extended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the participation loans were initially closed between December 1985 and October 1988, and were made with \"interest only\" notes for relatively short terms (1-2 years), with a balloon payment of the full principal due upon expiration.  When they were unable to find legitimate buyers to whom they could sell the properties at a profit sufficient to cover both the original purchase price and the excess \"pie\" they had received, the conspirators began to pyramid their loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1986, as loans came due on subdivision properties, Cohen would draw up papers \"selling\" a portion of the original subdivision to a newly created trust.  Defendant and Smith would then cause BCCU to make a loan to the new trust to finance the purchase.  The new loan proceeds would then be used to pay off the proportionate share of the prior loan.  Purchase \"prices\" were again artificially inflated so as to provide cash which was used to cover interest payments on the new loans and to help with debt service on the existing loans.  By March 1991, when BCCU was seized by the National Credit Union Administration, the outstanding balance of the Mangone-Smith-Devaney loans amounted to between forty and sixty million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 1992, defendant, Smith, Cohen, and Devaney were indicted for conspiracy (18 U.S.C. &#167; 371) to commit bank fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344);  unlawful receipt of monies by a credit union officer (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1006);  and money laundering (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957).  The case was tried on a redacted indictment that included a conspiracy count, seven bank fraud counts, seven parallel unlawful receipt counts (which concerned defendant alone) and the money laundering charges.  Defendant was convicted on all counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Defendant fled prior to sentencing and remained at large for eighteen months before he surrendered.  On September 12, 1995, defendant was sentenced to twenty-four years of incarceration after the district court departed upward by two years from the maximum sentence under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>The Bruton Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant appeals his conviction on the basis of alleged error under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).  This issue has already been decided against defendant's co-conspirator Smith, who asserted a factually identical claim of Bruton error in his appeal, which we found to have been harmless error.  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1229-30.   Although we could dispose of defendant's claim on the ground of stare decisis, we provide a brief analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court held in Bruton that, because of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, will look to a codefendant's incriminating extrajudicial statement in determining the defendant's guilt, admission of a codefendant's statement in a joint trial violates the defendant's right of cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  Bruton, 391 U.S. at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 1622-23.   The evidentiary basis for the Bruton claim is as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the last day of trial testimony, co-defendant Cohen called to the stand Professor Richard Huber, an authority on the professional responsibilities of attorneys.  Testifying under the district court's limiting instruction that the testimony was relevant as to Cohen only, and had nothing to do with any of Cohen's co-defendants, Professor Huber reiterated the events of April 4, 1991, when Cohen met with him to obtain advice concerning his representation of BCCU, which by that time was in the hands of federal regulators.  Huber testified that Cohen explained to him that Cohen's clients, \"a former officer of the bank, a former director of the bank, and a bank manager came in and spoke to [Cohen] ... concerning activities that involved them and their work at the bank.\"  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1228.   According to Huber, Cohen stated that \"certain documents had been changed, the information had been changed, figures had been changed, data had been changed, [and] that this had been done after preparation by Mr. Cohen and after they had been presumptively completed.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like Smith before him, defendant asserts that Huber's testimony constitutes reversible Bruton error because it \"expressly implicate[s] the defendant, leaving no doubt that it would prove powerfully incriminating.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration in original).  In Smith, we assumed without deciding that the admission of Huber's testimony constituted Bruton error, but held that any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  46 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), and related cases, defendant argues strenuously that the error was not harmless.  We disagree.  We remain convinced that any Bruton error that may have occurred below<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> was harmless for the reasons stated in Smith:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The jury convicted all the defendants on the conspiracy count, and Cohen on most of the substantive counts.  Even if the jury threw the curative instructions to the wind and considered the stricken testimony as evidence against [Mangone],<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the scenario which implicates Bruton, it could not have believed Cohen's claim that the unnamed clients confessed to him at the close of the conspiracy.  No one confesses to a partner in crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, Cohen's statement might tend to incriminate [Mangone] and Devaney by showing that the coconspirators met to discuss damage control.  In this sense, however, the statement falls far outside the pale of the \"powerfully incriminating\" evidence that produces Bruton errors.  Vasapolle had already testified in detail to the coconspirators' meetings in the wake of the BCCU takeover.  Thus, once Cohen's statement is considered as something other than an account of the codefendants' confessions, it becomes merely cumulative of the government's case and could not have produced Bruton error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right of confrontation ensures that a criminal defendant can cross-examine his or her accusers.  Had Cohen testified to the confession himself, [Mangone's] cross-examination of Cohen would have sought to show that no confession ever occurred.  The verdicts suggest that the jury, if it considered this evidence, found just that.  The jury, even if it disregarded the limiting instructions, plainly did not believe Cohen's claim that his codefendants had confessed to him.  It is clear, therefore, that any Bruton error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">46 F.3d at 1229-30 (footnote and citations omitted).  Because there is no difference between defendant's claim of Bruton error and the Bruton error asserted by Smith in his appeal, we follow the holding of Smith and affirm defendant's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>The Sentencing Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court departed upward by two years from the maximum sentence allowed under the Sentencing Guidelines.  Defendant appeals this departure on two grounds:  (1) that the district court failed to provide him with notice of its planned departure, as required under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, as interpreted in Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991);  and (2) that the upward departure was impermissible as a matter of law.  We begin our analysis with a recitation of the district court's procedure at sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indicating that it was following its \"usual procedure,\" the district court stated that it would \"go through mathematically the requirements of the Sentencing Guidelines, and if anyone, government or defense, disagrees with the numbers as I state them ... we will then discuss and resolve the differences right at that time.\"   After having verified that the defendant had read and understood the Presentence Report (PSR), the district court proceeded to calculate the applicable Guidelines sentence, assisted throughout by both the government and defense counsel.  The district court scrupulously determined the applicability of each guideline and made certain that both government and defense agreed on the accuracy of the court's calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the question of departure from the Guidelines, inviting argument from both government and defense.  The government urged an upward departure of two years on the basis of defendant's eighteen-month flight from justice.  Defense counsel argued against departing upward on the basis of flight, suggesting that modest credit should be given to defendant for surrendering, and that consideration should be given to defendant's age in weighing departure upward from an already lengthy sentence.  The district court then provided defendant with an opportunity to address the court, during which defendant expressed remorse for his actions.  The district court then announced the sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[T]his court sentences you to a total of 24 years in the custody of the United States Attorney General....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The total sentence of 24 years exceeds the maximum on the various counts of which you stand convicted.  And, therefore, it's appropriate to explain the manner in which the sentence will be calculated and the counts on which it will be calculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I depart upward not on the ground that the government has adverted to;  I do not punish you for a crime, though you admit it here, for which you have never been indicted, and never been brought before a jury and never had the process of law.  I depart upward solely because, in my judgment, having presided over this case, the egregiousness, evilness of your conduct, on each of the criteria considered by the Sentencing Guidelines taken in their entirety, takes you out of the heartland of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I adopt the argument that, in effect, you max out under the guidelines at a sentence that undervalues the actual criminality of your conduct if it is an appropriate goal of the criminal justice system to punish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Mangone, you've ruined people's lives;  lots of lives, people you don't even know.  Being sorry to these various financial institutions isn't the half of it.  That's the sentence of the Court.  At the same time I'm not insensitive to the Draconian nature of this sentence.  I believe it's appropriate in the circumstances and I arrive at it only after most careful reflection.  That's the sentence of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR contains no information which could be construed to provide notice to the defendant that the court was contemplating an upward departure based upon this particular ground.  In fact, when the district court asked the government about the possibility that the Guidelines sentence undervalued defendant's criminality, the government expressly stated that \"the guidelines adequately address the enormity of the offense here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Burns the precise question was whether Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a)(1), now 32(c)(1), required the sentencing court to give notice to the parties of its intent to make sua sponte departures from the Guidelines.  Subdivision (c)(1) of Rule 32 does not contain a specific notice provision but requires the district court to afford the parties \" 'an opportunity to comment upon ... matters relating to the appropriate sentence' at the sentencing hearing.\"  Burns, 501 U.S. at 132, 111 S.Ct. at 2184.   The Court observed, \"In our view, it makes no sense to impute to Congress an intent that a defendant have the right to comment on the appropriateness of a sua sponte departure but not the right to be notified that the court is contemplating such a ruling.\"  Id. at 135-36, 111 S.Ct. at 2186.   The Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>before a district court can depart upward on a ground not identified as a ground for upward departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government, Rule 32 requires that the district court give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling.  This notice must specifically identify the ground on which the district court is contemplating an upward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 138-39, 111 S.Ct. at 2187 (footnote omitted).  The Burns rule has been incorporated into an application note to &#167; 6A1.2 of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant challenges the district court's departure on the basis that he was not provided with notice of the court's intention to depart upward.  Because the defendant failed to object to the lack of notice at the sentencing hearing, we review the district court's actions under the rigorous standard of \"plain error\" review.

Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), teaches that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>the authority created by Rule 52(b) is circumscribed.  There must be an \"error\" that is \"plain\" and that \"affect[s] substantial rights.\"   Moreover, Rule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776 (quoting United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)) (other citation omitted) (alteration in original).  We now proceed with our Olano analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There must, first of all, be an \"error.\"  \"Deviation from a legal rule is 'error' unless the rule has been waived.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   There can be no doubt that there was a deviation from a legal rule in this case.  As stated supra, Burns requires that \"before a district court can depart upward on a ground not identified as a ground for upward departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government, ... the district court [must] give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling.\"  501 U.S. at 138, 111 S.Ct. at 2187.   This rule was completely ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the government's contention that, because the PSR contained a full recitation of the defendant's criminal conduct, this put defendant on notice of the factors on which the court relied for the upward departure.  If we accepted the government's theory, all defendants would be on notice as to any sua sponte departure so long as the departure was based on facts contained in the PSR.  Under that theory the Court's holding in Burns would become meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is worth noting that the sentencing facts here are remarkably similar to those in Burns.   In Burns, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the district court announced that it was departing upward from the Guidelines sentencing range, despite a statement in the PSR that \" '[t]here are no factors that would warrant departure from the guideline sentence.' \"  Id. at 131, 111 S.Ct. at 2184 (quoting PSR).  There was a similar statement in the PSR in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether the rule was \"waived\" or \"forfeited.\"  Olano teaches that \"[w]aiver is different from forfeiture.  Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.' \"  507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. at 1777 (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)).  In the case at bar there was a forfeiture, the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, but no waiver.  \"If a legal rule was violated during the district court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an 'error' within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite the absence of a timely objection.\"  507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   We have no difficulty finding error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Olano, we determine whether the error was \"plain,\" which is defined as \"synonymous with 'clear' or, equivalently, 'obvious'.\"  Id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   We think the error here easily fits within the definition of plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our next inquiry is whether the plain error affected the substantial rights of the defendant.  Id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   We think it did.  An increase of two years in time spent behind bars cannot help but affect one of the most precious rights an individual has, to live in freedom.  Accordingly, we find that the district court's plainly erroneous departure affected the defendant's substantial rights.  Cf. United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 531 (1st Cir.1996) (finding a case in which \"the claimed error could well have an impact on the length of defendant's incarceration\" to present a \"compelling case\" for the application of the plain error doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our final step in the Olano analysis is to determine whether we should, in our discretion, order correction of this plain error that affects substantial rights.  As Olano points out, \"Rule 52(b) is permissive, not mandatory.\"  507 U.S. at 735, 113 S.Ct. at 1778.   The standard that should guide us in the exercise of our remedial discretion is whether the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"  Id. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)) (alteration in original).  We think this standard has been met here.  When a district court fails to follow a rule established by the Supreme Court, even though such failure was not intentional, there is bound to be an adverse effect on the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Prior notice is one of the most zealously guarded rights of criminal defendants.  It is embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In Burns, the Court stated, \"In this case, were we to read Rule 32 to dispense with notice, we would then have to confront the serious question whether notice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause.\"  501 U.S. at 138, 111 S.Ct. at 2187.   The singular importance of such notice in the criminal arena means that disregard for it cannot help but have a denigrating effect on the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must be noted that the district court expressly refused to depart upward on the basis of defendant's flight before sentencing.

Wihbey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196557\"><a href=\"/opinion/196557/united-states-v-wihbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 764 (1st Cir.1996).  Between December 1985 and March 1991, defendant conspired with James Smith, Robert Cohen, and Ambrose Devaney to defraud two separate lending institutions, the Barnstable Community Federal Credit Union (\"BCCU\") and the Digital Employees Federal Credit Union (\"Digital\").  Defendant, president of Digital and a founder of BCCU, and Smith, a real estate developer and a founder of BCCU, were the primary organizers of the fraud.  Robert Cohen was general counsel to both credit unions.  Ambrose Devaney was a real estate developer on Cape Cod.  This court's affirmance of the convictions and sentences of Smith, Cohen and Devaney is found at United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195903\"><a href=\"/opinion/195903/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span> (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></span> (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and Smith used their control over the two credit unions to obtain tens of millions of dollars in loans for their own speculative real estate ventures.  The loans were used in part to finance the purchase of commercial real estate on Cape Cod, usually motel properties or raw land for residential subdivisions.  The loans were, in many instances, funded in amounts far in excess of the purchase price of the property, with much of the excess going directly into the pockets of defendant, Smith, and Devaney.  In order to avoid the credit union's policies restricting \"insider\" loans as well as policies limiting maximum borrowing by an individual, the conspirators formed over a dozen nominee trusts to create the fiction that the loans were going to many different borrowers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As president of Digital, which had experienced explosive growth since its founding in 1980, defendant enjoyed the confidence of that credit union's board of directors and staff.  Defendant was therefore able to induce Digital to allocate approximately $20,000,000 for \"investment\" in participation loans with BCCU, without disclosing the fact that defendant himself was one of the ultimate borrowers of those funds.  All of the participation loans were made to trusts owned by defendant and Smith (and in most cases Devaney).  In each instance, the participation loans were funded in amounts far in excess of the actual purchase price of the commercial property.  These excess funds, known as \"pie,\" were siphoned off and diverted to accounts controlled by defendant or Smith for further distribution.  The amount of \"pie\" varied but was generally between $75,000 and $200,000 per partner per loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of the participation loans and for many additional loans, defendant and his co-conspirators concealed their ownership interests by placing in BCCU's and Digital's files phony certificates of beneficial interest, falsely naming certain individuals as beneficiaries of the trusts.  In order to obtain loans well in excess of the purchase price of the property, defendant and Smith forged and altered purchase and sale agreements, often inflating prices by over one million dollars.  For most of the participation loans, defendant, Smith, and Lynn Vasapolle, an unindicted co-conspirator, prepared fake financial statements to create the false impression that the putative borrowers (the \"trustees\") were wealthy individuals capable of repaying the loans being extended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the participation loans were initially closed between December 1985 and October 1988, and were made with \"interest only\" notes for relatively short terms (1-2 years), with a balloon payment of the full principal due upon expiration.  When they were unable to find legitimate buyers to whom they could sell the properties at a profit sufficient to cover both the original purchase price and the excess \"pie\" they had received, the conspirators began to pyramid their loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1986, as loans came due on subdivision properties, Cohen would draw up papers \"selling\" a portion of the original subdivision to a newly created trust.  Defendant and Smith would then cause BCCU to make a loan to the new trust to finance the purchase.  The new loan proceeds would then be used to pay off the proportionate share of the prior loan.  Purchase \"prices\" were again artificially inflated so as to provide cash which was used to cover interest payments on the new loans and to help with debt service on the existing loans.  By March 1991, when BCCU was seized by the National Credit Union Administration, the outstanding balance of the Mangone-Smith-Devaney loans amounted to between forty and sixty million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 1992, defendant, Smith, Cohen, and Devaney were indicted for conspiracy (18 U.S.C. &#167; 371) to commit bank fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344);  unlawful receipt of monies by a credit union officer (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1006);  and money laundering (18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957).  The case was tried on a redacted indictment that included a conspiracy count, seven bank fraud counts, seven parallel unlawful receipt counts (which concerned defendant alone) and the money laundering charges.  Defendant was convicted on all counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Defendant fled prior to sentencing and remained at large for eighteen months before he surrendered.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span> (1968).  This issue has already been decided against defendant's co-conspirator Smith, who asserted a factually identical claim of Bruton error in his appeal, which we found to have been harmless error.  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1229-30.   Although we could dispose of defendant's claim on the ground of stare decisis, we provide a brief analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court held in Bruton that, because of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, will look to a codefendant's incriminating extrajudicial statement in determining the defendant's guilt, admission of a codefendant's statement in a joint trial violates the defendant's right of cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  Bruton, 391 U.S. at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 1622-23.   The evidentiary basis for the Bruton claim is as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the last day of trial testimony, co-defendant Cohen called to the stand Professor Richard Huber, an authority on the professional responsibilities of attorneys.  Testifying under the district court's limiting instruction that the testimony was relevant as to Cohen only, and had nothing to do with any of Cohen's co-defendants, Professor Huber reiterated the events of April 4, 1991, when Cohen met with him to obtain advice concerning his representation of BCCU, which by that time was in the hands of federal regulators.  Huber testified that Cohen explained to him that Cohen's clients, \"a former officer of the bank, a former director of the bank, and a bank manager came in and spoke to [Cohen] ... concerning activities that involved them and their work at the bank.\"  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1228.   According to Huber, Cohen stated that \"certain documents had been changed, the information had been changed, figures had been changed, data had been changed, [and] that this had been done after preparation by Mr. Cohen and after they had been presumptively completed.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like Smith before him, defendant asserts that Huber's testimony constitutes reversible Bruton error because it \"expressly implicate[s] the defendant, leaving no doubt that it would prove powerfully incriminating.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration in original).  In Smith, we assumed without deciding that the admission of Huber's testimony constituted Bruton error, but held that any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  46 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on Chapman v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span> (1967), and related cases, defendant argues strenuously that the error was not harmless.  We disagree.  We remain convinced that any Bruton error that may have occurred below<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> was harmless for the reasons stated in Smith:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The jury convicted all the defendants on the conspiracy count, and Cohen on most of the substantive counts.  Even if the jury threw the curative instructions to the wind and considered the stricken testimony as evidence against [Mangone],<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the scenario which implicates Bruton, it could not have believed Cohen's claim that the unnamed clients confessed to him at the close of the conspiracy.  No one confesses to a partner in crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, Cohen's statement might tend to incriminate [Mangone] and Devaney by showing that the coconspirators met to discuss damage control.  In this sense, however, the statement falls far outside the pale of the \"powerfully incriminating\" evidence that produces Bruton errors.  Vasapolle had already testified in detail to the coconspirators' meetings in the wake of the BCCU takeover.  Thus, once Cohen's statement is considered as something other than an account of the codefendants' confessions, it becomes merely cumulative of the government's case and could not have produced Bruton error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right of confrontation ensures that a criminal defendant can cross-examine his or her accusers.  Had Cohen testified to the confession himself, [Mangone's] cross-examination of Cohen would have sought to show that no confession ever occurred.  The verdicts suggest that the jury, if it considered this evidence, found just that.  The jury, even if it disregarded the limiting instructions, plainly did not believe Cohen's claim that his codefendants had confessed to him.  It is clear, therefore, that any Bruton error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">46 F.3d at 1229-30 (footnote and citations omitted).  Because there is no difference between defendant's claim of Bruton error and the Bruton error asserted by Smith in his appeal, we follow the holding of Smith and affirm defendant's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>The Sentencing Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court departed upward by two years from the maximum sentence allowed under the Sentencing Guidelines.  Defendant appeals this departure on two grounds:  (1) that the district court failed to provide him with notice of its planned departure, as required under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, as interpreted in Burns v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We begin our analysis with a recitation of the district court's procedure at sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indicating that it was following its \"usual procedure,\" the district court stated that it would \"go through mathematically the requirements of the Sentencing Guidelines, and if anyone, government or defense, disagrees with the numbers as I state them ... we will then discuss and resolve the differences right at that time.\"   After having verified that the defendant had read and understood the Presentence Report (PSR), the district court proceeded to calculate the applicable Guidelines sentence, assisted throughout by both the government and defense counsel.  The district court scrupulously determined the applicability of each guideline and made certain that both government and defense agreed on the accuracy of the court's calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the question of departure from the Guidelines, inviting argument from both government and defense.  The government urged an upward departure of two years on the basis of defendant's eighteen-month flight from justice.  Defense counsel argued against departing upward on the basis of flight, suggesting that modest credit should be given to defendant for surrendering, and that consideration should be given to defendant's age in weighing departure upward from an already lengthy sentence.  The district court then provided defendant with an opportunity to address the court, during which defendant expressed remorse for his actions.  The district court then announced the sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[T]his court sentences you to a total of 24 years in the custody of the United States Attorney General....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The total sentence of 24 years exceeds the maximum on the various counts of which you stand convicted.  And, therefore, it's appropriate to explain the manner in which the sentence will be calculated and the counts on which it will be calculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I depart upward not on the ground that the government has adverted to;  I do not punish you for a crime, though you admit it here, for which you have never been indicted, and never been brought before a jury and never had the process of law.  I depart upward solely because, in my judgment, having presided over this case, the egregiousness, evilness of your conduct, on each of the criteria considered by the Sentencing Guidelines taken in their entirety, takes you out of the heartland of the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I adopt the argument that, in effect, you max out under the guidelines at a sentence that undervalues the actual criminality of your conduct if it is an appropriate goal of the criminal justice system to punish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Mangone, you've ruined people's lives;  lots of lives, people you don't even know.  Being sorry to these various financial institutions isn't the half of it.  That's the sentence of the Court.  At the same time I'm not insensitive to the Draconian nature of this sentence.  I believe it's appropriate in the circumstances and I arrive at it only after most careful reflection.  That's the sentence of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR contains no information which could be construed to provide notice to the defendant that the court was contemplating an upward departure based upon this particular ground.  In fact, when the district court asked the government about the possibility that the Guidelines sentence undervalued defendant's criminality, the government expressly stated that \"the guidelines adequately address the enormity of the offense here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Burns the precise question was whether Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a)(1), now 32(c)(1), required the sentencing court to give notice to the parties of its intent to make sua sponte departures from the Guidelines.  Subdivision (c)(1) of Rule 32 does not contain a specific notice provision but requires the district court to afford the parties \" 'an opportunity to comment upon ... matters relating to the appropriate sentence' at the sentencing hearing.\"  Burns, 501 U.S. at 132, 111 S.Ct. at 2184.   The Court observed, \"In our view, it makes no sense to impute to Congress an intent that a defendant have the right to comment on the appropriateness of a sua sponte departure but not the right to be notified that the court is contemplating such a ruling.\"  Id. at 135-36, 111 S.Ct. at 2186.   The Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>before a district court can depart upward on a ground not identified as a ground for upward departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government, Rule 32 requires that the district court give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling.  This notice must specifically identify the ground on which the district court is contemplating an upward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 138-39, 111 S.Ct. at 2187 (footnote omitted).  The Burns rule has been incorporated into an application note to &#167; 6A1.2 of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant challenges the district court's departure on the basis that he was not provided with notice of the court's intention to depart upward.  Because the defendant failed to object to the lack of notice at the sentencing hearing, we review the district court's actions under the rigorous standard of \"plain error\" review.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1985)) (other citation omitted) (alteration in original).  We now proceed with our Olano analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There must, first of all, be an \"error.\"  \"Deviation from a legal rule is 'error' unless the rule has been waived.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   There can be no doubt that there was a deviation from a legal rule in this case.  As stated supra, Burns requires that \"before a district court can depart upward on a ground not identified as a ground for upward departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government, ... the district court [must] give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling.\"  501 U.S. at 138, 111 S.Ct. at 2187.   This rule was completely ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the government's contention that, because the PSR contained a full recitation of the defendant's criminal conduct, this put defendant on notice of the factors on which the court relied for the upward departure.  If we accepted the government's theory, all defendants would be on notice as to any sua sponte departure so long as the departure was based on facts contained in the PSR.  Under that theory the Court's holding in Burns would become meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is worth noting that the sentencing facts here are remarkably similar to those in Burns.   In Burns, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the district court announced that it was departing upward from the Guidelines sentencing range, despite a statement in the PSR that \" '[t]here are no factors that would warrant departure from the guideline sentence.' \"  Id. at 131, 111 S.Ct. at 2184 (quoting PSR).  There was a similar statement in the PSR in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether the rule was \"waived\" or \"forfeited.\"  Olano teaches that \"[w]aiver is different from forfeiture.  Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.' \"  507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. at 1777 (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 464, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span>, 1023, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></a></span> (1938)).  In the case at bar there was a forfeiture, the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, but no waiver.  \"If a legal rule was violated during the district court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an 'error' within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite the absence of a timely objection.\"  507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   We have no difficulty finding error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Olano, we determine whether the error was \"plain,\" which is defined as \"synonymous with 'clear' or, equivalently, 'obvious'.\"  Id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   We think the error here easily fits within the definition of plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our next inquiry is whether the plain error affected the substantial rights of the defendant.  Id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   We think it did.  An increase of two years in time spent behind bars cannot help but affect one of the most precious rights an individual has, to live in freedom.  Accordingly, we find that the district court's plainly erroneous departure affected the defendant's substantial rights.  Cf. United States v. Miranda-Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 531 (1st Cir.1996) (finding a case in which \"the claimed error could well have an impact on the length of defendant's incarceration\" to present a \"compelling case\" for the application of the plain error doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our final step in the Olano analysis is to determine whether we should, in our discretion, order correction of this plain error that affects substantial rights.  As Olano points out, \"Rule 52(b) is permissive, not mandatory.\"  507 U.S. at 735, 113 S.Ct. at 1778.   The standard that should guide us in the exercise of our remedial discretion is whether the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"  Id. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102591\"><a href=\"/opinion/102591/united-states-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 160, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102591\"><a href=\"/opinion/102591/united-states-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102591\"><a href=\"/opinion/102591/united-states-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span> (1936)) (alteration in original).  We think this standard has been met here.  When a district court fails to follow a rule established by the Supreme Court, even though such failure was not intentional, there is bound to be an adverse effect on the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.  Prior notice is one of the most zealously guarded rights of criminal defendants.  It is embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In Burns, the Court stated, \"In this case, were we to read Rule 32 to dispense with notice, we would then have to confront the serious question whether notice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause.\"  501 U.S. at 138, 111 S.Ct. at 2187.   The singular importance of such notice in the criminal arena means that disregard for it cannot help but have a denigrating effect on the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must be noted that the district court expressly refused to depart upward on the basis of defendant's flight before sentencing.  This was within his discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded to the District Court for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So Ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Smith was also convicted on all counts.
