Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Juan A. Hernandez Rivera and Raymond Rivera Esteves on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n   Guillermo Gill, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza Toro,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, Arthur J. Fried, General Counsel,\r\nCharlotte J. Hardnett, Principal Deputy General Counsel, John M.\r\nSacchetti, Associate General Counsel, Litigation Division, and\r\nEileen A. Farmer, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Social\r\nSecurity Administration, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOCTOBER 7, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  In this Social Security appeal, claimant\r\nMatilde Matos-Cruz seeks to challenge an agency decision\r\nrefusing to reinstate her request for an administrative\r\nhearing.  We agree with the district court that subject-matter\r\njurisdiction is lacking to review such a ruling.  We therefore\r\naffirm the judgment of dismissal.\r\n    In 1994, at age 36, claimant filed a claim for child's\r\ninsurance benefits as the adult child of a deceased wage\r\nearner, alleging that she had been disabled since birth. \r\nFollowing a preliminary denial of her claim, claimant requested\r\na hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\").  Such a\r\nhearing commenced as scheduled on December 6, 1995.  Yet during\r\nthe course thereof, with the advice of counsel, claimant\r\nswitched gears and filed a written withdrawal of her hearing\r\nrequest--having come to believe that, because of her marriage\r\nat age 16, she was statutorily ineligible for benefits.  The\r\nALJ issued a notice of dismissal six days later pursuant to 20\r\nC.F.R.  404.957(a).\r\n    At some point thereafter, claimant and her counsel came to\r\nthe conclusion that they had been mistaken--that, because\r\nclaimant had been \"left single\" before age 22, she was in fact\r\neligible for child's benefits.  Accordingly, on January 11,\r\n1996, claimant asked the Appeals Council to vacate the ALJ's\r\ndismissal of her hearing request and reinstate her application. \r\nShe there recounted the evolution in her legal position, while\r\nalso explaining that the change in her marital status had not\r\nearlier been revealed due to unidentified \"mental limitations.\" \r\nThe Appeals Council was unpersuaded.  Finding no \"good cause\"\r\nfor the request as required by 20 C.F.R.  404.960, it declined\r\nto vacate the dismissal.\r\n    Claimant filed the instant action under 42 U.S.C.  405(g)\r\nin order to challenge this ruling.  The Commissioner responded\r\nwith a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, contending\r\non the basis of Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977), that\r\nthe agency decision was not subject to review.  The district\r\ncourt agreed and summarily dismissed the case.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n    Under  405(g), judicial review is limited to \"any final\r\ndecision of the Secretary made after a hearing.\"  In Sanders,\r\nthe Court held that the Commissioner's discretionary decision\r\nnot to reopen a claim for benefits did not fall within this\r\nprovision and so was unreviewable (absent a colorable\r\nconstitutional challenge).  See 430 U.S. at 107-09.  The same\r\nconclusion has been reached with respect to the dismissal of a\r\nhearing request.  This is so whether such a dismissal occurred\r\nbecause res judicata was thought applicable, see, e.g., Rios v.\r\nSecretary of HEW, 614 F.2d 25, 26 (1st Cir. 1980); Matos v.\r\nSecretary of HEW, 581 F.2d 282, 286-87 (1st Cir. 1978), because\r\nthe hearing request was deemed inexcusably untimely, see, e.g.,\r\nHilmes v. Secretary of HHS, 983 F.2d 67, 69-70 (6th Cir. 1993),\r\nor because claimant was absent from the hearing without good\r\ncause, see, e.g., Brandyburg v. Sullivan, 959 F.2d 555, 558-62\r\n(6th Cir. 1992); Doe v. Secretary of HHS, 744 F.2d 3, 4-5 (1st\r\nCir. 1984) (per curiam).  Here, where the Commissioner declined\r\nto set aside the voluntary withdrawal of a hearing request,\r\nthere is no reason not to apply the same rule.  Cf. Hilmes, 983\r\nF.2d at 70 (\"the reason for the dismissal of the hearing\r\nrequest--so long as it does not implicate constitutional\r\nconcerns--does not appear to affect the analysis\"). \r\n    The arguments advanced by claimant do not call for a\r\ndifferent result.  She attempts to invoke the exception for\r\nconstitutional claims--by contending that the procedures here\r\nwere \"so fundamentally unfair\" as to constitute a due process\r\nviolation--but provides no supporting argumentation.  Her\r\nreliance on a regulation governing the withdrawal of benefit\r\napplications is unhelpful.  Her assertion that the Appeals\r\nCouncil's ruling constituted a \"final decision\" overlooks the\r\nstatutory mandate that only a decision \"made after a hearing\"\r\nis appealable.  And the fact that her hearing request was\r\nwithdrawn after the hearing had commenced is without\r\nsignificance.  Cf. Rios, 614 F.2d at 26 (hearing held by ALJ to\r\nconsider new evidence prior to dismissal of hearing request on\r\nres judicata grounds held not to be \"a 'hearing' within the\r\nmeaning of  405(g)\"). \r\n    Affirmed.\r\n",
