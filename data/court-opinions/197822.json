See Neitzke  v. Williams, 490\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 319, 327-28 (1989) (a legally frivolous complaint is one\r\n\nwhich  is based on \"an indisputably meritless legal theory\").\r\n\nThe judgment  of  that court  is therefore  affirmed for  the\r\n\nreason stated by  the court in its Memorandum,  dated June 2,\r\n\n1997.   We  add that  the following  claims also  are legally\r\n\nfrivolous.\r\n\n          1.   As with the complaint, appellant's claim under\r\n\nthe  Americans with  Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),  42 U.S.C.   \r\n\n12131 et seq.,  is \"inextricably intertwined\" with  the state\r\n\ncourt judgments regarding  the denial of her  application for\r\n\naccidental  disability   retirement  benefits.     That   is,\r\n\nentertaining the claim would require a lower federal court to\r\n\nreview the state court  judgments.  This is prohibited  under\r\n\nthe  Rooker-Feldman doctrine.  See District of Columbia Court\r                                                                         \r\n\nof Appeals  v.

Even  if  appellant's  Title  VII  claim  were\r\n\namended  to name  the  proper defendant,  it  still would  be\r\n\nlegally frivolous.   That is, nowhere in her  response to the\r\n\norder to show cause, in her brief  filed in this court, or in\r\n\nher state  brief is there  any indication that anyone  at the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nCommission  discriminated against her  on the basis  of race,\r\n\ncolor,  religion, gender, or national origin -- the practices\r\n\noutlawed by Title VII.  See 42 U.S.C.    2000e-2(a).  Indeed,\r                                       \r\n\nwhat does appear  clearly from appellant's pleadings  is that\r\n\nher former supervisors had conflicts with appellant and that,\r\n\nat least in appellant's view, these conflicts were due to the\r\n\nresentment of  one  of the  supervisors  over the  hiring  of\r\n\nappellant as  a counselor before that supervisor was hired as\r\n\none.  Personnel actions motivated by personality conflicts or\r\n\ncronyism do  not  violate  Title  VII.    See  DeNovellis  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nShalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                   \r\n\n          3.   To  the extent  that  appellant is  asserting,\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.    1983, that the  discrimination she endured\r\n\nwhile employed at the  Commission violated her constitutional\r\n\nrights,  her  cause of  action  is barred  by  the three-year\r\n\nstatute of limitations.  See Street  v. Vose, 936 F.2d 38, 39\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1991) (per  curiam) (the  Massachusetts three-year\r\n\nstatute  of limitations  applies to     1983 actions,  citing\r\n\nM.G.L.c. 260,     2A).   Appellant's  claim accrued,  at  the\r\n\nlatest,  in August  1987,  when she  became  disabled by  the\r\n\ndiscrimination and quit work.  See id. at 40 (the limitations\r                                                  \r\n\nperiod begins to run when a plaintiff \"knows or has reason to\r\n\nknow  of  the injury  which  is  the  basis of  the  action\")\r\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, any  \r\n\n1983  action  challenging  what happened  during  appellant's\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ntenure at  the Commission  should have been  filed by  August\r\n\n1990 in order to be considered timely.\r\n\n          4.   Finally, in her response to  the order to show\r\n\ncause  why the complaint  should not be  dismissed, appellant\r\n\nmade   conclusory   allegations   that   the   discrimination\r\n\n\"continued\"  after she  left  the  Commission  and  still  is\r\n\nongoing.    Appellant,  however,  nowhere  identified  anyone\r\n\nresponsible for  this harassment.  Where a complaint fails to\r\n\nname the individual  defendants by name the  complaint should\r\n\nnot  be dismissed  as frivolous  \"if  the allegations  in the\r                                                                         \r\n\ncomplaint allow for  the specific persons to  be subsequently\r                                                                         \r\n\nidentified with reasonable certainty.\"  Smith-Bey v.

See id. at 758  (a court is not  required to\r                                    \r\n\n\"invent factual scenarios that cannot be reasonably  inferred\r\n\nfrom the  pleadings\").
