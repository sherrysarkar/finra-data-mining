In this  appeal  from his  sentence, Jose\r                            \r\n\nGuzman raises three issues which  he concedes were not raised\r\n\nin  the district  court.  Accordingly,  \"his sentence  can be\r\n\nreversed on  [these grounds]  only upon  a showing  of 'plain\r\n\nerror.'\" United  States v.

After careful  review of the record, we conclude\r\n\nthat appellant has failed to make such a showing with respect\r\n\nto any of the issues he raises on appeal.  \r\n\n     The  district   court  adopted   the  undisputed   facts\r\n\ncontained in the  PSR, as permitted by Fed.R.Crim.P.  32.

See U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c) and note (D).\r                            \r\n\n     Nor does appellant's new sentencing factor  manipulation\r\n\nclaim   provide  a   basis   for  reversing   his   sentence.\r\n\n\"[S]entencing factor  manipulation is  a claim  only for  the\r\n\nextreme and unusual case.\" United  States v.

As  we reasoned in  a recent case  in\r\n\nwhich a similar claim was  made, \"[g]overnment agents are not\r\n\nlimited to replicating a suspect's largest unsolicited crime.\r\n\nIn this case, the full  contours of the criminal operation --\r\n\nits size,  techniques, personnel  -- were,  like an  iceberg,\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nlargely  submerged;   and  the  means  of   exploration  were\r\n\nadditional and  larger transactions.  . .  .
