RODRIGUEZ,\r\n\n                  Petitioner, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n                UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\n                  Respondent, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Juan E. Rodriguez on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Theodore B.\r\nHeinrich, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 4, 1998\r\n\n             Per Curiam.  Petitioner Juan Rodriguez, a resident\r\nalien from the Dominican Republic, appeals from the denial of\r\nhis petition for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C.  2255.  In\r\n1995, he pled guilty to a pair of drug offenses and was\r\nsentenced to a mandatory term of ten years in prison; included\r\nin the judgment was a recommendation that he be immediately\r\ndeported if such a course was consistent with the Attorney\r\nGeneral's policies.  The principal claim now advanced is that\r\ntrial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by improperly\r\npersuading petitioner not to appeal from that conviction,\r\nthereby precluding appellate review of various sentencing\r\nissues.  In particular, counsel is alleged to have \"assured\"\r\npetitioner that he would be immediately deported and that an\r\nappeal was thus unnecessary.  The district court dismissed the\r\npetition without a hearing.  We affirm substantially for the\r\nreasons enumerated in the court's decision, adding only the\r\nfollowing comments.\r\n         Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, this is not a\r\ncase of failure on the part of counsel to file a requested\r\nnotice of appeal.  See, e.g., Bonneau v. United States, 961\r\nF.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Tajeddini, 945 F.2d\r\n458, 466-69 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).  No matter how his\r\nallegations are construed, it is clear that petitioner\r\neventually acquiesced in his lawyer's advice--i.e., that he\r\nagreed to waive his right to appeal.  Instead, the central\r\nissue is whether such advice was so misplaced as to render that\r\nwaiver invalid.  \r\n         The district court properly dismissed the petition on\r\nits face.  At sentencing, the court had emphasized that any\r\nearly deportation was subject to the discretion of the Attorney\r\nGeneral and was far from certain.  The remarks supposedly\r\nvoiced by counsel to his client, just moments later, that\r\nimminent deportation was assured would have been directly at\r\nodds with the court's pronouncements.  Indeed, it defies\r\ncredulity that experienced counsel would have made such a\r\npromise under the circumstances.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nMcGill, 11 F.3d 223, 226 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that\r\nhabeas petition may be dismissed without an evidentiary hearing\r\nwhere the key factual averments \"contradict the record\" or are\r\n\"inherently incredible\").  We have considered a more plausible\r\nscenario never specifically articulated by petitioner--that\r\ncounsel simply predicted that early deportation was likely--and\r\nhave concluded that no Sixth Amendment violation would obtain\r\nin that situation either.  We also note that petitioner has\r\nvoiced no complaint on appeal regarding the court's refusal to\r\nhold an evidentiary hearing.\r\n         Petitioner's sentencing challenges are devoid of\r\nmerit in any event.  The record fully supports the court's\r\ndetermination that the \"safety valve\" provision was\r\ninapplicable due to petitioner's failure to make full\r\ndisclosure.  See 18 U.S.C.  3553(f); U.S.S.G.  5C1.2.  Such\r\na finding is reviewed only for clear error, see, e.g., United\r\nStates v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 73 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997); we\r\nperceive no error of any sort.  Petitioner's remaining claims\r\nhave been waived on appeal and are, in any event, likewise\r\nlacking in merit.\r\n         Affirmed.\n",
