Gaskins has filed a request for a\r\ncertificate of appealability (COA) from the district court's denial\r\nof his habeas petition as time-barred.  Gaskins' COA request\r\npresents two issues: (1) whether there exists a grace period in\r\nwhich to file a habeas petition, i.e., whether the one year\r\nlimitations period, see 28 U.S.C.  2244 (d)(1) (1996), runs from\r\nApril 24, 1996, the date of the enactment of the Antiterrorism and\r\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132 (1996)\r\n(\"AEDPA\") and (2) assuming the existence of a grace period, whether\r\nit was tolled during the time in which Gaskins' motion for\r\ncollateral review was pending in the state courts, see 28 U.S.C. \r\n2244(d)(2) (1996).\r\n\nBy order dated May 7, 1999, we granted a COA.  We invited the\r\nrespondent to respond to our preliminary conclusion that a remand\r\nmay be warranted.  We have received that response and now resolve\r\nthis appeal.\r\n\nAs to issue (1), the district court concluded, in Gaskins'\r\nfavor, that a one year grace period (running from AEDPA's effective\r\ndate) existed in which to file a habeas petition.  We have now\r\njoined our sister circuits in holding that, for causes of action\r\naccruing before the effective date of AEDPA (as, for example,\r\nconvictions that became final before April 24, 1996), there is a\r\none year grace period running from that date in which to file a\r\nmotion pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255.  Rogers v. United States, No.\r\n98-2215, slip op. at 9-14 (1st Cir. June 17, 1999).  Although the\r\ninstant case involves a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner\r\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2254, the reasoning of Rogers supporting\r\nthe recognition of this grace period controls here as well.  Id.;\r\nsee also Libby v. Magnusson, No. 98-1067, slip op. at 7 (1st Cir.\r\nMay 24, 1999) (acknowledging, in dicta, that the courts have\r\ngenerally recognized a one year grace period).  We, therefore,\r\naffirm the district court's conclusion on issue (1).\r\n\nAs to issue (2), the district court concluded that,\r\nnotwithstanding the applicability of a one year grace period,\r\nGaskins' habeas petition was nonetheless untimely because, in the\r\ncourt's view, the pendency of Gaskins' motion for state collateral\r\nrelief was irrelevant to the statute of limitations analysis.  We\r\ndisagree with the district court as to this issue and vacate its\r\norder denying Gaskins' habeas petition as time-barred and remand to\r\nthe district court for consideration of the habeas petition on the\r\nmerits.\r\n\nThe district court may have overlooked 28 U.S.C.  2244(d)(2),\r\nwhich provides that \"[t]he time during which a properly filed\r\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\r\nwith respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall\r\nnot be counted toward any period of limitation under this\r\nsubsection [setting forth the one year period of limitation].\"  The\r\none year period of limitations began running on April 25, 1996, the\r\nday after AEDPA's enactment.  It ran for 319 days until March 10,\r\n1997, when Gaskins filed a motion for new trial in the state\r\nsuperior court.  The period of limitations then was suspended\r\nduring pendency of that motion.  The new trial motion was denied by\r\nthe superior court on May 8, 1997.  On May 13, 1997, Gaskins timely\r\nmoved for leave to appeal that decision to the Supreme Judicial\r\nCourt.  The SJC denied leave to appeal on June 3, 1997.  The\r\nrunning of the limitations period then resumed for an additional 28\r\ndays for a total of 347 days, until July 2, 1997, when Gaskins\r\nfiled his habeas petition in federal court.  By this calculation,\r\ntherefore, Gaskins filed his federal habeas petition within the one\r\nyear grace period excluding the period during which his application\r\nfor state collateral review was pending.  The district court's\r\nconclusion that Gaskins' habeas petition was time-barred is\r\nerroneous.\r\n\nAlthough respondent argues that the tolling provision of \r\n2244(d)(2) ought not to apply to the one year grace period, every\r\ncircuit court that has addressed this issue has applied \r\n2244(d)(2)'s tolling provision to the one year grace period.  See\r\nFields v. Johnson, 159 F.3d 914, 916 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam);\r\nGendron v. United States, 154 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir. 1998) (per\r\ncuriam) (resolving consolidated case of state habeas petitioner),\r\ncert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1758 (1999); Hoggro v. Boone, 150 F.3d at\r\n1226-27; Lovasz v. Vaughn, 134 F.3d 146, 149 (3d Cir. 1998).  And,\r\nour own opinion in Libby suggests, albeit in dicta, that we would\r\napply the tolling provision of  2244(d)(2) to the one year grace\r\nperiod.  See Libby v. Magnusson, slip op. at 11 &amp; n.2.  Applying\r\nthe tolling provision encourages respect for the principle of\r\ncomity and compliance with the requirement that, ordinarily, a\r\nstate prisoner must first exhaust his state court remedies before\r\nseeking federal habeas relief. \r\n\nThe respondent cites certain district court cases in support\r\nof its position.  To the extent that these cases stand for the\r\nproposition that the tolling provision of  2244(d)(2) does not\r\napply to the one year grace period, we do not find them persuasive.\r\nMoreover, these cases appear to be questionable authority in light\r\nof later circuit court decisions.  And, the recent trend, even\r\namong district courts, is to apply the tolling provision of \r\n2244(d)(2) to the one year grace period.  See, e.g., Diaz v.\r\nMantello,     F.Supp.2d    , 1999 WL 258485 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 29,\r\n1999) (collecting cases); see also Hudson v. Jones, 35 F.Supp.2d\r\n986, 988-89 (E.D.Mich. 1999); Healy v. DiPaolo, 981 F.Supp. 705,\r\n706-08 (D.Mass. 1997).\r\n\nAccordingly, the district court order of July 28, 1997 is\r\nvacated and the matter is remanded to the district court for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this decision.\r\n\nIt is so ordered.\r\n\n                              By the Court:\r\n                                                                 PHOEBE MORSE,                  \r\n                              Clerk.\r\n\n     [cc: Mr. Gaskins, Mr. Duensing &amp; Ms Neaves]\r\n",

While the procedural issues in question are not constitutional, this           court has power to consider such preliminary procedural rulings where they are predicates to consideration of a           constitutional issue. See Nichols v. Bowersox, 172 F.3d 1068, 1070 n.2 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc); cf. Thomas           v. Greiner, 174 F.3d 260, 260 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam). Numerous courts, in fact, have simply granted           COAs on the timeliness issue without discussing whether the requirement of &#167; 2253(c)(2) has been met. See,           e.g., Flanagan v.

There is, as yet, no firm trend on the issue whether           \"a properly filed application\" for collateral review is \"pending\" during the period that the state appeal petition is           being prepared. Compare Barnett v. Lemaster, 167 F.3d 1321, 1323 (10th Cir. 1999) (tolling the preparation           period) and Hudson v. Jones, 35 F.Supp.2d 986, 988-89 (E.D.Mich. 1999) (similar) with Moseley v. French,           961 F. Supp. 889, 892 (M.D. N.C. 1997) (not excluding preparation period). We need not definitively resolve           whether the time for preparing a petition for appellate review of the denial of a request for collateral relief should           be excluded from period of limitations pursuant to &#167; 2244(d)(2). We have excluded those four days in the instant           case, but note that, even were we to count those days, Gaskins' habeas petition would be timely as only 351           days would have run prior to Gaskins' filing of his federal habeas petition.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We, therefore, affirm the district court's Conclusion           on issue (1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to issue (2), the district court concluded that, notwithstanding the applicability of a one year grace period,           Gaskins' habeas petition was nonetheless untimely because, in the court's view, the pendency of Gaskins' motion           for state collateral relief was irrelevant to the statute of limitations analysis. We disagree with the district court as           to this issue and vacate its order denying Gaskins' habeas petition as time-barred and remand to the district court           for consideration of the habeas petition on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court may have overlooked 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2), which provides that \"[t]he time during which a           properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent           judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection [setting           forth the one year period of limitation].\" The one year period of limitations began running on April 25, 1996, the           day after AEDPA's enactment. It ran for 319 days until March 10, 1997, when Gaskins filed a motion for new           trial in the state superior court. The period of limitations then was suspended during pendency of that motion. The           new trial motion was denied by the superior court on May 8, 1997. On May 13, 1997, Gaskins timely moved           for leave to appeal that decision to the Supreme Judicial Court. The SJC denied leave to appeal on June 3,           1997. The running of the limitations period then resumed for an additional 28 days for a total of 347 days, until           July 2, 1997, when Gaskins filed his habeas petition in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  By this calculation, therefore, Gaskins           filed his federal habeas petition within the one year grace period excluding the period during which his application           for state collateral review was pending. The district court's Conclusion that Gaskins' habeas petition was           time-barred is erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although respondent argues that the tolling provision of &#167; 2244(d)(2) ought not to apply to the one year grace           period, every circuit court that has addressed this issue has applied &#167; 2244(d)(2)'s tolling provision to the one           year grace period. See Fields v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"16152\"><a href=\"/opinion/16152/fields-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 916 (5th Cir. 1998) (per curiam); Gendron v.

And, our own opinion in Libby suggests, albeit in dicta, that we would apply the tolling           provision of &#167; 2244(d)(2) to the one year grace period. See Libby v. Magnusson, slip op. at 11 &amp; n.2. Applying           the tolling provision encourages respect for the principle of comity and compliance with the requirement that,           ordinarily, a state prisoner must first exhaust his state court remedies before seeking federal habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent cites certain district court cases in support of its position. To the extent that these cases stand for           the proposition that the tolling provision of &#167; 2244(d)(2) does not apply to the one year grace period, we do not           find them persuasive. Moreover, these cases appear to be questionable authority in light of later circuit court           decisions. And, the recent trend, even among district courts, is to apply the tolling provision of &#167; 2244(d)(2) to           the one year grace period. See, e.g., Diaz v. Mantello, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2527620\"><a href=\"/opinion/2527620/diaz-v-mantello/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

While the procedural issues in question are not constitutional, this           court has power to consider such preliminary procedural rulings where they are predicates to consideration of a           constitutional issue. See Nichols v. Bowersox, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763065\"><a href=\"/opinion/763065/michael-nichols-v-michael-bowersox-jeremiah-jay-nixon-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>, 1070 n.2 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc); cf.

Numerous courts, in fact, have simply granted           COAs on the timeliness issue without discussing whether the requirement of &#167; 2253(c)(2) has been met. See,           e.g., Flanagan v.

There is, as yet, no firm trend on the issue whether           \"a properly filed application\" for collateral review is \"pending\" during the period that the state appeal petition is           being prepared. Compare Barnett v. Lemaster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761772\"><a href=\"/opinion/761772/william-j-barnett-also-known-as-william-barnett-v-tim-lemaster-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span>, 1323 (10th Cir. 1999) (tolling the preparation           period) and Hudson v.

We need not definitively resolve           whether the time for preparing a petition for appellate review of the denial of a request for collateral relief should           be excluded from period of limitations pursuant to &#167; 2244(d)(2). We have excluded those four days in the instant           case, but note that, even were we to count those days, Gaskins' habeas petition would be timely as only 351           days would have run prior to Gaskins' filing of his federal habeas petition.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
