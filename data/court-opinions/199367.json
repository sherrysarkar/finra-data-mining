Resnic on brief for appellant.\n          Patrick Markey and Robinson, Donovan, Madden & Barry, P.C.\non brief for appellee.\n\fApril 11, 2001\n\n\n\n\n     -2-\n\f          PER CURIAM.   On March 20, 1996, Daniel and Deborah\n\nMeggison notified their insurer, Preferred Mutual Insurance\n\nCompany, that their home had suffered two types of damage:\n\nwater damage and damage from a partial collapse under the\n\nweight of snow.   Preferred paid the water damage claim but\n\ndenied the remaining claim.    The denial was based in part on\n\nan exclusion for errors, omissions, or defects.   A re-\n\ninspection of the home, at the Meggisons' request, did not\n\nchange Preferred's position.\n\n          Preferred then sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nits denial was appropriate.    The Meggisons counterclaimed for\n\nbreach of contract and violation of M.G.L. ch. 93A and ch.\n\n176D.   A jury returned a verdict for the insurance company; in\n\ntwo special interrogatories, it found that the snow load was\n\nthe proximate cause of the damage but also that the damage\n\nresulted \"in some significant way, from an act, error, or\n\nomission relating to the design, specification, construction,\n\nworkmanship or installation of the property, or the\n\nmaintenance of the property, or a defect in the materials used\n\nin the construction of the property.\"   The court had\n\ninstructed the jury that losses in which such excluded events\n\n                               -3-\n\fplayed a \"significant\" role were not covered by the policy.1\n\nAccordingly, the district court ruled for the insurer.   The\n\nMeggisons sought a new trial, or to alter or amend the\n\njudgment; the district court denied the motions.\n\n         This appeal is from the denial of those motions.      We\n\nreview for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for a\n\nnew trial.   Sheils Title Co. v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins.\n\n\n\n    1\n          The concurrent causation preamble and exclusion in the\npolicy read:\n\n         We do not pay for loss if one or more of the following\n         exclusions apply to the loss, regardless of other\n         causes or events that contribute to or aggravate the\n         loss, whether such causes or events act to produce the\n         loss before, at the same time as, or after the\n         excluded causes or events. . . .\n\n         12.   Errors, Omissions and Defects - We do not pay for\n               loss which results from one or more of the\n               following:\n\n               a. an act, error, or omission (negligent or not)\n               relating to:\n                    . . .\n                    (2)        the    design,     specification,\n                    construction, workmanship or installation of\n                    property;\n                    . . .\n               b.   a defect, a weakness, the inadequacy, a\n                    fault or unsoundness in materials used in\n                    construction or repair whether on or off the\n                    insured premises.\n\n                              -4-\n\fCo., 184 F.3d 10, 19 (1st Cir. 1999).   The Meggisons argue\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's\n\nanswer to the second special interrogatory.   Specifically,\n\nthey claim that Preferred proffered evidence only that the\n\nporch of their house was inadequately supported, but not that\n\nthis defect caused the damage for which they claimed.   That is\n\nsimply not so.   Preferred's expert testified that the house\n\ndepended on a cantilever system of support, which in turn\n\ndepended on the front porch being adequately supported; he\n\nconcluded that had the front porch been adequately supported,\n\nthe Meggisons' home would not have partially collapsed under\n\nthe weight of the winter's snowfall.    This conclusion was\n\nfurther supported by other evidence and by the jury's own view\n\nof the home during a visit to the site.   The district court\n\nthus did not abuse its discretion in denying the new trial\n\nmotion.\n\n          The Meggisons next claim a series of errors in the\n\ncourt's jury instructions.   The gist of their argument is that\n\nthe policy must be construed as a matter of law to cover the\n\nloss even if it was caused by an error, omission or defect; in\n\nparticular, they argue that the \"policy covers a loss if [a]\n\n                              -5-\n\fnon-excluded peril is the efficient proximate cause of the\n\ndamage, even though an excluded peril contributed to the\n\nloss.\"\n\n            To the same effect, the Meggisons argue that all\n\ninsurance contracts, like theirs, are contracts of adhesion\n\nand therefore their exclusions should not be enforced if\n\nunreasonable or contrary to public policy.    They contend that\n\nthe operative exclusion in this case runs afoul of these\n\nlimitations, in that the doctrine of efficient proximate cause\n\nbetter accords with public policy and the reasonable\n\nexpectations of insureds.\n\n            These last two sets of arguments were not, as the\n\nMeggisons' reply brief to this Court implicitly concedes,\n\nraised before the trial court.    The Meggisons have thus waived\n\nthe arguments, and by no means can we say that plain error\n\nresulted.    Indeed, much of this appeal is frivolous.   The\n\nplace to try a case and to present one's arguments for the\n\nfirst time is at the trial court, not the court of appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f         Affirmed.   Double costs, but not the attorneys fees\n\nas sought by Preferred in its Rule 38 Motion, are awarded to\n\nPreferred, against counsel for the Meggisons.2\n\n\n\n\n    2\n       Preferred's Rule 38 Motion for Sanctions was opposed by\na filing from opposing counsel and we have considered the\narguments made.\n\n                              -7-\n\f",
