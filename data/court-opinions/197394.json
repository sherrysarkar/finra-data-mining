The suit  alleged\r\n\nthat appellees, in violation  of Rold n's First Amendment rights,\r\n\ndismissed  her  from  her  position  of  Hearing  Examiner  (also\r\n\nreferred  to  as  Examining  Officer) because  of  her  political\r\n\nbeliefs.    The  district  court granted  appellees'  motion  for\r\n\nsummary  judgment on  the  ground that  party  affiliation is  an\r\n\nappropriate  requirement  for the  effective  performance of  the\r\n\nposition of  Hearing Examiner  and, consequently, that  appellees\r\n\nwere  entitled to dismiss Rold n  on those grounds.   See Opinion\r                                                                   \r\n\nand Order, March 5, 1996, at 10.  Having ruled on the merits, the\r\n\ndistrict  court did  not address,  inter alia,  whether appellees\r                                                       \r\n\nwere entitled to qualified immunity.\r\n\n          In  contrast to  the  lower  court,  we find  that  the\r\n\ninherent   duties  of   Rold n's  position  do   not  demonstrate\r\n\npolicymaking attributes sufficient to subject Rold n to discharge\r\n\nbased  on her  political  beliefs and,  accordingly, reverse  the\r\n\nentry of summary judgment.   Moreover, having found cause  to set\r\n\naside the  judgment on the merits, we address appellees' argument\r\n\nthat they are entitled to qualified immunity and find it wanting.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On  March  1, 1992,  Rold n  accepted  the position  of\r\n\nHearing Examiner with the Office of the Commissioner of Municipal\r\n\nAffairs.  The OCMA is the main regulatory agency of Puerto Rico's\r\n\nmunicipalities and is charged with uncovering, investigating, and\r\n\nreporting   to  municipal   mayors  any  irregularities   in  the\r\n\nmunicipalities'  management.   P.R.  Laws  Ann. tit.  21,    4909\r\n\n(1995).  The office is further obligated to provide various forms\r\n\nof \"technical  and professional assistance to  the municipalities\r\n\nrelating  to  their organization,  administration,  functions and\r\n\noperation.\"    Id.      4902.    The   Commissioner  developed  a\r                            \r\n\nconfidential and trust employee plan under which employees in the\r\n\nOCMA were classified  in accordance with  the Puerto Rico  Public\r\n\nService Personnel Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3,   1301 et seq.  The\r                                                                      \r\n\nplan, developed  by Cerezo's predecessor as  Commissioner, Ismael\r\n\nPag n-Colberg, designated the position  of \"examining officer\" as\r\n\na trust position.  According to this document, the OCMA positions\r\n\ndesignated as  trust or  confidence positions were  only \"[t]hose\r\n\npositions whose holders intervene or collaborate substantially in\r\n\nthe formulation of public policy, which directly advise or render\r\n\ndirect  services  to  the  Commissioner  of  the  Office  of  the\r\n\nCommissioner  of Municipal Affairs.\"   Def. Exh. IV  to Motion to\r\n\nSummary Judgment.\r\n\n          The  classification,   or  job  description,   for  the\r\n\nposition of \"Examining Officer\"  sets forth the position's duties\r\n\nas follows:\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          DUTIES OF POSITION\r\n\n          Professional and technical work that requires\r\n          great  knowledge  of the  principles  and the\r\n          practice  of  law and  the ability  to direct\r\n          research    procedures    leading    to    an\r\n          adjudicative determination.\r\n\n          1.

In March  1993, Rossell  appointed Cerezo Commissioner\r\n\nof  Municipal Affairs.  In April  1993, Cerezo appointed Valent n\r\n\nto head the Legal  Division of the OCMA.  On  May 6, 1994, Rold n\r\n\nreceived a dismissal letter effective that same date.\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We  review  the  grant  of summary  judgment  de  novo,\r                                                                          \r\n\nviewing  the facts, and drawing all reasonable inferences, in the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nlight  most  favorable  to   the  non-movant,  here  Rold n,  and\r\n\naffirming summary judgment only \"if  no genuine issue of material\r\n\nfact exists.\"   O'Connor v.

Political Discharge Claim\r          I.        Political Discharge Claim\r\n\n          We  turn  first to  the grounds  on which  the district\r\n\ncourt granted summary judgment to Cerezo and Valent n.  More than\r\n\ntwenty  years ago,  a plurality  of the  Supreme Court  held that\r\n\ngovernmental employers  may not discharge an  employee because of\r\n\nher political affiliation without showing a governmental interest\r\n\nsufficiently  vital to  outweigh  the employee's  First Amendment\r\n\nright to association.   Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 355-56, 362\r                                                \r\n\n(1976).   The plurality  found that the  government's interest in\r\n\neffective  implementation of  its  policies can  be achieved  \"by\r\n\nlimiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n372.  Justice Stewart's concurrence gave the Court a majority for\r\n\nthe proposition that  nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential  employees\r\n\nshould not be discharged on the basis of their political beliefs.\r\n\nId. at 374-75 (Stewart, J., concurring in the judgment).\r             \r\n\n          The Court next attempted to define the contours  of the\r\n\nprohibition on political  discharge in Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n507 (1980).   Instead  of applying Elrod's  policymaking inquiry,\r                                                  \r\n\nthe Branti Court relied upon a finding that political affiliation\r                    \r\n\nis not  an appropriate requirement for  the effective performance\r\n\nof the position  of assistant  public defender.   Id. at  518-19.\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nThe  Branti Court  again,  however,  imposed  the burden  on  the\r                     \r\n\ngovernmental body  seeking dismissal:   \"[U]nless  the government\r\n\ncan demonstrate 'an  overriding interest'  'of vital  importance'\r\n\nrequiring that a person's private beliefs conform to those of the\r\n\nhiring  authority,  his  beliefs  cannot be  the  sole  basis for\r\n\ndepriving  him of  continued public  employment.\"  Id.  at 515-16\r                                                                \r\n\n(citations omitted).  Of fundamental importance  is the idea that\r\n\n\"conditioning continued public employment on an employee's having\r\n\nobtained support  from a particular political  party violates the\r\n\nFirst  Amendment   because  of  'the  coercion   of  belief  that\r\n\nnecessarily flows from the knowledge that one must have a sponsor\r\n\nin the dominant  party in order to retain one's  job.'\"  Rutan v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRepublican Party  of Illinois,  497 U.S.  62, 70 (1990)  (quoting\r                                       \r\n\nBranti, 445 U.S. at 516).\r                \r\n\n          More  recently,   in  Rutan  v.  Republican   Party  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nIllinois,  the  Court  extended  the reach  of  the  Elrod-Branti\r                                                                           \r\n\ndoctrine  to  politically  motivated  promotions,  transfers, and\r\n\nrecalls.  Rutan, 497 U.S. at  70.  The Court reaffirmed the heavy\r                         \r\n\nburden on government employers to show that the use of \"patronage\r\n\npractices are  narrowly  tailored  to  further  vital  government\r\n\ninterests.\"  Id. at 74.  The Court reiterated that\r                          \r\n\n          [a]   government's   interest   in   securing\r\n          effective   employees   can    be   met    by\r\n          discharging, demoting,  or transferring staff\r\n          members   whose   work  is   deficient.     A\r\n          government's  interest in  securing employees\r\n          who  will loyally implement  its policies can\r\n          be   adequately   served   by   choosing   or\r\n          dismissing  certain  high-level employees  on\r\n          the basis of their political views.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nId.      Unless  a   position   is  one   that   requires  policy\r             \r\n\nimplementation,  or  is  confidential  in nature  (a  claim  that\r\n\nappellees here  do  not make  and  to which  we need  not  allude\r\n\nhereafter),  a  government  employer  must  rely  on  traditional\r\n\ndischarge criteria.\r\n\n          Based on  this case law,  this circuit has  developed a\r\n\ntwo-part test  for discerning  when discharge based  on political\r\n\naffiliation is permissible.   First, we inquire into  whether the\r\n\ndischarging agency's functions entail \"'decision making on issues\r\n\nwhere  there is room for political disagreement on goals or their\r\n\nimplementation.'\"   O'Connor,  994 F.2d  at 910  (quoting Jim nez\r                                                                           \r\n\nFuentes  v.

If so,  we  next  determine  \"whether  the  particular\r\n\nresponsibilities   of  the   plaintiff's  position,   within  the\r\n\ndepartment or agency, resemble  those of a policymaker, privy  to\r\n\nconfidential information,  a communicator,  or some  other office\r\n\nholder  whose  function is  such  that  party  affiliation is  an\r\n\nequally  appropriate  requirement  for  continued  tenure.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Jim nez Fuentes, 807\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  241-42.  In reviewing this  second prong, we have looked\r\n\nto \"relative pay, technical  competence, power to control others,\r\n\nauthority  to   speak  in   the  name  of   policymakers,  public\r\n\nperception,  influence   on   programs,  contact   with   elected\r\n\nofficials, and responsiveness to partisan  politics and political\r\n\nleaders.\"  O'Connor, 994 F.2d at 910.\r                             \r\n\n          A.

For instance,  in  Agosto-de-Feliciano v.  Aponte-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRoque,  889 F.2d  1209, 1213  (1st Cir.  1989), we  reviewed four\r               \r\n\npositions  to   determine   the  appropriateness   of   political\r\n\naffiliation.   The job description  of the first  position listed\r\n\ntwenty-six  responsibilities   including  supervising  employees,\r\n\nrepresenting  the  regional  director  at  public  meetings,  and\r\n\noverseeing the  respective office  when the director  was absent.\r\n\nId.   The second position  under review required the officeholder\r             \r\n\nto  act as a liaison  between the Department  of Public Education\r\n\nand private  schools, to  coordinate a  teaching  program in  the\r\n\nproject school, and  to direct a  regionwide committee on  school\r\n\norganization.   Id.  The third position consisted of twenty-three\r                             \r\n\nresponsibilities,  requiring the  officeholder  to survey  needs,\r\n\ndevelop  work  plans,  evaluate  curricula  and  training, manage\r\n\nvocational education, and  supervise student organizations.   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nThe  position  also  included   a  supervisory  component.

Id. at  1214-15.  These  high-level positions,  with\r                          \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ntheir  numerous,  loosely defined  responsibilities,  allowed the\r\n\nofficeholders considerable power and discretion in the management\r\n\nof  Puerto  Rico's  Department   of  Education.    They  included\r\n\noversight,  evaluation,  and  revision  of programs  as  well  as\r\n\nsupervision of personnel.  Some  allowed the officeholder to  act\r\n\nin  place  of  department  heads.    The  circumscribed  list  of\r\n\nresponsibilities of  the position of Hearing  Examiner grants the\r\n\nofficeholder no such broadly defined powers.\r\n\n          In O'Connor v.

The\r                                  \r\n\nposition of Internal Auditor did not require the  officeholder to\r\n\nengage in  policymaking decisions, but instead  required that the\r\n\nauditor investigate  the financial records of  a municipality and\r\n\nmake  a report to  the Mayor  and Comptroller.   Id. at  18.  The\r                                                              \r\n\ninternal  auditor had no authority to correct the mistakes he was\r\n\ncharged to investigate.  Id.\r                                      \r\n\n          As in  Cordero, the position at issue here is that of a\r                                  \r\n\nmere  \"technocrat.\"  Id.; see also De Choudens v. Government Dev.\r                                                                           \r\n\nBank of Puerto Rico, 801 F.2d 5, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1986).  A Hearing\r                             \r\n\nExaminer is charged only  with investigating and holding hearings\r\n\ninto   possible  irregularities   in  municipal   functions,  and\r\n\nreporting  them to the  Commissioner, in whom  authority rests to\r\n\ntake action.  Considering  these five enumerated duties, we  find\r\n\nthat they require  technical and professional  skills and do  not\r\n\nprovide  discretion  to  formulate  or  implement  policy.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ngenerally De Choudens, 801 F.2d at 9-10.  Accordingly,  political\r                               \r\n\naffiliation is not an appropriate requirement for the position.\r\n\n          Moreover,  a review  of the  indicia we  have typically\r\n\nconsidered material to this determination further suggests that a\r\n\nHearing Examiner is not  a policymaker.  With regard  to relative\r\n\npay, the salary for Hearing Examiner is the fifth  highest of the\r\n\n13  levels on the OCMA pay scale, not including the Commissioner.\r\n\nThe documents submitted  on summary judgment do not  indicate the\r\n\nnumber of employees filling each level of the scale.  Thus, while\r\n\nthe position  is ranked  fifth,  a significant  number of  actual\r\n\nemployees  may be paid more than the Hearing Examiner.  Moreover,\r\n\nthe  trust  classification  is  fifth-tier,  among  eleven  trust\r\n\npositions in  the OCMA.   Although  the position  is of a  quasi-\r\n\nadjudicative  nature, it  does not  require that  an officeholder\r\n\npossess  a  law  degree.   The  position  carries  no supervisory\r\n\nresponsibilities.     The  duties  neither  require   any  public\r\n\nappearances nor  grant authority  to speak on  the Commissioner's\r\n\nbehalf.   Contact with  elected officials  appears to  take place\r\n\nonly in  the context of a hearing, and in no other context does a\r\n\nHearing   Examiner  act   as   a  public   spokesperson  for   or\r\n\nrepresentative of her agency.\r\n\n          Appellees   attempt  to   maneuver   around   the   job\r\n\ndescription's  inherent duties by  pointing to item  number 61 on\r\n\nthe  job  description, claiming  that  the  possibility of  being\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Item number 6  states that the  office holder \"[c]arries  out\r\nother assigned duties.\"\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nassigned  related tasks  transforms  the position  into one  with\r\n\nbroad  powers.    The  summary  judgment  record  indicates  that\r\n\nappellees  presented  two  exhibits,   in  addition  to  the  job\r\n\ndescription, to  support this  contention.   The first of  these,\r\n\nExhibit VI, appears to be a listing of correspondence received by\r\n\nthe  Office  of  Legal  Affairs  containing  inquiries  regarding\r\n\nvarious  municipal concerns.   These  inquiries were  assigned to\r\n\nRold n for resolution.  The  last date on which any of  the tasks\r\n\non this list were assigned to  Rold n is September 24, 1992.  The\r\n\nother exhibit, Exhibit VII,  suggests that, as of July  28, 1992,\r\n\nRold n was assigned by Cerezo's predecessor to monitor the status\r\n\nof amendments to the Autonomous Municipalities Act.  We note that\r\n\nappellees did  not argue  to the  district court,  as they do  on\r\n\nappeal,  that the duties  set forth in  Exhibits VI  and VII were\r\n\nassigned as \"other [] related duties\" pursuant to item six of the\r\n\njob  description, and thus fall  within the scope  of the court's\r\n\nanalysis  of  \"inherent  duties.\"     Nevertheless,  because  the\r\n\ndistrict court took into  consideration the documents in Exhibits\r\n\nVI and VII, we address appellees' contention here.\r\n\n          In reviewing the nature of the tasks assigned to Rold n\r\n\nby Cerezo's  predecessor,  it  is  apparent that  they  were  not\r\n\nrelated to  the inherent  duties of  Hearing Examiner.   Instead,\r\n\nthese exhibits are of the very type we have consistently held are\r\n\nnot  to be  considered in  the process  of determining  whether a\r\n\nposition  entails  policymaking.   We look  only to  the inherent\r\n\nduties  of  the position  under review  and  do not  consider the\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nactual  tasks performed by a  present or past  officeholder.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nO'Connor, 994 F.2d at 911; Jim nez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 242.  The\r                                                    \r\n\ninherent   duties  of   a   Hearing  Examiner   relate  only   to\r\n\ninvestigating and administering hearings regarding irregularities\r\n\nand  do  not  encompass  providing legal  advice,  or  analyzing,\r\n\ndeveloping, or  advising the  Commissioner on proposed  or actual\r\n\nlegislation.   We  certainly cannot  allow a  catch-all provision\r\n\nsuch as that found in  Item 6 to convert all assigned  tasks into\r                                                      \r\n\ninherent  duties.   We  conclude that  the  duties set  forth  in\r\n\nExhibits VI and  VII, which  were assigned to  Rold n during  her\r\n\ntenure  as a  Hearing  Examiner, are  not  tasks related  to  her\r\n\nposition and thus cannot be properly characterized as assigned in\r\n\naccordance  with item number 6.  They are actual duties performed\r\n\nby a past officeholder, and not inherent duties.\r\n\n          We  recognize that,  in past  cases, we have  granted a\r\n\nmodicum of deference to the Puerto Rico legislature's designation\r\n\nof  a particular  position as  \"trust\"  or \"confidential.\"   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,   Figueroa-Rodr guez v.

Nevertheless, we decline\r                            \r\n\nto  grant deference to the  designation of Hearing  Examiner as a\r\n\n\"confidential\" position  here, when the plan  that designated the\r\n\nposition   as  confidential  took  into  consideration  the  five\r\n\nspecific  duties discussed  above and  merely suggested  that the\r\n\nHearing Examiner \"has broad  and considerable freedom to exercise\r\n\ninitiative  and his own judgment in the performance of his work.\"\r\n\nSee Def. Exh. IV to Motion for Summary Judgment.  We have already\r             \r\n\nconsidered  the job duties of  the position above  and found them\r\n\ninsufficient to indicate that the position entails  policymaking.\r\n\nHaving  \"freedom  to  exercise .  .  .  [one's]  judgment in  the\r\n\nperformance  of  [one's] work\"  does  not go  beyond  our earlier\r\n\nconsideration  of the  position and  does not  support appellees'\r\n\ncontention  that   the  position   involves  the  use   of  broad\r\n\ndiscretion.  In addition,  that the same plan labels  drivers and\r\n\nat  least  two tiers  of  secretaries  as  trust or  confidential\r\n\nemployees suggests that these categories are overly broad.\r\n\n          Based on the summary judgment record, we hold that  the\r\n\nposition  of  Hearing  Examiner  is   not  one  for  which  party\r\n\naffiliation is an appropriate requirement.\r\n\nII.

See,  e.g.,  Nereida-\r                                                                           \r\n\nGonz lez, 990 F.2d at 704 (granting defendants qualified immunity\r                  \r\n\nbecause  prior to  1989,  a period  that encompassed  defendants'\r\n\nallegedly  unconstitutional demotions and  transfers, it  was not\r\n\nclear  whether Elrod and Branti applied); Valiente v.

This case is different.  Appellees  discharged Rold n\r\n\non May  6, 1994.   The  contours of  the law regarding  discharge\r\n\nbased  on party affiliation grew  much clearer in  the late 1980s\r\n\nand early 1990s.  By 1993,  this circuit had decided two waves of\r\n\npolitical discrimination cases.  At the time appellees discharged\r\n\nRold n, this circuit's law regarding discharge based on political\r\n\ndiscrimination was indeed clearly established.\r\n\n          To be sure,  the law  may still be  blurred around  the\r\n\nedges.    But this  is  not a  borderline  case.   In determining\r\n\nentitlement to  the qualified  immunity defense in  the political\r\n\ndiscrimination  context, we look only to the inherent duties of a\r\n\nposition and  ask whether the defendant  could reasonably believe\r\n\nthe  position in  question was  one that  \"'potentially concerned\r\n\nmatters of partisan  political interest and  involved at least  a\r\n\nmodicum  of policymaking  responsibility, access  to confidential\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ninformation,  or  official communication.'\"   Figueroa-Rodr guez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n878 F.2d at 1480.  We have already found that the inherent duties\r\n\nof   the   position   were   limited   to   discrete,   technical\r\n\nresponsibilities that  did  not involve  policymaking  or  policy\r\n\nimplementation.     We  do  not  believe   that  appellees  could\r\n\nreasonably believe that the five specified duties of the position\r\n\nin any way provided Rold n with discretion to devise or implement\r\n\npolicy.  Assigning  her with  a duty related  to those  functions\r                                                      \r\n\nwould not expand her discretion in the position.\r\n\n          As discussed above,  the additional  tasks assigned  to\r\n\nRold n,  on  which  appellees  rely, were  not  inherent  to  the\r\n\nposition  nor can they be bootstrapped  into the position through\r\n\nthe device  of item  number 6.   That  the defendants might  have\r\n\nconsidered  the additional duties  assigned to Rold n  as part of\r\n\nthe duties inherent in  the position of Hearing Examiner  appears\r\n\nunreasonable based on the  record at the summary  judgment stage.\r\n\nWe  note that  should  defendants muster  convincing evidence  at\r\n\ntrial to show  that the  function of a  typical Hearing  Examiner\r                                                         \r\n\nincludes following the status  of legislation and providing legal\r\n\nassistance directly  to the municipalities and  that the position\r\n\nhas  traditionally been  perceived as  encompassing  these tasks,\r\n\nthey may or may not be entitled to qualified immunity.   They are\r\n\nnot, however, entitled to  summary judgment on qualified immunity\r\n\ngrounds.\r\n\n          Appellees suggest that  one of the  cases on which  the\r\n\ndistrict  court relied, Alfaro de Quevedo v. De Jes s Schuck, 556\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nF.2d 591 (1st Cir.  1977), is analogous  to the instant case  and\r\n\nwarrants the opposite conclusion.  The district court also relied\r\n\non  another case that  may seem to involve  a position similar to\r\n\nthat  of a Hearing Examiner.  See Gonz lez-Gonz lez v. Zayas, 878\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  1478  (1st  Cir.   1989)  (en  banc).    Those   cases  are\r\n\ndistinguishable on two grounds.\r\n\n          First, the  positions at issue in  those cases involved\r\n\nconsiderable  discretion  to  make  and implement  policy.    The\r\n\nposition  at  issue in  Alfaro de  Quevedo,  the Director  of the\r                                                    \r\n\nOffice   of   Criminal  Justice,   required,   inter   alia,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\nofficeholder to advise  \"the Secretary of Justice  on all pending\r\n\nlegislation affecting  crimes and  law enforcement,\" id.  at 593,\r                                                                  \r\n\ndraw up proposed legislation, prepare an annual budget, supervise\r\n\nthe  staff of  the  Office of  Criminal  Justice, and  prepare  a\r\n\nProposed  Code of  Criminal Justice  for Puerto Rico.   Id.   The\r                                                                     \r\n\nposition \"gave [the officeholder] a broad discretion to carry out\r\n\nhazily  defined purposes and to render advice to the Secretary in\r\n\nan area  that is far  from noncontroversial.\"   Id. at 593.   The\r                                                             \r\n\nposition at  issue in Gonz lez-Gonz lez was that  of the Director\r                                                 \r\n\nof the Board  of Appeals  of Puerto Rico's  Department of  Social\r\n\nServices.  See Gonz lez-Gonz lez, 878 F.2d at 1482.  The position\r                                          \r\n\nduties  were, among others, to  supervise 31 employees who worked\r\n\nfor  the  Board,  to  establish procedures  to  hold  hearings on\r\n\nappeals, to analyze and  make final decisions on all  appeals, to\r\n\nprepare  an annual budget, and  to recommend rule  changes to the\r\n\nDirectors  of  the various  Social Services  programs.   Id.   In\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\naddition to any adjudicatory  tasks, this position entailed broad\r\n\nadministrative,  policymaking, and  supervisory duties.   Id.  at\r                                                                       \r\n\n1483.   As our analysis indicates,  the broad discretion inherent\r\n\nin these duties is not present in the case before us.\r\n\n          Second,  Gonz lez-Gonz lez was dismissed  from his post\r\n\nin  1985 and  Alfaro  de Quevedo  resigned  in  1973.   When  the\r\n\ndefendants in those cases ousted the plaintiffs, the state of the\r\n\nlaw  with respect to political  firings was poorly  defined.  The\r\n\nstate of the  law at the time  of the discharge in  this case had\r\n\ndeveloped  markedly since  the  two opinions  relied upon  below.\r\n\nBecause  we must  consider whether  appellees violated  a clearly\r\n\nestablished  constitutional right  of  which a  reasonable person\r\n\nwould  have been aware, at the time the adverse employment action\r\n\nwas taken, the outcome of  these two cases is not controlling  on\r\n\nthe issue of qualified immunity.\r\n\n          We also recognize that in prior  cases, we have granted\r\n\nqualified immunity partially because a defendant might mistakenly\r\n\nrely on the position's status  as \"confidential\" or \"trust\" under\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico Public Service Personnel Act, P.R.

The suit  alleged\r\n\nthat appellees, in violation  of Rold n's First Amendment rights,\r\n\ndismissed  her  from  her  position  of  Hearing  Examiner  (also\r\n\nreferred  to  as  Examining  Officer) because  of  her  political\r\n\nbeliefs.    The  district  court granted  appellees'  motion  for\r\n\nsummary  judgment on  the  ground that  party  affiliation is  an\r\n\nappropriate  requirement  for the  effective  performance of  the\r\n\nposition of  Hearing Examiner  and, consequently, that  appellees\r\n\nwere  entitled to dismiss Rold n  on those grounds.

Moreover, having found cause  to set\r\n\naside the  judgment on the merits, we address appellees' argument\r\n\nthat they are entitled to qualified immunity and find it wanting.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On  March  1, 1992,  Rold n  accepted  the position  of\r\n\nHearing Examiner with the Office of the Commissioner of Municipal\r\n\nAffairs.  The OCMA is the main regulatory agency of Puerto Rico's\r\n\nmunicipalities and is charged with uncovering, investigating, and\r\n\nreporting   to  municipal   mayors  any  irregularities   in  the\r\n\nmunicipalities'  management.

A Hearing\r                             \r\n\nExaminer is charged only  with investigating and holding hearings\r\n\ninto   possible  irregularities   in  municipal   functions,  and\r\n\nreporting  them to the  Commissioner, in whom  authority rests to\r\n\ntake action.  Considering  these five enumerated duties, we  find\r\n\nthat they require  technical and professional  skills and do  not\r\n\nprovide  discretion  to  formulate  or  implement  policy.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ngenerally De Choudens, 801 F.2d at 9-10.  Accordingly,  political\r                               \r\n\naffiliation is not an appropriate requirement for the position.\r\n\n          Moreover,  a review  of the  indicia we  have typically\r\n\nconsidered material to this determination further suggests that a\r\n\nHearing Examiner is not  a policymaker.  With regard  to relative\r\n\npay, the salary for Hearing Examiner is the fifth  highest of the\r\n\n13  levels on the OCMA pay scale, not including the Commissioner.\r\n\nThe documents submitted  on summary judgment do not  indicate the\r\n\nnumber of employees filling each level of the scale.  Thus, while\r\n\nthe position  is ranked  fifth,  a significant  number of  actual\r\n\nemployees  may be paid more than the Hearing Examiner.  Moreover,\r\n\nthe  trust  classification  is  fifth-tier,  among  eleven  trust\r\n\npositions in  the OCMA.   Although  the position  is of a  quasi-\r\n\nadjudicative  nature, it  does not  require that  an officeholder\r\n\npossess  a  law  degree.   The  position  carries  no supervisory\r\n\nresponsibilities.     The  duties  neither  require   any  public\r\n\nappearances nor  grant authority  to speak on  the Commissioner's\r\n\nbehalf.   Contact with  elected officials  appears to  take place\r\n\nonly in  the context of a hearing, and in no other context does a\r\n\nHearing   Examiner  act   as   a  public   spokesperson  for   or\r\n\nrepresentative of her agency.\r\n\n          Appellees   attempt  to   maneuver   around   the   job\r\n\ndescription's  inherent duties by  pointing to item  number 61 on\r\n\nthe  job  description, claiming  that  the  possibility of  being\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Item number 6  states that the  office holder \"[c]arries  out\r\nother assigned duties.\"\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nassigned  related tasks  transforms  the position  into one  with\r\n\nbroad  powers.    The  summary  judgment  record  indicates  that\r\n\nappellees  presented  two  exhibits,   in  addition  to  the  job\r\n\ndescription, to  support this  contention.   The first of  these,\r\n\nExhibit VI, appears to be a listing of correspondence received by\r\n\nthe  Office  of  Legal  Affairs  containing  inquiries  regarding\r\n\nvarious  municipal concerns.   These  inquiries were  assigned to\r\n\nRold n for resolution.  The  last date on which any of  the tasks\r\n\non this list were assigned to  Rold n is September 24, 1992.  The\r\n\nother exhibit, Exhibit VII,  suggests that, as of July  28, 1992,\r\n\nRold n was assigned by Cerezo's predecessor to monitor the status\r\n\nof amendments to the Autonomous Municipalities Act.  We note that\r\n\nappellees did  not argue  to the  district court,  as they do  on\r\n\nappeal,  that the duties  set forth in  Exhibits VI  and VII were\r\n\nassigned as \"other [] related duties\" pursuant to item six of the\r\n\njob  description, and thus fall  within the scope  of the court's\r\n\nanalysis  of  \"inherent  duties.\"     Nevertheless,  because  the\r\n\ndistrict court took into  consideration the documents in Exhibits\r\n\nVI and VII, we address appellees' contention here.\r\n\n          In reviewing the nature of the tasks assigned to Rold n\r\n\nby Cerezo's  predecessor,  it  is  apparent that  they  were  not\r\n\nrelated to  the inherent  duties of  Hearing Examiner.   Instead,\r\n\nthese exhibits are of the very type we have consistently held are\r\n\nnot  to be  considered in  the process  of determining  whether a\r\n\nposition  entails  policymaking.   We look  only to  the inherent\r\n\nduties  of  the position  under review  and  do not  consider the\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nactual  tasks performed by a  present or past  officeholder.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nO'Connor, 994 F.2d at 911; Jim nez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 242.  The\r                                                    \r\n\ninherent   duties  of   a   Hearing  Examiner   relate  only   to\r\n\ninvestigating and administering hearings regarding irregularities\r\n\nand  do  not  encompass  providing legal  advice,  or  analyzing,\r\n\ndeveloping, or  advising the  Commissioner on proposed  or actual\r\n\nlegislation.   We  certainly cannot  allow a  catch-all provision\r\n\nsuch as that found in  Item 6 to convert all assigned  tasks into\r                                                      \r\n\ninherent  duties.   We  conclude that  the  duties set  forth  in\r\n\nExhibits VI and  VII, which  were assigned to  Rold n during  her\r\n\ntenure  as a  Hearing  Examiner, are  not  tasks related  to  her\r\n\nposition and thus cannot be properly characterized as assigned in\r\n\naccordance  with item number 6.

In addition,  that the same plan labels  drivers and\r\n\nat  least  two tiers  of  secretaries  as  trust or  confidential\r\n\nemployees suggests that these categories are overly broad.\r\n\n          Based on the summary judgment record, we hold that  the\r\n\nposition  of  Hearing  Examiner  is   not  one  for  which  party\r\n\naffiliation is an appropriate requirement.\r\n\nII.

This case is different.  Appellees  discharged Rold n\r\n\non May  6, 1994.   The  contours of  the law regarding  discharge\r\n\nbased  on party affiliation grew  much clearer in  the late 1980s\r\n\nand early 1990s.  By 1993,  this circuit had decided two waves of\r\n\npolitical discrimination cases.  At the time appellees discharged\r\n\nRold n, this circuit's law regarding discharge based on political\r\n\ndiscrimination was indeed clearly established.\r\n\n          To be sure,  the law  may still be  blurred around  the\r\n\nedges.    But this  is  not a  borderline  case.   In determining\r\n\nentitlement to  the qualified  immunity defense in  the political\r\n\ndiscrimination  context, we look only to the inherent duties of a\r\n\nposition and  ask whether the defendant  could reasonably believe\r\n\nthe  position in  question was  one that  \"'potentially concerned\r\n\nmatters of partisan  political interest and  involved at least  a\r\n\nmodicum  of policymaking  responsibility, access  to confidential\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ninformation,  or  official communication.'\"   Figueroa-Rodr guez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n878 F.2d at 1480.  We have already found that the inherent duties\r\n\nof   the   position   were   limited   to   discrete,   technical\r\n\nresponsibilities that  did  not involve  policymaking  or  policy\r\n\nimplementation.     We  do  not  believe   that  appellees  could\r\n\nreasonably believe that the five specified duties of the position\r\n\nin any way provided Rold n with discretion to devise or implement\r\n\npolicy.  Assigning  her with  a duty related  to those  functions\r                                                      \r\n\nwould not expand her discretion in the position.\r\n\n          As discussed above,  the additional  tasks assigned  to\r\n\nRold n,  on  which  appellees  rely, were  not  inherent  to  the\r\n\nposition  nor can they be bootstrapped  into the position through\r\n\nthe device  of item  number 6.   That  the defendants might  have\r\n\nconsidered  the additional duties  assigned to Rold n  as part of\r\n\nthe duties inherent in  the position of Hearing Examiner  appears\r\n\nunreasonable based on the  record at the summary  judgment stage.\r\n\nWe  note that  should  defendants muster  convincing evidence  at\r\n\ntrial to show  that the  function of a  typical Hearing  Examiner\r                                                         \r\n\nincludes following the status  of legislation and providing legal\r\n\nassistance directly  to the municipalities and  that the position\r\n\nhas  traditionally been  perceived as  encompassing  these tasks,\r\n\nthey may or may not be entitled to qualified immunity.   They are\r\n\nnot, however, entitled to  summary judgment on qualified immunity\r\n\ngrounds.\r\n\n          Appellees suggest that  one of the  cases on which  the\r\n\ndistrict  court relied, Alfaro de Quevedo v.

The district court also relied\r\n\non  another case that  may seem to involve  a position similar to\r\n\nthat  of a Hearing Examiner.  See Gonz lez-Gonz lez v.

As our analysis indicates,  the broad discretion inherent\r\n\nin these duties is not present in the case before us.\r\n\n          Second,  Gonz lez-Gonz lez was dismissed  from his post\r\n\nin  1985 and  Alfaro  de Quevedo  resigned  in  1973.   When  the\r\n\ndefendants in those cases ousted the plaintiffs, the state of the\r\n\nlaw  with respect to political  firings was poorly  defined.  The\r\n\nstate of the  law at the time  of the discharge in  this case had\r\n\ndeveloped  markedly since  the  two opinions  relied upon  below.\r\n\nBecause  we must  consider whether  appellees violated  a clearly\r\n\nestablished  constitutional right  of  which a  reasonable person\r\n\nwould  have been aware, at the time the adverse employment action\r\n\nwas taken, the outcome of  these two cases is not controlling  on\r\n\nthe issue of qualified immunity.\r\n\n          We also recognize that in prior  cases, we have granted\r\n\nqualified immunity partially because a defendant might mistakenly\r\n\nrely on the position's status  as \"confidential\" or \"trust\" under\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico Public Service Personnel Act, P.R.
