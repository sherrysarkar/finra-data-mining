This is an  unusual\r\n\ncase \r                that \r                     goes \r                         back \r                              a \r                                long while, including a four year history\r\n\nprior to suit.   Plaintiff Chrysler Corporation  (\"Chrysler\")\r\n\nfiled suit in the Massachusetts District Court in July  1991,\r\n\nunder \r                 the \r                     Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. SS 1051 et seq., for trademark\r\n\ninfringement,\r                         specifically trade dress, against John C. Silva,\r\n\nJr. \r               (\"Silva\"), and a number of other individual defendants who\r\n\nhave settled out.   At issue  was Chrysler's allegation  that\r\n\nSilva copied Chrysler's  innovative \"muscle  car,\" the  Dodge\r\n\nViper.  Silva counter-claimed, alleging that the shoe was  on\r\n\nthe other  foot; that Chrysler was  the one at fault,  having\r\n\nstolen \r                  the \r                     allegedly \r                               infringed design from him.  On December 9,\r\n\n1993  the court,  in a   separate  brief memorandum,  ordered\r\n\nsummary judgment  for Chrysler  on the  counter-claim on  the\r\n\nground of estoppel.1\r\n\n          The \r                         first \r                               of \r                                 Chrysler's \r                                            demands was for a preliminary\r\n\ninjunction \r                      against \r                             violation.  This was denied, and ultimately,\r\n\nafter a bench trial, the court dismissed Chrysler's complaint\r\n\nwith \r                a \r                  memorandum \r                            of \r                               findings.  This was initially done on July\r\n\n19, \r               1995. \r                      \r                      On \r                        August \r                               4 \r                                 Chrysler moved to amend the findings and\r\n\nto alter or amend the judgment, or, alternatively, for a  new\r\n\ntrial.  The court took additional testimony and on January 9,\r\n\n1996 \r                it \r                   again entered judgment for defendant on the complaint.\r\n\nBoth parties appealed.  We affirm in part.\r\n\n1.  This went to judgment on December 14, 1995.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Just prior to oral argument before us, Silva  died.\r\n\nAt \r              the \r                  argument \r                          date \r                               his \r                                   (former) counsel appeared, saying that\r\n\nhe had no client.  On his stating that his argument was ready\r\n\nwe said we  would hear the oral  arguments of both sides  and\r\n\nreproduce \r                     them for the files.  This has been done.  We further\r\n\nstated that we would  afford time for an administrator to  be\r\n\nappointed for  Silva and  move to  continue the  case, if  so\r\n\nminded.   This, too,  has been done.   One  Jeanne A.  Silva,\r\n\ntemporary administratrix of the estate of John C. Silva, Jr.,\r\n\nhas \r               been \r                    substituted for the deceased Silva in all capacities.\r\n\nWe continue with the appeals.\r\n\n                          I. Facts\r\n\n          It is, of course, well known that there is enormous\r\n\ncompetition  that  depends   upon  the  body  appearance   of\r\n\nautomobiles. \r                         \r                         It \r                           is \r                              not \r                                  so well known that this is so important\r\n\nto true enthusiasts that custom builders make, or order made,\r\n\nspecial \r                   bodies to place over a standard chassis.  This art can\r\n\nproduce problems.   See,  e.g., Ferrari  S.P.A. Esercizio  v.\r\n\nRoberts, 944 F.2d 1235, 1244-45 (6th Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          In 1988, spurred on  by a conversation between  its\r\n\nexecutives the  previous  year, Chrysler  considered  designs\r\n\nharking back, in part, to 1960's roadsters.  A prototype  was\r\n\ncompleted \r                     in \r                        time \r                            for \r                                the January 1989 International Automobile\r\n\nShow \r                in \r                   Detroit.  Here the reception was so good that Chrysler\r\n\nformed TEAM VIPER.  By December 1991, it had four  production\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nunits  and in  1992 it  produced 200  Vipers.   It had  spent\r\n\napproximately  $8,000,000 to  promote this  vehicle and  over\r\n\n$75,000,000  to bring  it into  production.   It attracted  a\r\n\nspecial class of buyers.\r\n\n          During the trial, as a defense to the  infringement\r\n\nclaim, Silva testified that he had contacted Chrysler by mail\r\n\nin  October 1987  and offered  it the  opportunity either  to\r\n\npurchase \r                    his \r                        design for a car Silva had dubbed the \"Mongoose,\"\r\n\nfor \r               which \r                     he \r                        included sketches with his letter, or to contract\r\n\nwith him to build a show car based on the design.  He claimed\r\n\nthat past experience in building cars for large manufacturers\r\n\ninstilled in him the necessity of clearly marking the designs\r\n\nwith proprietary statements of ownership and  confidentiality\r\n\nbefore \r                  forwarding \r                            them \r                                 to Chrysler.  He also included a request\r\n\nthat the sketches be returned if Chrysler was not interested.\r\n\nHe \r              received \r                       no \r                         response \r                                  to his letter and the sketches were not\r\n\nreturned.\r\n\n          In early 1989, Ronald Torlone, one of the  original\r\n\ndefendants, decided  he  wanted a  \"new  look\" for  his  1979\r\n\nChevrolet Corvette.   For this he  retained a builder,  Motor\r\n\nIncorporated,  for  which  Silva  worked  as  an  independent\r\n\ncontractor.   They  and another  original defendant,  Richard\r\n\nGalardi, \r                    produced the Mongoose.2  Also in 1989, after seeing a\r\n\n2.  The single Mongoose is currently in the hands of Chrysler\r\nwho received it from another original defendant, Leonard\r\nLegere, who purchased it from Richard Galardi who received it\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\npicture of Chrysler's prototype  for the Viper, Silva  called\r\n\nChrysler and eventually spoke with an in-house attorney  who,\r\n\nafter learning of the Mongoose, demanded that Silva stop work\r\n\nand \r               destroy \r                       the vehicle.  Silva refused, Chrysler brought this\r\n\nsuit and Silva counterclaimed for the theft of his design.\r\n\n                        II.  Analysis\r\n\n          Section \r                             43(a) \r                                   of \r                                     the \r                                         Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.

S 1125(a).\r\n\n          In \r                        1992, \r                              the \r                                 Supreme \r                                         Court held that S 43(a) extended\r\n\nto \r              claims \r                     for infringement of trade dress.  Two Pesos, Inc. v.\r\n\nTaco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 770 (1992). Trade dress  has\r\n\nbeen defined  as \"the design  and appearance  of [a]  product\r\n\nfrom Ronald Torlone in satisfaction of amounts due in return\r\nfor Galardi's construction of the mechanicals for the car. \r\nWhile Chrysler has possession of the Mongoose apparently as\r\npart of a consent decree with Legere, Galardi retains title\r\nto the vehicle because Legere defaulted on his payments.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ntogether with the  elements making up the overall image  that\r\n\nserves to  identify the product  presented to the  consumer.\"\r\n\nFun-Dametal Too, Ltd. v. Gemmy Indus., 111 F.3d 993, 999  (2d\r\n\nCir. 1997) (internal citation omitted).  In order to  warrant\r\n\nprotection, trade dress must be either inherently distinctive\r\n\nor \r              have \r                   become \r                         so \r                            by \r                               acquiring a secondary meaning.

Inherently distinctive trade dress cannot be\r\n\nfunctional, and to  prevail on a  claim of infringement,  the\r\n\ndefendant's \r                       product \r                              must \r                                   have created a likelihood of confusion\r\n\nwith \r                regard \r                       to its source.

It made several  individual\r\n\nfindings of fact.  Relevant ones include:\r\n\n          11.  Mr. Silva saw and/or read the  press\r\n          coverage of the Viper concept car in  the\r\n          Spring and Summer of 1989.\r\n\n                            * * *\r\n\n          13. \r                         Photographs of the Dodge Viper concept\r\n          car served as the starting point for  the\r\n          car body designed  by Mr.  Silva for  Mr.\r\n          Torlone.\r\n\n          14.   Mr.    Silva    made    significant\r\n          modifications to the design of the  Dodge\r\n          Viper in his  creation of  the car  body,\r\n          including,  but   not  limited  to:   the\r\n          windshield; the  rollbar; the nose  area;\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n          the wrap-around area of the mirrors;  and\r\n          the cut lines.\r\n\n          15. Mr. Silva did not intend to duplicate\r\n          or otherwise copy the Dodge Viper.\r\n\n          With these findings in hand, the court moved to the\r\n\ntest \r                for \r                    likelihood of confusion, consisting of eight relevant\r\n\nfactors, see Aktiebolaget Electrolux v.

Similarity of  the marks  (dress)  -\r\n               Chrysler\r\n\n          2.   Similarity of goods - Chrysler\r\n\n          3.   Channel of trade - Silva\r\n\n          4.   Channel of advertising - Silva\r\n\n          5.   Class  of  prospective  purchaser  -\r\n               Silva\r\n\n          6.   Evidence  of   actual  confusion   -\r\n               Chrysler\r\n\n          7.   Defendant's intent  in adopting  the\r\n               dress - Silva\r\n\n          8.   Strength of the dress - Chrysler.\r\n\n          On this basis, unless Silva prevails because of his\r\n\nlack  of bad  intent  in  adopting Chrysler's  dress,  it  is\r\n\ndifficult to understand why  Chrysler, who prevailed here  on\r\n\nsimilarity \r                      and strength of dress, should lose its case, it not\r\n\nbeing necessary, since the  Lanham Act's amendment, to  prove\r\n\npurchaser confusion, post.  Beyond this seeming inconsistency\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nit is hard to explain  how the court could say, \"[T]he  Court\r\n\nrules, as a matter of law, that plaintiff did not establish a\r\n\nlikelihood of  confusion between  its vehicle  and the  Silva\r\n\nvehicle.\"  (emphasis supplied.)  If the court meant matter of\r\n\nlaw, it was clearly  wrong.  There were ample lay  witnesses,\r\n\nnotably the other original defendants, expressly mentioned by\r\n\nthe \r               court, \r                      whose evidence  precluded ruling as a matter of law\r\n\nin Silva's favor.\r\n\n          Study \r                           of \r                              its \r                                  opinion as a whole leads us to conclude\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    court really meant \"find,\" or \"conclude,\" and we will\r\n\nso  address  its  decision.    Chrysler  says,  as  it  must,\r\n\nAktiebolaget \r                        Electrolux\r                                 , \r                                   that such a finding was plainly wrong.\r\n\n          A \r                       substantial part of the court's opinion is devoted\r\n\nto listed factors 3, 4 &amp; 5, ante, concluding that  purchasers\r\n\nwould not  be confused or  misled.   Chrysler concedes  this;\r\n\nindeed it offered no evidence to the contrary.3  Rather,  its\r\n\ncase \r                depends \r                        on \r                          what \r                               is \r                                  known as post-sale confusion -- viewers\r\n\nwho  have an  interest from  the standpoint  of the  original\r\n\ncreator's reputation and may be misled.  Chrysler  introduced\r\n\npersuasive \r                      evidence \r                              that \r                                   the Viper added greatly to its general\r\n\nreputation, quite apart from sales.  Infringers who do a poor\r\n\n3.  We devote a footnote to the court's giving weight to its\r\nfinding that Silva did not intend to copy.  Strictly, intent,\r\nor lack thereof, does not affect the eyes of the viewer.  See\r\nLois Sportswear, U.S.A. v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., 799 F.2d 867,\r\n875 (2d Cir. 1986).  Proof of bad intent may,\r\npsychologically, hurt as an admission.  Proof of good intent\r\ndoes not change appearance.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\njob \r               mechanically, \r                            or \r                               introduce differences that detract, but do\r\n\nnot \r               change \r                      the apparent origin, were recognized by Congress in\r\n\nenlarging the statute.  See Roberts, 944 F.2d at 1244-45.  In\r\n\ndisregard of  Fed. R. Civ. P.  52(a), this confusion was  not\r\n\nmentioned, let alone discussed by the court, although it  was\r\n\npart of Chrysler's main case and was adequately supported  by\r\n\nexpert \r                  testimony.4  We see no possible fair resolution of this\r\n\nbasic \r                 inadequacy \r                           short \r                                 of giving Chrysler a whole new trial, to\r\n\nbe \r              before \r                     a \r                       new judge because of the extensive interlocking of\r\n\nthe evidence.\r\n\n          This brings us to Silva's temporary  Administratrix\r\n\nentering the  case  to pursue  the  appeal from  the  summary\r\n\njudgment  disposing of  the counterclaim  for taking  Silva's\r\n\ndesign. \r                    \r                    If \r                      Silva's \r                              testimony of significant variances by which\r\n\nthe Mongoose departed from the Viper is correct, and on which\r\n\nthe court ultimately relied,  it is hard to see how  Chrysler\r\n\npirated \r                   the \r                      Mongoose's \r                                 design.  While a party's pleading may be\r\n\ninconsistent, in the  last analysis one  cannot have it  both\r\n\nways.   The  court was  impressed by  Silva's submission  and\r\n\npretrial evidence  contrary to  the counterclaim,  committing\r\n\nhimself to inconsistencies, and held him estopped5.\r\n\n4.  The court did give some attention to Chrysler's expert\r\nduring trial.  \"I was . . . not paying too much attention to\r\nthe cross-examination, but the last question was a good one,\r\nit woke me up.\"\r\n\n5.  The district court found in relevant part:\r\n\n                            -10-\r\r\n\n          We  are   not   moved  by   Silva's   explanations;\r\n\nparticularly \r                        not by the use he made of the fact that initially\r\n\nhe was  without counsel,  and  we are  much troubled  by  his\r\n\ncharging  Chrysler  with  making  \"an  especially   egregious\r\n\nmisstatement \r                        of fact\" in saying his answers to interrogatories\r\n\nwere under  oath when  they were  unsigned.   Silva fails  to\r\n\nmention \r                   that \r                        in \r                          his \r                              deposition, obviously under oath, he agreed\r\n\nto their correctness.\r\n\n          The judgment dismissing the complaint is  reversed;\r\n\nChrysler \r                    to \r                       have \r                           a \r                             new \r                                 trial.  The judgment for Chrysler on the\r\n\ncounterclaim \r                        is \r                          affirmed, with leave to the succeeding judge to\r\n\nreconsider if so minded.  Costs to Chrysler.\r\n\n               Defendant Silva repeatedly made\r\n          judicial admissions negating his\r\n          misappropriation counterclaim, and, thus,\r\n          is estopped from raising said claim at\r\n          this time.  The Defendant Silva\r\n          repeatedly conceded in pleadings and\r\n          other papers filed with this Court that\r\n          his vehicle is \"significantly different\"\r\n          than the Viper and was based on design\r\n          elements in the public domain.\r\n\n                            -11-\r\n",

Plaintiff Chrysler Corporation  (\"Chrysler\")\r\n\nfiled suit in the Massachusetts District Court in July  1991,\r\n\nunder \r                 the \r                     Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. SS 1051 et seq., for trademark\r\n\ninfringement,\r                         specifically trade dress, against John C. Silva,\r\n\nJr. \r               (\"Silva\"), and a number of other individual defendants who\r\n\nhave settled out.   At issue  was Chrysler's allegation  that\r\n\nSilva copied Chrysler's  innovative \"muscle  car,\" the  Dodge\r\n\nViper.  Silva counter-claimed, alleging that the shoe was  on\r\n\nthe other  foot; that Chrysler was  the one at fault,  having\r\n\nstolen \r                  the \r                     allegedly \r                               infringed design from him.  On December 9,\r\n\n1993  the court,  in a   separate  brief memorandum,  ordered\r\n\nsummary judgment  for Chrysler  on the  counter-claim on  the\r\n\nground of estoppel.1\r\n\n          The \r                         first \r                               of \r                                 Chrysler's \r                                            demands was for a preliminary\r\n\ninjunction \r                      against \r                             violation.  This was denied, and ultimately,\r\n\nafter a bench trial, the court dismissed Chrysler's complaint\r\n\nwith \r                a \r                  memorandum \r                            of \r                               findings.  This was initially done on July\r\n\n19, \r               1995. \r                      \r                      On \r                        August \r                               4 \r                                 Chrysler moved to amend the findings and\r\n\nto alter or amend the judgment, or, alternatively, for a  new\r\n\ntrial.  The court took additional testimony and on January 9,\r\n\n1996 \r                it \r                   again entered judgment for defendant on the complaint.\r\n\nBoth parties appealed.  We affirm in part.\r\n\n1.  This went to judgment on December 14, 1995.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Just prior to oral argument before us, Silva  died.\r\n\nAt \r              the \r                  argument \r                          date \r                               his \r                                   (former) counsel appeared, saying that\r\n\nhe had no client.  On his stating that his argument was ready\r\n\nwe said we  would hear the oral  arguments of both sides  and\r\n\nreproduce \r                     them for the files.  This has been done.  We further\r\n\nstated that we would  afford time for an administrator to  be\r\n\nappointed for  Silva and  move to  continue the  case, if  so\r\n\nminded.   This, too,  has been done.

Facts\r\n\n          It is, of course, well known that there is enormous\r\n\ncompetition  that  depends   upon  the  body  appearance   of\r\n\nautomobiles. \r                         \r                         It \r                           is \r                              not \r                                  so well known that this is so important\r\n\nto true enthusiasts that custom builders make, or order made,\r\n\nspecial \r                   bodies to place over a standard chassis.

A prototype  was\r\n\ncompleted \r                     in \r                        time \r                            for \r                                the January 1989 International Automobile\r\n\nShow \r                in \r                   Detroit.  Here the reception was so good that Chrysler\r\n\nformed TEAM VIPER.  By December 1991, it had four  production\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nunits  and in  1992 it  produced 200  Vipers.   It had  spent\r\n\napproximately  $8,000,000 to  promote this  vehicle and  over\r\n\n$75,000,000  to bring  it into  production.   It attracted  a\r\n\nspecial class of buyers.\r\n\n          During the trial, as a defense to the  infringement\r\n\nclaim, Silva testified that he had contacted Chrysler by mail\r\n\nin  October 1987  and offered  it the  opportunity either  to\r\n\npurchase \r                    his \r                        design for a car Silva had dubbed the \"Mongoose,\"\r\n\nfor \r               which \r                     he \r                        included sketches with his letter, or to contract\r\n\nwith him to build a show car based on the design.  He claimed\r\n\nthat past experience in building cars for large manufacturers\r\n\ninstilled in him the necessity of clearly marking the designs\r\n\nwith proprietary statements of ownership and  confidentiality\r\n\nbefore \r                  forwarding \r                            them \r                                 to Chrysler.  He also included a request\r\n\nthat the sketches be returned if Chrysler was not interested.\r\n\nHe \r              received \r                       no \r                         response \r                                  to his letter and the sketches were not\r\n\nreturned.\r\n\n          In early 1989, Ronald Torlone, one of the  original\r\n\ndefendants, decided  he  wanted a  \"new  look\" for  his  1979\r\n\nChevrolet Corvette.   For this he  retained a builder,  Motor\r\n\nIncorporated,  for  which  Silva  worked  as  an  independent\r\n\ncontractor.   They  and another  original defendant,  Richard\r\n\nGalardi, \r                    produced the Mongoose.2  Also in 1989, after seeing a\r\n\n2.

If the court meant matter of\r\n\nlaw, it was clearly  wrong.  There were ample lay  witnesses,\r\n\nnotably the other original defendants, expressly mentioned by\r\n\nthe \r               court, \r                      whose evidence  precluded ruling as a matter of law\r\n\nin Silva's favor.\r\n\n          Study \r                           of \r                              its \r                                  opinion as a whole leads us to conclude\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    court really meant \"find,\" or \"conclude,\" and we will\r\n\nso  address  its  decision.

Chrysler concedes  this;\r\n\nindeed it offered no evidence to the contrary.3  Rather,  its\r\n\ncase \r                depends \r                        on \r                          what \r                               is \r                                  known as post-sale confusion -- viewers\r\n\nwho  have an  interest from  the standpoint  of the  original\r\n\ncreator's reputation and may be misled.
