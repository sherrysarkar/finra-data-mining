Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                 Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                  and Singal,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Robert W.

This case requires us to evaluate\n\nthe district court's application of an exception to the general\n\nrule that silence does not constitute acceptance of the terms of a\n\ncontract offer.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Bell Microproducts, Inc. (Bell) mailed George R. McGurn\n\na signed offer of employment, which stipulated that if McGurn was\nterminated without cause during the first twelve months of his\n\nemployment with Bell he would receive a severance package worth\n\n$120,000. In countersigning and returning the offer letter, McGurn\ncrossed out the word \"twelve\" and replaced it with \"twenty-four.\"\nMcGurn initialed his alteration, but otherwise did nothing to call\nit to Bell's attention.   Bell terminated McGurn thirteen months\n\nlater and refused to pay him the severance package on the ground\nthat the twelve-month period stipulated in the offer letter had\npassed, and that McGurn's replacement of \"twelve\" with \"twenty-\n\nfour\" was a counteroffer which Bell had never accepted.\n          McGurn filed an action in the Massachusetts Superior\nCourt to collect the compensation he claimed Bell owed him under\nthe contract, and Bell removed the case to federal district court\n\non the basis of diversity of citizenship.    The parties agree that\n\nMassachusetts law governs this dispute.      Presented with cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment for McGurn, finding that Bell's silence in response to\n\nMcGurn's counteroffer constituted an acceptance of the 24-month\n\ntermination clause. We find that conclusion premature. The import\n\n                                  -2-\n\fof Bell's silence cannot be decided as a matter of law on a motion\n\nfor summary judgment because of genuine issues of material fact\n\nabout   whether   Bell    knew   or    should      have    known   of   McGurn's\ncounteroffer.     We therefore vacate the district court's judgment\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                      II.\n\n           Except as noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n\nBell Microproducts is a distributor of semiconductor parts and\n\ncomponents with headquarters in San Jose, California.               McGurn is a\n\nresident of Massachusetts.          In March of 1997, Bell's President,\nDonald Bell, met with McGurn, who at the time was gainfully\n\nemployed elsewhere, to discuss the position of Vice President for\nthe Eastern Region at Bell.         McGurn said that if he came to work\nfor Bell he would require a written contract that included a\n\n\"termination clause\" stipulating that he would receive six months\nsalary and half his commissions in the event that he was fired.\nDuring the next few months McGurn communicated several times with\n\nBill Murphy, the Bell official to whom McGurn would report, and\nexpressed interest in pursuing the position.\n           Based on these discussions, Murphy's secretary prepared\n\nan offer letter and delivered it to Linda Teague, Bell's Director\nof Human Resources.      Teague dated the letter June 10, 1997, signed\nit, and mailed it to McGurn.          Upon receipt of the letter, McGurn\n\ntelephoned Murphy to discuss the offer and the absence of a\ntermination   clause.      McGurn     then   had    a     series   of   telephone\n\nconversations with Donald Bell in which a termination clause was\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdiscussed.      On June 29, McGurn requested a termination clause that\n\nwould remain in force as long as he worked for Bell.                         However, he\n\nalso said to Donald Bell that he would consider one that was\nlimited    to    the    first     twenty      four   months     of     his   employment.\n\nAccording to McGurn, Donald Bell replied that a twenty-four month\n\ntermination clause would be acceptable.\n               Teague     then     drafted       a   second         offer    letter,      in\n\nconsultation with Donald Bell, which she signed and dated July 1,\n\n1997.     The letter included a termination clause stipulating that\n\n\"[i]f your       status    as     an   employee      with    Bell     Microproducts       is\n\nterminated within the first 12 months of employment for any reason\n\nother than gross misconduct, upon termination you will receive a\n\nsix-month severance package.\"              In response, McGurn drafted his own\nproposed offer          letter,    dated    July     2,     1997,    which   included      a\n\nparagraph on termination \"for cause,\" defined as conviction of a\n\nfelony    or    gross    negligence      or    misconduct       on    the    job,   and    a\nparagraph on termination \"without cause,\" which was open-ended:\n\n               [T]he Company may terminate your employment\n               without cause.     In such event, you will\n               continue to receive your base salary for a\n               period of six (6) months following your\n               termination of employment, [and] . . . you\n               will receive an additional lump-sum amount\n               equal to $40,000 or 50% of annual incentive.\n\nMcGurn faxed his proposed offer letter to Murphy.\n\n               McGurn's next contact with Bell was his receipt of an\n\noffer letter dated July 3, 1997, signed by Teague.                            The letter\n\nincluded the following paragraph on termination without cause (we\n\nhave underlined the material change from McGurn's July 2 proposal):\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f          [T]he Company may terminate your employment\n          without cause. In the event that this occurs\n          within your first twelve months of employment,\n          you will continue to receive your base salary\n          for a period of six (6) months following your\n          termination of employment, [and] . . . you\n          will receive an additional lump-sum amount\n          equal to $40,000 or 50% of annual incentive.\nThe letter concluded with Teague's request that McGurn \"sign an\n\nacknowledgment of this offer of employment and return to me for our\n\nfiles.\"   The following appeared under Teague's signature:\n\n           I acknowledge my acceptance of the offer as\n           described above and my start date will be\n           __________.\n\n           Signed _________________ Date _______________\n\nMcGurn signed his name and entered \"7-8-97\" in the other two blank\nspaces. In addition, he crossed out the word \"twelve\" in the\n\ntermination clause, inserted \"twenty four\" directly above it, and\n\ninitialed the change.    The alteration was in the center of the\nsecond page of the two-page letter, five inches above McGurn's\n\nsignature.   McGurn returned the letter to Teague (or possibly to\n\nMurphy), and started work on July 8, 1997.1\n\n           McGurn advised no one at Bell that he had modified the\n\nJuly 3 offer letter, and Teague, Murphy, and Donald Bell all deny\n\nhaving viewed the letter upon its return.     The Human Resources\n\nDepartment did receive the letter, but Teague testified that she\n\nherself would only have been notified if the letter had not been\n\nreceived, as McGurn could not have been paid unless a countersigned\n\n\n     1\n        Bell testified that he returned the letter to \"Teague or\nBill Murphy.\" Teague testified that her department received the\nletter.\n\n                                -5-\n\fcopy of the offer letter was in Bell's files.          Although there is no\n\ndirect evidence that anyone in the Human Resources Department\n\nexamined the returned letter, there was evidence that it was Bell's\npractice to check that returned offer letters had been signed by\n\nthe employee.\n\n            In   or   around   April    of   1998,   Brian    Clark   (Murphy's\nsuccessor at Bell) concluded that McGurn's performance was not\n\nsatisfactory.     At some point after Clark made this determination,\n\nbut before he fired McGurn on August 3, 1998, Murphy discovered\n\nMcGurn's alteration of the offer letter, and discussed it with\n\nTeague and Donald Bell. Upon learning of his termination on August\n\n3, 1998, after approximately 13 months at Bell, McGurn conveyed to\n\nClark his belief that his contract included a two-year termination\nclause.     Clark disagreed, and Bell refused to pay the amounts\n\nspecified in the termination clause.\n\n            McGurn sued Bell for breach of contract in the Superior\nCourt of Middlesex County, Massachusetts.             Based on diversity of\n\ncitizenship, Bell removed the case to federal district court.                28\n\nU.S.C. §    1332(a)(1).    The parties filed cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment.    In a Memorandum and Order dated February 15, 2001, the\n\ndistrict court granted McGurn's motion and denied Bell's motion.\n\nThe district court found that McGurn's alteration of the July 3\n\noffer letter constituted a counteroffer which, in the circumstances\n\nof this case, Bell had accepted by its silence.              The court entered\n\njudgment for McGurn in the amount of $120,000 plus interest, and\n\nBell filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f                                     III.\n\n              The parties agree that McGurn's alteration of Bell's\n\noffer letter constituted a rejection of that offer and created a\n\ncounteroffer.       See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 59 (1981)\n\n(\"A   reply    to   an   offer   which   purports    to   accept   it   but   is\n\nconditional on the offeror's assent to terms additional to or\n\ndifferent from those offered is not an acceptance but is a counter-\n\noffer.\").      What is in dispute is whether Bell accepted McGurn's\n\ncounteroffer.       The district court concluded that it did because\n\nBell should have known about the change made by McGurn, and hence\nits silence constituted an acceptance of McGurn's counteroffer:\n\n              Although no one on behalf of the defendant\n              signed McGurn's counteroffer, the defendant\n              admits it received the offer and accepted\n              McGurn's services for thirteen months.       A\n              presumably sophisticated employer who receives\n              a   signed  letter   of  engagement    from  a\n              prospective employee and fails to read the\n              letter,    particularly    after   weeks    of\n              negotiation, does so at its own peril. Thus,\n              in the circumstances of this case, the\n              defendant's failure to read the terms of the\n              offer [does] not preclude the formation of a\n              contract. The defendant accepted the terms of\n              the plaintiff's offer when it decided to and\n              did employ the plaintiff for thirteen months.\nUrging a different theory than the \"should have known\" theory\n\nadopted by the district court, McGurn argues that Bell's silence in\nthe face of his counteroffer amounted to an acceptance because Bell\nknew that McGurn had amended the termination clause, but gave no\n\nindication that it rejected the change.             Bell denies that it knew\nabout McGurn's alteration of the offer letter.\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          As a general rule, silence in response to an offer to\n\nenter into a contract does not constitute an acceptance of the\n\noffer.   See   Restatement    (Second)    of   Contracts   §   69   cmt.    a\n(\"Acceptance   by   silence   is   exceptional.\");   Polaroid    Corp.     v.\n\nRollins Envtl. Servs. (NJ), Inc., 624 N.E. 2d 959, 964 (Mass. 1993)\n\n(noting that \"silence does not ordinarily manifest assent\"). There\nis, however, an exception to the rule against acceptance by silence\n\n\"[w]here an offeree takes the benefit of offered services with\n\nreasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they\n\nwere offered with the expectation of compensation.\"2           Restatement\n\n(Second) of Contracts § 69(1)(a).\n\n          In Gateway Co. v. Charlotte Theatres, Inc., 297 F.2d 483\n\n(1st Cir. 1961), a case in many respects similar to this one, the\ndefendant had sent the plaintiff two copies of a document which\n\nreduced to writing an oral agreement for the defendant to install\n\nair conditioning in the plaintiff's movie theater, with one copy to\nbe countersigned and returned.      Id. at 485.   The plaintiff signed,\n\nbut also inserted a provision that the work would be performed by\n\na certain date.     Id.   The plaintiff returned the countersigned\n\ncontract with a cover letter noting its \"understanding\" that the\n\nwork would be performed by that date (although the letter made no\n\n\n     2\n          Although the Restatement exception, by its terms,\naddresses a situation in which the offeree advances no payment at\nall in exchange for the offeror's services, the district court\nconcluded correctly that the exception also applies when there is\na dispute about the nature or extent of required compensation. See\nPolaroid, 624 N.E.2d at 964 (applying the exception to a dispute\nover whether a waste disposal contract included an indemnification\nclause).\n\n                                    -8-\n\freference to the alteration of the contract itself).    Id. at 485-\n\n86.   We stated that \"[i]n the absence of actual knowledge [of the\n\nalteration of the contract], the test is whether there was reason\nfor [the defendant] to suppose that such addition might have been\n\nmade.\"   Id. at 486.    We held that because of the cover letter\n\nflagging the issue, defendant's silence could constitute acceptance\nof plaintiff's counteroffer.\n\n           Importantly, we also noted in Gateway that \"absent the\n\n[cover] letter, the case would seem more like\" Kidder v. Greenman,\n\n187 N.E. 42 (Mass. 1933).   Gateway, 297 F.2d at 486.   In Kidder, a\n\ntenant had signed and returned a lease to her landlord with the\n\nunderstanding that the landlord would fill in certain blank spaces\n\npursuant to an oral agreement.     The landlord then completed the\nlease so as to include a term contrary to the oral understanding,\n\nsigned it, and returned it to the tenant, who \"did not look at the\n\nlease at the time she received it except to slit the envelope and\nsee it contained a lease.\"      Kidder, 187 N.E. at 45 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      The court declined to enforce the\n\ndisputed term against the tenant on the ground that she \"had no\n\nreason to think that the [landlord] had not completed the lease in\n\nthe authorized manner and, therefore, [had] no occasion to examine\n\nit, when it was returned to her, to see if he had done so.\"   Id. at\n\n48.   The Kidder court concluded that \"[i]n these circumstances the\n\ndoctrine that a person who accepts an instrument . . . without\n\nreading it . . . is charged with knowledge of [its] contents is not\n\napplicable.\"   Id. (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           We distill from the Restatement and the Gateway and\n\nKidder precedents the legal rule in Massachusetts that silence in\n\nresponse to an offer may constitute an acceptance if an offeree who\ntakes the benefit of offered services knew or had reason to know of\n\nthe existence of the offer, and had a reasonable opportunity to\n\nreject it.      See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 69(1)(a);\n\nGateway, 297 F.2d at 485-86; Kidder, 187 N.E. at 48.              We turn now\n\nto the application of that rule in this case.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n           Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), a court may\nenter summary judgment if the record \"show[s] that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"          We review the district\ncourt's grant of summary judgment de novo, and examine the record\n\nin the light most favorable to the party against whom summary\njudgment had been entered, drawing all reasonable inferences in\nthat party's favor.    Barreto-Rivera v. Medina-Vargas, 168 F.3d 42,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 1999).        We note that \"disputes about whether a\ncontract has or has not been formed as the result of words and\nconduct over a period of time . . . present interpretive issues\n\ntraditionally     understood    to    be    for     the   trier   of    fact.\"\nCharbonnages de France v. Smith, 597 F.2d 406, 414-15 (4th Cir.\n\n1979).   This is so unless \"the manifestations of intention of both\n\nparties to   be   bound,   or   of   either   not    to   be   bound,   are   so\nunequivocal as to present no genuine issue of fact.\"              Id. at 415.\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fA. The District Court's Opinion\n\n          In response to Bell's assertion that it did not notice\n\nMcGurn's alteration of the offer letter until just before his\n\ntermination, the district court observed that \"absent fraud, a\n\nparty to a contract is bound by the terms of the contract whether\n\nor not he read them.\"   The court added: \"It will not do for a man\n\nto enter into a contract, and, when called upon to respond to its\n\nobligations, to say that he did not read it when he signed it, or\n\ndid not know what it contained.\"       The district court's legal\n\nproposition is sound, but inapposite to this case.      The disputed\nterm was added to the offer after Bell had signed it.   The relevant\n\nquestion is why, as a matter of law, Bell should be expected to re-\n\nread an offer it had written and signed, upon its return with\nMcGurn's countersignature.\n\n          In response to that question, the district court declared\nthat \"[a] presumably sophisticated employer who receives a signed\nletter of engagement from a prospective employee and fails to read\n\nthe letter, particularly after weeks of negotiation, does so at its\nown peril.\"   Although the logic of this generalization has some\nappeal, its generality is an insurmountable problem.     Unless the\n\nrecord establishes that Bell knew or had reason to know that McGurn\nhad modified what Bell had written--and the district court points\nto no facts in the record that would support such a conclusion--we\n\ncannot say that Bell's silence, as a matter of law, constituted an\nacceptance of McGurn's counteroffer.\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f             Although we decline to endorse the district court's\n\ngeneralization, \"we may affirm [a summary judgment] order on any\n\nground revealed by the record.\"              Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.\nTown of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).                   We therefore\n\nexamine the record to see if, drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nBell's favor, the evidence nevertheless compels the conclusion that\nresponsible officials at Bell knew or should have known about\n\nMcGurn's counteroffer far enough in advance of his termination that\n\nBell   had    a    reasonable     opportunity        to    reject    the    24-month\n\ntermination clause if it wished to avoid being bound.                        Summary\n\njudgment     for    McGurn    would    be   proper    if    Bell    had    actual   or\n\nconstructive knowledge of McGurn's counteroffer at the time he\n\nreturned the       offer     letter,   or   if,   when     Clark    discovered      the\ncounteroffer, he had a \"reasonable opportunity to reject\" it before\n\nhe fired McGurn, but instead continued to \"take[] the benefit of\n\n[McGurn's] services\" without speaking up.                 Restatement (Second) of\n\nContracts § 69(1)(a).\n\n             There are three possible grounds for affirmance suggested\n\nby the record, two involving alleged actual knowledge and one\n\ninvolving constructive knowledge.              We examine them in turn.\n\nB. Prominence of the Alteration\n\n             McGurn argues that Bell had actual knowledge of the\nalteration of the offer letter at the time of its return.                   Although\n\nMcGurn advances no direct evidence that anyone at Bell noticed his\nrevision     of    the   termination    clause,      he    points    out    that    the\n\nalteration was made on the same page that bore his signature, which\n\n                                        -12-\n\fBell acknowledges an unknown employee checked pursuant to company\n\npolicy.   McGurn infers from this that the unknown employee \"had to\n\nhave seen the change\" in the duration of the termination clause,\nbecause \"one's eyes are immediately drawn to the change made by\n\nMcGurn and his initials above that change.\"\n\n           While an inference that Bell \"had to have seen the\nchange\" would be permissible based on the evidence in the record--\n\nthe alteration was in the center of the very page McGurn had\n\nsigned--we cannot say that a factfinder would be required to\n\nconclude that the Bell employee who checked for McGurn's signature\n\nmust have noticed McGurn's alteration of the termination clause\n\nhalf-way up the page.   That is, the evidence that a Bell employee\n\nmust have seen McGurn's alteration is not \"so one-sided that\n[McGurn] must prevail as a matter of law.\"     Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).\n\nC. Clark's Discovery\n\n           Clark declared that he examined the countersigned offer\n\nletter and discovered what McGurn had done \"[a]t some point after\nmaking [the] decision [to terminate McGurn], but before the actual\ntermination.\"   The record only establishes that this discovery was\n\nmade during or after April of 1998, and before McGurn was fired in\nAugust of 1998.3    McGurn argues that once Bell discovered his\n\n\n\n     3\n        In Bell's Statement of Material Facts, the timing of the\ndiscovery is characterized as follows: \"McGurn's change . . . was\nnot discovered until sometime during or after April, 1998,\nafter . . . Brian Clark[] had determined that McGurn's performance\nwas not satisfactory.\"\n\n                                -13-\n\fcounteroffer it had an obligation to speak up if it wished to\n\nreject it.     Bell points out, however, that Clark \"could have\n\ndiscovered the altered document as late as the day before\" he fired\nMcGurn.    Whatever the merits of McGurn's legal argument on this\n\npoint--a   matter   as    to   which   we   take   no    view--this     factual\n\nuncertainty precludes summary judgment for McGurn based on Clark's\nactual knowledge of McGurn's counteroffer.\n\nD. Teague's Responsibility\n\n            We also examine the record for evidence that Teague\n\n(Bell's Director     of    Human   Resources),     or   an   employee    in   her\ndepartment acting on her behalf, should have determined if the\n\nreturned offer letter had been modified.           Teague had participated\nin the negotiations with McGurn. She stated at her deposition that\n\"Bill Murphy and I worked together on all of these offer letters,\"\n\nand Donald Bell testified that he \"consult[ed] with Linda [Teague]\"\nduring the drafting of the letter.4          The July 3 offer letter from\nBell to McGurn was signed by Teague, and indicated that McGurn\n\nshould    return   the    countersigned     copy   to   her.     Under    these\ncircumstances, a jury might conclude that McGurn could reasonably\nhave expected Teague (or Murphy) to inspect the document upon its\n\nreturn.    Moreover, the offer set out in Bell's letter was not a\nmere reduction to writing of a previous oral agreement; it was a\nstep in a negotiation which Bell had no reason to assume had been\n\n\n\n     4\n         The actual discussions (in person and via telephone)\nbetween Bell and McGurn were conducted by Bill Murphy and Donald\nBell, not by Teague.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fconcluded.          Although Teague requested that McGurn simply sign and\n\nreturn the letter unamended, the evidence supports the inference\n\nthat she had no basis for assuming he would do so.                     Instead, she\nshould have checked the document to ensure that he had not made\n\nfurther changes.\n\n               Although an inference that Teague should have examined\nthe returned offer letter with greater care would be permissible\n\nbased on the evidence in the record, the evidence, again, does not\n\ncompel such an inference. Bell disputes the notion that Teague (or\n\nher subordinates) had any reason to check the returned offer letter\n\nfor unauthorized modifications, and a factfinder might conclude\n\nthat       Teague    had   no   reason   to   inspect   the   letter    absent   any\n\nindication from McGurn that he had revised a material term.5\n               We have stated that \"[o]rdinarily the question of whether\n\na contract has been made . . . is for the jury,\" Ismert & Assocs.,\n\nInc. v. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 801 F.2d 536, 541 (1st Cir.\n1986), except where \"[t]he words and actions that allegedly formed\n\na contract [are] so clear themselves that reasonable people could\n\n       5\n        Because the July 3 offer letter was signed by Teague, and\nMcGurn returned it to Teague (or Bill Murphy), we need not be\ndetained by Bell's argument that the low-level employee who\nexamined the returned letter lacked the authority to bind the\ncorporation (with his silence) on the question of McGurn's\ntermination clause. Teague having requested that McGurn return the\nletter to her, it would be no defense for her to say that a\nsubordinate in her office who lacked the authority to bind the\ncorporation opened the letter and failed to show it to her. See\nGateway, 297 F.2d at 486 & n.4 (holding corporation responsible for\ncontents of letter addressed to its president but read by a\nsecretary). To accept Bell's argument on this point would be to\npenalize McGurn for Teague's failure to read her own mail. The\nsame logic applies if McGurn returned the letter to Murphy, as he\nsuggested he might have done.\n\n                                         -15-\n\fnot differ over their meaning,\" Borque v.

Instead,\nthose issues must be resolved by the factfinder at a trial.\n\n          Judgment vacated.          Remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.        Each party to bear his or its own\ncosts.\n\n                     -- Separate Opinion Follows --\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge (dubitante).       I write separately\n\nbecause I doubt that the court's opinion reflects either the\n\npracticalities of the case at hand or the result that the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC) would reach.\n\n          The critical facts are undisputed. McGurn's counteroffer\n\n- the letter containing his modification of the termination clause\n\n- was received at Bell's headquarters in the ordinary course and\n\nrouted by it to its human resources department. That letter formed\n\nthe basis for the company's treatment of McGurn as an employee and\n\nremained part of the corporate personnel records for the duration\nof his employment.   Given these facts, the case turns on whether\n\nBell should be said to have accepted McGurn's counteroffer.\n          While no official of the company ever said \"I accept\" in\nso many words, acceptance can occur by silence under certain\n\ncircumstances. See, e.g., Ismert & Assocs., Inc. v. New Engl. Mut.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 801 F.2d 536, 541-42 (1st Cir. 1986); Polaroid Corp.\n\nv. Rollins Envtl. Servs. (NJ), Inc., 624 N.E.2d 959, 964 (Mass.\n\n1993); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 69 (1981). One\nsuch set of circumstances, pertinent here, is when an offeree fails\nto reply to an offer yet takes the benefit of the offered services\n\nwith reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that\nthey   were   tendered   in   the   expectation   of   a   particular\nconsideration.   See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 69(1).   In\n\nsuch a situation, it would be manifestly unjust for an offeree to\nreap the benefit of the services without letting the offeror know\n\nthat it had no intention of paying the remuneration that the\n\n                                -17-\n\fofferor expected to receive.                  Id., cmt. b.      Thus, fundamental\n\nfairness permits silence to operate as an acceptance.\n\n                  This    principle     is   part   of   the   warp       and   woof    of\nMassachusetts contract law.              See Polaroid, 624 N.E.2d at 964; Bump\n\nv. Robbins, 509 N.E.2d 12, 18-19 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987).                          On the\n\nfacts of record here, I think it likely that the SJC would find, as\ndid the able district judge, that Bell implicitly assented to (and,\n\ntherefore, should be bound by) the terms of McGurn's counteroffer.\n\nAfter all, Bell unreservedly accepted McGurn's services, having\n\nreason to know from its own files that those services were being\n\nrendered with an expectation that the terms of the counteroffer\n\n(including the amended termination clause) would be fulfilled.6\n\n                  To be sure, Bell tells us that, even though it employed\nMcGurn for thirteen months pursuant to the letter that set out the\n\nterms of his counteroffer, no one in its employ noticed the\n\nmodification.            But there is no hint here of chicanery on McGurn's\npart,       and    I     doubt   that   ignorance   induced    by     a    party's     own\n\nnegligence or lassitude is a basis for escaping from contractual\nobligations.           To the contrary, the acceptance of offered services,\n\nunder circumstances in which the beneficiary of those services\n\nought to have known that the provider expected to be compensated\n\n\n        6\n      Suppose the shoe was on the other foot, and McGurn's\ncounteroffer had included not only an expanded termination clause\nbut also a covenant not to compete. Only an innocent would assume\nthat Bell would refrain from attempting to enforce the covenant\nagainst McGurn.   To my mind, this example illustrates that the\nmajority's resolution of the case lets Bell have its cake and eat\nit too. I have no stomach for so one-sided a result - and I doubt\nthat the SJC would find it appetizing.\n\n                                             -18-\n\ffor them in a certain way, is the functional equivalent of express\n\nassent.   See Bump, 509 N.E.2d at 18-19.           This case seems to fit\n\nwithin the contours of that rule.\n              To sum up, I believe that a party should not be able to\n\ninsulate itself from ex contractu liability by professing that it\n\nneglected to read the very document essential for the formation of\nthe contract, especially when that document has reposed in its own\n\nfiles at all relevant times.            Were the law otherwise and the\n\nmajority's view taken to its logical extreme, an offeree could\n\ncompletely redefine its responsibilities by the simple expedient of\n\nclaiming that it was not aware of what its own records plainly\n\nshowed. I doubt that the SJC would countenance so counterintuitive\n\na   result.      Cf.   Upton   v.   Tribilcock,   91   U.S.   45,   50   (1875)\n(observing that \"[i]t will not do for a man to enter into a\n\ncontract, and, when called upon to respond to its obligations, to\n\nsay that he did not . . . know what it contained.               If this were\npermitted, contracts would not be worth the paper on which they are\n\nwritten\").      Given this doubt, I respectfully decline to join the\n\ncourt's opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f",

(Bell) mailed George R. McGurn a signed offer of employment, which stipulated that if McGurn was terminated without cause during the first twelve months of his employment with Bell he would receive a severance package worth $120,000. In countersigning and returning the offer letter, McGurn crossed out the word \"twelve\" and replaced it with \"twenty-four.\" McGurn initialed his alteration, but otherwise did nothing to call it to Bell's attention. Bell terminated McGurn thirteen months later and refused to pay him the severance package on the ground that the twelve-month period stipulated in the offer letter had passed, and that McGurn's replacement of \"twelve\" with \"twenty-four\" was a counteroffer which Bell had never accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn filed an action in the Massachusetts Superior Court to collect the compensation he claimed Bell owed him under the contract, and Bell removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. The parties agree that Massachusetts law governs this dispute. Presented with cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment for McGurn, finding that Bell's silence in response to McGurn's counteroffer constituted an acceptance of the 24-month termination clause. We find that conclusion premature. The import of Bell's silence cannot be decided as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment because of genuine issues of material fact about whether Bell knew or should have known of McGurn's counteroffer. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as noted, the following facts are undisputed. Bell Microproducts is a distributor of semiconductor parts and components with headquarters in San Jose, California. McGurn is a resident of Massachusetts. In March of 1997, Bell's President, Donald Bell, met with McGurn, who at the time was gainfully employed elsewhere, to discuss the position of Vice President for the Eastern Region at Bell. McGurn said that if he came to work for Bell he would require a written contract that included a \"termination clause\" stipulating that he would receive six months salary and half his commissions in the event that he was fired. During the next few months McGurn communicated several times with Bill Murphy, the Bell official to whom McGurn would report, and expressed interest in pursuing the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these discussions, Murphy's secretary prepared an offer letter and delivered it to Linda Teague, Bell's Director of Human Resources. Teague dated the letter June 10, 1997, signed it, and mailed it to McGurn. Upon receipt of the letter, McGurn telephoned Murphy to discuss the offer and the absence of a termination clause. McGurn then had a series of telephone conversations with Donald Bell in which a termination clause was discussed. On June 29, McGurn requested a termination clause that would remain in force as long as he worked for Bell. However, he also said to Donald Bell that he would consider one that was limited to the first twenty four months of his employment. According to McGurn, Donald Bell replied that a twenty-four month termination clause would be acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Teague then drafted a second offer letter, in consultation with Donald Bell, which she signed and dated July 1, 1997. The letter included a termination clause stipulating that \"[i]f your status as an employee with Bell Microproducts is terminated within the first 12 months of employment for any reason other than gross misconduct, upon termination you will receive a six-month severance package.\" In response, McGurn drafted his own proposed offer letter, dated July 2, 1997, which included a paragraph on termination \"for cause,\" defined as conviction of a felony or gross negligence or misconduct on the job, and a paragraph on termination \"without cause,\" which was open-ended:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Company may terminate your employment without cause. In such event, you will continue to receive your base salary for a period of six (6) months following your termination of employment, [and] ... you will receive an additional lump-sum amount equal to $40,000 or 50% of annual incentive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn faxed his proposed offer letter to Murphy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn's next contact with Bell was his receipt of an offer letter dated July 3, 1997, signed by Teague. The letter included the following paragraph on termination without cause (we have underlined the material change from McGurn's July 2 proposal):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Company may terminate your employment without cause.

In addition, he crossed out the word \"twelve\" in the termination clause, inserted \"twenty four\" directly above it, and initialed the change. The alteration was in the center of the second page of the two-page letter, five inches above McGurn's signature. McGurn returned the letter to Teague (or possibly to Murphy), and started work on July 8, 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn advised no one at Bell that he had modified the July 3 offer letter, and Teague, Murphy, and Donald Bell all deny having viewed the letter upon its return. The Human Resources Department did receive the letter, but Teague testified that she herself would only have been notified if the letter had <i>not</i> been received, as McGurn could not have been paid unless a countersigned copy of the offer letter was in Bell's files. Although there is no direct evidence that anyone in the Human Resources Department examined the returned letter, there was evidence that it was Bell's practice to check that returned offer letters had been signed by the employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or around April of 1998, Brian Clark (Murphy's successor at Bell) concluded that McGurn's performance was not satisfactory. At some point after Clark made this determination, but before he fired McGurn on August 3, 1998, Murphy discovered McGurn's alteration of the offer letter, and discussed it with Teague and Donald Bell. Upon learning of his termination on August 3, 1998, after approximately 13 months at Bell, McGurn conveyed to Clark his belief that his contract included a two-year termination clause. Clark disagreed, and Bell refused to pay the amounts specified in the termination clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn sued Bell for breach of contract in the Superior Court of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Based on diversity of citizenship, Bell removed the case to federal district court. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(1). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In a Memorandum and Order dated February 15, 2001, the district court granted McGurn's motion and denied Bell's motion. The district court found that McGurn's alteration of the July 3 offer letter constituted a counteroffer which, in the circumstances of this case, Bell had accepted by its silence. The court entered judgment for McGurn in the amount of $120,000 plus interest, and Bell filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that McGurn's alteration of Bell's offer letter constituted a rejection of that offer and created a counteroffer. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 59 (1981) (\"A reply to an offer which purports to accept it but is conditional on the offeror's assent to terms additional to or different from those offered is not an acceptance but is a counter-offer.\"). What is in dispute is whether Bell accepted McGurn's counteroffer. The district court concluded that it did because Bell should have known about the change made by McGurn, and hence its silence constituted an acceptance of McGurn's counteroffer:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although no one on behalf of the defendant signed McGurn's counteroffer, the defendant admits it received the offer and accepted McGurn's services for thirteen months. A presumably sophisticated employer who receives a signed letter of engagement from a prospective employee and fails to read the letter, particularly after weeks of negotiation, does so at its own peril. Thus, in the circumstances of this case, the defendant's failure to read the terms of the offer [does] not preclude the formation of a contract. The defendant accepted the terms of the plaintiff's offer when it decided to and did employ the plaintiff for thirteen months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Urging a different theory than the \"should have known\" theory adopted by the district court, McGurn argues that Bell's silence in the face of his counteroffer amounted to an acceptance because Bell knew that McGurn had amended the termination clause, but gave no indication that it rejected the change.

The court declined to enforce the disputed term against the tenant on the ground that she \"had no reason to think that the [landlord] had not completed the lease in the authorized manner and, therefore, [had] no occasion to examine it, when it was returned to her, to see if he had done so.\" <i>Id.</i> at 48.

The District Court's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Bell's assertion that it did not notice McGurn's alteration of the offer letter until just before his termination, the district court observed that \"absent fraud, a party to a contract is bound by the terms of the contract whether or not he read them.\" The court added: \"It will not do for a man to enter into a contract, and, when called upon to respond to its obligations, to say that he did not read it when he signed it, or did not know what it contained.\" The district court's legal proposition is sound, but inapposite to this case. The disputed term was added to the offer <i>after Bell had signed it.</i> The relevant question is why, as a matter of law, Bell should be expected to <i>re-read</i> an offer it had written and signed, upon its return with McGurn's countersignature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to that question, the district court declared that \"[a] presumably sophisticated employer who receives a signed letter of engagement from a prospective employee and fails to read the letter, particularly after weeks of negotiation, does so at its own peril.\" Although the logic of this generalization has some appeal, its generality is an insurmountable problem. Unless the record establishes that Bell knew or had reason to know that McGurn had modified what Bell had written &#8212; and the district court points to no facts in the record that would support such a conclusion &#8212; we cannot say that Bell's silence, as a matter of law, constituted an acceptance of McGurn's counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we decline to endorse the district court's generalization, \"we may affirm [a summary judgment] order on any ground revealed by the record.\" <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999). We therefore examine the record to see if, drawing all reasonable inferences in Bell's favor, the evidence nevertheless compels the conclusion that responsible officials at Bell knew or should have known about McGurn's counteroffer far enough in advance of his termination that Bell had a reasonable opportunity to reject the 24-month termination clause if it wished to avoid being bound. Summary judgment for McGurn would be proper if Bell had actual or constructive knowledge of McGurn's counteroffer at the time he returned the offer letter, or if, when Clark discovered the counteroffer, he had a \"reasonable opportunity to reject\" it before he fired McGurn, but instead continued to \"take[ ] the benefit of [McGurn's] services\" without speaking up. <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 69(1)(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three possible grounds for affirmance suggested by the record, two involving alleged actual knowledge and one involving constructive knowledge.

Prominence of the Alteration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn argues that Bell had actual knowledge of the alteration of the offer letter at the time of its return. Although McGurn advances no direct evidence that anyone at Bell noticed his revision of the termination clause, he points out that the alteration was made on the same page that bore his signature, which Bell acknowledges an unknown employee checked pursuant to company policy. McGurn infers from this that the unknown employee \"had to have seen the change\" in the duration of the termination clause, because \"one's eyes are immediately drawn to the change made by McGurn and his initials above that change.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an inference that Bell \"had to have seen the change\" would be permissible based on the evidence in the record &#8212; the alteration was in the center of the very page McGurn had signed &#8212; we cannot say that a factfinder would be required to conclude that the Bell employee who checked for McGurn's signature must have noticed McGurn's alteration of the termination clause half-way up the page. That is, the evidence that a Bell employee must have seen McGurn's alteration is not \"so one-sided that [McGurn] must prevail as a matter of law.\" <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Clark's Discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clark declared that he examined the countersigned offer letter and discovered what McGurn had done \"[a]t some point after making [the] decision [to terminate McGurn], but before the actual termination.\" The record only establishes that this discovery was made during or after April of 1998, and before McGurn was fired in August of 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> McGurn argues that once Bell discovered his counteroffer it had an obligation to speak up if it wished to reject it. Bell points out, however, that Clark \"could have discovered the altered document as late as the day before\" he fired McGurn. Whatever the merits of McGurn's legal argument on this point &#8212; a matter as to which we take no view &#8212; this factual uncertainty precludes summary judgment for McGurn based on Clark's actual knowledge of McGurn's counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Teague's Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also examine the record for evidence that Teague (Bell's Director of Human Resources), or an employee in her department acting on her behalf, should have determined if the returned offer letter had been modified. Teague had participated in the negotiations with McGurn. She stated at her deposition that \"Bill Murphy and I worked together on all of these offer letters,\" and Donald Bell testified that he \"consult[ed] with Linda [Teague]\" during the drafting of the letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The July 3 offer letter from Bell to McGurn was signed by Teague, and indicated that McGurn should return the countersigned copy <i>to her.</i> Under these circumstances, a jury might conclude that McGurn could reasonably have expected Teague (or Murphy) to inspect the document upon its return. Moreover, the offer set out in Bell's letter was not a mere reduction to writing of a previous oral agreement; it was a step in a negotiation which Bell had no reason to assume had been concluded. Although Teague requested that McGurn simply sign and return the letter unamended, the evidence supports the inference that she had no basis for assuming he would do so. Instead, she should have checked the document to ensure that he had not made further changes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although an inference that Teague should have examined the returned offer letter with greater care would be permissible based on the evidence in the record, the evidence, again, does not compel such an inference. Bell disputes the notion that Teague (or her subordinates) had any reason to check the returned offer letter for unauthorized modifications, and a factfinder might conclude that Teague had no reason to inspect the letter absent any indication from McGurn that he had revised a material term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that \"[o]rdinarily the question of whether a contract has been made ... is for the jury,\" <i>Ismert &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 801 F.2d 536, 541 (1st Cir.1986), except where \"[t]he words and actions that allegedly formed a contract [are] so clear themselves that reasonable people could not differ over their meaning,\" <i>Bourque v. FDIC,</i> 42 F.3d 704, 708 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). When, as is the case here, \"the facts support plausible but conflicting inferences on a pivotal issue in the case, the judge may not choose between those inferences at the summary judgment stage.\" <i>Coyne v. Taber Partners I,</i> 53 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir.1995); <i>accord</i> 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Brian Clark[] had determined that McGurn's performance was not satisfactory.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The actual discussions (in person and via telephone) between Bell and McGurn were conducted by Bill Murphy and Donald Bell, not by Teague</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Because the July 3 offer letter was signed by Teague, and McGurn returned it to Teague (or Bill Murphy), we need not be detained by Bell's argument that the low-level employee who examined the returned letter lacked the authority to bind the corporation (with his silence) on the question of McGurn's termination clause. Teague having requested that McGurn return the letter<i>to her,</i> it would be no defense for her to say that a subordinate in her office who lacked the authority to bind the corporation opened the letter and failed to show it to her. <i>See Gateway,</i> 297 F.2d at 486 &amp; n. 4 (holding corporation responsible for contents of letter addressed to its president but read by a secretary). To accept Bell's argument on this point would be to penalize McGurn for Teague's failure to read her own mail. The same logic applies if McGurn returned the letter to Murphy, as he suggested he might have done.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge (dubitante).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I write separately because I doubt that the court's opinion reflects either the practicalities of the case at hand or the result that the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) would reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical facts are undisputed. McGurn's counteroffer &#8212; the letter containing his modification of the termination clause &#8212; was received at Bell's headquarters in the ordinary course and routed by it to its human resources department. That letter formed the basis for the company's treatment of McGurn as an employee and remained part of the corporate personnel records for the duration of his employment. Given these facts, the case turns on whether Bell should be said to have accepted McGurn's counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While no official of the company ever said \"I accept\" in so many words, acceptance can occur by silence under certain circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Ismert &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. New Engl. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 801 F.2d 536, 541-42 (1st Cir.1986); <i>Polaroid Corp. v. Rollins Envtl. Servs. (NJ), Inc.,</i> 416 Mass. 684, 624 N.E.2d 959, 964 (1993); <i>see also</i> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 69 (1981). One such set of circumstances, pertinent here, is when an offeree fails to reply to an offer yet takes the benefit of the offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were tendered in the expectation of a particular consideration. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 69(1). In such a situation, it would be manifestly unjust for an offeree to reap the benefit of the services without letting the offeror know that it had no intention of paying the remuneration that the offeror expected to receive. <i>Id.,</i> cmt. b. Thus, fundamental fairness permits silence to operate as an acceptance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This principle is part of the warp and woof of Massachusetts contract law. <i>See Polaroid,</i> 624 N.E.2d at 964; <i>Bump v. Robbins,</i> 24 Mass.App.Ct. 296, 509 N.E.2d 12, 18-19 (1987). On the facts of record here, I think it likely that the SJC would find, as did the able district judge, that Bell implicitly assented to (and, therefore, should be bound by) the terms of McGurn's counteroffer. After all, Bell unreservedly accepted McGurn's services, having reason to know <i>from its own files</i> that those services were being rendered with an expectation that the terms of the counteroffer (including the amended termination clause) would be fulfilled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Bell tells us that, even though it employed McGurn for thirteen months <i>pursuant to the letter that set out the terms of his counteroffer,</i> no one in its employ noticed the modification. But there is no hint here of chicanery on McGurn's part, and I doubt that ignorance induced by a party's own negligence or lassitude is a basis for escaping from contractual obligations. To the contrary, the acceptance of offered services, under circumstances in which the beneficiary of those services ought to have known that the provider expected to be compensated for them in a certain way, is the functional equivalent of express assent. <i>See Bump,</i> 509 N.E.2d at 18-19. This case seems to fit within the contours of that rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, I believe that a party should not be able to insulate itself from ex contractu liability by professing that it neglected to read the very document essential for the formation of the contract, especially when that document has reposed in its own files at all relevant times. Were the law otherwise and the majority's view taken to its logical extreme, an offeree could completely redefine its responsibilities by the simple expedient of claiming that it was not aware of what its own records plainly showed. I doubt that the SJC would countenance so counterintuitive a result. <i>Cf. Upton v. Tribilcock,</i> 91 U.S. 45, 50, 23 L.Ed. 203 (1875) (observing that \"[i]t will not do for a man to enter into a contract, and, when called upon to respond to its obligations, to say that he did not ... know what it contained. If this were permitted, contracts would not be worth the paper on which they are written\"). Given this doubt, I respectfully decline to join the court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Suppose the shoe was on the other foot, and McGurn's counteroffer had included not only an expanded termination clause but also a covenant not to compete. Only an innocent would assume that Bell would refrain from attempting to enforce the covenant against McGurn. To my mind, this example illustrates that the majority's resolution of the case lets Bell have its cake and eat it too. I have no stomach for so one-sided a result &#8212; and I doubt that the SJC would find it appetizing</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(Bell) mailed George R. McGurn a signed offer of employment, which stipulated that if McGurn was terminated without cause during the first twelve months of his employment with Bell he would receive a severance package worth $120,000. In countersigning and returning the offer letter, McGurn crossed out the word \"twelve\" and replaced it with \"twenty-four.\" McGurn initialed his alteration, but otherwise did nothing to call it to Bell's attention. Bell terminated McGurn thirteen months later and refused to pay him the severance package on the ground that the twelve-month period stipulated in the offer letter had passed, and that McGurn's replacement of \"twelve\" with \"twenty-four\" was a counteroffer which Bell had never accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn filed an action in the Massachusetts Superior Court to collect the compensation he claimed Bell owed him under the contract, and Bell removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. The parties agree that Massachusetts law governs this dispute. Presented with cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment for McGurn, finding that Bell's silence in response to McGurn's counteroffer constituted an acceptance of the 24-month termination clause. We find that conclusion premature. The import of Bell's silence cannot be decided as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment because of genuine issues of material fact about whether Bell knew or should have known of McGurn's counteroffer. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as noted, the following facts are undisputed. Bell Microproducts is a distributor of semiconductor parts and components with headquarters in San Jose, California. McGurn is a resident of Massachusetts. In March of 1997, Bell's President, Donald Bell, met with McGurn, who at the time was gainfully employed elsewhere, to discuss the position of Vice President for the Eastern Region at Bell. McGurn said that if he came to work for Bell he would require a written contract that included a \"termination clause\" stipulating that he would receive six months salary and half his commissions in the event that he was fired. During the next few months McGurn communicated several times with Bill Murphy, the Bell official to whom McGurn would report, and expressed interest in pursuing the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these discussions, Murphy's secretary prepared an offer letter and delivered it to Linda Teague, Bell's Director of Human Resources. Teague dated the letter June 10, 1997, signed it, and mailed it to McGurn. Upon receipt of the letter, McGurn telephoned Murphy to discuss the offer and the absence of a termination clause. McGurn then had a series of telephone conversations with Donald Bell in which a termination clause was discussed. On June 29, McGurn requested a termination clause that would remain in force as long as he worked for Bell. However, he also said to Donald Bell that he would consider one that was limited to the first twenty four months of his employment. According to McGurn, Donald Bell replied that a twenty-four month termination clause would be acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Teague then drafted a second offer letter, in consultation with Donald Bell, which she signed and dated July 1, 1997. The letter included a termination clause stipulating that \"[i]f your status as an employee with Bell Microproducts is terminated within the first 12 months of employment for any reason other than gross misconduct, upon termination you will receive a six-month severance package.\" In response, McGurn drafted his own proposed offer letter, dated July 2, 1997, which included a paragraph on termination \"for cause,\" defined as conviction of a felony or gross negligence or misconduct on the job, and a paragraph on termination \"without cause,\" which was open-ended:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Company may terminate your employment without cause.

The letter included the following paragraph on termination without cause (we have underlined the material change from McGurn's July 2 proposal):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Company may terminate your employment without cause.

In addition, he crossed out the word \"twelve\" in the termination clause, inserted \"twenty four\" directly above it, and initialed the change. The alteration was in the center of the second page of the two-page letter, five inches above McGurn's signature. McGurn returned the letter to Teague (or possibly to Murphy), and started work on July 8, 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn advised no one at Bell that he had modified the July 3 offer letter, and Teague, Murphy, and Donald Bell all deny having viewed the letter upon its return. The Human Resources Department did receive the letter, but Teague testified that she herself would only have been notified if the letter had <i>not</i> been received, as McGurn could not have been paid unless a countersigned copy of the offer letter was in Bell's files. Although there is no direct evidence that anyone in the Human Resources Department examined the returned letter, there was evidence that it was Bell's practice to check that returned offer letters had been signed by the employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or around April of 1998, Brian Clark (Murphy's successor at Bell) concluded that McGurn's performance was not satisfactory. At some point after Clark made this determination, but before he fired McGurn on August 3, 1998, Murphy discovered McGurn's alteration of the offer letter, and discussed it with Teague and Donald Bell. Upon learning of his termination on August 3, 1998, after approximately 13 months at Bell, McGurn conveyed to Clark his belief that his contract included a two-year termination clause. Clark disagreed, and Bell refused to pay the amounts specified in the termination clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGurn sued Bell for breach of contract in the Superior Court of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Based on diversity of citizenship, Bell removed the case to federal district court. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(1). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In a Memorandum and Order dated February 15, 2001, the district court granted McGurn's motion and denied Bell's motion. The district court found that McGurn's alteration of the July 3 offer letter constituted a counteroffer which, in the circumstances of this case, Bell had accepted by its silence. The court entered judgment for McGurn in the amount of $120,000 plus interest, and Bell filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that McGurn's alteration of Bell's offer letter constituted a rejection of that offer and created a counteroffer. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 59 (1981) (\"A reply to an offer which purports to accept it but is conditional on the offeror's assent to terms additional to or different from those offered is not an acceptance but is a counter-offer.\"). What is in dispute is whether Bell accepted McGurn's counteroffer. The district court concluded that it did because Bell should have known about the change made by McGurn, and hence its silence constituted an acceptance of McGurn's counteroffer:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although no one on behalf of the defendant signed McGurn's counteroffer, the defendant admits it received the offer and accepted McGurn's services for thirteen months. A presumably sophisticated employer who receives a signed letter of engagement from a prospective employee and fails to read the letter, particularly after weeks of negotiation, does so at its own peril. Thus, in the circumstances of this case, the defendant's failure to read the terms of the offer [does] not preclude the formation of a contract. The defendant accepted the terms of the plaintiff's offer when it decided to and did employ the plaintiff for thirteen months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Urging a different theory than the \"should have known\" theory adopted by the district court, McGurn argues that Bell's silence in the face of his counteroffer amounted to an acceptance because Bell knew that McGurn had amended the termination clause, but gave no indication that it rejected the change. Bell denies that it knew about McGurn's alteration of the offer letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, silence in response to an offer to enter into a contract does not constitute an acceptance of the offer. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 69 cmt. a (\"Acceptance by silence is exceptional.\"); <i>Polaroid Corp. v.

The District Court's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Bell's assertion that it did not notice McGurn's alteration of the offer letter until just before his termination, the district court observed that \"absent fraud, a party to a contract is bound by the terms of the contract whether or not he read them.\" The court added: \"It will not do for a man to enter into a contract, and, when called upon to respond to its obligations, to say that he did not read it when he signed it, or did not know what it contained.\" The district court's legal proposition is sound, but inapposite to this case. The disputed term was added to the offer <i>after Bell had signed it.</i> The relevant question is why, as a matter of law, Bell should be expected to <i>re-read</i> an offer it had written and signed, upon its return with McGurn's countersignature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to that question, the district court declared that \"[a] presumably sophisticated employer who receives a signed letter of engagement from a prospective employee and fails to read the letter, particularly after weeks of negotiation, does so at its own peril.\" Although the logic of this generalization has some appeal, its generality is an insurmountable problem. Unless the record establishes that Bell knew or had reason to know that McGurn had modified what Bell had written &#8212; and the district court points to no facts in the record that would support such a conclusion &#8212; we cannot say that Bell's silence, as a matter of law, constituted an acceptance of McGurn's counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we decline to endorse the district court's generalization, \"we may affirm [a summary judgment] order on any ground revealed by the record.\" <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.

We therefore examine the record to see if, drawing all reasonable inferences in Bell's favor, the evidence nevertheless compels the conclusion that responsible officials at Bell knew or should have known about McGurn's counteroffer far enough in advance of his termination that Bell had a reasonable opportunity to reject the 24-month termination clause if it wished to avoid being bound. Summary judgment for McGurn would be proper if Bell had actual or constructive knowledge of McGurn's counteroffer at the time he returned the offer letter, or if, when Clark discovered the counteroffer, he had a \"reasonable opportunity to reject\" it before he fired McGurn, but instead continued to \"take[ ] the benefit of [McGurn's] services\" without speaking up. <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 69(1)(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three possible grounds for affirmance suggested by the record, two involving alleged actual knowledge and one involving constructive knowledge.

Although McGurn advances no direct evidence that anyone at Bell noticed his revision of the termination clause, he points out that the alteration was made on the same page that bore his signature, which Bell acknowledges an unknown employee checked pursuant to company policy. McGurn infers from this that the unknown employee \"had to have seen the change\" in the duration of the termination clause, because \"one's eyes are immediately drawn to the change made by McGurn and his initials above that change.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an inference that Bell \"had to have seen the change\" would be permissible based on the evidence in the record &#8212; the alteration was in the center of the very page McGurn had signed &#8212; we cannot say that a factfinder would be required to conclude that the Bell employee who checked for McGurn's signature must have noticed McGurn's alteration of the termination clause half-way up the page. That is, the evidence that a Bell employee must have seen McGurn's alteration is not \"so one-sided that [McGurn] must prevail as a matter of law.\" <i>Anderson v.

Bell points out, however, that Clark \"could have discovered the altered document as late as the day before\" he fired McGurn. Whatever the merits of McGurn's legal argument on this point &#8212; a matter as to which we take no view &#8212; this factual uncertainty precludes summary judgment for McGurn based on Clark's actual knowledge of McGurn's counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Teague's Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also examine the record for evidence that Teague (Bell's Director of Human Resources), or an employee in her department acting on her behalf, should have determined if the returned offer letter had been modified. Teague had participated in the negotiations with McGurn. She stated at her deposition that \"Bill Murphy and I worked together on all of these offer letters,\" and Donald Bell testified that he \"consult[ed] with Linda [Teague]\" during the drafting of the letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The July 3 offer letter from Bell to McGurn was signed by Teague, and indicated that McGurn should return the countersigned copy <i>to her.</i> Under these circumstances, a jury might conclude that McGurn could reasonably have expected Teague (or Murphy) to inspect the document upon its return. Moreover, the offer set out in Bell's letter was not a mere reduction to writing of a previous oral agreement; it was a step in a negotiation which Bell had no reason to assume had been concluded. Although Teague requested that McGurn simply sign and return the letter unamended, the evidence supports the inference that she had no basis for assuming he would do so. Instead, she should have checked the document to ensure that he had not made further changes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although an inference that Teague should have examined the returned offer letter with greater care would be permissible based on the evidence in the record, the evidence, again, does not compel such an inference. Bell disputes the notion that Teague (or her subordinates) had any reason to check the returned offer letter for unauthorized modifications, and a factfinder might conclude that Teague had no reason to inspect the letter absent any indication from McGurn that he had revised a material term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that \"[o]rdinarily the question of whether a contract has been made ... is for the jury,\" <i>Ismert &amp; Assocs., Inc. v.

Brian Clark[] had determined that McGurn's performance was not satisfactory.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The actual discussions (in person and via telephone) between Bell and McGurn were conducted by Bill Murphy and Donald Bell, not by Teague</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Because the July 3 offer letter was signed by Teague, and McGurn returned it to Teague (or Bill Murphy), we need not be detained by Bell's argument that the low-level employee who examined the returned letter lacked the authority to bind the corporation (with his silence) on the question of McGurn's termination clause. Teague having requested that McGurn return the letter<i>to her,</i> it would be no defense for her to say that a subordinate in her office who lacked the authority to bind the corporation opened the letter and failed to show it to her. <i>See Gateway,</i> 297 F.2d at 486 &amp; n. 4 (holding corporation responsible for contents of letter addressed to its president but read by a secretary). To accept Bell's argument on this point would be to penalize McGurn for Teague's failure to read her own mail. The same logic applies if McGurn returned the letter to Murphy, as he suggested he might have done.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge (dubitante).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I write separately because I doubt that the court's opinion reflects either the practicalities of the case at hand or the result that the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) would reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical facts are undisputed. McGurn's counteroffer &#8212; the letter containing his modification of the termination clause &#8212; was received at Bell's headquarters in the ordinary course and routed by it to its human resources department. That letter formed the basis for the company's treatment of McGurn as an employee and remained part of the corporate personnel records for the duration of his employment. Given these facts, the case turns on whether Bell should be said to have accepted McGurn's counteroffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While no official of the company ever said \"I accept\" in so many words, acceptance can occur by silence under certain circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Ismert &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. New Engl. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476639\"><a href=\"/opinion/476639/ismert-and-associates-inc-v-new-england-mutual-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 541-42 (1st Cir.1986); <i>Polaroid Corp. v.

One such set of circumstances, pertinent here, is when an offeree fails to reply to an offer yet takes the benefit of the offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were tendered in the expectation of a particular consideration. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 69(1). In such a situation, it would be manifestly unjust for an offeree to reap the benefit of the services without letting the offeror know that it had no intention of paying the remuneration that the offeror expected to receive. <i>Id.,</i> cmt. b. Thus, fundamental fairness permits silence to operate as an acceptance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This principle is part of the warp and woof of Massachusetts contract law. <i>See Polaroid,</i> 624 N.E.2d at 964; <i>Bump v. Robbins,</i> 24 Mass.App.Ct. 296, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2079141\"><a href=\"/opinion/2079141/bump-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1987). On the facts of record here, I think it likely that the SJC would find, as did the able district judge, that Bell implicitly assented to (and, therefore, should be bound by) the terms of McGurn's counteroffer. After all, Bell unreservedly accepted McGurn's services, having reason to know <i>from its own files</i> that those services were being rendered with an expectation that the terms of the counteroffer (including the amended termination clause) would be fulfilled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Bell tells us that, even though it employed McGurn for thirteen months <i>pursuant to the letter that set out the terms of his counteroffer,</i> no one in its employ noticed the modification. But there is no hint here of chicanery on McGurn's part, and I doubt that ignorance induced by a party's own negligence or lassitude is a basis for escaping from contractual obligations. To the contrary, the acceptance of offered services, under circumstances in which the beneficiary of those services ought to have known that the provider expected to be compensated for them in a certain way, is the functional equivalent of express assent. <i>See Bump,</i> 509 N.E.2d at 18-19. This case seems to fit within the contours of that rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, I believe that a party should not be able to insulate itself from ex contractu liability by professing that it neglected to read the very document essential for the formation of the contract, especially when that document has reposed in its own files at all relevant times. Were the law otherwise and the majority's view taken to its logical extreme, an offeree could completely redefine its responsibilities by the simple expedient of claiming that it was not aware of what its own records plainly showed. I doubt that the SJC would countenance so counterintuitive a result. <i>Cf. Upton v. Tribilcock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89145\"><a href=\"/opinion/89145/upton-v-tribilcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89145\"><a href=\"/opinion/89145/upton-v-tribilcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (1875) (observing that \"[i]t will not do for a man to enter into a contract, and, when called upon to respond to its obligations, to say that he did not ... know what it contained. If this were permitted, contracts would not be worth the paper on which they are written\"). Given this doubt, I respectfully decline to join the court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Suppose the shoe was on the other foot, and McGurn's counteroffer had included not only an expanded termination clause but also a covenant not to compete. Only an innocent would assume that Bell would refrain from attempting to enforce the covenant against McGurn. To my mind, this example illustrates that the majority's resolution of the case lets Bell have its cake and eat it too. I have no stomach for so one-sided a result &#8212; and I doubt that the SJC would find it appetizing</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
