John J.  Sullivan appeals pro se  from the\r                                                               \r\n\ndenial of his  petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  For the\r\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.1\r                                         1\r\n\n     A New Hampshire state jury  found Sullivan guilty of the\r\n\nsecond  degree murder of Lynne Rousseau  and the first degree\r\n\nmurder of Harry  Pike.  Sullivan's conviction was affirmed on\r\n\ndirect appeal to  the New Hampshire Supreme Court.   State v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSullivan, 551  A.2d 519  (N.H. 1988).   On January  13, 1995,\r                    \r\n\nSullivan sought federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2254.  The habeas petition was referred to a magistrate judge\r\n\nwho recommended that  it be  denied.   On July  7, 1995,  the\r\n\ndistrict judge approved the recommendation of the magistrate.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\n     Sullivan argues  that the  evidence was  insufficient to\r\n\nprove the elements of premeditation and deliberation required\r\n\nfor a conviction of first  degree murder under New  Hampshire\r\n\nstate law.  We disagree.  Since the state  court reviewed the\r\n\nevidence of premeditation in  some detail and we  fully agree\r\n\nwith its  analysis of  the sufficiency of  this evidence,  we\r\n\nneed add only the following comments.  Contrary to Sullivan's\r\n\ncontention,   the  jury  was   not  bound  by   his  expert's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1While  this case  was pending  on  appeal, the  President\r               1\r\nsigned into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\r\nAct  of 1996,  Pub. L.  104-132,  110 Stat.  1214 (April  24,\r\n1996).  Although neither party  has raised the issue, we note\r\nthat we  need not  decide in  this  case whether  any of  the\r\namendments  in the  Act apply  since it  would not  alter our\r\ndisposition.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n\"uncontradicted\"  testimony that  Sullivan's intoxication  on\r\n\nthe night of the killings rendered him unable to premeditate.\r\n\nSee  State v.  Rullo,  412  A.2d  1009, 1011-12  (N.H.  1980)\r                                \r\n\n(observing that the trier of fact may reject expert testimony\r\n\neven when  the opposing party  has presented none).   This is\r\n\nparticularly  so  in   light  of  countervailing   evidence--\r\n\nincluding testimony regarding  Sullivan's ability immediately\r\n\nbefore and  after the killings to understand questions and to\r\n\nexpress himself--from  which the  trier of  fact could  infer\r\n\nthat he  was  capable  of  premeditating.    See  Jackson  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979) (stating that the relevant\r                    \r\n\nquestion is whether, after viewing the evidence in the  light\r\n\nmost favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact\r\n\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\r\n\nreasonable doubt).    We  add that  we  reject  as  meritless\r\n\nSullivan's claim that the jury  instructions on premeditation\r\n\nand burden  of proof were confusing, much less any suggestion\r\n\nthat these instructions were  violative of due process.   The\r\n\ninstructions  adequately  explained  the  difference  between\r\n\n\"premeditation\"  and  \"knowingly\"  and, as  a  whole, clearly\r\n\nconveyed to the jury that  the prosecution bore the burden of\r\n\nproving the elements of the  crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n     Sullivan also  contends that  the prosecutor  improperly\r\n\ncross-examined  him concerning  a propensity  toward violence\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nand  a  general   dislike  of  women,  that   the  prosecutor\r\n\nmisrepresented  evidence  in  his  closing,   and  that  this\r\n\n\"misconduct\" by  the prosecutor  requires  a new  trial.   On\r\n\nhabeas,   we  review   state   court  proceedings   only  for\r\n\nconstitutional error.  See, e.g., Amirault v. Fair,  968 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n1404, 1406 (1st Cir.) (explaining  that to prevail on a claim\r\n\nof prosecutorial  misconduct, a  habeas petitioner  must show\r\n\nthat  the prosecutor's conduct  \"'so infected the  trial with\r\n\nunfairness as to  make the resulting  conviction a denial  of\r\n\ndue  process'\" (quoting Donnelly  v. DeChristoforo,  416 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n637, 643 (1974))), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1000 (1992); Puleio\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197,  1204 (1st Cir. 1987) (observing that\r                   \r\n\nhabeas  review  does  not ordinarily  extend  to  state court\r\n\nrulings  on the admissibility of evidence), cert. denied, 485\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  990 (1988).   In  the instant  case, the  New Hampshire\r\n\nSupreme Court found  the challenged character evidence  to be\r\n\nadmissible under state law, and we do not think the admission\r\n\nof the evidence--or the prosecutor's conduct in eliciting it-\r\n\n-violated  due process.  Similarly, having reviewed the trial\r\n\ntranscript, we reject as meritless Sullivan's suggestion that\r\n\nthe   prosecutor's   closing  remarks   rendered   his  trial\r\n\nfundamentally  unfair,  especially  given the  trial  court's\r\n\nrepeated  instructions that the  jurors should rely  on their\r\n\nown memory of the evidence.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     Last,  since Sullivan  did not  raise  the issue  in his\r\n\nhabeas petition, we  decline to address his  argument that he\r\n\nis entitled  to some form of relief  because the State--which\r\n\nprovided Sullivan's counsel  on direct appeal with  a copy of\r\n\nthe  trial  transcripts--failed to  provide  Sullivan with  a\r\n\npersonal  copy  of  these  transcripts.    See  Cacoperdo  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nDemosthenes,  37 F.3d 504,  507 (9th Cir.  1994) (grounds not\r                       \r\n\nraised  in habeas  petition are  not  cognizable on  appeal),\r\n\ncert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1378 (1995).  We note, however, that\r                        \r\n\nSullivan has  had the  benefit of these  transcripts in  this\r\n\nappeal, and that  we have carefully considered  all citations\r\n\nto the record.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

(explaining that to prevail on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, a habeas petitioner must show that the prosecutor's conduct \" 'so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process' \" (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109024\"><a href=\"/opinion/109024/donnelly-v-dechristoforo/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 643 (1974))), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span> (1992);  Puleio v. Vose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495428\"><a href=\"/opinion/495428/joseph-a-puleio-v-george-a-vose-jr-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1204 (1st Cir.1987) (observing that habeas review does not ordinarily extend to state court rulings on the admissibility of evidence), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></span> (1988).   In the instant case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found the challenged character evidence to be admissible under state law, and we do not think the admission of the evidence--or the prosecutor's conduct in eliciting it--violated due process.   Similarly, having reviewed the trial transcript, we reject as meritless Sullivan's suggestion that the prosecutor's closing remarks rendered his trial fundamentally unfair, especially given the trial court's repeated instructions that the jurors should rely on their own memory of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last, since Sullivan did not raise the issue in his habeas petition, we decline to address his argument that he is entitled to some form of relief because the State--which provided Sullivan's counsel on direct appeal with a copy of the trial transcripts--failed to provide Sullivan with a personal copy of these transcripts.  See Cacoperdo v. Demosthenes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679609\"><a href=\"/opinion/679609/dominick-cacoperdo-v-peter-demosthenes-the-attorney-general-of-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 507 (9th Cir.1994) (grounds not raised in habeas petition are not cognizable on appeal), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></span> (1995).   We note, however, that Sullivan has had the benefit of these transcripts in this appeal, and that we have carefully considered all citations to the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While this case was pending on appeal, the President signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (April 24, 1996).   Although neither party has raised the issue, we note that we need not decide in this case whether any of the amendments in the Act apply since it would not alter our disposition</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
