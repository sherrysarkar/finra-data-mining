Henry appeals from the district  court's grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment for the defendants.

See  Woods v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFriction Materials, Inc.,  30 F.3d 255, 259 (1st  Cir. 1994).\r                                    \r\n\nIn  this  case,  however,  the  summary  judgment  record  is\r\n\nparticularly unhelpful  to Henry  because the  district court\r\n\nruled  that he failed to comply with the local rule requiring\r\n\nthe  party opposing  summary  judgment to  provide a  concise\r\n\nstatement  of the  material  facts as  to  which there  is  a\r\n\ngenuine issue to  be tried.  See D.  Mass. L. R. 56.1.   As a\r                                            \r\n\nconsequence  of  that non-compliance,  the  court deemed  the\r\n\nmoving  defendants'  statement  of  undisputed  facts  to  be\r\n\nadmitted by Henry, as the local rule provides.  See id.  \r                                                                   \r\n\n          On appeal,  Henry states in  his brief that  he did\r\n\ncomply  with the  local  rule, and  he  points out  that  his\r\n\nmemorandum  opposing  summary  judgment  included  a  lengthy\r\n\nfactual  statement with  record  citations.   Henry does  not\r\n\nexplain, however, how his factual statement complies with the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nrequirement of a concise  statement of the material  facts as\r                                                               \r\n\nto which  there is a genuine issue.  See id.  Henry's factual\r                                                        \r\n\nstatement was  a general and  complete background  statement,\r\n\nspanning seven pages, providing relevant facts whether or not\r\n\nthey were  disputed or  material to the  outcome.  We  see no\r\n\nerror in the district court's application of the  local rule,\r\n\ntherefore we, like the district court, treat the facts as set\r\n\nforth in the defendant's statement as admitted by Henry.\r\n\n          In   1986,   Henry   purchased   several   business\r\n\ncondominium units  in Andover, Massachusetts.1   In 1989, for\r\n\npurposes  of  refinancing   the  property,  Henry   hired  an\r\n\nenvironmental   consultant  to   inspect  the   property  for\r\n\ncontamination.    The  inspection  revealed  high  levels  of\r\n\nvolatile organic compounds (\"VOCs\") in the groundwater.\r\n\n          Prior  to  Henry's  purchase  of  the  property,  a\r\n\nlaundry and dry  cleaning facility had  operated on the  site\r\n\nfrom   about    1960   until   1981,    utilizing   a    VOC,\r\n\nperchloroethylene (\"PCE\"),  as a dry cleaning  solvent.  Upon\r\n\ndeposition, the former owner of the laundry conceded that PCE\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In 1981, Cash Energy, Inc., a corporation owned by Henry,\r\npurchased the property and in 1986 converted it into business\r\ncondominium  units,  transferring   several  units  to  Henry\r\npersonally and to  others.   Cash Energy, Inc.,  and all  the\r\nother plaintiffs (except  Henry individually) were  defaulted\r\nfrom  this  action  in November  1991.    The  record is  not\r\ncompletely  clear as  to  what actions  were  taken by  Henry\r\npersonally, as opposed to his corporation or others, but that\r\nis  irrelevant  to  the  disposition  of  this  appeal.   For\r\nsimplicity,  we will  recite the  facts as  if Henry  was the\r\nactor unless more specificity is required.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nsometimes spilled on the  ground during the monthly refilling\r\n\nof the PCE storage tank.\r\n\n          Adjacent to  Henry's property, the  defendants2 own\r\n\na commercial property on which a solvent reclamation business\r\n\nhas   operated  since  1969,   handling  industrial  solvents\r\n\ncontaining VOCs.   That property, too,  was contaminated with\r\n\nVOCs, necessitating an ongoing environmental remediation.  It\r\n\nis likely that solvents from the defendants' property entered\r\n\nthe groundwater  on Henry's property, accounting  for some of\r\n\nthe VOCs detected in the groundwater.\r\n\n          Henry filed the instant lawsuit in 1990, bringing a\r\n\nmyriad  of  claims   under  the  Comprehensive  Environmental\r\n\nResponse,  Compensation, and  Liability  Act  (\"CERCLA\"),  42\r\n\nU.S.C.     9601-9675,  the  Massachusetts  Oil and  Hazardous\r\n\nMaterial Release  Prevention and Response Act,  Mass. Gen. L.\r\n\nch.  21E, and Massachusetts  common law  (nuisance, trespass,\r\n\nnegligence, etc.).       The   litigation  did   not  proceed\r\n\nsmoothly.    A   description  of  Henry's   missteps,  missed\r\n\ndeadlines,  and  failures  to comply  with  scheduling orders\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  district court,  in  the order  that Henry  appeals,\r\ngranted summary judgement to the following defendants: Melvin\r\nL. Weiner (as Trustee of  Weiner Real Estate Trust);  Service\r\nChemical Corp.;  North  East  Solvents  Services,  Inc.;  and\r\nLaidlaw  Environmental Services,  Inc.  (formerly North  East\r\nSolvents  Reclamation  Corp.).    The roles  of  the  various\r\ndefendants are not germane to the disposition of this appeal,\r\nand we shall  refer to them  simply as \"the  defendants.\"   A\r\nnumber  of  other defendants  were  dismissed  from the  case\r\nearlier, and are not parties to this appeal.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nwould fill several pages;  suffice it to say that  the record\r\n\nsuggests a pattern of flagrant non-compliance with deadlines,\r\n\norders, and  rules.  On January  31, 1995, as a  sanction for\r\n\nHenry's  repeated  discovery violations,  the  district court\r\n\ngranted  the   defendants'  motion  to  preclude  Henry  from\r\n\npresenting  expert  testimony  on  damages.   Henry  has  not\r\n\nappealed that order.\r\n\n          The defendants moved for summary  judgment in March\r\n\n1995, arguing,  in  essence, that  without expert  testimony,\r\n\nHenry would be unable  to prove damages, a  necessary element\r\n\nof his prima  facie case under all his claims.   The district\r                               \r\n\ncourt granted  summary judgment  in favor of  the defendants,\r\n\nfinding  that,   in  light  of  the   preclusion  order,  the\r\n\naffidavits  with which  Henry  had  opposed summary  judgment\r\n\ncontained  no admissible  evidence  from which  a jury  could\r\n\nreasonably measure damages.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                           ANALYSIS\r                                       ANALYSIS\r                                               \r\n\n            On appeal, Henry argues that he can prove damages\r\n\nwithout expert testimony, and that therefore summary judgment\r\n\nwas improper.   Henry does  not argue that  he could  survive\r\n\nsummary judgment without  some proof  of damages,  apparently\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nconceding  that under all of  his causes of  action, he bears\r\n\nthe burden of proving that he suffered recoverable damages.3\r\n\n          We review a  grant of summary judgment  de novo, in\r                                                                     \r\n\naccordance with our usual  standard.  See Friction Materials,\r                                                                        \r\n\n30  F.3d at  259.   Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  56(c)\r\n\n\"mandates the entry of summary judgment,   . . . upon motion,\r\n\nagainst  a party who fails  to establish the  existence of an\r\n\nelement  essential to that  party's case,  and on  which that\r\n\nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"  Celotex Corp.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).\r                      \r\n\n          Misguidedly,  Henry  uses  much  of  his  brief  to\r\n\ndescribe the evidence  that he  would be able  to present  at\r\n\ntrial.  In reviewing summary judgment, however, the issue  is\r\n\nnot what  Henry might be able  to prove at trial,  but rather\r\n\nwhat Henry  has  put  into  the summary  judgment  record  in\r\n\ncompliance  with Fed. R. Civ. P. 56  and D. Mass. L. R. 56.1.\r\n\nUnder  Rule  56(e),  \"the  adverse  party  [i.e.,  the  party\r\n\nopposing  summary  judgment]  may  not  rest  upon  the  mere\r\n\nallegations or  denials of the adverse  party's pleading, but\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We  note  that  Henry   has  not  addressed  whether  his\r\ndeclaratory  judgment  count  should  have  survived  summary\r\njudgment even without proof of damages.  It appears, however,\r\nthat the declaratory judgment  that Henry sought pertained to\r\nthe defendant's  liability for damages under  CERCLA, so that\r\nproof of damages may have been critical here as well.  In any\r\nevent,  Henry has  waived the  issue.   See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\nZannino,  895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)

R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56(e).\r\n\n          Henry  has asserted  three applicable  theories for\r\n\nthe  measurement   of  his   damages,  but,   without  expert\r\n\ntestimony, he  has failed to demonstrate  a trialworthy issue\r\n\nof fact on any.   Each of Henry's  theories -- diminution  of\r\n\nhis property's market value, estimated remediation costs, and\r\n\nrecovery of response costs paid -- require a determination as\r\n\nto the extent of the harm,  if any, caused by the defendants.\r\n\nGiven the  facts on  the summary  judgment record  here, that\r\n\nrequirement calls for the segregation of damage caused by the\r\n\ndefendants from  damage generated  by the former  on-site dry\r\n\ncleaning  operation.5   It is  axiomatic that  the defendants\r\n\nare not liable for damages they did not cause. \r\n\n          The district court held the burden was  on Henry to\r\n\nisolate the harm caused  by the defendants.  On  appeal Henry\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  In  addition to  affidavits,  Rule 56  allows a  party to\r\nsupport   or   oppose   summary   judgment   with  pleadings,\r\ndepositions,  answers to  interrogatories, and  admissions on\r\nfile.   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(c).   Henry, in  opposing summary\r\njudgment,  cited only  to  two affidavits,  which we  discuss\r\ninfra.\r                 \r\n\n5.  The  district court  held that  the diminution  in market\r\nvalue  theory  also calls  for  segregation  of the  general,\r\nmarket-wide devaluation of commercial  properties in the area\r\nfrom  the effect on value of the contamination, but we do not\r\nrely on this in reaching our decision.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\ndoes no more than assert that he was not  required to isolate\r\n\nthe  harm, without  citing statutes or  case law.   It is the\r\n\nduty  of the appellant to show that error has been committed,\r\n\nand Henry has not done so.\r\n\n          Although the  allocation of  damages caused by  two\r\n\ndistinct  sources  of  groundwater pollution  would  seem  to\r\n\nrequire  expert  testimony, we  need  not  decide that  issue\r\n\nbecause  Henry has failed  to put  into the  summary judgment\r\n\nrecord  any admissible  evidence that  would allow a  jury to\r\n\nallocate  the damages.    Henry supported  his opposition  to\r\n\nsummary  judgment with his own affidavit and the affidavit of\r\n\nStephen  L. Kurz,  an  environmental consultant.6   Only  one\r\n\nstatement  in   these  affidavits  addresses  the   issue  of\r\n\nsegregating   the  contamination   that  emanated   from  the\r\n\ndefendants'  adjacent property  from contamination  caused by\r\n\nthe  on-site dry cleaning establishment.   Henry avers in his\r\n\nown affidavit that another consultant, ENPRO Services,  Inc.,\r\n\n\"concluded that  the source of the  solvent contamination was\r\n\nthe [defendants']  property and  that [Henry's] property  was\r\n\nnot  a source of  the contamination.\"   While that conclusion\r\n\nseems  improbable, credibility  is  not at  issue on  summary\r\n\njudgment.  But Henry's statement about ENPRO's conclusions is\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Henry  also  made  a  single  citation  to  a  deposition\r\nsubmitted with  the defendants' motion  for summary judgment,\r\nas to a fact not relevant to the allocation of damages issue.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ninadmissible  hearsay,  and cannot  be considered  on summary\r\n\njudgment.7  See Garside v.

But Kurz does  not\r\n\naddress in any way the issue of  isolating the harm caused by\r\n\nthe  defendants'  activities  from  that  caused  by  Henry's\r\n\npredecessor,  the dry  cleaner.

Henry brought an action seeking damages from an adjacent property owner for groundwater contamination to Henry's commercial property.   Henry appeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment for the defendants.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first summarize the relevant facts as they appear on the summary judgment record, viewing them in the light most favorable to the non-movant Henry.  See Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 259 (1st Cir.1994).   In this case, however, the summary judgment record is particularly unhelpful to Henry because the district court ruled that he failed to comply with the local rule requiring the party opposing summary judgment to provide a concise statement of the material facts as to which there is a genuine issue to be tried.   See D.Mass.L.R. 56.1.   As a consequence of that non-compliance, the court deemed the moving defendants' statement of undisputed facts to be admitted by Henry, as the local rule provides.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Henry states in his brief that he did comply with the local rule, and he points out that his memorandum opposing summary judgment included a lengthy factual statement with record citations.   Henry does not explain, however, how his factual statement complies with the requirement of a concise statement of the material facts as to which there is a genuine issue.   See id.   Henry's factual statement was a general and complete background statement, spanning seven pages, providing relevant facts whether or not they were disputed or material to the outcome.   We see no error in the district court's application of the local rule, therefore we, like the district court, treat the facts as set forth in the defendant's statement as admitted by Henry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, Henry purchased several business condominium units in Andover, Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In 1989, for purposes of refinancing the property, Henry hired an environmental consultant to inspect the property for contamination.   The inspection revealed high levels of volatile organic compounds (\"VOCs\") in the groundwater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Henry's purchase of the property, a laundry and dry cleaning facility had operated on the site from about 1960 until 1981, utilizing a VOC, perchloroethylene (\"PCE\"), as a dry cleaning solvent.   Upon deposition, the former owner of the laundry conceded that PCE sometimes spilled on the ground during the monthly refilling of the PCE storage tank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adjacent to Henry's property, the defendants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> own a commercial property on which a solvent reclamation business has operated since 1969, handling industrial solvents containing VOCs.  That property, too, was contaminated with VOCs, necessitating an ongoing environmental remediation.   It is likely that solvents from the defendants' property entered the groundwater on Henry's property, accounting for some of the VOCs detected in the groundwater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry filed the instant lawsuit in 1990, bringing a myriad of claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 9601-9675, the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch.   21E, and Massachusetts common law (nuisance, trespass, negligence, etc.).   The litigation did not proceed smoothly.   A description of Henry's missteps, missed deadlines, and failures to comply with scheduling orders would fill several pages;  suffice it to say that the record suggests a pattern of flagrant non-compliance with deadlines, orders, and rules.   On January 31, 1995, as a sanction for Henry's repeated discovery violations, the district court granted the defendants' motion to preclude Henry from presenting expert testimony on damages.   Henry has not appealed that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment in March 1995, arguing, in essence, that without expert testimony, Henry would be unable to prove damages, a necessary element of his prima facie case under all his claims.   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding that, in light of the preclusion order, the affidavits with which Henry had opposed summary judgment contained no admissible evidence from which a jury could reasonably measure damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Henry argues that he can prove damages without expert testimony, and that therefore summary judgment was improper.   Henry does not argue that he could survive summary judgment without some proof of damages, apparently conceding that under all of his causes of action, he bears the burden of proving that he suffered recoverable damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, in accordance with our usual standard.  See Friction Materials, 30 F.3d at 259.   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) \"mandates the entry of summary judgment, ... upon motion, against a party who fails to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Misguidedly, Henry uses much of his brief to describe the evidence that he would be able to present at trial.   In reviewing summary judgment, however, the issue is not what Henry might be able to prove at trial, but rather what Henry has put into the summary judgment record in compliance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 and D.Mass.L.R. 56.1.   Under Rule 56(e), \"the adverse party [i.e., the party opposing summary judgment] may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry has asserted three applicable theories for the measurement of his damages, but, without expert testimony, he has failed to demonstrate a trialworthy issue of fact on any.   Each of Henry's theories--diminution of his property's market value, estimated remediation costs, and recovery of response costs paid--require a determination as to the extent of the harm, if any, caused by the defendants.   Given the facts on the summary judgment record here, that requirement calls for the segregation of damage caused by the defendants from damage generated by the former on-site dry cleaning operation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  It is axiomatic that the defendants are not liable for damages they did not cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held the burden was on Henry to isolate the harm caused by the defendants.   On appeal Henry does no more than assert that he was not required to isolate the harm, without citing statutes or case law.   It is the duty of the appellant to show that error has been committed, and Henry has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the allocation of damages caused by two distinct sources of groundwater pollution would seem to require expert testimony, we need not decide that issue because Henry has failed to put into the summary judgment record any admissible evidence that would allow a jury to allocate the damages.   Henry supported his opposition to summary judgment with his own affidavit and the affidavit of Stephen L. Kurz, an environmental consultant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Only one statement in these affidavits addresses the issue of segregating the contamination that emanated from the defendants' adjacent property from contamination caused by the on-site dry cleaning establishment.   Henry avers in his own affidavit that another consultant, ENPRO Services, Inc., \"concluded that the source of the solvent contamination was the [defendants'] property and that [Henry's] property was not a source of the contamination.\"   While that conclusion seems improbable, credibility is not at issue on summary judgment.   But Henry's statement about ENPRO's conclusions is inadmissible hearsay, and cannot be considered on summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1990).   Moreover, Henry's statement, without more, is too conclusory to satisfy the Rule 56(e) requirement that the non-movant \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  See Crawford v. LaMantia, 34 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1994) (\"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation\" insufficient to block summary judgment), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1393 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Environmental consultant Kurz, in the other affidavit submitted by Henry, opines that the remedial measures being implemented on defendants' site are inadequate to deal with the groundwater contamination, and estimates the cost of a remediation plan that properly addresses both Henry's and the defendants' properties.   But Kurz does not address in any way the issue of isolating the harm caused by the defendants' activities from that caused by Henry's predecessor, the dry cleaner.   In any event, if the Kurz Affidavit had addressed the segregation of off-site damages, it would violate the court's order precluding expert testimony on damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that absent a showing that the district court misconstrued the law, Henry failed to meet his burden on summary judgment to set forth specific facts, which if believed, would allow a jury to measure the damages caused by the defendants.  See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986).   Henry's failure to isolate the off-site harm from that caused by the dry cleaning operation that operated on site is fatal to all three damages measures:  diminution of property value, remediation costs, and response costs.   Accordingly, the district court's order granting summary judgment is affirmed.   Costs to the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 1981, Cash Energy, Inc., a corporation owned by Henry, purchased the property and in 1986 converted it into business condominium units, transferring several units to Henry personally and to others.   Cash Energy, Inc., and all the other plaintiffs (except Henry individually) were defaulted from this action in November 1991.   The record is not completely clear as to what actions were taken by Henry personally, as opposed to his corporation or others, but that is irrelevant to the disposition of this appeal.   For simplicity, we will recite the facts as if Henry was the actor unless more specificity is required</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court, in the order that Henry appeals, granted summary judgement to the following defendants:  Melvin L. Weiner (as Trustee of Weiner Real Estate Trust);  Service Chemical Corp.;   North East Solvents Services, Inc.;   and Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.  (formerly North East Solvents Reclamation Corp.).   The roles of the various defendants are not germane to the disposition of this appeal, and we shall refer to them simply as \"the defendants.\"   A number of other defendants were dismissed from the case earlier, and are not parties to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that Henry has not addressed whether his declaratory judgment count should have survived summary judgment even without proof of damages.   It appears, however, that the declaratory judgment that Henry sought pertained to the defendant's liability for damages under CERCLA, so that proof of damages may have been critical here as well.   In any event, Henry has waived the issue.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In addition to affidavits, Rule 56 allows a party to support or oppose summary judgment with pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file.

Henry does not argue that he could survive summary judgment without some proof of damages, apparently conceding that under all of his causes of action, he bears the burden of proving that he suffered recoverable damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, in accordance with our usual standard.  See Friction Materials, 30 F.3d at 259.   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) \"mandates the entry of summary judgment, ... upon motion, against a party who fails to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 322 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Misguidedly, Henry uses much of his brief to describe the evidence that he would be able to present at trial.   In reviewing summary judgment, however, the issue is not what Henry might be able to prove at trial, but rather what Henry has put into the summary judgment record in compliance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 and D.Mass.L.R. 56.1.   Under Rule 56(e), \"the adverse party [i.e., the party opposing summary judgment] may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry has asserted three applicable theories for the measurement of his damages, but, without expert testimony, he has failed to demonstrate a trialworthy issue of fact on any.   Each of Henry's theories--diminution of his property's market value, estimated remediation costs, and recovery of response costs paid--require a determination as to the extent of the harm, if any, caused by the defendants.   Given the facts on the summary judgment record here, that requirement calls for the segregation of damage caused by the defendants from damage generated by the former on-site dry cleaning operation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  It is axiomatic that the defendants are not liable for damages they did not cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held the burden was on Henry to isolate the harm caused by the defendants.   On appeal Henry does no more than assert that he was not required to isolate the harm, without citing statutes or case law.   It is the duty of the appellant to show that error has been committed, and Henry has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the allocation of damages caused by two distinct sources of groundwater pollution would seem to require expert testimony, we need not decide that issue because Henry has failed to put into the summary judgment record any admissible evidence that would allow a jury to allocate the damages.   Henry supported his opposition to summary judgment with his own affidavit and the affidavit of Stephen L. Kurz, an environmental consultant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Only one statement in these affidavits addresses the issue of segregating the contamination that emanated from the defendants' adjacent property from contamination caused by the on-site dry cleaning establishment.   Henry avers in his own affidavit that another consultant, ENPRO Services, Inc., \"concluded that the source of the solvent contamination was the [defendants'] property and that [Henry's] property was not a source of the contamination.\"   While that conclusion seems improbable, credibility is not at issue on summary judgment.   But Henry's statement about ENPRO's conclusions is inadmissible hearsay, and cannot be considered on summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.1990).   Moreover, Henry's statement, without more, is too conclusory to satisfy the Rule 56(e) requirement that the non-movant \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  See Crawford v. LaMantia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195599\"><a href=\"/opinion/195599/crawford-v-lamantia/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1994) (\"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation\" insufficient to block summary judgment), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1393</span></span> (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Environmental consultant Kurz, in the other affidavit submitted by Henry, opines that the remedial measures being implemented on defendants' site are inadequate to deal with the groundwater contamination, and estimates the cost of a remediation plan that properly addresses both Henry's and the defendants' properties.   But Kurz does not address in any way the issue of isolating the harm caused by the defendants' activities from that caused by Henry's predecessor, the dry cleaner.   In any event, if the Kurz Affidavit had addressed the segregation of off-site damages, it would violate the court's order precluding expert testimony on damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that absent a showing that the district court misconstrued the law, Henry failed to meet his burden on summary judgment to set forth specific facts, which if believed, would allow a jury to measure the damages caused by the defendants.  See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 249 (1986).   Henry's failure to isolate the off-site harm from that caused by the dry cleaning operation that operated on site is fatal to all three damages measures:  diminution of property value, remediation costs, and response costs.   Accordingly, the district court's order granting summary judgment is affirmed.   Costs to the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In 1981, Cash Energy, Inc., a corporation owned by Henry, purchased the property and in 1986 converted it into business condominium units, transferring several units to Henry personally and to others.   Cash Energy, Inc., and all the other plaintiffs (except Henry individually) were defaulted from this action in November 1991.   The record is not completely clear as to what actions were taken by Henry personally, as opposed to his corporation or others, but that is irrelevant to the disposition of this appeal.   For simplicity, we will recite the facts as if Henry was the actor unless more specificity is required</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court, in the order that Henry appeals, granted summary judgement to the following defendants:  Melvin L. Weiner (as Trustee of Weiner Real Estate Trust);  Service Chemical Corp.;   North East Solvents Services, Inc.;   and Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.  (formerly North East Solvents Reclamation Corp.).   The roles of the various defendants are not germane to the disposition of this appeal, and we shall refer to them simply as \"the defendants.\"   A number of other defendants were dismissed from the case earlier, and are not parties to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that Henry has not addressed whether his declaratory judgment count should have survived summary judgment even without proof of damages.   It appears, however, that the declaratory judgment that Henry sought pertained to the defendant's liability for damages under CERCLA, so that proof of damages may have been critical here as well.   In any event, Henry has waived the issue.  See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.)
