Eladio  Camacho  appeals  from  his\r                                 \r\n\nsentence  on the sole ground that the district court erred in\r\n\ndenying him a two-level reduction for his \"minor\" role in the\r\n\noffense under  U.S.S.G.  3B1.2(b).   In a  Supplemental Order\r\n\ndated December 4, 1996, the district court found that Camacho\r\n\nwas  not  \"less  culpable   than  most  other  participants.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    3B1.2,   comment.   (n.3).     We   review   such\r\n\ndeterminations  only for  clear error.  See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 413 (1st Cir. 1995).  \"'Where more than\r                   \r\n\none reasonable inference may be drawn from  undisputed facts,\r\n\nthe court's choice from among supportable alternatives cannot\r\n\nbe clearly  erroneous.'\" United  States v. Rodriguez  Cortes,\r                                                                        \r\n\n949 F.2d 532, 546-47 (1st Cir. 1991) (citation omitted).\r\n\n     The  district court's  role-in-the-offense determination\r\n\nin this case was  not clearly erroneous.  \"[A]  defendant who\r\n\nis a drug courier is not entitled as of right  to a reduction\r\n\nof the  offense  level as  a minimal  or minor  participant.\"\r                                                          \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Lopez-Gil, 965  F.2d 1124, 1131  (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1992)  (emphasis added).   The  undisputed fact  that Camacho\r\n\nacted as a drug courier  does not entitle him to a  two-level\r\n\nreduction for minor participation  and the court's refusal to\r\n\ngrant a reduction was not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n     Camacho's sentence is affirmed. See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
