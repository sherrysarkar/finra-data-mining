This appeal presents the issue\n\nof whether an alien who was convicted of an aggravated felony\n\nafter the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and\n\nImmigrant      Responsibility    Act,     Pub.   L.   No.   104-208   (1996)\n\n(codified in scattered sections of 8 U.S.C.) (IIRIRA), may\n\nobtain habeas relief on the ground that the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) failed to exercise discretion when\n\nit initiated deportation proceedings against him.               The district\n\ncourt found this issue lurking in the penumbra of the case;\n\ndeemed   it    a   sufficient   basis    to   grant   relief   in   favor   of\n\npetitioner-appellee Edovidio R. Carranza; and therefore ordered\n\nfurther consideration of the petitioner's situation by the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA).           See Carranza v. INS, 89 F. Supp.\n\n2d 91, 95-97 (D. Mass. 2000) (Carranza I); see also Carranza v.\n\nINS, 111 F. Supp. 2d 60, 64 (D. Mass. 2000) (Carranza II)\n\n(denying Rule 59(e) motion).        We reverse.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n              The petitioner is a Guatemalan national who entered\n\nthis country over two decades ago.            He lived in Maine with his\n\ncommon-law wife and children, but worked in Boston.                 On March\n\n23, 1996, police officers in that city arrested him after he\n\nengaged in a violent dispute with his mistress.                On October 1,\n\n1997, the petitioner entered a guilty plea in state court to\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\freduced charges (assault with a dangerous weapon and unlawful\n\npossession     of      a       firearm).     The    court    imposed       a    three-year\n\nincarcerative sentence.\n\n             Roughly ten weeks later, the INS commenced deportation\n\nproceedings by issuing a notice to appear before an immigration\n\njudge (IJ).         The IJ held a removal hearing on March 5, 1998.\n\nThe petitioner appeared pro se.                    The hearing was not completed\n\non    that   date,     and       the   petitioner     filed       an    application     for\n\nsuspension of deportation, citing family and economic concerns.\n\nWhen the hearing resumed (June 2, 1998), the petitioner admitted\n\nto the assault conviction.                 He would not take responsibility for\n\nthe firearms conviction, however, adamantly asserting that the\n\nweapon was not his.\n\n             The IJ found that the INS had sustained its burden of\n\nshowing removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C); took\n\nthe    firearms      conviction         at   face    value;       and    held    that   the\n\npetitioner,       as       a    firearms     offender       who    had    committed      an\n\naggravated felony, see id. § 1101(a)(43)(F), was ineligible for\n\ncancellation of removal (the IIRIRA's equivalent of suspension\n\nof deportation).               The petitioner appealed, and the BIA upheld\n\nthe decision.\n\n             The petitioner essayed a court challenge to the BIA's\n\ndecision.     He filed papers in this court in which he effectively\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fconceded both his aggravated felon status and his ineligibility\n\nfor the cancellation of removal process established under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1229b.        Citing the bar to direct review contained in 8\n\nU.S.C.     §     1252(a)(2)(C),         we     determined     that     we    lacked\n\njurisdiction to scrutinize the BIA's decision.                  Carranza v. INS,\n\nNo. 99-1428 (1st Cir. May 3, 1999) (unpublished order).                     Withal,\n\nwe   noted      that   the     petitioner's       papers     could   be     read    as\n\nrequesting relief in the nature of habeas corpus and transferred\n\nthe matter to the district court for consideration of that\n\nclaim.     Id. at 1-2 (referencing 28 U.S.C. § 2241).\n\n               In the district court, the petitioner claimed that he\n\nhad not been properly advised of the consequences of pleading\n\nguilty to the firearms charge and asserted that he would have\n\ncontested that charge had he known the ramifications.                       To show\n\nthat he had a viable defense, he tendered a statement from his\n\nlandlord       maintaining      that    the      landlord    (rather      than     the\n\npetitioner) owned the gun.              He also proffered evidence of his\n\ngood character and his son's delicate medical condition.\n\n               The district court held a non-evidentiary hearing on\n\nJanuary    20,    2000.        The   petitioner      again    appeared      pro    se.\n\nAlthough the petitioner had not raised the question, the court\n\nexpressed       concern   as    to     whether    the   Attorney     General       had\n\nexercised       discretion     before    initiating        removal   proceedings.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fCounsel for the INS stubbornly refused to address this concern,\n\nbut, rather, (1) questioned the district court's jurisdiction to\n\nhear the matter, and (2) asserted that when an alien had been\n\nconvicted of an aggravated felony, the IIRIRA left the Attorney\n\nGeneral no choice but to proceed with deportation.\n\n           On February 29, 2000, the district court issued an\n\nopinion in which it rejected the INS's contention that the court\n\nlacked habeas jurisdiction.      Carranza I, 89 F. Supp. 2d at 94-\n\n95.   The court then concluded that \"[a]lthough this district\n\ncourt cannot review the decision that the INS reaches after\n\nexercising its discretion, this court can require that the INS\n\nexercise   discretion   rather   than   deciding   that   [it]   has   no\n\ndiscretion.\"   Id. at 95.    The court emphasized the very short\n\ntime that had elapsed between the petitioner's conviction and\n\nthe INS's issuance of the notice to appear — roughly ten weeks\n\n— and ruled that the INS had brought removal proceedings against\n\nthe petitioner without any antecedent exercise of discretion.\n\nId.   On that basis, the court remanded the case to the BIA \"for\n\na   discretionary   determination   of   the   propriety    of   having\n\ncommenced proceedings against Carranza,\" and appointed counsel\n\nfor him.   Id. at 97.   At the same time, the court dismissed the\n\npetitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim vis-à-vis\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe firearms conviction on the ground that the petitioner had\n\nfailed to exhaust available state remedies.1               Id. at 96.\n\n              The INS promptly moved to alter or amend the judgment.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).          It asserted that the district court\n\nhad misunderstood its position and argued that the decision to\n\ninstitute removal proceedings against the petitioner itself\n\nrepresented the required exercise of discretion.                 The district\n\ncourt      rejected    this    entreaty,      stating    that   the    INS    had\n\n\"conflat[ed] an act of discretion with an act (unmodified).\"\n\nCarranza II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 63.             The court concluded:\n\n                     Available evidence strongly supports\n              the inference . . . that employees of the\n              INS do not recognize the scope of their\n              discretionary power in assessing the merits\n              of individual cases before proceeding, and\n              during proceedings, and that in the case of\n              [petitioner]    they   did    not   make   a\n              discretionary   determination   as   to  the\n              propriety of instituting proceedings against\n              him.\n\nId. at 64.      This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.     ANALYSIS\n\n              We think it useful to begin by attempting to distill\n\nsome       semblance   of     clarity   from    the     Byzantine     realm    of\n\nimmigration law.        We then mull the particulars of the case at\n\nhand.\n\n\n       1\n     The petitioner has not appealed from this portion of the\ndistrict court's ukase.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                                  A.    Historical Overview.\n\n                 The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, ch. 2, §\n\n212,       66    Stat.      187    (1952)    (repealed      1996)    (INA),   gave    the\n\nAttorney General discretion to permit aliens lawfully admitted\n\nfor permanent residence to return after a temporary absence.2\n\nThis seemingly innocuous provision was later interpreted to\n\npermit the Attorney General, as a matter of discretion, to waive\n\ndeportation           for    removable      aliens    already   within    the     United\n\nStates.          Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 281 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nSuch waivers came to be known as \"212(c) waivers\" or \"212(c)\n\nrelief.\"\n\n                 In United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347\n\nU.S. 260 (1954), the Supreme Court encountered a claim based on\n\na substantively similar provision embodied in an earlier version\n\nof   the        immigration        laws.     There,    an    alien    filed   a   habeas\n\npetition         in    which       he    charged     the    Attorney    General      with\n\nimproperly influencing the BIA and thus precluding meaningful\n\nreview of his application for 212(c) relief.                           Id. at 263-65.\n\nThe Court found this claim colorable under the district court's\n\nhabeas jurisdiction, reasoning that the regulations granted the\n\n\n\n       2\n     The Attorney General's discretion in this field has from\ntime to time been delegated to the BIA and/or the INS.       See\nUnited States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 265-\n66 & n.6 (1954) (discussing this phenomenon).\n\n                                              -8-\n\fBIA discretion in passing upon applications for equitable relief\n\nfrom deportation, and that the BIA's failure to exercise this\n\ndiscretion was actionable.         Id. at 268.    The Court concluded:\n\n                  If   petitioner    can   prove    the\n           allegation, he should receive a new hearing\n           before the Board without the burden of\n           previous proscription by the [Attorney\n           General's bias].   . . .   [I]n arriving at\n           its decision [the Board must] exercise its\n           own independent discretion, after a fair\n           hearing, which is nothing more than what the\n           regulations accord petitioner as a right.\n\nId.\n\n           Critical to this analysis was the admonition that a\n\ncourt reviewing a habeas claim could not pass upon the merits of\n\nthe BIA's final decision on the appropriateness of discretionary\n\nrelief.   See id. (warning that the petitioner \"may still fail to\n\nconvince the Board or the Attorney General, in the exercise of\n\ntheir discretion, that he is entitled to suspension\").                 The\n\nCourt reiterated this point two years later, declaring that\n\n\"[a]lthough   .   .   .   aliens    have   been   given   a   right   to   a\n\ndiscretionary determination on an application for suspension, a\n\ngrant thereof is manifestly not a matter of right under any\n\ncircumstances, but rather is in all cases a matter of grace.\"\n\nJay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 354 (1956) (citation omitted).\n\n           This, then, was the state of the law while the INA\n\nremained in force.    Because section 212(c) afforded a deportable\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\falien an opportunity to apply for discretionary relief, an\n\neligible alien could seek habeas review if and when the INS\n\nrefused to entertain such an application at all.                  This is not an\n\nespecially     radical     view     of    the       law,     but,     rather,    a\n\nparticularized application of the precept that as long as a\n\nregulation is properly promulgated and stays in force, \"the\n\nExecutive Branch is bound by it, and indeed the United States as\n\nthe sovereign composed of the three branches is bound to respect\n\nand to enforce it.\"       United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 696\n\n(1974) (citing Accardi).\n\n            In 1996, Congress enacted the IIRIRA,3 and the tectonic\n\nplates    shifted.    One       section   of    the   IIRIRA      provides    that\n\n\"notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have\n\njurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any\n\nalien    arising   from   the    decision      or   action   by     the   Attorney\n\nGeneral to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute\n\nremoval orders against any alien under this chapter.\"                     8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(g).     Another section prohibits judicial review of any\n\nappeal challenging a final order of removal if initiated by an\n\nalien convicted of an aggravated felony.               Id. § 1252(a)(2)(C).\n\n\n\n    3Some of the provisions cited herein are, in fact,\namendments to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,\nPub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). See Goncalves v.\nReno, 144 F.3d 110, 112-13 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                     -10-\n\f             The IIRIRA also changed the form and method by which\n\nthe Attorney General (and through him or her the INS, see supra\n\nnote 2) may grant discretionary relief.                          Congress abolished\n\n212(c)   waivers       entirely          and    substituted      a    process       called\n\n\"cancellation of removal.\"                Id. § 1229b.        The new procedure is\n\nconsiderably more restrictive.                   Of particular interest here, it\n\nprohibits      the    Attorney      General       from     exercising       his    or   her\n\ndiscretion to halt the removal of any alien convicted of an\n\naggravated felony.         Id. § 1229b(a)(3).\n\n             The     import    of       these    statutes    was      not   immediately\n\napparent.      In Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\nwe   faced   a     situation       in    which    the     petitioner,       having      been\n\nconvicted of non-aggravated felonies, applied for 212(c) relief\n\nbefore   the     passage      of    the    IIRIRA.         Id.   at   114.        The    INS\n\nthereafter       refused      to        process     his    application,           and    the\n\npetitioner sought habeas review.                  Id. at 112.        We ruled that the\n\nfederal courts' habeas jurisdiction survived the enactment of\n\nthe IIRIRA.        Id. at 122-23.              We then held that the petitioner\n\nwas still eligible to pursue 212(c) relief because Congress did\n\nnot intend the IIRIRA to apply retroactively to invalidate\n\n212(c) applications that had been placed on record before the\n\nIIRIRA's effective date.                Id. at 133.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f           A    year     later,    the    Supreme    Court    decided    Reno    v.\n\nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471 (1999)\n\n(AADC).        There,    a   group   of    aliens    sought   to   contest      the\n\ninitiation of removal proceedings on the ground that the INS had\n\ntargeted them in retaliation for their political beliefs.                       Id.\n\nat 473-74.     The case came before the Court on direct review, and\n\nthe Court read 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) as barring the exercise of\n\njurisdiction over the aliens' claims.                Id. at 492.        The Court\n\nadded that, in all events, \"an alien unlawfully in this country\n\nhas no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as\n\na defense against his deportation.\"             Id. at 488.\n\n           We addressed the impact of AADC in Mahadeo v. Reno, 226\n\nF.3d 3 (1st Cir. 2000).           There, an alien whose prior convictions\n\ndisqualified him for discretionary relief under the IIRIRA — but\n\nnot under the INA — claimed eligibility for a 212(c) waiver on\n\nthe ground that the convictions predated the IIRIRA.                    Id. at 6.\n\nWe rejected the Attorney General's argument that AADC overruled\n\nGoncalves, or, alternatively, that the petitioner no longer was\n\neligible       for      discretionary       relief     because     deportation\n\nproceedings had not commenced until after the expiration of the\n\nso-called transitional rules.4              See id. at 10 (holding that\n\n\n    4Congress established certain transitional rules to apply to\ncases pending at the time that the IIRIRA was enacted.       See\nIIRIRA § 309(c).    Under these rules, Congress delayed the\n\n                                         -12-\n\f\"IIRIRA's    permanent   rules   lack    the   clear      statement   of   the\n\ncongressional intent necessary to eliminate habeas review\").\n\nNoting that AADC applied only to cases on direct review, id. at\n\n12, we remanded Mahadeo's case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings, id. at 15.\n\n            The Supreme Court reentered the fray last term in two\n\ncompanion cases.    See INS v. St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. 2271 (2001);\n\nCalcano-Martinez    v.   INS,    121    S.   Ct.   2268    (2001).     Those\n\ndecisions closely tracked the line we had drawn in Goncalves and\n\nMahadeo:\n\n                   If it were clear that the question of\n            law could be answered in another judicial\n            forum, it might be permissible to accept the\n            INS' reading of § 1252. But the absence of\n            such a forum, coupled with the lack of a\n            clear, unambiguous, and express statement of\n            congressional intent to preclude judicial\n            consideration on habeas of such an important\n            question of law, strongly counsels against\n            adopting a construction that would raise\n            serious      constitutional      questions.\n            Accordingly,   we   conclude   that   habeas\n\n\nenforcement of section 1252(b)(9) (removing jurisdiction for\njudicial review of INS decisions to commence removal) until\nApril 1, 1997, but made section 1252(g) (eliminating judicial\nreview of appeals launched by aggravated felons) effective\nimmediately. Id. § 309(a). The parties quarrel about whether\nsection 1252(g) or section 1252(b)(9) applies after the\nexpiration of the transitional rules.       There is a simple\nsolution to this quandary: both sections apply. From and after\nApril 1, 1997, Congress eliminated judicial review not only over\ndecisions to initiate removal but also over attempts by aliens\nthereafter convicted of aggravated felonies to appeal removal\norders. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483.\n\n                                  -13-\n\f             jurisdiction under [28 U.S.C.] § 2241 was\n             not repealed by AEDPA and IIRIRA.\n\nSt. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. at 2287 (citation omitted).                   Federal courts\n\ntherefore     retain    subject        matter    jurisdiction      over   habeas\n\npetitions brought by aliens facing removal to the extent that\n\nthose petitions are based on colorable claims of legal error,\n\nthat   is,    colorable      claims      that    an    alien's    statutory    or\n\nconstitutional rights have been violated.\n\n                          B.    The Case at Hand.\n\n             In light of St. Cyr, INS's principal argument — that\n\nsection 1252(g) forecloses the exercise of habeas jurisdiction\n\nover cases in which an alien challenges his imminent deportation\n\n— is a dead letter.       Here, however, the habeas petition is filed\n\nby an aggravated felon who was convicted of the predicate crime\n\nafter the effective date of the IIRIRA.                     Under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229b(a)(3),     such   an     alien    has     no    statutory   right   to   any\n\nparticular process for withholding deportation.                   The question,\n\nthen, is whether a claim grounded solely in the INS's failure to\n\nexercise its prosecutorial discretion is colorable under 28 §\n\nU.S.C. 2241.     We think not.\n\n             In each of the cases that we have discussed — Accardi\n\nand Goncalves are prime examples — an alien was afforded a\n\nstatutory right to have an application for discretionary relief\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fconsidered.    See Accardi, 347 U.S. at 268; Goncalves, 144 F.3d\n\nat 125.   We elaborated upon this point in Goncalves:\n\n          Analytically, the decision whether an alien\n          is   eligible  to   be  considered   for   a\n          particular discretionary form of relief is a\n          statutory   question   separate   from   the\n          discretionary      component      of     the\n          administrative decision whether to grant\n          relief.\n\n          . . . . The Court has determined that the\n          refusal of the BIA to consider an alien's\n          request   for   discretionary    relief,  in\n          violation of statute or regulations, is a\n          valid claim on habeas corpus.      In making\n          certain aliens eligible for discretionary\n          relief, Congress intended the Attorney\n          General or her designated subordinates to\n          make a judgment.     A refusal to make that\n          judgment would frustrate Congress' intent. .\n          . .      Thus it is no answer to [the\n          petitioner's] argument to emphasize the\n          broad discretion of the political branches\n          in immigration matters. It was the intent\n          of   Congress   that   such   discretion  be\n          exercised.\n\n144 F.3d at 125 (citations omitted).     As this discussion makes\n\npellucid, under earlier legal regimes an alien could bring a\n\nhabeas claim if he was not afforded access to the process\n\nthrough which the INS could exercise its discretion to withhold\n\ndeportation.   The alien could not, however, challenge the INS's\n\ndecision (i.e., its exercise or non-exercise of discretion) on\n\nits merits.    Jay, 351 U.S. at 353.   Put another way, the alien\n\nhad a right to the process, enforceable by habeas if need be,\n\nbut no right to a particular result.\n\n                               -15-\n\f            The    question,         then,      reduces          to     whether,      in     the\n\ncircumstances      of     this      case,       the    petitioner            has    shown     an\n\nestablished right to a particular process.                            Such an established\n\nright may inure by statute or by constitutional command.                               See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2241(c)(3) (extending the writ of habeas corpus to\n\npersons    held    \"in    violation        of    the       Constitution        or     laws    or\n\ntreaties of the United States\").                      Without such an established\n\nright, however, an alien's claim simply is not cognizable under\n\nthe habeas statute.\n\n            No such right exists here.                     The petitioner, following\n\nthe district court's lead, questions whether the INS exercised\n\nits discretion at all.             In the habeas context, we may conduct an\n\ninquiry    into    the    exercise        vel    non       of    discretion         only   when\n\nCongress    has    afforded         the   alien        a    statutory         right    to     be\n\nconsidered for discretionary relief.                            While the INS retains\n\ninherent prosecutorial discretion as to whether to bring removal\n\nproceedings, see AADC, 525 U.S. at 489, there is no provision of\n\nlaw which gives an alien aggravated felon, convicted after\n\nSeptember    30,    1996      (the    effective            date    of    the       IIRIRA),    a\n\nstatutory    right       to   be    considered         for      such     a   discretionary\n\ndetermination.       And once the removal determination has been\n\nmade, Congress has eliminated any right for such an individual\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fto be considered by the Attorney General for cancellation of\n\nremoval.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3).\n\n                 The only remaining issue is whether the petitioner\n\nmaintains         some    residual     constitutional          right,    presumably\n\nemanating from the Due Process Clause, to have the INS weigh the\n\nequities of his appeal — or as the district court phrased it, to\n\nhave the INS perform \"an act of discretion\" rather than \"an act\n\n(unmodified).\"           Carranza II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 63.             The text of\n\nthe Constitution does not confer such a right, and the case law\n\ndoes       not    support    its    existence.          That    leaves    only    the\n\npossibility of creating such an entitlement out of whole cloth\n\n—   but     doing    so     would    fly    in    the   teeth    of     the   general\n\nproscription against judicial review of any aspect of such\n\nprosecutorial deliberations.5               See Wayte v. United States, 470\n\nU.S. 598, 607-08 (1985).               That proscription has undeniable\n\n\n\n       5\n     We exempt from this general proscription, of course,\ngovernment misconduct that violates the Equal Protection Clause.\nSee Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364 (1978) (\"[T]he\nconscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in\nitself a federal constitutional violation so long as the\nselection was not deliberately based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard   such   as  race,   religion,   or   other   arbitrary\nclassification.\") (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).   In much the same vein, the AADC Court, in dictum,\nleft room for \"the possibility of a rare case in which the\nalleged basis of discrimination is so outrageous\" that an\nexception might lie. 525 U.S. at 491. Because nothing remotely\nresembling egregious government misconduct is alleged here, we\nneed not pursue this point.\n\n                                           -17-\n\frelevance here.     See AADC, 525 U.S. at 491 (\"The contention that\n\na[n immigration] violation must be allowed to continue because\n\nit   has   been   improperly   selected   [for   prosecution]   is   not\n\npowerfully appealing.\").       Indeed, the Court has made it plain\n\nthat no general constitutional right exists for an alien in the\n\npetitioner's circumstances to review prosecutorial deliberations\n\nin order to forfend removal.        See id. at 487-92.      We see no\n\nfounded basis for applying a different constitutional principle\n\nto the absence of such deliberations.\n\n            This construct comports with the way in which writs of\n\nhabeas corpus historically have been employed in the immigration\n\ncontext.     As a general rule, the type of claims that are\n\navailable to aliens on habeas are restricted, see Bowrin v. INS,\n\n194 F.3d 483, 490 (4th Cir. 1999) (limiting habeas review in\n\nimmigration cases to \"questions of pure law\"),6 and here, habeas\n\ncannot lie without the linchpin of a right granted by statute.7\n\nWhether or not the INS exercised its discretion is therefore\n\nbeside any relevant point.      Because the petitioner did not have\n\n\n      6\n     Purely legal questions are suitable for habeas review\nbecause answering them does not necessitate second-guessing \"the\nagency's factual findings or the Attorney General's exercise of\nher discretion.\" Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106, 120 n.10 (2d\nCir. 1998) (citing Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 125).\n      7\n     This holding does not in any way implicate the Suspension\nClause. See Delaney v. Matesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(\"The Suspension Clause applies (if at all) only when Congress\ntotally bars an individual or a group from access to habeas\nrelief.\").\n\n                                  -18-\n\fa right to demand the exercise of this discretion in the first\n\nplace, it follows inexorably that he cannot challenge its non-\n\nexercise by means of an application for habeas review.\n\n          That ends the matter.        Unlike the alien in St. Cyr, 121\n\nS. Ct. at 2275, the petitioner pleaded guilty to an aggravated\n\nfelony after the IIRIRA's effective date.              Thus, the process\n\nthat gave rise to habeas jurisdiction in earlier cases — the\n\nright to be considered for 212(c) relief — is unavailable to\n\nhim.   As an aggravated felon, the petitioner is ineligible to\n\napply for cancellation of removal (and, thus, has no statutory\n\nright on which to base a claim that the Attorney General refused\n\nto exercise discretion in respect to his removal).                  This is\n\ncompletely    congruent   with    the     absence      of   any   colorable\n\nconstitutional claim in that respect.          See supra.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no further.         Barring a colorable statutory\n\nor constitutional claim, the failure of the INS to exercise\n\nindividualized      discretion    in     its   decision      to   initiate\n\ndeportation   proceedings    against      an   alien    convicted    of   an\n\naggravated felony after the effective date of the IIRIRA does\n\nnot fall within the purview of the residual federal habeas\n\nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 2241.       Thus, we hold that the petitioner —\n\nan alien convicted of an aggravated felony after the IIRIRA's\n\neffective date — lacks any entitlement to pursue habeas relief\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fon the ground that the INS refused to exercise discretion in\n\ninstituting deportation proceedings.   On this basis, we reverse\n\nthe judgment below and remand the matter to the district court\n\nwith instructions to dismiss the petitioner's habeas application\n\nfor want of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\f",

L. No. 104-208 (1996) (codified in scattered sections of 8 U.S.C.) (IIRIRA), may obtain habeas relief on the ground that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) failed to exercise discretion when it initiated deportation proceedings against him. The district court found this issue lurking in the penumbra of the case; deemed it a sufficient basis to grant relief in favor of petitioner-appellee Edovidio R. Carranza; and therefore ordered further consideration of the petitioner's situation by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). See Carranza v. INS, 89 F. Supp. 2d 91, 95-97 (D. Mass. 2000) (Carranza I); see also Carranza v. INS, 111 F. Supp. 2d 60, 64 (D. Mass. 2000) (Carranza II) (denying Rule 59(e) motion). We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner is a Guatemalan national who entered this country over two decades ago. He lived in Maine with his common-law wife and children, but worked in Boston. On March 23, 1996, police officers in that city arrested him after he engaged in a violent dispute with his mistress. On October 1, 1997, the petitioner entered a guilty plea in state court to reduced charges (assault with a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm). The court imposed a three-year incarcerative sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly ten weeks later, the INS commenced deportation proceedings by issuing a notice to appear before an immigration judge (IJ). The IJ held a removal hearing on March 5, 1998. The petitioner appeared pro se. The hearing was not completed on that date, and the petitioner filed an application for suspension of deportation, citing family and economic concerns. When the hearing resumed (June 2, 1998), the petitioner admitted to the assault conviction. He would not take responsibility for the firearms conviction, however, adamantly asserting that the weapon was not his.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found that the INS had sustained its burden of showing removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(C); took the firearms conviction at face value; and held that the petitioner, as a firearms offender who had committed an aggravated felony, see id. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F), was ineligible for cancellation of removal (the IIRIRA's equivalent of suspension of deportation). The petitioner appealed, and the BIA upheld the decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner essayed a court challenge to the BIA's decision. He filed papers in this court in which he effectively conceded both his aggravated felon status and his ineligibility for the cancellation of removal process established under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b. Citing the bar to direct review contained in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(C), we determined that we lacked jurisdiction to scrutinize the BIA's decision. Carranza v. INS, No. 99-1428 (1st Cir. May 3, 1999) (unpublished order). Withal, we noted that the petitioner's papers could be read as requesting relief in the nature of habeas corpus and transferred the matter to the district court for consideration of that claim. Id. at 1-2 (referencing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the petitioner claimed that he had not been properly advised of the consequences of pleading guilty to the firearms charge and asserted that he would have contested that charge had he known the ramifications. To show that he had a viable defense, he tendered a statement from his landlord maintaining that the landlord (rather than the petitioner) owned the gun. He also proffered evidence of his good character and his son's delicate medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a non-evidentiary hearing on January 20, 2000. The petitioner again appeared pro se. Although the petitioner had not raised the question, the court expressed concern as to whether the Attorney General had exercised discretion before initiating removal proceedings. Counsel for the INS stubbornly refused to address this concern, but, rather, (1) questioned the district court's jurisdiction to hear the matter, and (2) asserted that when an alien had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the IIRIRA left the Attorney General no choice but to proceed with deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 29, 2000, the district court issued an opinion in which it rejected the INS's contention that the court lacked habeas jurisdiction. Carranza I, 89 F. Supp. 2d at 94-95. The court then concluded that \"[a]lthough this district court cannot review the decision that the INS reaches after exercising its discretion, this court can require that the INS exercise discretion rather than deciding that [it] has no discretion.\" Id. at 95. The court emphasized the very short time that had elapsed between the petitioner's conviction and the INS's issuance of the notice to appear -- roughly ten weeks -- and ruled that the INS had brought removal proceedings against the petitioner without any antecedent exercise of discretion. Id. On that basis, the court remanded the case to the BIA \"for a discretionary determination of the propriety of having commenced proceedings against Carranza,\" and appointed counsel for him. Id. at 97. At the same time, the court dismissed the petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim vis-a-vis the firearms conviction on the ground that the petitioner had failed to exhaust available state remedies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Id. at 96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS promptly moved to alter or amend the judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). It asserted that the district court had misunderstood its position and argued that the decision to institute removal proceedings against the petitioner itself represented the required exercise of discretion. The district court rejected this entreaty, stating that the INS had \"conflat[ed] an act of discretion with an act (unmodified).\" Carranza II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 63. The court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Available evidence strongly supports the inference . . . that employees of the INS do not recognize the scope of their discretionary power in assessing the merits of individual cases before proceeding, and during proceedings, and that in the case of [petitioner] they did not make a discretionary determination as to the propriety of instituting proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 64.

Such waivers came to be known as \"212(c) waivers\" or \"212(c) relief.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), the Supreme Court encountered a claim based on a substantively similar provision embodied in an earlier version of the immigration laws. There, an alien filed a habeas petition in which he charged the Attorney General with improperly influencing the BIA and thus precluding meaningful review of his application for 212(c) relief. Id. at 263-65. The Court found this claim colorable under the district court's habeas jurisdiction, reasoning that the regulations granted the BIA discretion in passing upon applications for equitable relief from deportation, and that the BIA's failure to exercise this discretion was actionable. Id. at 268. The Court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If petitioner can prove the allegation, he should receive a new hearing before the Board without the burden of previous proscription by the [Attorney General's bias]. . . . [I]n arriving at its decision [the Board must] exercise its own independent discretion, after a fair hearing, which is nothing more than what the regulations accord petitioner as a right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Critical to this analysis was the admonition that a court reviewing a habeas claim could not pass upon the merits of the BIA's final decision on the appropriateness of discretionary relief. See id. (warning that the petitioner \"may still fail to convince the Board or the Attorney General, in the exercise of their discretion, that he is entitled to suspension\"). The Court reiterated this point two years later, declaring that \"[a]lthough . . . aliens have been given a right to a discretionary determination on an application for suspension, a grant thereof is manifestly not a matter of right under any circumstances, but rather is in all cases a matter of grace.\" Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 354 (1956) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, then, was the state of the law while the INA remained in force. Because section 212(c) afforded a deportable alien an opportunity to apply for discretionary relief, an eligible alien could seek habeas review if and when the INS refused to entertain such an application at all. This is not an especially radical view of the law, but, rather, a particularized application of the precept that as long as a regulation is properly promulgated and stays in force, \"the Executive Branch is bound by it, and indeed the United States as the sovereign composed of the three branches is bound to respect and to enforce it.\" United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 696 (1974) (citing Accardi).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Congress enacted the IIRIRA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and the tectonic plates shifted. One section of the IIRIRA provides that \"notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g). Another section prohibits judicial review of any appeal challenging a final order of removal if initiated by an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Id. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IIRIRA also changed the form and method by which the Attorney General (and through him or her the INS, see supra note 2) may grant discretionary relief. Congress abolished 212(c) waivers entirely and substituted a process called \"cancellation of removal.\" Id. &#167; 1229b. The new procedure is considerably more restrictive. Of particular interest here, it prohibits the Attorney General from exercising his or her discretion to halt the removal of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Id. &#167; 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The import of these statutes was not immediately apparent. In Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998), we faced a situation in which the petitioner, having been convicted of non-aggravated felonies, applied for 212(c) relief before the passage of the IIRIRA. Id. at 114. The INS thereafter refused to process his application, and the petitioner sought habeas review. Id. at 112. We ruled that the federal courts' habeas jurisdiction survived the enactment of the IIRIRA. Id. at 122-23. We then held that the petitioner was still eligible to pursue 212(c) relief because Congress did not intend the IIRIRA to apply retroactively to invalidate 212(c) applications that had been placed on record before the IIRIRA's effective date. Id. at 133.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year later, the Supreme Court decided Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471 (1999) (AADC). There, a group of aliens sought to contest the initiation of removal proceedings on the ground that the INS had targeted them in retaliation for their political beliefs. Id. at 473-74. The case came before the Court on direct review, and the Court read 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g) as barring the exercise of jurisdiction over the aliens' claims. Id. at 492. The Court added that, in all events, \"an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against his deportation.\" Id. at 488.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We addressed the impact of AADC in Mahadeo v. Reno, 226 F.3d 3 (1st Cir. 2000). There, an alien whose prior convictions disqualified him for discretionary relief under the IIRIRA -- but not under the INA -- claimed eligibility for a 212(c) waiver on the ground that the convictions predated the IIRIRA. Id. at 6. We rejected the Attorney General's argument that AADC overruled Goncalves, or, alternatively, that the petitioner no longer was eligible for discretionary relief because deportation proceedings had not commenced until after the expiration of the so-called transitional rules.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See id. at 10 (holding that \"IIRIRA's permanent rules lack the clear statement of the congressional intent necessary to eliminate habeas review\"). Noting that AADC applied only to cases on direct review, id. at 12, we remanded Mahadeo's case to the district court for further proceedings, id. at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reentered the fray last term in two companion cases. See INS v. St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. 2271 (2001); Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 121 S. Ct. 2268 (2001). Those decisions closely tracked the line we had drawn in Goncalves and Mahadeo:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it were clear that the question of law could be answered in another judicial forum, it might be permissible to accept the INS' reading of &#167; 1252. But the absence of such a forum, coupled with the lack of a clear, unambiguous, and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on habeas of such an important question of law, strongly counsels against adopting a construction that would raise serious constitutional questions. Accordingly, we conclude that habeas jurisdiction under [28 U.S.C.] &#167; 2241 was not repealed by AEDPA and IIRIRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. at 2287 (citation omitted). Federal courts therefore retain subject matter jurisdiction over habeas petitions brought by aliens facing removal to the extent that those petitions are based on colorable claims of legal error, that is, colorable claims that an alien's statutory or constitutional rights have been violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Case at Hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of St. Cyr, INS's principal argument -- that section 1252(g) forecloses the exercise of habeas jurisdiction over cases in which an alien challenges his imminent deportation -- is a dead letter. Here, however, the habeas petition is filed by an aggravated felon who was convicted of the predicate crime after the effective date of the IIRIRA. Under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a)(3), such an alien has no statutory right to any particular process for withholding deportation. The question, then, is whether a claim grounded solely in the INS's failure to exercise its prosecutorial discretion is colorable under 28 &#167; U.S.C. 2241. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each of the cases that we have discussed -- Accardi and Goncalves are prime examples -- an alien was afforded a statutory right to have an application for discretionary relief considered. See Accardi, 347 U.S. at 268; Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 125. We elaborated upon this point in Goncalves:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analytically, the decision whether an alien is eligible to be considered for a particular discretionary form of relief is a statutory question separate from the discretionary component of the administrative decision whether to grant relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . . The Court has determined that the refusal of the BIA to consider an alien's request for discretionary relief, in violation of statute or regulations, is a valid claim on habeas corpus. In making certain aliens eligible for discretionary relief, Congress intended the Attorney General or her designated subordinates to make a judgment. A refusal to make that judgment would frustrate Congress' intent. . . . Thus it is no answer to [the petitioner's] argument to emphasize the broad discretion of the political branches in immigration matters. It was the intent of Congress that such discretion be exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">144 F.3d at 125 (citations omitted). As this discussion makes pellucid, under earlier legal regimes an alien could bring a habeas claim if he was not afforded access to the process through which the INS could exercise its discretion to withhold deportation. The alien could not, however, challenge the INS's decision (i.e., its exercise or non-exercise of discretion) on its merits. Jay, 351 U.S. at 353. Put another way, the alien had a right to the process, enforceable by habeas if need be, but no right to a particular result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, reduces to whether, in the circumstances of this case, the petitioner has shown an established right to a particular process. Such an established right may inure by statute or by constitutional command. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c)(3) (extending the writ of habeas corpus to persons held \"in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\"). Without such an established right, however, an alien's claim simply is not cognizable under the habeas statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No such right exists here. The petitioner, following the district court's lead, questions whether the INS exercised its discretion at all. In the habeas context, we may conduct an inquiry into the exercise vel non of discretion only when Congress has afforded the alien a statutory right to be considered for discretionary relief. While the INS retains inherent prosecutorial discretion as to whether to bring removal proceedings, see AADC, 525 U.S. at 489, there is no provision of law which gives an alien aggravated felon, convicted after September 30, 1996 (the effective date of the IIRIRA), a statutory right to be considered for such a discretionary determination. And once the removal determination has been made, Congress has eliminated any right for such an individual to be considered by the Attorney General for cancellation of removal. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining issue is whether the petitioner maintains some residual constitutional right, presumably emanating from the Due Process Clause, to have the INS weigh the equities of his appeal -- or as the district court phrased it, to have the INS perform \"an act of discretion\" rather than \"an act (unmodified).\" Carranza II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 63. The text of the Constitution does not confer such a right, and the case law does not support its existence. That leaves only the possibility of creating such an entitlement out of whole cloth -- but doing so would fly in the teeth of the general proscription against judicial review of any aspect of such prosecutorial deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-08 (1985). That proscription has undeniable relevance here. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 491 (\"The contention that a[n immigration] violation must be allowed to continue because it has been improperly selected [for prosecution] is not powerfully appealing.\"). Indeed, the Court has made it plain that no general constitutional right exists for an alien in the petitioner's circumstances to review prosecutorial deliberations in order to forfend removal. See id. at 487-92. We see no founded basis for applying a different constitutional principle to the absence of such deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construct comports with the way in which writs of habeas corpus historically have been employed in the immigration context. As a general rule, the type of claims that are available to aliens on habeas are restricted, see Bowrin v. INS, 194 F.3d 483, 490 (4th Cir. 1999) (limiting habeas review in immigration cases to \"questions of pure law\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and here, habeas cannot lie without the linchpin of a right granted by statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Whether or not the INS exercised its discretion is therefore beside any relevant point. Because the petitioner did not have a right to demand the exercise of this discretion in the first place, it follows inexorably that he cannot challenge its non-exercise by means of an application for habeas review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Unlike the alien in St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. at 2275, the petitioner pleaded guilty to an aggravated felony after the IIRIRA's effective date. Thus, the process that gave rise to habeas jurisdiction in earlier cases -- the right to be considered for 212(c) relief -- is unavailable to him. As an aggravated felon, the petitioner is ineligible to apply for cancellation of removal (and, thus, has no statutory right on which to base a claim that the Attorney General refused to exercise discretion in respect to his removal). This is completely congruent with the absence of any colorable constitutional claim in that respect. See supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Barring a colorable statutory or constitutional claim, the failure of the INS to exercise individualized discretion in its decision to initiate deportation proceedings against an alien convicted of an aggravated felony after the effective date of the IIRIRA does not fall within the purview of the residual federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241. Thus, we hold that the petitioner -- an alien convicted of an aggravated felony after the IIRIRA's effective date -- lacks any entitlement to pursue habeas relief on the ground that the INS refused to exercise discretion in instituting deportation proceedings. On this basis, we reverse the judgment below and remand the matter to the district court with instructions to dismiss the petitioner's habeas application for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioner has not appealed from this portion of the district court's ukase.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Attorney General's discretion in this field has from time to time been delegated to the BIA and/or the INS. See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 265-66 &amp; n.6 (1954) (discussing this phenomenon).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Some of the provisions cited herein are, in fact, amendments to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). See Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 112-13 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Congress established certain transitional rules to apply to cases pending at the time that the IIRIRA was enacted. See IIRIRA &#167; 309(c). Under these rules, Congress delayed the enforcement of section 1252(b)(9) (removing jurisdiction for judicial review of INS decisions to commence removal) until April 1, 1997, but made section 1252(g) (eliminating judicial review of appeals launched by aggravated felons) effective immediately. Id. &#167; 309(a). The parties quarrel about whether section 1252(g) or section 1252(b)(9) applies after the expiration of the transitional rules. There is a simple solution to this quandary: both sections apply. From and after April 1, 1997, Congress eliminated judicial review not only over decisions to initiate removal but also over attempts by aliens thereafter convicted of aggravated felonies to appeal removal orders. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We exempt from this general proscription, of course, government misconduct that violates the Equal Protection Clause. See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364 (1978) (\"[T]he conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation so long as the selection was not deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In much the same vein, the AADC Court, in dictum, left room for \"the possibility of a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so outrageous\" that an exception might lie. 525 U.S. at 491. Because nothing remotely resembling egregious government misconduct is alleged here, we need not pursue this point.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Purely legal questions are suitable for habeas review because answering them does not necessitate second-guessing \"the agency's factual findings or the Attorney General's exercise of her discretion.\" Henderson v.

The district court found this issue lurking in the penumbra of the case; deemed it a sufficient basis to grant relief in favor of petitioner-appellee Edovidio R.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner is a Guatemalan national who entered this country over two decades ago. He lived in Maine with his common-law wife and children, but worked in Boston. On March 23, 1996, police officers in that city arrested him after he engaged in a violent dispute with his mistress. On October 1, 1997, the petitioner entered a guilty plea in state court to reduced charges (assault with a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm). The court imposed a three-year incarcerative sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly ten weeks later, the INS commenced deportation proceedings by issuing a notice to appear before an immigration judge (IJ). The IJ held a removal hearing on March 5, 1998. The petitioner appeared pro se. The hearing was not completed on that date, and the petitioner filed an application for suspension of deportation, citing family and economic concerns. When the hearing resumed (June 2, 1998), the petitioner admitted to the assault conviction. He would not take responsibility for the firearms conviction, however, adamantly asserting that the weapon was not his.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found that the INS had sustained its burden of showing removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(C); took the firearms conviction at face value; and held that the petitioner, as a firearms offender who had committed an aggravated felony, see id. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F), was ineligible for cancellation of removal (the IIRIRA's equivalent of suspension of deportation).

He filed papers in this court in which he effectively conceded both his aggravated felon status and his ineligibility for the cancellation of removal process established under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b. Citing the bar to direct review contained in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(C), we determined that we lacked jurisdiction to scrutinize the BIA's decision. Carranza v. INS, No. 99-1428 (1st Cir. May 3, 1999) (unpublished order). Withal, we noted that the petitioner's papers could be read as requesting relief in the nature of habeas corpus and transferred the matter to the district court for consideration of that claim. Id. at 1-2 (referencing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the petitioner claimed that he had not been properly advised of the consequences of pleading guilty to the firearms charge and asserted that he would have contested that charge had he known the ramifications. To show that he had a viable defense, he tendered a statement from his landlord maintaining that the landlord (rather than the petitioner) owned the gun.

The petitioner again appeared pro se. Although the petitioner had not raised the question, the court expressed concern as to whether the Attorney General had exercised discretion before initiating removal proceedings. Counsel for the INS stubbornly refused to address this concern, but, rather, (1) questioned the district court's jurisdiction to hear the matter, and (2) asserted that when an alien had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the IIRIRA left the Attorney General no choice but to proceed with deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 29, 2000, the district court issued an opinion in which it rejected the INS's contention that the court lacked habeas jurisdiction. Carranza I, 89 F. Supp. 2d at 94-95. The court then concluded that \"[a]lthough this district court cannot review the decision that the INS reaches after exercising its discretion, this court can require that the INS exercise discretion rather than deciding that [it] has no discretion.\" Id. at 95. The court emphasized the very short time that had elapsed between the petitioner's conviction and the INS's issuance of the notice to appear -- roughly ten weeks -- and ruled that the INS had brought removal proceedings against the petitioner without any antecedent exercise of discretion. Id. On that basis, the court remanded the case to the BIA \"for a discretionary determination of the propriety of having commenced proceedings against Carranza,\" and appointed counsel for him. Id. at 97. At the same time, the court dismissed the petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim vis-a-vis the firearms conviction on the ground that the petitioner had failed to exhaust available state remedies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Id. at 96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS promptly moved to alter or amend the judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). It asserted that the district court had misunderstood its position and argued that the decision to institute removal proceedings against the petitioner itself represented the required exercise of discretion. The district court rejected this entreaty, stating that the INS had \"conflat[ed] an act of discretion with an act (unmodified).\" Carranza II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 63.

There, an alien filed a habeas petition in which he charged the Attorney General with improperly influencing the BIA and thus precluding meaningful review of his application for 212(c) relief. Id. at 263-65. The Court found this claim colorable under the district court's habeas jurisdiction, reasoning that the regulations granted the BIA discretion in passing upon applications for equitable relief from deportation, and that the BIA's failure to exercise this discretion was actionable. Id. at 268. The Court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If petitioner can prove the allegation, he should receive a new hearing before the Board without the burden of previous proscription by the [Attorney General's bias]. . . . [I]n arriving at its decision [the Board must] exercise its own independent discretion, after a fair hearing, which is nothing more than what the regulations accord petitioner as a right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Critical to this analysis was the admonition that a court reviewing a habeas claim could not pass upon the merits of the BIA's final decision on the appropriateness of discretionary relief. See id. (warning that the petitioner \"may still fail to convince the Board or the Attorney General, in the exercise of their discretion, that he is entitled to suspension\"). The Court reiterated this point two years later, declaring that \"[a]lthough . . . aliens have been given a right to a discretionary determination on an application for suspension, a grant thereof is manifestly not a matter of right under any circumstances, but rather is in all cases a matter of grace.\" Jay v. Boyd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105407\"><a href=\"/opinion/105407/jay-v-boyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span>, 354 (1956) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, then, was the state of the law while the INA remained in force. Because section 212(c) afforded a deportable alien an opportunity to apply for discretionary relief, an eligible alien could seek habeas review if and when the INS refused to entertain such an application at all. This is not an especially radical view of the law, but, rather, a particularized application of the precept that as long as a regulation is properly promulgated and stays in force, \"the Executive Branch is bound by it, and indeed the United States as the sovereign composed of the three branches is bound to respect and to enforce it.\" United States v. Nixon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span>, 696 (1974) (citing Accardi).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Congress enacted the IIRIRA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and the tectonic plates shifted. One section of the IIRIRA provides that \"notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g). Another section prohibits judicial review of any appeal challenging a final order of removal if initiated by an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.

Congress abolished 212(c) waivers entirely and substituted a process called \"cancellation of removal.\" Id. &#167; 1229b. The new procedure is considerably more restrictive. Of particular interest here, it prohibits the Attorney General from exercising his or her discretion to halt the removal of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Id. &#167; 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The import of these statutes was not immediately apparent.

Id. at 114. The INS thereafter refused to process his application, and the petitioner sought habeas review. Id. at 112. We ruled that the federal courts' habeas jurisdiction survived the enactment of the IIRIRA. Id. at 122-23. We then held that the petitioner was still eligible to pursue 212(c) relief because Congress did not intend the IIRIRA to apply retroactively to invalidate 212(c) applications that had been placed on record before the IIRIRA's effective date. Id. at 133.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year later, the Supreme Court decided Reno v.

There, a group of aliens sought to contest the initiation of removal proceedings on the ground that the INS had targeted them in retaliation for their political beliefs. Id. at 473-74. The case came before the Court on direct review, and the Court read 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g) as barring the exercise of jurisdiction over the aliens' claims. Id. at 492.

There, an alien whose prior convictions disqualified him for discretionary relief under the IIRIRA -- but not under the INA -- claimed eligibility for a 212(c) waiver on the ground that the convictions predated the IIRIRA. Id. at 6. We rejected the Attorney General's argument that AADC overruled Goncalves, or, alternatively, that the petitioner no longer was eligible for discretionary relief because deportation proceedings had not commenced until after the expiration of the so-called transitional rules.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See id. at 10 (holding that \"IIRIRA's permanent rules lack the clear statement of the congressional intent necessary to eliminate habeas review\").

Those decisions closely tracked the line we had drawn in Goncalves and Mahadeo:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it were clear that the question of law could be answered in another judicial forum, it might be permissible to accept the INS' reading of &#167; 1252. But the absence of such a forum, coupled with the lack of a clear, unambiguous, and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on habeas of such an important question of law, strongly counsels against adopting a construction that would raise serious constitutional questions. Accordingly, we conclude that habeas jurisdiction under [28 U.S.C.] &#167; 2241 was not repealed by AEDPA and IIRIRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. at 2287 (citation omitted). Federal courts therefore retain subject matter jurisdiction over habeas petitions brought by aliens facing removal to the extent that those petitions are based on colorable claims of legal error, that is, colorable claims that an alien's statutory or constitutional rights have been violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Case at Hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of St. Cyr, INS's principal argument -- that section 1252(g) forecloses the exercise of habeas jurisdiction over cases in which an alien challenges his imminent deportation -- is a dead letter. Here, however, the habeas petition is filed by an aggravated felon who was convicted of the predicate crime after the effective date of the IIRIRA. Under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a)(3), such an alien has no statutory right to any particular process for withholding deportation. The question, then, is whether a claim grounded solely in the INS's failure to exercise its prosecutorial discretion is colorable under 28 &#167; U.S.C. 2241. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each of the cases that we have discussed -- Accardi and Goncalves are prime examples -- an alien was afforded a statutory right to have an application for discretionary relief considered. See Accardi, 347 U.S. at 268; Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 125. We elaborated upon this point in Goncalves:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analytically, the decision whether an alien is eligible to be considered for a particular discretionary form of relief is a statutory question separate from the discretionary component of the administrative decision whether to grant relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . . The Court has determined that the refusal of the BIA to consider an alien's request for discretionary relief, in violation of statute or regulations, is a valid claim on habeas corpus. In making certain aliens eligible for discretionary relief, Congress intended the Attorney General or her designated subordinates to make a judgment. A refusal to make that judgment would frustrate Congress' intent. . . . Thus it is no answer to [the petitioner's] argument to emphasize the broad discretion of the political branches in immigration matters. It was the intent of Congress that such discretion be exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">144 F.3d at 125 (citations omitted). As this discussion makes pellucid, under earlier legal regimes an alien could bring a habeas claim if he was not afforded access to the process through which the INS could exercise its discretion to withhold deportation. The alien could not, however, challenge the INS's decision (i.e., its exercise or non-exercise of discretion) on its merits. Jay, 351 U.S. at 353. Put another way, the alien had a right to the process, enforceable by habeas if need be, but no right to a particular result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, reduces to whether, in the circumstances of this case, the petitioner has shown an established right to a particular process. Such an established right may inure by statute or by constitutional command. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c)(3) (extending the writ of habeas corpus to persons held \"in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\"). Without such an established right, however, an alien's claim simply is not cognizable under the habeas statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No such right exists here. The petitioner, following the district court's lead, questions whether the INS exercised its discretion at all. In the habeas context, we may conduct an inquiry into the exercise vel non of discretion only when Congress has afforded the alien a statutory right to be considered for discretionary relief. While the INS retains inherent prosecutorial discretion as to whether to bring removal proceedings, see AADC, 525 U.S. at 489, there is no provision of law which gives an alien aggravated felon, convicted after September 30, 1996 (the effective date of the IIRIRA), a statutory right to be considered for such a discretionary determination. And once the removal determination has been made, Congress has eliminated any right for such an individual to be considered by the Attorney General for cancellation of removal. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining issue is whether the petitioner maintains some residual constitutional right, presumably emanating from the Due Process Clause, to have the INS weigh the equities of his appeal -- or as the district court phrased it, to have the INS perform \"an act of discretion\" rather than \"an act (unmodified).\" Carranza II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 63. The text of the Constitution does not confer such a right, and the case law does not support its existence. That leaves only the possibility of creating such an entitlement out of whole cloth -- but doing so would fly in the teeth of the general proscription against judicial review of any aspect of such prosecutorial deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See Wayte v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111375\"><a href=\"/opinion/111375/wayte-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 607-08 (1985). That proscription has undeniable relevance here. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 491 (\"The contention that a[n immigration] violation must be allowed to continue because it has been improperly selected [for prosecution] is not powerfully appealing.\"). Indeed, the Court has made it plain that no general constitutional right exists for an alien in the petitioner's circumstances to review prosecutorial deliberations in order to forfend removal. See id. at 487-92. We see no founded basis for applying a different constitutional principle to the absence of such deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This construct comports with the way in which writs of habeas corpus historically have been employed in the immigration context. As a general rule, the type of claims that are available to aliens on habeas are restricted, see Bowrin v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766494\"><a href=\"/opinion/766494/in-re-franklyn-roosevelt-bowrin-franklyn-roosevelt-bowrin-v-us/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 490 (4th Cir. 1999) (limiting habeas review in immigration cases to \"questions of pure law\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and here, habeas cannot lie without the linchpin of a right granted by statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Whether or not the INS exercised its discretion is therefore beside any relevant point. Because the petitioner did not have a right to demand the exercise of this discretion in the first place, it follows inexorably that he cannot challenge its non-exercise by means of an application for habeas review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Unlike the alien in St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. at 2275, the petitioner pleaded guilty to an aggravated felony after the IIRIRA's effective date. Thus, the process that gave rise to habeas jurisdiction in earlier cases -- the right to be considered for 212(c) relief -- is unavailable to him. As an aggravated felon, the petitioner is ineligible to apply for cancellation of removal (and, thus, has no statutory right on which to base a claim that the Attorney General refused to exercise discretion in respect to his removal). This is completely congruent with the absence of any colorable constitutional claim in that respect. See supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Barring a colorable statutory or constitutional claim, the failure of the INS to exercise individualized discretion in its decision to initiate deportation proceedings against an alien convicted of an aggravated felony after the effective date of the IIRIRA does not fall within the purview of the residual federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241. Thus, we hold that the petitioner -- an alien convicted of an aggravated felony after the IIRIRA's effective date -- lacks any entitlement to pursue habeas relief on the ground that the INS refused to exercise discretion in instituting deportation proceedings. On this basis, we reverse the judgment below and remand the matter to the district court with instructions to dismiss the petitioner's habeas application for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioner has not appealed from this portion of the district court's ukase.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Attorney General's discretion in this field has from time to time been delegated to the BIA and/or the INS.

See IIRIRA &#167; 309(c). Under these rules, Congress delayed the enforcement of section 1252(b)(9) (removing jurisdiction for judicial review of INS decisions to commence removal) until April 1, 1997, but made section 1252(g) (eliminating judicial review of appeals launched by aggravated felons) effective immediately. Id. &#167; 309(a). The parties quarrel about whether section 1252(g) or section 1252(b)(9) applies after the expiration of the transitional rules. There is a simple solution to this quandary: both sections apply. From and after April 1, 1997, Congress eliminated judicial review not only over decisions to initiate removal but also over attempts by aliens thereafter convicted of aggravated felonies to appeal removal orders.

In much the same vein, the AADC Court, in dictum, left room for \"the possibility of a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so outrageous\" that an exception might lie. 525 U.S. at 491.
