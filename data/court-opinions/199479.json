The district court dismissed the claims\n\nagainst McDonald's Corporation for failure to state a claim.\n\nLater, the court dismissed any intended \"civil rights\" claim\n\nagainst Canobie Lake Park for failure to state a cognizable\n\nfederal claim and, when plaintiff failed to substantiate the\n\nrequisite amount in controversy for diversity jurisdiction,\n\nthe remaining claims were dismissed for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.\n\n         Reviewing the judgment de novo in light of the\n\nrecord and the parties' arguments on appeal, we affirm.   See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                            -2-\n\f",
