Appellant Air  Safety, Inc.\r                                            \r\n\nfiled  this diversity  suit  seeking payments  allegedly due  for\r\n\nasbestos  removal at  six  Boston area  parochial  schools.   The\r\n\ndefendants, the Roman Catholic  Archbishop of Boston (\"RCAB\") and\r\n\nthe  Christian Brothers  Institute  of Massachusetts,  Inc. (\"the\r\n\nInstitute\"),  filed counterclaims  alleging damages  arising from\r\n\nAir Safety's work.1  The bottom line after a series of rulings by\r\n\nthe  court  and  the  jury  was a  net  award  in  favor  of each\r\n\ndefendant.   Air  Safety asserts  two claims  on appeal:  (1) the\r\n\ndistrict  court abused  its  discretion  in  refusing to  hold  a\r\n\npartial  new  trial  on  negligence  damages,  which  Air  Safety\r\n\ncontends were  excessive and unsupported  by the record;  and (2)\r\n\nthe district  court erred  in excluding crucial  exhibits showing\r\n\nAir Safety's overhead costs, requiring a partial new trial on its\r                                                                           \r\n\ndamages  against  the  RCAB  and  the  Institute.    We  find  no\r\n\nreversible error  in the  court's evidentiary ruling,  but vacate\r\n\nand  remand  for a  new trial  on  the negligence  damages unless\r\n\ndefendants accept a proposed remittitur.\r\n\n                      I. Factual Background\r                                                     \r\n\n     This  case  originated in  Air  Safety's  successful bid  to\r\n\nremove asbestos at six schools owned by the defendants.  The work\r\n\nbegan  in the  summer  of 1988.    Conflicts arose  over  various\r\n\naspects  of the project,  including the  quality of  Air Safety's\r\n\nperformance and the defendants'  obligations to pay for completed\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1 RCAB is the owner of five of the schools.  The Institute\r\nowns the sixth, Catholic Memorial High School.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nwork.   Air Safety filed suit to obtain payment, asserting claims\r\n\nfor breach  of contract,  for payments  on an  \"account stated,\"2\r\n\nand, as alternative relief, for quantum meruit.  The RCAB and the\r\n\nInstitute   filed  counterclaims  for   breach  of  contract  and\r\n\nnegligence.3\r\n\n     During the  course of  pre-trial  proceedings, the  district\r\n\ncourt  allowed Air Safety's account stated claim in the amount of\r\n\n$328,738  for  the five  schools owned  by  the RCAB,  but stayed\r\n\nenforcement  of   the  judgment  until  all   other  claims  were\r\n\nresolved.4   Following  a twelve-day trial,  the jury  found that\r\n\nneither the RCAB nor the  Institute had breached their contracts,\r\n\nbut that  Air Safety  had done  so.  It  found, however,  that no\r\n\nbreach of contract damages had been suffered by either defendant.\r\n\nThe jury  also  determined that  Air Safety  was responsible  for\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2 An \"account stated\" claim is one based on an\r\nacknowledgement of an existing liability for a specified amount,\r\nfrom which the law implies a promise to pay.  Rizkalla v.\r                                                                \r\nAbusamra, 187 N.E. 602, 603 (Mass. 1933).\r                  \r\n\n     3 Other causes of action not of significance here were\r\ndismissed.\r\n\n     4 Two aspects of the account stated portion of the case need\r\nclarification.  First, the proceeding affected only the RCAB and\r\nits five schools because the Institute had not yet been made a\r\nparty; Air Safety did not realize at the outset of the litigation\r\nthat the sixth school, Catholic Memorial High School, was owned\r\nby a separate entity.  It subsequently filed a First Amended and\r\nSupplemental Complaint adding the Institute as a defendant.\r\n     Second, the account stated award was reduced after trial,\r\nbased on amounts paid by the RCAB, to $62,249.97.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nnegligence damages, but  that it was  entitled to quantum  meruit\r\n\nrelief.  The net result was awards in favor of both defendants.5\r\n\n     Air  Safety filed a motion  for new trial  on the negligence\r\n\ndamages, claiming that  the amounts awarded were not supported by\r\n\nthe  evidence.  After  briefing and  oral argument,  the district\r\n\ncourt denied the motion in a margin order.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                      II. Negligence Damages\r                                                      \r\n\n     Air Safety  contends that  the jury's negligence  awards far\r\n\nexceed the record evidence of damage.  It maintains that the RCAB\r\n\nestablished  only  $21,672 in  damages,  while  the jury  awarded\r\n\n$235,000.  It further claims  that the Institute's proven damages\r\n\ntotaled only  $85,894, compared with  a jury  award of  $138,000.\r\n\nThe district court rejected Air Safety's request through a motion\r\n\nfor new trial to revisit the issue of negligence damages, and Air\r\n\nSafety now urges us to find that that ruling was erroneous.\r\n\n     Our review is narrow.  A district court's denial of a motion\r\n\nfor new  trial may be  reversed only for an  abuse of discretion.\r\n\nAhern  v. Scholz,  85 F.3d  774,  780 (1st  Cir. 1996).   \"`In  a\r                          \r\n\nchallenge  to a jury award,  [the appellate court]  is limited to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5 The judgment specified the following amounts, plus\r\ninterest:\r\n\n(a) quantum meruit from the RCAB to Air Safety: $87,000;\r\n(b) quantum meruit from the Institute to Air Safety: $63,100;\r\n(c) account stated from the RCAB to Air Safety: $62,249.97;\r\n(cont'd)\r\n\n(cont'd from page 3)\r\n(c) negligence damages to the RCAB from Air Safety: $235,500;\r\n(d) negligence damages to the Institute from Air Safety:\r\n$138,100.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nexamining whether  evidence in  the record supports  the verdict.\r\n\nIf  the jury  award has  a rational  basis in  evidence,  we must\r\n\naffirm it.'\"  Nydam v.

The  evidence  in  the  record fails  to\r\n\nsubstantiate the amounts imposed; even  a generous reading of the\r\n\ntestimony supports  only a small  portion of  the damages  beyond\r\n\nthose  conceded by Air Safety  on appeal.   We discuss separately\r\n\nthe results of our study with respect to each defendant.\r\n\n     The RCAB.  Air Safety contends that the record supports only\r                       \r\n\n$21,672  in damages for  the cost  of a  temporary boiler  at St.\r\n\nTheresa's school.    The  jury  awarded  $235,000.    Our  search\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nrevealed  three  additional  items   that  the  jury  could  have\r\n\nattributed  to Air  Safety's negligence:  extra clean-up  work by\r\n\ncustodians at St. Theresa's for which Rev. Helmick testified that\r\n\nhe \"paid  a lot;\" damage to  a clock and bell  system; and $7,400\r\n\nfor painting at St. William's school.   No amounts for either the\r\n\ncustodial  time or the clock  repair were presented  to the jury,\r\n\nalthough the  district court reported in a June 20, 1990 Order on\r\n\nthe  parties'  summary judgment  motions  that  those items  were\r\n\nalleged to cost $4,377 and $272.50, respectively.\r\n\n     We  think it  within  reason  for  the  jury  to  choose  to\r\n\ncompensate the RCAB for these asserted harms, despite the lack of\r\n\ntestimony on specific  dollar amounts.6  This is  not the sort of\r\n\nconjecture  barred by  Massachusetts law in  calculating damages,\r\n\nbut simply a matter of imprecision with respect to the amount for\r\n\na  specifically  identified  harm.   The  gap  challenged  by Air\r\n\nSafety,  however,  is  far  greater than  any  reasonable  figure\r\n\nattributable  to these additional harms.  We think an appropriate\r\n\nrecovery for them  would be the amounts  previously identified by\r\n\nthe RCAB, totaling $12,049.50.\r\n\n     The  RCAB points to one additional expense that the jury may\r\n\nhave attributed to Air  Safety: the $57,971.80 difference between\r\n\nthe  contract  price for  Mission  High School  and  the combined\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6 The record arguably is ambiguous as to whether Air Safety\r\ndid the necessary painting at St. William's.  On cross-\r\nexamination, Air Safety's witness, John Murphy, acknowledged that\r\nit was his company's responsibility to paint areas damaged by the\r\nasbestos removal process, but was unsure whether the work had\r\nbeen done.  He testified: \"I would have to look back.  I thought\r\nwe painted the floor.\"\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\namount of Air Safety's  account stated claim for Mission  and the\r\n\namount  paid  to  a new  contractor  to  complete  the work  left\r\n\nunfinished by Air Safety.  In other words, the RCAB contends that\r\n\nthe record showed that  it paid nearly $58,000 more  for asbestos\r\n\nremoval at  Mission  High School  than  the Air  Safety  contract\r\n\nprice.\r\n\n     We  have  two problems  with this  contention.   First, this\r\n\ndifferential amount  between the original contract  price and the\r\n\namount  actually expended  to  get the  job  done is  classically\r\n\nbreach  of contract  damages.    The  jury, however,  awarded  no\r\n\ndamages for the breach.7\r\n\n     Second, and  more significantly,  there was no  testimony or\r\n\nargument at trial concerning the $58,000.  In closing, the RCAB's\r\n\nattorney pointed out (consistent with Rev. Ryan's testimony) that\r\n\nit cost $105,000 to complete the contract work left unfinished by\r\n\nAir  Safety;  he  did  not  assert,  however,  that  that  amount\r\n\nrepresented  higher charges for work Air Safety had contracted to\r\n\nperform  for less.  Although the original contract amount and Air\r\n\nSafety's  account  stated  claim  both were  contained  in  trial\r\n\nexhibits,  there was  no basis for  the jurors  to have  made the\r\n\ncalculation now  offered  by  the  RCAB to  undergird  its  award\r\n\nwithout the crucial $58,000 figure having been explained to them.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7 We recognize that the district court explicitly told the\r\njurors that they may award damages \"only once for each harm,\" and\r\nthat the jury, for convenience, might have decided to classify\r\nall damages under the negligence rubric.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n     We  think it  likely that the  huge discrepancy  between the\r\n\ndamages actually  proven and  the amount  awarded stems  from the\r\n\njury's effort to compensate the RCAB and the parents and students\r\n\nattending the five affected schools for the trouble caused by Air\r\n\nSafety's negligent  work.  Beyond the  fact that the RCAB  has no\r\n\nclaim  to damages for discomfort  suffered by others  is the fact\r\n\nthat  this case  involves property  damage, not  personal injury.\r\n\nSee  generally Guaranty-First  Trust Co.  v. Textron,  622 N.E.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n597, 599 (Mass. 1993) (under common law, if injury to property is\r\n\nreasonably curable by  repairs, the expense  of repairs, if  less\r\n\nthan  diminished  market  value,  is the  measure  of  recovery);\r\n\nMichael B.  Bogdanow, Massachusetts  Tort Damages    9.03 (1995).\r                                                           \r\n\nIt goes without saying that a breach of contract or the negligent\r\n\nperformance of  a contractual  obligation will impose  burdens on\r\n\nthe  wronged party,  but compensation  is limited to  making that\r\n\nparty whole.8\r\n\n     Moreover, even if harm  in the nature of pain  and suffering\r\n\nwere  compensable in  this context,  such damages  would be  rank\r\n\nspeculation  here.    No  testimony  was  presented  of  specific\r\n\nintangible injuries  to the RCAB or its  officials as a result of\r\n\nAir Safety's conduct.

Our review turned up three additional items\r\n\nfor  which the  jury  properly could  have awarded  compensation:\r\n\nreplacing gymnasium  light frames, repairing a  broken piano leg,\r\n\nand replacing  paneling in two  rooms.  The  piano leg  and light\r\n\nframes were the  subject of  testimony by Rev.  Sheehan, and  the\r\n\nneed for repaneling was noted in  Exhibit 58, to which the jury's\r\n\nattention was directed.11\r\n\n     One more aspect of  the Institute's harm warrants attention.\r\n\nAir  Safety  concedes  responsibility  for the  $12,770  cost  of\r\n\nrepairing  the  gymnasium  floor  at Catholic  Memorial.    Kevin\r\n\nMurphy, whose company  did the floor  repair, testified that  the\r\n\nprocess  of  sanding  removes   wood,  and  the  gymnasium  floor\r\n\ntherefore  was, to  some  degree, in  worse  condition after  the\r\n\nrepair than before  the damage was done.  When  asked whether the\r\n\ndeficiency  would limit the use of  the floor in future years, he\r\n\nresponded that it would, \"considerably down the road.\"\r\n\n     We  believe  this  testimony  permitted the  jury  to  award\r\n\ndamages   for  the   premature  loss   of  use   of  the   floor.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10 These are: $12,570 for gym floor repairs; $966 for\r\ndamaged books; $432 for damaged computer cables; $296 for damaged\r\nphone wires; $1,630 for re-hanging curtains; $42,000 for wasted\r\nsalaries, and $28,000 for 14 weeks' lost bingo profits.\r\n\n     11 Although the paneling was not the subject of specific\r\ntestimony, and, unlike other items, no invoice for it was\r\nincluded in the record, see Exhibit 65, we think it reasonable\r                                     \r\nfor the jury to conclude, on the basis of Exhibit 58, that this\r\nwas damage for which Air Safety was responsible.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nUnfortunately, no value  was placed  on either this  harm or  the\r\n\nthree items of  damage listed above.   Without question, however,\r\n\nthe  approximately  $50,000 questioned  by  appellant  is far  in\r\n\nexcess  of the appropriate amount.   The evidence  was that a new\r\n\nfloor would have cost $50,000 to $60,000; from that knowledge, we\r\n\nare  confident that  compensation  for reducing  the old  floor's\r\n\nlifespan \"considerably down the road\" could not reasonably amount\r\n\nto more than  several thousand dollars.  The other  items, all of\r\n\nwhich appear to be  relatively minor, might generously add  up to\r\n\n$5,000.\r\n\n     Because our task is  to view the evidence in the  light most\r\n\nfavorable to the defendants,  see Velazquez, 996 F.2d at  428, we\r                                                     \r\n\nconclude  that the record supports a maximum award of $95,000 for\r\n\nall  damages  to  the  Institute.    Thus, unless  the  Institute\r\n\nconsents  to a remittitur of $43,000, Air Safety is entitled to a\r\n\npartial new trial.\r\n\n                  III.  Exclusion of Summaries12\r                                                        \r\n\n     Air Safety  sought to  introduce into  evidence a  number of\r\n\nsummary exhibits in support  of its claim for damages  or quantum\r\n\nmeruit relief.   Such exhibits  may be admissible  under Fed.  R.\r\n\nEvid. 1006, which provides:\r\n\n     The  contents  of voluminous  writings,  recordings, or\r\n     photographs  which cannot  conveniently be  examined in\r\n     court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12 Defendants' assertion that this issue was not preserved\r\nfor appeal is untenable.  See McLaurin v. Fischer, 768 F.2d 98,\r                                                           \r\n101 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"[T]he law is well settled that an appeal\r\nfrom a final judgment draws into question all prior non-final\r\nrulings and orders.\").\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n     or calculation.  The originals, or duplicates, shall be\r\n     made available for examination  or copying, or both, by\r\n     other parties at reasonable time  and place.  The court\r\n     may order that they be produced in court.\r\n\nAt issue  in this case is  the requirement in Rule  1006 that the\r\n\nmaterials  underlying   a  proposed  summary  exhibit   be  \"made\r\n\navailable\" to opposing parties.  After a two-hour, mid-trial voir\r\n\ndire  hearing in which each of Air Safety's proposed exhibits was\r\n\nconsidered individually, the court  excluded most of them because\r\n\nthe  documents from which the  summaries were drawn  had not been\r\n\nseen  by the  defendants  and were  unavailable  at the  time  of\r\n\ntrial.13\r\n\n     Air Safety asserts that  the court erred in  concluding that\r\n\nthe documents  were inadmissible  under Rule 1006.14   It  claims\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13 The supporting records at issue were those showing the\r\ncompany's overhead costs, and were located in its home office in\r\nIllinois.\r\n\n     14 A portion of Air Safety's argument seems based on an\r\nassumption that the district court improperly excluded the\r\nsummaries because they were not supported by evidence\r\nindependently established in the record.  Although the court at\r\none point indicated that it felt bound by the \"already-in-\r\nevidence\" requirement because of language to that effect in a\r\nFirst Circuit decision, United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110,\r                                                         \r\n1125-26 (1989), the court recognized that such an approach\r\nconflicted with the language of Rule 1006 giving the court\r\ndiscretion to order production in court of the documents\r                    \r\nunderlying a summary.  In any event, its decision ultimately was\r\nbased on a determination that the underlying documents had not\r\nbeen \"made available\" to the defendants, and it therefore did not\r\nneed to rule on whether a summary based on records that were\r                                                                      \r\navailable nonetheless must be excluded because they were\r\nunsupported in the record.\r\n     We note, for the sake of clarity, that Air Safety is correct\r\nthat the evidence underlying Rule 1006 summaries need not be\r\nadmitted into evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Bakker, 925\r                                                                     \r\nF.2d 728, 736-37 (4th Cir. 1991); 5 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret\r\nA.

Moreover,\r\n\ndefense counsel had signed  two pretrial memoranda without noting\r\n\nany  problems with Air  Safety's proposed  exhibits.   Air Safety\r\n\npoints out that  the documents  at issue easily  could have  been\r\n\nbrought  to  Boston for  defendants'  review had  there  been any\r\n\nindication  before the start  of trial that  defendants wanted to\r\n\nsee them.  Thus, Air Safety contends that the records  were \"made\r\n\navailable\"  within the meaning of  Rule 1006, and,  to the extent\r\n\nthat  they were  inaccessible at  trial, the  defendants were  to\r\n\nblame.    In  Air  Safety's view,  defendants'  trial  objections\r\n\nconstituted an ambush and should have been dismissed as untimely.\r\n\n     We cannot agree.   Although it appears that Air  Safety left\r\n\nthe overhead records in Illinois in the reasonable belief that no\r\n\none was interested in them, the record indicates that the company\r\n\nfell  short of meeting its  responsibility under Rule  1006.

Indeed, such an interpretation of the rule would negate\r\nits explicit grant of discretion to the trial judge to order the\r                                          \r\nunderlying documents produced in court.\r\n     Although in Nivica and a subsequent case relying on it,\r                                 \r\nUnited States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 740 (1st Cir. 1996), we\r                                 \r\nstated that Rule 1006 summaries must be based upon \"evidence\r\nindependently established in the record,\" the language in both\r\ncases was dictum because the relevant evidence there had been\r\nadmitted.  The requirement of prior admission actually applies to\r\na different sort of summary: one used as a jury aid to summarize\r\ncomplex or voluminous information already in the record.  See,\r                                                                       \r\ne.g., Bakker, 925 F.2d at 736-37; Weinstein's Evidence, at  \r                                                                \r\n1006[07], 1006-21.  In such cases, the summary is not itself\r\nevidence, Bakker, 925 F.2d at 736; Weinstein's Evidence, at  \r                                                                 \r\n1006[07], 1006-21-23, and the court's concern is to ensure that\r\nthe jury is not misled or confused by selective emphasis,\r\nWeinstein's Evidence, at   1006[07], 1006-21-22. \r                              \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nSafety  apparently  submitted  only  a skeletal  version  of  its\r\n\nsummary exhibits  in November  1992, perhaps  without designating\r\n\nthem as  summaries,15 and first provided  a comprehensive version\r\n\nin  June 1994.  In  the interim, all  parties had signed pretrial\r\n\nmemoranda that Air  Safety took as a sign that  defendants saw no\r\n\nproblems  with its  exhibits.   Defendants, however,  intended no\r\n\nsuch acquiesence and, once the nature of the damages exhibits was\r\n\nclear to them, sought to examine the underlying documents.\r\n\n     In concluding that  Air Safety  had failed to  lay a  proper\r\n\nfoundation for the summaries, the district court did not  dispute\r\n\nthat  the company  willingly would  have provided  the underlying\r\n\ndocuments  --  if requested  -- at  any  time during  the lengthy\r\n\npretrial period.   The  court ruled,  however, that such  passive\r\n\navailability did  not  meet Air  Safety's obligation.   Near  the\r\n\nconclusion of the voir dire hearing, it summarized its ruling: \r\n\n          I  don't think that it  is enough to  say that the\r\n     documents  have  been  available  or  could  have  been\r\n     available  or  were   available  when  they  were   not\r\n     identified as the  source for these summaries.  What is\r\n     important in  the discovery  context is one  thing, but\r\n     once  the discovery  comes down  to trial  and somebody\r\n     prepares a  summary, it  seems  to me  that the  person\r\n     providing  the summary  must say  now these  documents,\r\n     this summary  is a  summary of the  following documents\r\n     and here they are.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     15 Defendants claim that the exhibits provided in 1992,\r\ndescribed by Air Safety's counsel as \"prototypes,\" contained\r\nlittle information.  Indeed, the Institute's counsel described\r\nthem during the voir dire hearing as \"blanks\" that bore headings,\r\nbut no numbers and few subheadings.  Those preliminary documents\r\napparently are not in the appellate record.  The Institute's\r\ncounsel additionally asserts that the challenged exhibits were\r\nidentified as \"summaries\" for the first time at the final\r\npretrial conference on June 30; the next day, she sent a letter\r\nrequesting the underlying documents.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n     We think this is a correct and sensible construction of Rule\r\n\n1006's \"made  available\" requirement.   As the  court recognized,\r\n\nRule  1006 operates  independently  of the  discovery rules,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nWeinstein's  Evidence   1006[04], at  1006-16, and the failure to\r                               \r\n\nrequest or obtain the documents during discovery  does not negate\r\n\na party's  \"absolute right  to subsequent production  of material\r\n\nunder Rule 1006,  should that material  become incorporated in  a\r\n\nchart,  summary, or calculation.\"  Id.; see also Square Liner 360\r                                                                           \r\n\nDegrees,  Inc.  v.

It seemingly was the lack of such notice that gave rise to\r\n\nthe misunderstanding and confusion here. \r\n\n     Thus, to  satisfy the \"made available\"  requirement, a party\r\n\nseeking  to use  a  summary under  Rule  1006 must  identify  its\r\n\nexhibit as such, provide  a list or description of  the documents\r\n\nsupporting  the exhibit,  and state  when and  where they  may be\r\n\nreviewed.16  Here,  Air Safety merely assumed that the defendants\r\n\nwere  uninterested  in reviewing  the  overhead  records that  it\r\n\nbelieved were  the obvious -- though not explicitly identified --\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16 This assumes, of course, that the \"when\" and \"where\" are\r\nreasonably convenient for the opposing party.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nsource   for   its  proposed   damage   summaries.     In   these\r\n\ncircumstances, the  district court committed no  reversible error\r\n\nin  concluding  that  Air  Safety  had  not  satisfied the  \"made\r\n\navailable\" foundation requirement for admitting the exhibits.\r\n\n     Moreover,  we  doubt that  the  exclusion  of this  material\r\n\nsignificantly prejudiced Air Safety.   The district court allowed\r\n\nAir Safety to use the exhibits as chalks, and they were relied on\r\n\nheavily  during the testimony of its damages expert.  The expert,\r\n\nDennis Staats, testified to the specific amounts contained in the\r\n\nsummaries while the jury was able to peruse the chalks.  Although\r\n\nthe  district  court  repeatedly   reminded  the  jury  that  the\r\n\ntestimony -- not the summaries -- was the evidence, we think  the\r\n\njury  was more likely to have understood  this as a caution about\r\n\nthe  technicalities of litigation  than as a  suggestion that the\r\n\ncalculations  in the  chalks  were untrustworthy.   The  numbers,\r\n\nafter all,  also were contained  in the  testimony.  To  be sure,\r\n\nexclusion  of the summaries  from the jury  room required greater\r\n\nreliance  on memory.    Air Safety,  however,  makes no  specific\r\n\nargument -- even  a speculative  one -- showing  how the  quantum\r\n\nmeruit figures might have  been more accurate had the  jurors had\r\n\naccess to the excluded exhibits during deliberations.\r\n\n     We therefore affirm the court's judgment with respect to the\r\n\nquantum meruit award.\r\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\r                                                  \r\n\n     The district court's judgment on negligence  damages against\r\n\nAir Safety is vacated, and  the case is remanded for a  new trial\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\non  that   issue  unless  defendants  agree   to  remittiturs  of\r\n\n$201,278.50 for the RCAB  and $43,000 for the Institute.   Having\r\n\nfound  no error in the court's exclusion of Air Safety's proposed\r\n\ndamages summary exhibits,  we affirm the quantum meruit award for\r\n\nAir Safety as determined by the jury.\r\n\n     Affirmed  in part, vacated and remanded in part.

The defendants, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston (\"RCAB\") and the Christian Brothers Institute of Massachusetts, Inc.  (\"the Institute\"), filed counterclaims alleging damages arising from Air Safety's work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The bottom line after a series of rulings by the court and the jury was a net award in favor of each defendant.

We find no reversible error in the court's evidentiary ruling, but vacate and remand for a new trial on the negligence damages unless defendants accept a proposed remittitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case originated in Air Safety's successful bid to remove asbestos at six schools owned by the defendants.  The work began in the summer of 1988.  Conflicts arose over various aspects of the project, including the quality of Air Safety's performance and the defendants' obligations to pay for completed work.  Air Safety filed suit to obtain payment, asserting claims for breach of contract, for payments on an \"account stated,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and, as alternative relief, for quantum meruit.  The RCAB and the Institute filed counterclaims for breach of contract and negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of pre-trial proceedings, the district court allowed Air Safety's account stated claim in the amount of $328,738 for the five schools owned by the RCAB, but stayed enforcement of the judgment until all other claims were resolved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Following a twelve-day trial, the jury found that neither the RCAB nor the Institute had breached their contracts, but that Air Safety had done so.  It found, however, that no breach of contract damages had been suffered by either defendant.  The jury also determined that Air Safety was responsible for negligence damages, but that it was entitled to quantum meruit relief.  The net result was awards in favor of both defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety filed a motion for new trial on the negligence damages, claiming that the amounts awarded were not supported by the evidence.  After briefing and oral argument, the district court denied the motion in a margin order.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Negligence Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety contends that the jury's negligence awards far exceed the record evidence of damage.  It maintains that the RCAB established only $21,672 in damages, while the jury awarded $235,000.  It further claims that the Institute's proven damages totaled only $85,894, compared with a jury award of $138,000.  The district court rejected Air Safety's request through a motion for new trial to revisit the issue of negligence damages, and Air Safety now urges us to find that that ruling was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is narrow.  A district court's denial of a motion for new trial may be reversed only for an abuse of discretion.   Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 780 (1st Cir.1996).  \" 'In a challenge to a jury award, [the appellate court] is limited to examining whether evidence in the record supports the verdict.  If the jury award has a rational basis in evidence, we must affirm it.' \"   Nydam v. Lennerton, 948 F.2d 808, 810-11 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting  O'Brien v. Papa Gino's of America, Inc., 780 F.2d 1067, 1076 (1st Cir.1986)).  Under Massachusetts law, uncertainty as to the amount of damages does not bar their recovery, see Stuart v. Town of Brookline, 412 Mass. 251, 587 N.E.2d 1384, 1387 (1992), but a plaintiff \" 'must establish [its] claim upon a solid foundation in fact, and cannot recover when any essential element is left to conjecture, surmise or hypothesis,' \"  Snelling &amp; Snelling of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Wall, 345 Mass. 634, 189 N.E.2d 231, 232 (1963) (quoting  John Hetherington &amp; Sons, Ltd. v. William Firth Co., 210 Mass. 8, 95 N.E. 961, 964 (1911)).  See also Hendricks &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 217 (1st Cir.1991);   Puritan Medical Ctr., Inc. v. Cashman, 413 Mass. 167, 596 N.E.2d 1004, 1013 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the confines of our inquiry, our examination of the trial transcript requires us to conclude that the negligence awards cannot stand.  The evidence in the record fails to substantiate the amounts imposed;  even a generous reading of the testimony supports only a small portion of the damages beyond those conceded by Air Safety on appeal.  We discuss separately the results of our study with respect to each defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RCAB.   Air Safety contends that the record supports only $21,672 in damages for the cost of a temporary boiler at St. Theresa's school.  The jury awarded $235,000.  Our search revealed three additional items that the jury could have attributed to Air Safety's negligence:  extra clean-up work by custodians at St. Theresa's for which Rev. Helmick testified that he \"paid a lot;\" damage to a clock and bell system;  and $7,400 for painting at St. William's school.  No amounts for either the custodial time or the clock repair were presented to the jury, although the district court reported in a June 20, 1990 Order on the parties' summary judgment motions that those items were alleged to cost $4,377 and $272.50, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it within reason for the jury to choose to compensate the RCAB for these asserted harms, despite the lack of testimony on specific dollar amounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This is not the sort of conjecture barred by Massachusetts law in calculating damages, but simply a matter of imprecision with respect to the amount for a specifically identified harm.  The gap challenged by Air Safety, however, is far greater than any reasonable figure attributable to these additional harms.  We think an appropriate recovery for them would be the amounts previously identified by the RCAB, totaling $12,049.50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RCAB points to one additional expense that the jury may have attributed to Air Safety:  the $57,971.80 difference between the contract price for Mission High School and the combined amount of Air Safety's account stated claim for Mission and the amount paid to a new contractor to complete the work left unfinished by Air Safety.  In other words, the RCAB contends that the record showed that it paid nearly $58,000 more for asbestos removal at Mission High School than the Air Safety contract price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have two problems with this contention.  First, this differential amount between the original contract price and the amount actually expended to get the job done is classically breach of contract damages.  The jury, however, awarded no damages for the breach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more significantly, there was no testimony or argument at trial concerning the $58,000.  In closing, the RCAB's attorney pointed out (consistent with Rev. Ryan's testimony) that it cost $105,000 to complete the contract work left unfinished by Air Safety;  he did not assert, however, that that amount represented higher charges for work Air Safety had contracted to perform for less.  Although the original contract amount and Air Safety's account stated claim both were contained in trial exhibits, there was no basis for the jurors to have made the calculation now offered by the RCAB to undergird its award without the crucial $58,000 figure having been explained to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it likely that the huge discrepancy between the damages actually proven and the amount awarded stems from the jury's effort to compensate the RCAB and the parents and students attending the five affected schools for the trouble caused by Air Safety's negligent work.  Beyond the fact that the RCAB has no claim to damages for discomfort suffered by others is the fact that this case involves property damage, not personal injury.  See generally Guaranty-First Trust Co. v. Textron, 416 Mass. 332, 622 N.E.2d 597, 599 (1993) (under common law, if injury to property is reasonably curable by repairs, the expense of repairs, if less than diminished market value, is the measure of recovery);  Michael B. Bogdanow, Massachusetts Tort Damages &#167; 9.03 (1995).  It goes without saying that a breach of contract or the negligent performance of a contractual obligation will impose burdens on the wronged party, but compensation is limited to making that party whole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if harm in the nature of pain and suffering were compensable in this context, such damages would be rank speculation here.  No testimony was presented of specific intangible injuries to the RCAB or its officials as a result of Air Safety's conduct.  The general reference in counsel's closing argument to \"frustration,\" \"aggravation,\" and \"inconvenience\"--by-products of any tort or breach of contract--is far from the \"solid foundation in fact,\"  Snelling &amp; Snelling, 189 N.E.2d at 232, necessary to support an award of damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that, unless the RCAB agrees to a remittitur of $201,278.50--reducing its negligence damages to $33,721.50--Air Safety is entitled to a partial new trial.  See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 495 (appellate court has the option of selecting a reduced damages figure or remanding to district court to determine damages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Institute.   Air Safety acknowledges that the record supports an award of $85,894 in damages for a number of specific problems at Catholic Memorial High School,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> but contends that no other figures were provided to explain the additional $52,106 awarded by the jury.  Our review turned up three additional items for which the jury properly could have awarded compensation:  replacing gymnasium light frames, repairing a broken piano leg, and replacing paneling in two rooms.  The piano leg and light frames were the subject of testimony by Rev. Sheehan, and the need for repaneling was noted in Exhibit 58, to which the jury's attention was directed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One more aspect of the Institute's harm warrants attention.  Air Safety concedes responsibility for the $12,570 cost of repairing the gymnasium floor at Catholic Memorial.  Kevin Murphy, whose company did the floor repair, testified that the process of sanding removes wood, and the gymnasium floor therefore was, to some degree, in worse condition after the repair than before the damage was done.  When asked whether the deficiency would limit the use of the floor in future years, he responded that it would, \"considerably down the road.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe this testimony permitted the jury to award damages for the premature loss of use of the floor.  Unfortunately, no value was placed on either this harm or the three items of damage listed above.  Without question, however, the approximately $50,000 questioned by appellant is far in excess of the appropriate amount.  The evidence was that a new floor would have cost $50,000 to $60,000;  from that knowledge, we are confident that compensation for reducing the old floor's life-span \"considerably down the road\" could not reasonably amount to more than several thousand dollars.  The other items, all of which appear to be relatively minor, might generously add up to $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because our task is to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants, see Velazquez, 996 F.2d at 428, we conclude that the record supports a maximum award of $95,000 for all damages to the Institute.  Thus, unless the Institute consents to a remittitur of $43,000, Air Safety is entitled to a partial new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.  Exclusion of Summaries</p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">12</a>\n        <p></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety sought to introduce into evidence a number of summary exhibits in support of its claim for damages or quantum meruit relief.  Such exhibits may be admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 1006, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation.  The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at reasonable time and place.  The court may order that they be produced in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in this case is the requirement in Rule 1006 that the materials underlying a proposed summary exhibit be \"made available\" to opposing parties.  After a two-hour, mid-trial voir dire hearing in which each of Air Safety's proposed exhibits was considered individually, the court excluded most of them because the documents from which the summaries were drawn had not been seen by the defendants and were unavailable at the time of trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety asserts that the court erred in concluding that the documents were inadmissible under Rule 1006.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  It claims that it gave defendants copies of the challenged exhibits in November 1992, and that they never asked during the year and a half before trial to see the underlying material.  Moreover, defense counsel had signed two pretrial memoranda without noting any problems with Air Safety's proposed exhibits.  Air Safety points out that the documents at issue easily could have been brought to Boston for defendants' review had there been any indication before the start of trial that defendants wanted to see them.  Thus, Air Safety contends that the records were \"made available\" within the meaning of Rule 1006, and, to the extent that they were inaccessible at trial, the defendants were to blame.  In Air Safety's view, defendants' trial objections constituted an ambush and should have been dismissed as untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree.  Although it appears that Air Safety left the overhead records in Illinois in the reasonable belief that no one was interested in them, the record indicates that the company fell short of meeting its responsibility under Rule 1006.  Air Safety apparently submitted only a skeletal version of its summary exhibits in November 1992, perhaps without designating them as summaries,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and first provided a comprehensive version in June 1994.  In the interim, all parties had signed pretrial memoranda that Air Safety took as a sign that defendants saw no problems with its exhibits.  Defendants, however, intended no such acquiescence and, once the nature of the damages exhibits was clear to them, sought to examine the underlying documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Air Safety had failed to lay a proper foundation for the summaries, the district court did not dispute that the company willingly would have provided the underlying documents--if requested--at any time during the lengthy pretrial period.  The court ruled, however, that such passive availability did not meet Air Safety's obligation.  Near the conclusion of the voir dire hearing, it summarized its ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't think that it is enough to say that the documents have been available or could have been available or were available when they were not identified as the source for these summaries.  What is important in the discovery context is one thing, but once the discovery comes down to trial and somebody prepares a summary, it seems to me that the person providing the summary must say now these documents, this summary is a summary of the following documents and here they are.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this is a correct and sensible construction of Rule 1006's \"made available\" requirement.  As the court recognized, Rule 1006 operates independently of the discovery rules, see Weinstein's Evidence p 1006, at 1006-16, and the failure to request or obtain the documents during discovery does not negate a party's \"absolute right to subsequent production of material under Rule 1006, should that material become incorporated in a chart, summary, or calculation.\"  Id.;  see also Square Liner 360 Degrees, Inc. v. Chisum, 691 F.2d 362, 376 (8th Cir.1982).  Common sense dictates that this guaranteed access, designed to give the opponent the ability to check the summary's accuracy and prepare for cross-examination, see, e.g., Chisum, 691 F.2d at 376-77;   United States v. Smyth, 556 F.2d 1179, 1183 (5th Cir.1977);  Weinstein's Evidence p 1006, at 1006-15, must include unequivocal notice of the other party's intent to invoke Rule 1006.  It seemingly was the lack of such notice that gave rise to the misunderstanding and confusion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, to satisfy the \"made available\" requirement, a party seeking to use a summary under Rule 1006 must identify its exhibit as such, provide a list or description of the documents supporting the exhibit, and state when and where they may be reviewed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Here, Air Safety merely assumed that the defendants were uninterested in reviewing the overhead records that it believed were the obvious--though not explicitly identified--source for its proposed damage summaries.  In these circumstances, the district court committed no reversible error in concluding that Air Safety had not satisfied the \"made available\" foundation requirement for admitting the exhibits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we doubt that the exclusion of this material significantly prejudiced Air Safety.  The district court allowed Air Safety to use the exhibits as chalks, and they were relied on heavily during the testimony of its damages expert.  The expert, Dennis Staats, testified to the specific amounts contained in the summaries while the jury was able to peruse the chalks.  Although the district court repeatedly reminded the jury that the testimony--not the summaries--was the evidence, we think the jury was more likely to have understood this as a caution about the technicalities of litigation than as a suggestion that the calculations in the chalks were untrustworthy.  The numbers, after all, also were contained in the testimony.  To be sure, exclusion of the summaries from the jury room required greater reliance on memory.

Although we do not lightly reverse an award for economic loss, the inquiry in such a case is much more closely focused on whether there is adequate evidentiary support for the amount awarded.

Although the court at one point indicated that it felt bound by the \"already-in-evidence\" requirement because of language to that effect in a First Circuit decision,  United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1125-26 (1989), the court recognized that such an approach conflicted with the language of Rule 1006 giving the court discretion to order production in court of the documents underlying a summary.  In any event, its decision ultimately was based on a determination that the underlying documents had not been \"made available\" to the defendants, and it therefore did not need to rule on whether a summary based on records that were available nonetheless must be excluded because they were unsupported in the record</p>\n        <p>We note, for the sake of clarity, that Air Safety is correct that the evidence underlying Rule 1006 summaries need not be admitted into evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Bakker, 925 F.2d 728, 736-37 (4th Cir.1991);  5 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Evidence, p 1006, 1006-9 (1995);  Michael H. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 7031, at 959 (1992).  Indeed, such an interpretation of the rule would negate its explicit grant of discretion to the trial judge to order the underlying documents produced in court.</p>\n        <p>Although in  Nivica and a subsequent case relying on it,  United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 740 (1st Cir.1996), we stated that Rule 1006 summaries must be based upon \"evidence independently established in the record,\" the language in both cases was dictum because the relevant evidence there had been admitted.  The requirement of prior admission actually applies to a different sort of summary:  one used as a jury aid to summarize complex or voluminous information already in the record.  See, e.g., Bakker, 925 F.2d at 736-37;  Weinstein's Evidence, at p 1006, 1006-21.  In such cases, the summary is not itself evidence,  Bakker, 925 F.2d at 736;  Weinstein's Evidence, at p 1006, 1006-21-23, and the court's concern is to ensure that the jury is not misled or confused by selective emphasis, Weinstein's Evidence, at p 1006, 1006-21-22.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Defendants claim that the exhibits provided in 1992, described by Air Safety's counsel as \"prototypes,\" contained little information.

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case originated in Air Safety's successful bid to remove asbestos at six schools owned by the defendants.  The work began in the summer of 1988.  Conflicts arose over various aspects of the project, including the quality of Air Safety's performance and the defendants' obligations to pay for completed work.  Air Safety filed suit to obtain payment, asserting claims for breach of contract, for payments on an \"account stated,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and, as alternative relief, for quantum meruit.  The RCAB and the Institute filed counterclaims for breach of contract and negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of pre-trial proceedings, the district court allowed Air Safety's account stated claim in the amount of $328,738 for the five schools owned by the RCAB, but stayed enforcement of the judgment until all other claims were resolved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Following a twelve-day trial, the jury found that neither the RCAB nor the Institute had breached their contracts, but that Air Safety had done so.  It found, however, that no breach of contract damages had been suffered by either defendant.  The jury also determined that Air Safety was responsible for negligence damages, but that it was entitled to quantum meruit relief.  The net result was awards in favor of both defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety filed a motion for new trial on the negligence damages, claiming that the amounts awarded were not supported by the evidence.  After briefing and oral argument, the district court denied the motion in a margin order.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Negligence Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety contends that the jury's negligence awards far exceed the record evidence of damage.  It maintains that the RCAB established only $21,672 in damages, while the jury awarded $235,000.  It further claims that the Institute's proven damages totaled only $85,894, compared with a jury award of $138,000.  The district court rejected Air Safety's request through a motion for new trial to revisit the issue of negligence damages, and Air Safety now urges us to find that that ruling was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is narrow.

The evidence in the record fails to substantiate the amounts imposed;  even a generous reading of the testimony supports only a small portion of the damages beyond those conceded by Air Safety on appeal.  We discuss separately the results of our study with respect to each defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RCAB.   Air Safety contends that the record supports only $21,672 in damages for the cost of a temporary boiler at St. Theresa's school.  The jury awarded $235,000.  Our search revealed three additional items that the jury could have attributed to Air Safety's negligence:  extra clean-up work by custodians at St. Theresa's for which Rev. Helmick testified that he \"paid a lot;\" damage to a clock and bell system;  and $7,400 for painting at St. William's school.  No amounts for either the custodial time or the clock repair were presented to the jury, although the district court reported in a June 20, 1990 Order on the parties' summary judgment motions that those items were alleged to cost $4,377 and $272.50, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it within reason for the jury to choose to compensate the RCAB for these asserted harms, despite the lack of testimony on specific dollar amounts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This is not the sort of conjecture barred by Massachusetts law in calculating damages, but simply a matter of imprecision with respect to the amount for a specifically identified harm.  The gap challenged by Air Safety, however, is far greater than any reasonable figure attributable to these additional harms.  We think an appropriate recovery for them would be the amounts previously identified by the RCAB, totaling $12,049.50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The RCAB points to one additional expense that the jury may have attributed to Air Safety:  the $57,971.80 difference between the contract price for Mission High School and the combined amount of Air Safety's account stated claim for Mission and the amount paid to a new contractor to complete the work left unfinished by Air Safety.  In other words, the RCAB contends that the record showed that it paid nearly $58,000 more for asbestos removal at Mission High School than the Air Safety contract price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have two problems with this contention.  First, this differential amount between the original contract price and the amount actually expended to get the job done is classically breach of contract damages.  The jury, however, awarded no damages for the breach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more significantly, there was no testimony or argument at trial concerning the $58,000.  In closing, the RCAB's attorney pointed out (consistent with Rev. Ryan's testimony) that it cost $105,000 to complete the contract work left unfinished by Air Safety;  he did not assert, however, that that amount represented higher charges for work Air Safety had contracted to perform for less.  Although the original contract amount and Air Safety's account stated claim both were contained in trial exhibits, there was no basis for the jurors to have made the calculation now offered by the RCAB to undergird its award without the crucial $58,000 figure having been explained to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it likely that the huge discrepancy between the damages actually proven and the amount awarded stems from the jury's effort to compensate the RCAB and the parents and students attending the five affected schools for the trouble caused by Air Safety's negligent work.  Beyond the fact that the RCAB has no claim to damages for discomfort suffered by others is the fact that this case involves property damage, not personal injury.

Textron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101629\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101629/guaranty-first-trust-co-v-textron/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101629\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101629/guaranty-first-trust-co-v-textron/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 599 (1993) (under common law, if injury to property is reasonably curable by repairs, the expense of repairs, if less than diminished market value, is the measure of recovery);  Michael B. Bogdanow, Massachusetts Tort Damages &#167; 9.03 (1995).  It goes without saying that a breach of contract or the negligent performance of a contractual obligation will impose burdens on the wronged party, but compensation is limited to making that party whole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if harm in the nature of pain and suffering were compensable in this context, such damages would be rank speculation here.  No testimony was presented of specific intangible injuries to the RCAB or its officials as a result of Air Safety's conduct.  The general reference in counsel's closing argument to \"frustration,\" \"aggravation,\" and \"inconvenience\"--by-products of any tort or breach of contract--is far from the \"solid foundation in fact,\"  Snelling &amp; Snelling, 189 N.E.2d at 232, necessary to support an award of damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that, unless the RCAB agrees to a remittitur of $201,278.50--reducing its negligence damages to $33,721.50--Air Safety is entitled to a partial new trial.  See Anthony, 17 F.3d at 495 (appellate court has the option of selecting a reduced damages figure or remanding to district court to determine damages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Institute.   Air Safety acknowledges that the record supports an award of $85,894 in damages for a number of specific problems at Catholic Memorial High School,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> but contends that no other figures were provided to explain the additional $52,106 awarded by the jury.  Our review turned up three additional items for which the jury properly could have awarded compensation:  replacing gymnasium light frames, repairing a broken piano leg, and replacing paneling in two rooms.  The piano leg and light frames were the subject of testimony by Rev. Sheehan, and the need for repaneling was noted in Exhibit 58, to which the jury's attention was directed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One more aspect of the Institute's harm warrants attention.  Air Safety concedes responsibility for the $12,570 cost of repairing the gymnasium floor at Catholic Memorial.  Kevin Murphy, whose company did the floor repair, testified that the process of sanding removes wood, and the gymnasium floor therefore was, to some degree, in worse condition after the repair than before the damage was done.  When asked whether the deficiency would limit the use of the floor in future years, he responded that it would, \"considerably down the road.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe this testimony permitted the jury to award damages for the premature loss of use of the floor.  Unfortunately, no value was placed on either this harm or the three items of damage listed above.  Without question, however, the approximately $50,000 questioned by appellant is far in excess of the appropriate amount.  The evidence was that a new floor would have cost $50,000 to $60,000;  from that knowledge, we are confident that compensation for reducing the old floor's life-span \"considerably down the road\" could not reasonably amount to more than several thousand dollars.  The other items, all of which appear to be relatively minor, might generously add up to $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because our task is to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants, see Velazquez, 996 F.2d at 428, we conclude that the record supports a maximum award of $95,000 for all damages to the Institute.  Thus, unless the Institute consents to a remittitur of $43,000, Air Safety is entitled to a partial new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.  Exclusion of Summaries</p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">12</a>\n        <p></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety sought to introduce into evidence a number of summary exhibits in support of its claim for damages or quantum meruit relief.  Such exhibits may be admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 1006, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation.  The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at reasonable time and place.  The court may order that they be produced in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in this case is the requirement in Rule 1006 that the materials underlying a proposed summary exhibit be \"made available\" to opposing parties.  After a two-hour, mid-trial voir dire hearing in which each of Air Safety's proposed exhibits was considered individually, the court excluded most of them because the documents from which the summaries were drawn had not been seen by the defendants and were unavailable at the time of trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Air Safety asserts that the court erred in concluding that the documents were inadmissible under Rule 1006.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  It claims that it gave defendants copies of the challenged exhibits in November 1992, and that they never asked during the year and a half before trial to see the underlying material.  Moreover, defense counsel had signed two pretrial memoranda without noting any problems with Air Safety's proposed exhibits.  Air Safety points out that the documents at issue easily could have been brought to Boston for defendants' review had there been any indication before the start of trial that defendants wanted to see them.  Thus, Air Safety contends that the records were \"made available\" within the meaning of Rule 1006, and, to the extent that they were inaccessible at trial, the defendants were to blame.  In Air Safety's view, defendants' trial objections constituted an ambush and should have been dismissed as untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree.  Although it appears that Air Safety left the overhead records in Illinois in the reasonable belief that no one was interested in them, the record indicates that the company fell short of meeting its responsibility under Rule 1006.  Air Safety apparently submitted only a skeletal version of its summary exhibits in November 1992, perhaps without designating them as summaries,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and first provided a comprehensive version in June 1994.  In the interim, all parties had signed pretrial memoranda that Air Safety took as a sign that defendants saw no problems with its exhibits.  Defendants, however, intended no such acquiescence and, once the nature of the damages exhibits was clear to them, sought to examine the underlying documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Air Safety had failed to lay a proper foundation for the summaries, the district court did not dispute that the company willingly would have provided the underlying documents--if requested--at any time during the lengthy pretrial period.  The court ruled, however, that such passive availability did not meet Air Safety's obligation.  Near the conclusion of the voir dire hearing, it summarized its ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't think that it is enough to say that the documents have been available or could have been available or were available when they were not identified as the source for these summaries.  What is important in the discovery context is one thing, but once the discovery comes down to trial and somebody prepares a summary, it seems to me that the person providing the summary must say now these documents, this summary is a summary of the following documents and here they are.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this is a correct and sensible construction of Rule 1006's \"made available\" requirement.  As the court recognized, Rule 1006 operates independently of the discovery rules, see Weinstein's Evidence p 1006, at 1006-16, and the failure to request or obtain the documents during discovery does not negate a party's \"absolute right to subsequent production of material under Rule 1006, should that material become incorporated in a chart, summary, or calculation.\"  Id.;  see also Square Liner 360 Degrees, Inc. v. Chisum, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409693\"><a href=\"/opinion/409693/square-liner-360o-inc-appellantcross-v-finis-lavell-chisum-and-chief/\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 376 (8th Cir.1982).  Common sense dictates that this guaranteed access, designed to give the opponent the ability to check the summary's accuracy and prepare for cross-examination, see, e.g., Chisum, 691 F.2d at 376-77;   United States v. Smyth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346660\"><a href=\"/opinion/346660/corrected-opinion-united-states-of-america-v-lewis-miller-smyth-iii-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span>, 1183 (5th Cir.1977);  Weinstein's Evidence p 1006, at 1006-15, must include unequivocal notice of the other party's intent to invoke Rule 1006.  It seemingly was the lack of such notice that gave rise to the misunderstanding and confusion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, to satisfy the \"made available\" requirement, a party seeking to use a summary under Rule 1006 must identify its exhibit as such, provide a list or description of the documents supporting the exhibit, and state when and where they may be reviewed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Here, Air Safety merely assumed that the defendants were uninterested in reviewing the overhead records that it believed were the obvious--though not explicitly identified--source for its proposed damage summaries.  In these circumstances, the district court committed no reversible error in concluding that Air Safety had not satisfied the \"made available\" foundation requirement for admitting the exhibits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we doubt that the exclusion of this material significantly prejudiced Air Safety.  The district court allowed Air Safety to use the exhibits as chalks, and they were relied on heavily during the testimony of its damages expert.  The expert, Dennis Staats, testified to the specific amounts contained in the summaries while the jury was able to peruse the chalks.  Although the district court repeatedly reminded the jury that the testimony--not the summaries--was the evidence, we think the jury was more likely to have understood this as a caution about the technicalities of litigation than as a suggestion that the calculations in the chalks were untrustworthy.  The numbers, after all, also were contained in the testimony.  To be sure, exclusion of the summaries from the jury room required greater reliance on memory.  Air Safety, however, makes no specific argument--even a speculative one--showing how the quantum meruit figures might have been more accurate had the jurors had access to the excluded exhibits during deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the court's judgment with respect to the quantum meruit award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment on negligence damages against Air Safety is vacated, and the case is remanded for a new trial on that issue unless defendants agree to remittiturs of $201,278.50 for the RCAB and $43,000 for the Institute.

Nivica, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531008\"><a href=\"/opinion/531008/united-states-v-gjon-n-nivica-united-states-of-america-v-mark-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1125-26 (1989), the court recognized that such an approach conflicted with the language of Rule 1006 giving the court discretion to order production in court of the documents underlying a summary.  In any event, its decision ultimately was based on a determination that the underlying documents had not been \"made available\" to the defendants, and it therefore did not need to rule on whether a summary based on records that were available nonetheless must be excluded because they were unsupported in the record</p>\n        <p>We note, for the sake of clarity, that Air Safety is correct that the evidence underlying Rule 1006 summaries need not be admitted into evidence.  See, e.g., United States v.

Indeed, such an interpretation of the rule would negate its explicit grant of discretion to the trial judge to order the underlying documents produced in court.</p>\n        <p>Although in  Nivica and a subsequent case relying on it,  United States v. Sawyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196785\"><a href=\"/opinion/196785/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 740 (1st Cir.1996), we stated that Rule 1006 summaries must be based upon \"evidence independently established in the record,\" the language in both cases was dictum because the relevant evidence there had been admitted.  The requirement of prior admission actually applies to a different sort of summary:  one used as a jury aid to summarize complex or voluminous information already in the record.  See, e.g., Bakker, 925 F.2d at 736-37;  Weinstein's Evidence, at p 1006, 1006-21.  In such cases, the summary is not itself evidence,  Bakker, 925 F.2d at 736;  Weinstein's Evidence, at p 1006, 1006-21-23, and the court's concern is to ensure that the jury is not misled or confused by selective emphasis, Weinstein's Evidence, at p 1006, 1006-21-22.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Defendants claim that the exhibits provided in 1992, described by Air Safety's counsel as \"prototypes,\" contained little information.  Indeed, the Institute's counsel described them during the voir dire hearing as \"blanks\" that bore headings, but no numbers and few subheadings.  Those preliminary documents apparently are not in the appellate record.  The Institute's counsel additionally asserts that the challenged exhibits were identified as \"summaries\" for the first time at the final pretrial conference on June 30;  the next day, she sent a letter requesting the underlying documents</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> This assumes, of course, that the \"when\" and \"where\" are reasonably convenient for the opposing party</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
