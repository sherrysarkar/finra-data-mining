This is an appeal from the\n\ndistrict    court's    dismissal,        for      lack    of   subject      matter\n\njurisdiction, of an action allegedly arising under 47 U.S.C. §\n\n332(c)(7)(B)(iv) (the Telecommunications Act of 1996).                     Because\n\nthere is no longer an actual case or controversy between the\n\nappellants and any of the defendants, we dismiss the appeal as\n\nmoot.   Moreover, because of the frivolous nature of this appeal,\n\nwe order counsel for appellants to show cause why sanctions\n\nshould not be imposed.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           On November 30, 1999, Donald B. Hyde applied to the\n\nPlanning Board of the Town of Stow [the \"Board\"] for a permit to\n\nconstruct a wireless communications facility at 29 Wheeler Road\n\nin Stow, Massachusetts.          On February 7, 2000, AT&T Wireless\n\nServices   [AT&T]     applied    for     a   similar      permit    for    another\n\nproperty in the Town of Stow at 23 Hillcrest Avenue.                      On May 4,\n\n2000, the Board voted to deny the applications.                    The Board did\n\nnot,    however,    forward     notice       of   its    disapproval       of   the\n\napplications to the Town Clerk.              According to appellants, that\n\nfailure contravened the Board's rules.                   On June 6, 2000, the\n\nBoard voted to let Hyde and AT&T withdraw their applications\n\nwithout prejudice.      Hyde and AT&T then reapplied to the Board\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffor permits for the same sites, and the Board noticed public\n\nhearings on their refiled applications.\n\n                 Thomas W. Maher, Jr. and Valerie E. Calabria-Maher,\n\nresidents        of   Stow,   filed     a   complaint    in     the   United    States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts against Hyde,\n\nAT&T, the Board and its individual members.                           The complaint\n\nstated that the Mahers were \"aggrieved\" by the refusal of the\n\nBoard to file notice of its disapproval of the original Hyde and\n\nAT&T       applications       with    the     Town     Clerk;    by    the     Board's\n\nconsideration of the refiled applications within two years of\n\nits denial of the same applications; and by the Board's possible\n\n\"constructive approval\" of the applications.1 The Mahers claimed\n\nthat       the    Board's     actions       violated    state     laws   and     local\n\nregulations.          They requested a declaration that the Board lacked\n\nthe authority to let Hyde and AT&T withdraw without prejudice\n\nand then refile their (denied) applications, pursuant to Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 231A, § 1 (authorizing courts to make \"binding\n\ndeclarations of right, duty, status and other legal relations\");\n\nrelief in the nature of certiorari to correct substantial errors\n\nof law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, § 4 (authorizing actions\n\nfor    such       relief);     and    injunctive       relief     barring      further\n\n\n       1Exactly why the Mahers were \"aggrieved\" is not apparent\nfrom the record, which indicates nothing about them except their\nnames and their address.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fproceedings on the refiled applications except in conformity\n\nwith          Mass.          Gen.         Laws      ch.         40A,        §           16\n\n(\"No . . . application . . . which has been unfavorably and\n\nfinally    acted      upon    by    the   special      permit    granting       .   .    .\n\nauthority shall be acted favorably upon within two years after\n\nthe    date    of     final    unfavorable        action    unless      [enumerated\n\nconditions are met]\").             Although the complaint did not allege a\n\nspecific violation of federal law, it asserted: \"Jurisdiction in\n\nthis action arises under 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(4) [sic] [The\n\nTelecommunications Act of 1996], 28 U.S.C. § 1331 [federal\n\nquestion], and 28 U.S.C. § 1367 [supplemental jurisdiction over\n\nstate law claims]\" (brackets in original).\n\n              On November 14, 2000, the district court granted AT&T's\n\nmotion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\n\nconcluding      that    \"plaintiffs        fail   to    allege    any   cognizable\n\nviolation of the Telecommunications Act, or any other federal\n\nlaw, on the face of their complaint.\"2                 The Mahers filed a notice\n\nof appeal on December 14, 2000.\n\n              Subsequent to the dismissal of the Mahers' action, the\n\nBoard denied both Hyde's and AT&T's refiled permit applications,\n\n\n       2Although only AT&T had filed a motion to dismiss, the\ndistrict court also dismissed the complaint against defendants\nHyde and the Board.   The Board raised lack of subject matter\njurisdiction as an affirmative defense in its answer to the\ncomplaint; Hyde has made no appearance in this case.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fand Hyde and AT&T challenged those denials in the district court\n\npursuant to the Telecommunications Act.3            On July 12, 2001,\n\npursuant    to   a   settlement   between   the   Board   and   AT&T,   the\n\ndistrict court ordered that the Board issue a permit to AT&T for\n\nthe 23 Hillcrest Avenue property.           Hyde's action against the\n\nBoard concerning the 29 Wheeler Road property is still pending.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Federal courts do not issue advisory opinions.          There\n\nmust be an actual controversy between the parties requiring\n\nresolution:\n\n            The   Constitution   confines  the   federal\n            courts' jurisdiction to those claims which\n            embody actual \"cases\" or \"controversies.\"\n            U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.       This\n            requirement must be satisfied at each and\n            every stage of the litigation. When a case\n            is moot – that is, when the issues presented\n            are no longer live or when the parties lack\n            a legally cognizable interest in the outcome\n            – a case or controversy ceases to exist, and\n            dismissal of the action is compulsory.\n\nCruz v. Farquharson, 252 F.3d 530, 533 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n    3  Although the record discloses neither the Board's denial\nof Hyde's refiled application nor his challenge to that denial\nin the district court, appellants' counsel called these events\nto our attention at oral argument, and we take judicial notice\nof them. See Hyde v. Town of Stow, No. 01-CV-10762-PBS (D. Mass\nfiled May 4, 2001). See Kowalski v. Gagne, 914 F.2d 299, 305\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is well-accepted that federal courts may\ntake judicial notice of proceedings in other courts if those\nproceedings have relevance to the matters at hand.\").\n\n                                   -6-\n\f         Although   the    brief    he   filed   suggests   otherwise,\n\nappellants' counsel stated at oral argument that 23 Hillcrest\n\nAvenue is \"a property that's not at issue in the case that's\n\nhere this morning.\"4      Counsel explained that \"my clients are\n\nchallenging the case relating to the Hyde property . . . at 29\n\nWheeler Road,\" and even asserted (wrongly) that \"my clients have\n\nraised no issue in this court or any other court with respect to\n\n[23] Hillcrest [Avenue].\"    As the Mahers, through counsel, have\n\nnow expressly disavowed any interest in the 23 Hillcrest Avenue\n\nproperty, the appeal described in their papers of the Board's\n\nactions concerning AT&T and 23 Hillcrest Avenue is necessarily\n\nmoot.\n\n         The 29 Wheeler Road appeal is also moot.           The Mahers'\n\ncomplaint challenges the Board's decision to let Hyde withdraw\n\nwithout prejudice his initial (denied) application, and its\n\nsubsequent decision to let Hyde file a new application.          Since\n\nthe Mahers commenced their action, however, the Board has denied\n\nHyde's refiled application.        Because this denial is the very\n\noutcome the Mahers sought in court, there is no longer a live\n\ncontroversy between the Mahers and either Hyde or the Board\n\n\n\n    4   Appellants' brief, which is a challenge to decipher,\nrefers several times to AT&T's permit application, and nowhere\nindicates that the district court's dismissal of the claims vis-\na-vis AT&T and 23 Hillcrest Avenue is not being appealed.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fconcerning the Board's actions.                  We therefore dismiss this\n\nappeal as moot.          See Cruz, 252 F.3d at 533.\n\n                                       III.\n\n               Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides that\n\n\"[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous,\n\nit may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court\n\nand reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and\n\nsingle or double costs to the appellee.\"5                Rule 38 permits the\n\naward of attorney's fees as \"just damages.\"                Cronin v. Town of\n\nAmesbury, 81 F.3d 257, 261 (1st Cir. 1996).                We have held that\n\nwhere \"[t]he bulk of the blame for the frivolous appeal rests\n\nwith       appellants'     attorney,\"       it   is   appropriate    to   impose\n\nsanctions on the attorney personally.                  Id. at 262; see also\n\nHilmon Co. (V.I.) Inc. v. Hyatt Int'l, 899 F.2d 250, 254 (3rd\n\nCir.       1990)    (imposing   Rule   38   sanctions    against    appellant's\n\ncounsel).          Evidence of bad faith is not required to support Rule\n\n38 sanctions.          See Pimentel v. Jacobsen Fishing Co. Inc., 102\n\nF.3d 638, 641 n.2 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n               We have observed that \"[t]he purpose of [Rule 38]\n\n\n\n       5Sanctions are also available under 28 U.S.C. § 1927,\nwhich provides that \"[a]ny attorney . . . who so multiplies the\nproceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be\nrequired by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,\nexpenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of\nsuch conduct.\"\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpenalties is to discourage litigants from wasting the time and\n\nmonetary resources of both their opponents and the nation's\n\njudicial     system    with      legal    arguments        that   do     not    merit\n\nconsideration.\"        E.H. Ashley & Co., Inc. v. Wells Fargo Alarm\n\nServices, 907 F.2d 1274, 1280 (1st Cir. 1990).                     It is hard to\n\nimagine a clearer case of an appeal unworthy of consideration.\n\nThe Mahers submitted a brief to us that purports to appeal the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of their complaint which named AT&T\n\nas a defendant.        The brief repeatedly references AT&T's permit\n\napplication without disclosing that the 23 Hillcrest Avenue\n\nproperty is outside the scope of the appeal.                  At oral argument,\n\nhowever, counsel indicated that 23 Hillcrest Avenue was \"not at\n\nissue in the case that's here this morning.\"                  That being so, an\n\nappeal encompassing the 23 Hillcrest Avenue proceedings should\n\nnot have been filed.\n\n             Moreover,      at   oral    argument,     counsel         revealed     an\n\nunfamiliarity with his own complaint and brief by suggesting\n\nthat AT&T's application for a permit for the 23 Hillcrest Avenue\n\nproperty was never at issue in this litigation.                     He said that\n\n\"as far as I know, no action was pursued with respect to the\n\nHillcrest     Avenue     property.\"            He   also    declared,          equally\n\ninexplicably, that the Mahers \"have raised no issue in this\n\ncourt   or    any   other     court     with    respect     to    [23]    Hillcrest\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f[Avenue].\"       Yet his own complaint named AT&T as a defendant and\n\nmade parallel allegations concerning the 23 Hillcrest Avenue and\n\n29 Wheeler Road properties.6\n\n           The appeal is also frivolous as to Hyde's 29 Wheeler\n\nRoad property.      Although an actual controversy may have existed\n\nwhen the Mahers filed their notice of appeal in December 2000,\n\nthe appeal became moot in April 2001 – five months before oral\n\nargument     –    when   the   Board    denied   Hyde's   refiled   permit\n\napplication.       Although the Mahers expressed concern at oral\n\nargument that Hyde might emerge from his litigation against the\n\n\n    6   Although prefaced with yet another denial, counsel did\nacknowledge at one point the contents of his papers:\n\n    THE COURT: I thought 23 Hillcrest Avenue was a\n    property involved in both of these proceedings.     Is\n    that correct or not correct?\n    MR. COLLINS: That is not my understanding, your Honor.\n    My understanding is that my client brought an\n    attack . . . on the withdrawal issue, I think fairly\n    said alleging improper withdrawal by the Planning\n    Board and I think with respect to both properties, my\n    recollection   is   the    complaint   mentions   both\n    properties.\n\nThis convoluted acknowledgment of the obvious does not, of\ncourse, excuse counsel's multiple assertions to the contrary,\nnor the uncertainty about the content of his own complaint\nnaming AT&T as a defendant. The complaint repeatedly references\nAT&T, and includes allegations such as the following:\n\n    31.   Plaintiffs are aggrieved by the acceptance and\n    notice of public hearing by the Stow Planning Board on\n    the refiled AT&T application for a special permit [for\n    23 Hillcrest Avenue] within two years of its\n    disapproval of the same application.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fBoard with a permit, as did AT&T, this is mere speculation.            The\n\nMahers   got   what   they   wanted   when   the   Board   denied   Hyde's\n\napplication.    If the Mahers were concerned that their interests\n\ncould be adversely affected by Hyde's action against the Board,\n\nthey could have petitioned to intervene in that litigation.\n\nTheir failure to withdraw the 29 Wheeler Road appeal once it had\n\nbecome moot is thus an additional ground for our conclusion that\n\nthe appeal is frivolous.\n\n          Before sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal may be\n\nimposed sua sponte, Rule 38 requires \"notice from the court and\n\nreasonable opportunity to respond.\" See In re JC's East, Inc.,\n\n84 F.3d 527, 532 (2d Cir. 1996) (ordering appellants and their\n\nattorney to show cause within thirty days why they should not be\n\nsanctioned); McDonough v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., 48 F.3d\n\n256, 259 (7th Cir. 1995) (granting appellant fifteen days to\n\nexplain why sanctions were not warranted). We therefore order\n\nappellants' counsel to show cause, within fourteen days, why he\n\nshould not be sanctioned by payment of costs and fees for having\n\nfiled a frivolous appeal.       See    Fed. R. App. P. 38.      Appellee\n\nshould submit an affidavit within fourteen days itemizing the\n\nreasonable costs and fees of this appeal.\n\n          The appeal is      dismissed as moot. Appellants' counsel\nhas fourteen days from       the filing of this decision to file a\nmemorandum explaining        why sanctions are not warranted for\npursuing a frivolous         appeal.    Appellee should submit an\n\n                                  -11-\n\faffidavit within fourteen days itemizing the reasonable costs\nand fees of this appeal.    Appellants' counsel will then have\nseven days to respond to appellee's submission.     Appellants'\ncounsel must deliver to his clients a copy of this opinion, and\nprovide proof thereof.\n\n\n\n\n                             -12-\n\f",

They requested a declaration that the Board lacked the authority to let Hyde and AT&amp;T withdraw without prejudice and then refile their (denied) applications, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, &#167; 1 (authorizing courts to make \"binding declarations of right, duty, status and other legal relations\"); relief in the nature of certiorari to correct substantial errors of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, &#167; 4 (authorizing actions for such relief); and injunctive relief barring further proceedings on the refiled applications except in conformity with Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 16 (\"No . . . application . . . which has been unfavorably and finally acted upon by the special permit granting . . . authority shall be acted favorably upon within two years after the date of final unfavorable action unless [enumerated conditions are met]\"). Although the complaint did not allege a specific violation of federal law, it asserted: \"Jurisdiction in this action arises under 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(4) [sic] [The Telecommunications Act of 1996], 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 [federal question], and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 [supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims]\" (brackets in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 14, 2000, the district court granted AT&amp;T's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that \"plaintiffs fail to allege any cognizable violation of the Telecommunications Act, or any other federal law, on the face of their complaint.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Mahers filed a notice of appeal on December 14, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to the dismissal of the Mahers' action, the Board denied both Hyde's and AT&amp;T's refiled permit applications, and Hyde and AT&amp;T challenged those denials in the district court pursuant to the Telecommunications Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On July 12, 2001, pursuant to a settlement between the Board and AT&amp;T, the district court ordered that the Board issue a permit to AT&amp;T for the 23 Hillcrest Avenue property.

The Mahers submitted a brief to us that purports to appeal the district court's dismissal of their complaint which named AT&amp;T as a defendant. The brief repeatedly references AT&amp;T's permit application without disclosing that the 23 Hillcrest Avenue property is outside the scope of the appeal. At oral argument, however, counsel indicated that 23 Hillcrest Avenue was \"not at issue in the case that's here this morning.\" That being so, an appeal encompassing the 23 Hillcrest Avenue proceedings should not have been filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, at oral argument, counsel revealed an unfamiliarity with his own complaint and brief by suggesting that AT&amp;T's application for a permit for the 23 Hillcrest Avenue property was never at issue in this litigation. He said that \"as far as I know, no action was pursued with respect to the Hillcrest Avenue property.\" He also declared, equally inexplicably, that the Mahers \"have raised no issue in this court or any other court with respect to [23] Hillcrest [Avenue].\" Yet his own complaint named AT&amp;T as a defendant and made parallel allegations concerning the 23 Hillcrest Avenue and 29 Wheeler Road properties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is also frivolous as to Hyde's 29 Wheeler Road property. Although an actual controversy may have existed when the Mahers filed their notice of appeal in December 2000, the appeal became moot in April 2001 - five months before oral argument - when the Board denied Hyde's refiled permit application. Although the Mahers expressed concern at oral argument that Hyde might emerge from his litigation against the Board with a permit, as did AT&amp;T, this is mere speculation. The Mahers got what they wanted when the Board denied Hyde's application. If the Mahers were concerned that their interests could be adversely affected by Hyde's action against the Board, they could have petitioned to intervene in that litigation. Their failure to withdraw the 29 Wheeler Road appeal once it had become moot is thus an additional ground for our conclusion that the appeal is frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal may be imposed sua sponte, Rule 38 requires \"notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond.\" See In re JC's East, Inc., 84 F.3d 527, 532 (2d Cir. 1996) (ordering appellants and their attorney to show cause within thirty days why they should not be sanctioned); McDonough v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., 48 F.3d 256, 259 (7th Cir. 1995) (granting appellant fifteen days to explain why sanctions were not warranted). We therefore order appellants' counsel to show cause, within fourteen days, why he should not be sanctioned by payment of costs and fees for having filed a frivolous appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 38.

On February 7, 2000, AT&amp;T Wireless Services [AT&amp;T] applied for a similar permit for another property in the Town of Stow at 23 Hillcrest Avenue. On May 4, 2000, the Board voted to deny the applications. The Board did not, however, forward notice of its disapproval of the applications to the Town Clerk. According to appellants, that failure contravened the Board's rules. On June 6, 2000, the Board voted to let Hyde and AT&amp;T withdraw their applications without prejudice.

He said that \"as far as I know, no action was pursued with respect to the Hillcrest Avenue property.\" He also declared, equally inexplicably, that the Mahers \"have raised no issue in this court or any other court with respect to [23] Hillcrest [Avenue].\" Yet his own complaint named AT&amp;T as a defendant and made parallel allegations concerning the 23 Hillcrest Avenue and 29 Wheeler Road properties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is also frivolous as to Hyde's 29 Wheeler Road property. Although an actual controversy may have existed when the Mahers filed their notice of appeal in December 2000, the appeal became moot in April 2001 - five months before oral argument - when the Board denied Hyde's refiled permit application. Although the Mahers expressed concern at oral argument that Hyde might emerge from his litigation against the Board with a permit, as did AT&amp;T, this is mere speculation. The Mahers got what they wanted when the Board denied Hyde's application. If the Mahers were concerned that their interests could be adversely affected by Hyde's action against the Board, they could have petitioned to intervene in that litigation. Their failure to withdraw the 29 Wheeler Road appeal once it had become moot is thus an additional ground for our conclusion that the appeal is frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal may be imposed sua sponte, Rule 38 requires \"notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond.\" See In re JC's East, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718599\"><a href=\"/opinion/718599/in-re-jcs-east-inc-doing-business-as-lolabelle-debtor-jcs-east-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 532 (2d Cir. 1996) (ordering appellants and their attorney to show cause within thirty days why they should not be sanctioned); McDonough v.

We therefore order appellants' counsel to show cause, within fourteen days, why he should not be sanctioned by payment of costs and fees for having filed a frivolous appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 38.

Appellants' counsel has fourteen days from the filing of this decision to file a memorandum explaining why sanctions are not warranted for pursuing a frivolous appeal. Appellee should submit an affidavit within fourteen days itemizing the reasonable costs and fees of this appeal. Appellants' counsel will then have seven days to respond to appellee's submission.
