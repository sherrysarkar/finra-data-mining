Defendant Kenneth  Schiavo\r                                             \r\n\nappeals his conviction for conspiring to possess, and possessing,\r\n\ncocaine  with intent to distribute  in violation of  21 U.S.C.   \r\n\n841(a)(1) &amp; 846.  After careful consideration, we affirm.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n     We  briefly sketch  the facts  underlying this case,  as the\r\n\njury might have  found them,  saving detail for  our analysis  of\r\n\nspecific claims.   Defendant  Schiavo was involved  in a  cocaine\r\n\ndistribution scheme  with Howard  Winter and Gennaro  Farina that\r\n\noperated in Massachusetts for  an extended period of time  in the\r\n\nearly  1990s. Winter was the target of a joint investigation into\r\n\ndrug  trafficking   conducted  during  this  time   by  the  Drug\r\n\nEnforcement  Agency  (DEA) and  the  Massachusetts State  Police.\r\n\nWith  assistance  from a  confidential  informant  (CI), the  law\r\n\nenforcement agencies developed  extensive evidence through direct\r\n\nand electronic surveillance.\r\n\n     The CI, who had  been a regular customer of  Winter's before\r\n\ngoing to  work for the government in April 1991, reported that in\r\n\nthe spring  of 1990 Winter had disclosed to him that \"Kenny . . .\r\n\nwas the supplier\" of the cocaine that the CI had been purchasing.\r\n\nFrom May to November 1991, the CI engaged in five controlled buys\r\n\nthrough  Winter.   A  pattern  emerged  from these  transactions:\r\n\nafter Winter discussed a potential sale with the CI, he called or\r\n\nmet Schiavo,  and then reported pertinent information back to the\r\n\nCI.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     The final transaction provided  the most direct link between\r\n\nSchiavo and the  conspiracy.   On November 4,  1991, the CI  gave\r\n\nWinter a New Balance bag containing $9,000 in  identifiable bills\r\n\nas partial  payment  for  cocaine delivered  November  1.    Soon\r\n\nthereafter,  Winter and Schiavo  met at a  restaurant in Chelsea.\r\n\nSchiavo  was followed  from  there  and,  in  accordance  with  a\r\n\nprearranged  plan,  stopped  by  Trooper  Thomas  Duffy.    Duffy\r\n\napproached Schiavo, observed  a bulge in his jacket,  frisked him\r\n\nfor  weapons and  discovered the  New Balance  bag.   The officer\r\n\nseized  the money  in  the bag  and  additional cash  carried  by\r\n\nSchiavo -- a total of $12,500 -- but did not arrest him. \r\n\n     In  January 1992,  a  grand jury  returned a  multiple count\r\n\nindictment   against   Schiavo,  Winter   and   Farina,  charging\r\n\nparticipation  in a drug conspiracy  from May 1991  to January 5,\r\n\n1992, and five substantive  counts of possessing and distributing\r\n\ncocaine.  Schiavo was charged on three of the substantive counts.\r\n\nFollowing his arrest,  he successfully moved to suppress  the bag\r\n\nof money.1\r\n\n     On September 1, 1994, shortly before trial was scheduled  to\r\n\nbegin,  Schiavo  was charged  in  a  superseding indictment  that\r\n\npushed  the  conspiracy's  start  date back  eighteen  months  to\r\n\nDecember  1989 and added two substantive counts.  Schiavo filed a\r\n\nmotion to  dismiss the superseding indictment,  which was denied.\r\n\nThe  trial eventually  began  on November  14,  1994.   The  jury\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1   The suppression was affirmed  by this court.   29 F.3d 6\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nreturned guilty  verdicts on the conspiracy charge  and the three\r\n\nsubstantive counts originally charged.\r\n\n     Schiavo  raises six issues on appeal:  (1) a double jeopardy\r\n\nviolation; (2) improper admission of testimony about the stop and\r\n\nfrisk on  November  4, 1992;  (3) insufficient  evidence that  he\r\n\nparticipated  in a  conspiracy spanning  the term charged  in the\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment;  (4)  improper  admission  of  the  CI's\r\n\nreported  statement  from Winter  that  Schiavo  was the  cocaine\r\n\nsupplier;  (5) prosecutorial  vindictiveness; and (6) a violation\r\n\nof the Speedy Trial Act.  We discuss each in turn.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.   Double Jeopardy\r                              \r\n\n     Pursuant to 21  U.S.C.   881(a)(6),  the DEA obtained  civil\r\n\nforfeiture  of $5,090 of  Schiavo's money.2   Schiavo claims that\r\n\nhis criminal  conviction following this forfeiture  constitutes a\r\n\nsecond punishment for  a single  offense, and  thus violates  the\r\n\nconstitutional proscription of  double jeopardy.   This  argument\r\n\nwas firmly  rejected by United States v. Ursery, 116 S. Ct. 2135,\r                                                         \r\n\n2149 (1996), where the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that an in\r                                                               \r\n\nrem civil  forfeiture under   881(a)(6)  is \"neither 'punishment'\r\n\nnor criminal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\"\r\n\nB.   Testimony Relating to the Stop and Frisk\r                                                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    The  DEA  instituted  separate  forfeiture  proceedings\r\nagainst the $3500 of non-governmental money seized on November 4,\r\n1991 and  the $1590 seized from Schiavo at the time of his arrest\r\non March 5, 1993.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     On Schiavo's  original motion  to suppress, the  court ruled\r\n\nthat  Duffy's  search reached  its  constitutional  limit at  the\r\n\ncompletion of the initial pat frisk, which confirmed that Schiavo\r\n\nwas not carrying  any weapons.  Accordingly, the court suppressed\r\n\nall  items seized  after this  point, in  particular, the  bag of\r\n\ncurrency.\r\n\n     At trial,  Duffy recounted his stop-and-frisk encounter with\r\n\nSchiavo.  \r\n\n     Q.  And did you approach Mr. Schiavo?\r\n     A.  Yes, I did.\r\n     Q.  And did you notice anything upon approaching Mr. Schiavo\r\n         after you pulled him over?\r\n     A.  I did.\r\n     Q.  What did you observe?\r\n     A.  I noticed the large bulge in his left breast area.\r\n     Q.  After you noticed this bulge, what did you do?\r\n     A.  I did an initial pat frisk of that area and I asked if \r\n         that was all him.\r\n     Q.  And how did Mr. Schiavo respond when you pat frisked him\r\n         and asked him if it was all him?\r\n     A.  He responded \"Mostly.\"\r\n     Q.  Did  you make any other comments concerning the bulge in\r\n         his jacket at that point in time?\r\n     A.  Yes.\r\n     Q.  What did you say?\r\n     A.  I asked him more than once if he had a weapon.\r\n     Q.  Did you ask him anything else?\r\n     A.   As I was touching  that area of his  chest, I asked him\r\nwhat          it was.\r\n         He replied, \"It's a bag.\"\r\n         I said, \"It's an awful big bulge for a bag.\"\r\n         He responded, \"It's big.\" \r\n\n     Schiavo complains that  it was error to allow  any testimony\r\n\nregarding  the stop,  especially  testimony that  related to  the\r\n\nsuppressed  bag of  currency.    For  a  number  of  reasons,  we\r\n\ndisagree. \r\n\n     Most significantly, Schiavo's  motion to suppress referenced\r\n\nonly  \"items seized,\" not statements  made.  This distinction was\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nconfirmed  at the  suppression hearing,  where Schiavo's  counsel\r\n\nmade  clear that defendant's statements  were not at  issue.3  On\r\n\nNovember 14, 1994, the first day of trial, Schiavo filed a motion\r\n\nin limine  requesting exclusion  of \"any evidence  concerning the\r\n\n'serialized' currency,\" but it was  not until November 21,  1994,\r\n\nthat  Schiavo filed a motion  to suppress any  and all statements\r\n\nmade  by him on November 4, 1991.   The court properly denied the\r\n\nmotion  as untimely, see Fed.  R. Crim. P.  12(b)(3), and without\r                                  \r\n\nmerit,  but  nonetheless  suppressed statements  made  after  the\r\n\nillegal seizure of the bag of currency.  \r\n\n     We think the  court's reasoning, that the  completion of the\r\n\npat frisk  separated admissible from  inadmissible statements, is\r\n\nunassailable.   The frisk antedated the unconstitutional conduct;\r\n\naccordingly, information derived during  it cannot be  considered\r\n\nfruit of  the poisonous tree.   See United  States v. Crews,  445\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. 463, 470-71  (1980).   Moreover, the  court's assessment  of\r\n\nwhere the pat  frisk ended  was cautious and  to the  defendant's\r\n\nbenefit.  The statement \"It's big\" fell well within its span.\r\n\n     Schiavo  alternatively seeks  exclusion  of  the  statements\r\n\nbased  on the absence of  Miranda warnings.   This contention was\r                                           \r\n\nnot raised in any manner below and is waived.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    The  Court:  So, in other  words, there is no motion to\r\n          suppress  any statements that  may or may  not be made,\r\n          we're just concerned with suppression of the money?\r\n\n          Schiavo's Counsel:  Correct, your Honor.\r\n\n     4  In  any event, the  statements were made during  a lawful\r\nstop and frisk  under Terry v. Ohio,  392 U.S. 1 (1968).   See 29\r                                                                        \r\nF.3d  at  9.   Schiavo  was  not in  custody  at  the time,  and,\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nC.  Claims Based on Length of the Conspiracy\r                                                      \r\n\n     Schiavo contends  that the  government's evidence  failed to\r\n\nlink  him to a conspiracy  lasting from December  1989 to January\r\n\n1992.   He therefore argues that the jury's guilty verdict on the\r\n\nconspiracy  charge must  be  vacated and  that the  coconspirator\r\n\nstatement  made in  1990 was  improperly admitted.   We  think it\r\n\nhelpful  to set forth in  detail the evidence  presented at trial\r\n\nrelevant  to the conspiracy charge before analyzing his claims of\r\n\nerror.\r\n\nThe 1990 Transactions\r                               \r\n\n     The CI  detailed seven transactions that  took place between\r\n\nJanuary  and  November  1990,  before his  involvement  with  the\r\n\ngovernment.   The  CI arranged  these deals  through  Winter, who\r\n\nthen,  usually accompanied  by  Farina,  delivered  the  cocaine,\r\n\nthough the drugs were  once delivered by Farina and  another time\r\n\nby  Winter's son.  Without exception, the CI received the cocaine\r\n\non credit, paying Winter within a few days.\r\n\n       The CI learned of Schiavo's participation during the fifth\r\n\ntransaction, which  occurred in  May or  June of  1990.   On that\r\n\noccasion, according to his testimony, the CI drove with Winter to\r\n\nthe  Assembly Mall  parking  lot  in  Somerville,  Massachusetts.\r\n\nSchiavo  arrived  soon  thereafter  and parked  nearby.    Winter\r\n\napproached Schiavo, received a bag from him,  returned and handed\r\n\nthe bag  to the CI.   The bag contained one  kilogram of cocaine.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ntherefore,  Miranda  warnings were  not  warranted.   See  United\r                                                                           \r\nStates v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 160-61 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                         \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nThe  CI  testified that  he  then inquired  into  the deliverer's\r\n\nidentity:  \"I asked Howie  who this gentleman was and he  said it\r\n\nwas Kenny and that he was the supplier for the products.\"\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nThe CI's Cessation of Activities\r                                          \r\n\n     In  November  1990,  Winter  advised   the  CI  not  to  use\r\n\ntelephones because of \"a 3T investigation.\"5  Upon  hearing this,\r\n\nthe CI terminated  his business with  Winter.  The  conspirators'\r\n\nawareness of the DEA investigation was further  demonstrated by a\r\n\nphone conversation intercepted on November 22, in which Schiavo's\r\n\nson indicated  to a friend that the police were listening.  Later\r\n\nthat same day, Schiavo and Winter  met briefly on a street corner\r\n\nin Medford.\r\n\n     The  CI  could  not  provide information  about  the  period\r\n\nbetween November  1990 and  May 1991.   Nonetheless,  NYNEX phone\r\n\nrecords established  that a number  of calls were  placed between\r\n\nthe residences of Schiavo and Winter during this time.6\r\n\nThe 1991 Transactions\r                               \r\n\n     The 1991 controlled transactions were documented by personal\r\n\nand  electronic surveillance.   The  CI reinitiated  contact with\r\n\nWinter  on May 20, 1991, and  met with him the next  day.  On May\r\n\n22,  Winter and Farina delivered  one kilogram of  cocaine to the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5    According  to a  DEA  agent,  3T  refers to  electronic\r\nsurveillance  authorized pursuant  to  Title III  of the  Omnibus\r\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C.    2510-2522.  From\r\nNovember to  early December  1990, the government  had wiretapped\r\none telephone of Winter's and two telephones of Schiavo's.\r\n\n     6   The phone records entered as  exhibits at trial were not\r\nincluded in the appellate record.   We accept the representations\r\nof the government at closing argument and in its brief as to what\r\nthese records  reflect about the  number and  timing of  specific\r\ncalls.   The defendant's closing argument and brief indicate that\r\nthere is no dispute as to the contents of these exhibits.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nCI; on June 13, 1991, they delivered two.7  In each case, payment\r\n\nwas rendered  the following  day.   At significant  points during\r\n\neach  deal -- on May 22, near the  time that the CI called Winter\r\n\nto  arrange for payment; on June 12, following the CI's order for\r\n\ntwo  kilograms; and  on June  14, following  the CI's  payment to\r\n\nWinter -- calls were placed from Winter's home to Schiavo's.\r\n\n     On the  morning of  August 1,  the CI picked  up Winter  and\r\n\nordered two kilograms of cocaine.  After stopping to make a phone\r\n\ncall, Winter informed  the CI that,  \"He's gonna meet me.\"   They\r\n\nproceeded to a  Caldor's parking lot  in Brighton, where  Schiavo\r\n\nsoon  arrived.    After  meeting  briefly  with  Schiavo,  Winter\r\n\nreturned to the car and told the CI, that \"[We're] gonna meet him\r\n\nat 12 o'clock.\"   Schiavo returned to Somerville, and  parked his\r\n\ncar near Farina's.  At approximately 12:00 p.m., Farina delivered\r\n\none kilogram of cocaine to the CI.  \r\n\n     On August  2, the CI paid  Winter and asked about  the other\r\n\nkilogram of cocaine.  Winter responded \"let me call  him up,\" and\r\n\nthen placed  a call to  Schiavo's home.   He then advised  the CI\r\n\nthat \"he's  still trying to --  to get that other  one,\" and that\r\n\n\"if he  can get it out  there, whatever time, I'll  just give you\r\n\nthe time  and that  kid8 will  be there.\"   The next  day, Farina\r\n\ndelivered a  kilogram of cocaine to  the CI.  The  CI paid Winter\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7  These transactions served as the basis for the two counts\r\nof the  superseding indictment  for which  Schiavo was  found not\r\nguilty.\r\n\n     8  Earlier in the conversation, Winter had referred to \"that\r\nkid Gerry\" -- i.e., Farina.\r                            \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nfor  this cocaine  on August  8.   On August  9, Winter  met with\r\n\nSchiavo  for several minutes in  the parking lot  of the Sheraton\r\n\nTara hotel in Framingham.\r\n\n     On October 31,  the CI, while  driving with Winter,  ordered\r\n\nanother  kilogram  of cocaine.   Winter  placed  a phone  call to\r\n\nSchiavo's  residence and arranged to meet him at a Dunkin Donuts.\r\n\nWinter and Schiavo met  briefly, and Winter informed the  CI that\r\n\nhe could  pick  up the  kilogram later  in  the day.    Due to  a\r\n\nmisunderstanding -- the CI apparently  went to the wrong location\r\n\n--  the cocaine  was not delivered  until the  following morning,\r\n\nwhen Winter brought it to the CI's home.\r\n\n     As discussed above, the  CI gave Winter  $9,000 in a bag  on\r\n\nNovember  4.   A  short time  later,  Winter and  Schiavo arrived\r\n\nseparately  at  the  Chandlery   Restaurant  in  Chelsea.    Upon\r\n\ndeparting and being stopped and frisked by Trooper Duffy, Schiavo\r\n\nstated that he  was carrying a  big bag.   On November 6, the  CI\r\n\npaid Winter the balance owed on the one kilogram.\r\n\n     1.  The Conspiracy Verdict\r                                         \r\n\n     Schiavo contends  that the evidence failed  to establish the\r\n\nsingle  conspiracy  charged, and  suggests  that,  at best,  only\r\n\nmultiple  conspiracies  were  proved.     We  review  the  jury's\r\n\ndetermination  for  evidentiary  sufficiency,  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nWihbey,  75  F.3d  761, 774  (1st  Cir. 1996),  and  affirm  if a\r                \r\n\nrational jury could have  found guilt beyond a reasonable  doubt.\r\n\nUnited States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                 \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n     The  controlled nature  of the  1991 deals,  conducted under\r\n\nextensive surveillance, yielded substantial evidence of Schiavo's\r\n\ninvolvement  in  the cocaine  conspiracy.    For example,  Winter\r\n\nconsistently called, or arranged to meet, Schiavo whenever the CI\r\n\nordered  or paid for cocaine.  This indicated that Schiavo played\r\n\na  major role  in  the  operation.    Moreover,  the  jury  could\r\n\nreasonably infer,  based on Schiavo's comments  to Trooper Duffy,\r\n\nthat the bag on his person was the bag  of money delivered by the\r\n\nCI to Winter.       Notwithstanding    Schiavo's   protestations,\r\n\nthere  was  significant evidence  that this  conspiracy commenced\r\n\nmany  months  earlier.    First,  the  particulars  of  the  1991\r\n\ntransactions  were consistent with the 1990 ones:  the CI ordered\r\n\ncocaine  from Winter, received it  from Winter and/or Farina, and\r\n\npaid  Winter  for  it  within  a  few  days.     Both  series  of\r\n\ntransactions  involved the  same  people,  contemplated the  same\r\n\nends,  and used the same means to  reach those ends, all of which\r\n\nsignify one continuous  conspiracy.  See United States  v. David,\r                                                                          \r\n\n940 F.2d 722, 734 (1st Cir.  1991).  Even more compelling, the CI\r\n\nobserved Schiavo deliver cocaine to Winter in the spring of 1990,\r\n\nat  which time Winter identified  Schiavo as the  supplier of the\r\n\ndrugs.9 \r\n\n     Schiavo's essential argument  is that there  was a lapse  of\r\n\nsix  months  in  which  the  government  failed   to  identify  a\r\n\nsubstantive transaction.  We  do not think that  a lapse of  time\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9  We  explain the  admissibility of this  statement in  the\r\nnext section.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nper se transforms a single conspiracy into multiple conspiracies.\r                \r\n\nSee  United States v. Williamson, 53 F.3d  1500, 1513 &amp; n.6 (10th\r                                          \r\n\nCir.  1995) (citing cases from other  circuits); United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMaldanado-Rivera,  922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. 1990).  There is no\r                          \r\n\nindication whatsoever that Schiavo withdrew from the  conspiracy.\r\n\nIndeed, phone records indicate  that Schiavo and Winter regularly\r\n\ncommunicated during the supposed period of inactivity.  Moreover,\r\n\nbased on the  events in November 1990 -- Winter's  comment to the\r\n\nCI,  Schiavo's son's  intercepted conversation,  and the  meeting\r\n\nbetween  Winter and  Schiavo --  it is  reasonable to  infer that\r\n\nSchiavo  and Winter  were  well aware  of  the increased  federal\r\n\nsurveillance,  and   resolved  to  be  more   cautious  in  their\r\n\nactivities.\r\n\n     In  short,  the fact  that there  is  no direct  evidence of\r\n\ncocaine  transactions from  late November  1990 to late  May 1991\r\n\ndoes  not  negate  the   evidence  of  a  continuing  conspiracy.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  find the  evidence  sufficient  to support  the\r\n\nverdict.10\r\n\n     2.  Admission of Winter's Statement\r                                                  \r\n\n     Schiavo complains of the  court's admission of Winter's 1990\r\n\nstatement  identifying him as \"the supplier.\"   The court allowed\r\n\nthe remark as a  statement made by a coconspirator under  Fed. R.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10   Because  the  evidence supports  the single  conspiracy\r\ncharged  in the  indictment, we  need not  address the  issues of\r\nvariance  and prejudice  that are  common components  of multiple\r\nconspiracy claims.  See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 774.\r                                        \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nEvid.  801(d)(2)(E).11    Schiavo  contends  that  there  was  no\r\n\nevidence that Schiavo and Winter were coconspirators at the time.\r\n\nThe  court, based on a preponderance of the evidence, reached the\r\n\nopposite conclusion.   We review its  factual findings for  clear\r\n\nerror.  United States v. Sepulveda,  15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993).\r\n\n     The law  in this  area  is well  settled.   \"To  invoke  the\r\n\n[801(d)(2)(E)]  exception,  a  party  who wants  to  introduce  a\r\n\nparticular statement must show by a preponderance of the evidence\r\n\nthat a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the  defendant\r\n\nexisted, and that the declarant  uttered the statement during and\r\n\nin  furtherance of  the  conspiracy.\"   United States  v. Flores-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRivera,  56 F.3d  319, 329  (1st Cir.  1995)  (internal quotation\r                \r\n\nmarks and citations omitted).  This determination is the province\r\n\nof the  court.  United  States v. Petrozziello,  548 F.2d 20,  23\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1977).  \r\n\n     During  a conference near the  end of trial,  the court made\r\n\nexplicit findings under Petrozziello, stating \r                                              \r\n\n     I have  to make that  finding at  the close of  all the\r\n     testimony[] --  that Mr. Winter and Mr. Schiavo and Mr.\r\n     Farina were members  of the conspiracy at  the time the\r\n     statements were made and  that the statements were made\r\n     during  the  course  of   and  in  furtherance  of  the\r\n     conspiracy.  I do find that by a preponderance.12\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11    Rule  801(d)(2)(E)  provides that  \"a  statement  by a\r\ncoconspirator  of a party during the course and in furtherance of\r\nthe conspiracy\" is not hearsay.\r\n\n     12  We note that  the judge's interpretation of the law  was\r\nmore  favorable to Schiavo than required:  a defendant is subject\r\nto  proof of  the comments  of coconspirators  made prior  to his\r\ninvolvement  in the conspiracy.  United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n     Schiavo argues that there is no extrinsic evidence tying him\r\n\nto a  conspiracy in 1990.  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1182 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir.  1993).  Our earlier discussion of evidentiary sufficiency  \r\n\ndisposes of this assertion.  Given the relevant standard of proof\r\n\n--  more  likely  than  not  --  the  evidence,  absent  Winter's\r\n\nstatement, easily supports the court's finding that the statement\r\n\nwas  made  during the  course of  a conspiracy  involving Winter,\r\n\nSchiavo and Farina.\r\n\n     Nor  can  its  finding  that   the  statement  was  made  in\r\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy be attacked.  A statement  furthers\r\n\na  conspiracy  if  it  \"tends  to  advance  the  objects  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy  as opposed to thwarting its  purpose.\"  United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Here, the identification of Schiavo\r\n\nto the CI, then a key participant in the drug distribution chain,\r\n\nclearly tended to  further the goals of the conspiracy.   See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nWinter's statement was properly admissible.  \r\n\nD.  Prosecutorial Vindictiveness\r                                          \r\n\n     On September 19,  1994, Schiavo filed  a pretrial motion  to\r\n\ndismiss  the superseding  indictment asserting, inter  alia, that\r                                                                     \r\n\nthe indictment was procured as a  result of an abuse of the grand\r\n\njury  process.   In particular,  he alleged  that  the government\r\n\nconvened the grand jury to shore up its weak case, violating  the\r\n\nspirit of United States  v. Doe, 455 F.2d  1270 (1st Cir.  1972).\r                                         \r\n\nAfter an evidentiary  hearing, the  motion was  denied.

As this claim was not advanced below,\r\n\nwe  review for plain error.   United States  v. Santiago, 83 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n20, 25 (1st  Cir. 1996); United States v. Whaley,  830 F.2d 1469,\r                                                          \r\n\n1476-77 (7th Cir. 1987) (vindictive prosecution claim).\r\n\n     A defendant may show  vindictive prosecution by 1) producing\r\n\nevidence  of  actual  vindictiveness  sufficient to  show  a  due\r\n\nprocess violation or 2) demonstrating that the circumstances show\r\n\nthere is a sufficient \"likelihood of vindictiveness\" to warrant a\r\n\npresumption of  vindictiveness.  United States  v. Marrapese, 826\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir. 1987).  Schiavo does not attempt to prove\r\n\nactual vindictiveness, but insists  that the following facts give\r\n\nrise to the requisite presumption:  1) the superseding indictment\r\n\nwas returned soon  after the  government lost its  appeal on  the\r\n\nsuppression of the currency,  2) the indictment was not  based on\r\n\nthe discovery  of new  evidence, and 3)  the government  expected\r\n\nSchiavo  to  plead.     Even  assuming  that   a  presumption  of\r\n\nvindictiveness could  arise from  pretrial conduct --  a scenario\r\n\nthat  is questionable in light  of United States  v. Goodwin, 457\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 368, 381 (1982) (\"There is good reason to be cautious before\r\n\nadopting    an    inflexible    presumption   of    prosecutorial\r\n\nvindictiveness  in  a  pretrial  setting.\") --  these  facts  are\r\n\ndeficient as a  matter of law.  The filing  of a pretrial motion,\r\n\nregardless of its  successful outcome,  and the  failure of  plea\r\n\nnegotiations are routine events  unlikely to provoke a prosecutor\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nto  \"seek to  penalize and deter.\"   See  id.

Speedy Trial\r                          \r\n\n     Schiavo  claims a  violation  of the  Speedy  Trial Act,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    3161-74.  Under the Act, trial  must commence within 70\r\n\nnonexcludable  days following  defendant's  appearance  before  a\r\n\njudicial officer of  the court.  Id.   3161(c)(1).   On Schiavo's\r                                              \r\n\nmotion, the court  determined that  578 of the  616 days  between\r\n\nSchiavo's  initial  court appearance  on March  8, 1993,  and the\r\n\nstart of his trial on November 14, 1994, were excludable, leaving\r\n\n38 nonexcludable days to go on the speedy trial clock.13\r\n\n     Schiavo  alleges  that the  court  erred  by excluding  time\r\n\nattributable to 1) his motion for pretrial release, 2) his motion\r\n\nto  reconsider pretrial  release,  3) his  motion  for return  of\r\n\nproperty,  and 4) a one week continuance.   We review the court's\r\n\nfactual findings for clear  error and its legal rulings  de novo.\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited  States v.

We need  not address  the\r\n\ncontinuance, which accounted  for six excludable  days.  Even  if\r\n\nexclusion  were   erroneous,   there  would   still   remain   26\r\n\nnonexcludable days on the speedy trial clock.  \r\n\n                         III.

Defendant Kenneth  Schiavo\r                                             \r\n\nappeals his conviction for conspiring to possess, and possessing,\r\n\ncocaine  with intent to distribute  in violation of  21 U.S.C.   \r\n\n841(a)(1) &amp; 846.  After careful consideration, we affirm.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n     We  briefly sketch  the facts  underlying this case,  as the\r\n\njury might have  found them,  saving detail for  our analysis  of\r\n\nspecific claims.   Defendant  Schiavo was involved  in a  cocaine\r\n\ndistribution scheme  with Howard  Winter and Gennaro  Farina that\r\n\noperated in Massachusetts for  an extended period of time  in the\r\n\nearly  1990s. Winter was the target of a joint investigation into\r\n\ndrug  trafficking   conducted  during  this  time   by  the  Drug\r\n\nEnforcement  Agency  (DEA) and  the  Massachusetts State  Police.\r\n\nWith  assistance  from a  confidential  informant  (CI), the  law\r\n\nenforcement agencies developed  extensive evidence through direct\r\n\nand electronic surveillance.\r\n\n     The CI, who had  been a regular customer of  Winter's before\r\n\ngoing to  work for the government in April 1991, reported that in\r\n\nthe spring  of 1990 Winter had disclosed to him that \"Kenny . . .\r\n\nwas the supplier\" of the cocaine that the CI had been purchasing.\r\n\nFrom May to November 1991, the CI engaged in five controlled buys\r\n\nthrough  Winter.   A  pattern  emerged  from these  transactions:\r\n\nafter Winter discussed a potential sale with the CI, he called or\r\n\nmet Schiavo,  and then reported pertinent information back to the\r\n\nCI.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     The final transaction provided  the most direct link between\r\n\nSchiavo and the  conspiracy.   On November 4,  1991, the CI  gave\r\n\nWinter a New Balance bag containing $9,000 in  identifiable bills\r\n\nas partial  payment  for  cocaine delivered  November  1.    Soon\r\n\nthereafter,  Winter and Schiavo  met at a  restaurant in Chelsea.\r\n\nSchiavo  was followed  from  there  and,  in  accordance  with  a\r\n\nprearranged  plan,  stopped  by  Trooper  Thomas  Duffy.    Duffy\r\n\napproached Schiavo, observed  a bulge in his jacket,  frisked him\r\n\nfor  weapons and  discovered the  New Balance  bag.   The officer\r\n\nseized  the money  in  the bag  and  additional cash  carried  by\r\n\nSchiavo -- a total of $12,500 -- but did not arrest him. \r\n\n     In  January 1992,  a  grand jury  returned a  multiple count\r\n\nindictment   against   Schiavo,  Winter   and   Farina,  charging\r\n\nparticipation  in a drug conspiracy  from May 1991  to January 5,\r\n\n1992, and five substantive  counts of possessing and distributing\r\n\ncocaine.  Schiavo was charged on three of the substantive counts.\r\n\nFollowing his arrest,  he successfully moved to suppress  the bag\r\n\nof money.1\r\n\n     On September 1, 1994, shortly before trial was scheduled  to\r\n\nbegin,  Schiavo  was charged  in  a  superseding indictment  that\r\n\npushed  the  conspiracy's  start  date back  eighteen  months  to\r\n\nDecember  1989 and added two substantive counts.  Schiavo filed a\r\n\nmotion to  dismiss the superseding indictment,  which was denied.\r\n\nThe  trial eventually  began  on November  14,  1994.   The  jury\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1   The suppression was affirmed  by this court.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195480\"><a href=\"/opinion/195480/united-states-v-schiavo/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nreturned guilty  verdicts on the conspiracy charge  and the three\r\n\nsubstantive counts originally charged.\r\n\n     Schiavo  raises six issues on appeal:  (1) a double jeopardy\r\n\nviolation; (2) improper admission of testimony about the stop and\r\n\nfrisk on  November  4, 1992;  (3) insufficient  evidence that  he\r\n\nparticipated  in a  conspiracy spanning  the term charged  in the\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment;  (4)  improper  admission  of  the  CI's\r\n\nreported  statement  from Winter  that  Schiavo  was the  cocaine\r\n\nsupplier;  (5) prosecutorial  vindictiveness; and (6) a violation\r\n\nof the Speedy Trial Act.  We discuss each in turn.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.   Double Jeopardy\r                              \r\n\n     Pursuant to 21  U.S.C.   881(a)(6),  the DEA obtained  civil\r\n\nforfeiture  of $5,090 of  Schiavo's money.2   Schiavo claims that\r\n\nhis criminal  conviction following this forfeiture  constitutes a\r\n\nsecond punishment for  a single  offense, and  thus violates  the\r\n\nconstitutional proscription of  double jeopardy.   This  argument\r\n\nwas firmly  rejected by United States v. Ursery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118052\"><a href=\"/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Testimony Relating to the Stop and Frisk\r                                                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    The  DEA  instituted  separate  forfeiture  proceedings\r\nagainst the $3500 of non-governmental money seized on November 4,\r\n1991 and  the $1590 seized from Schiavo at the time of his arrest\r\non March 5, 1993.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     On Schiavo's  original motion  to suppress, the  court ruled\r\n\nthat  Duffy's  search reached  its  constitutional  limit at  the\r\n\ncompletion of the initial pat frisk, which confirmed that Schiavo\r\n\nwas not carrying  any weapons.  Accordingly, the court suppressed\r\n\nall  items seized  after this  point, in  particular, the  bag of\r\n\ncurrency.\r\n\n     At trial,  Duffy recounted his stop-and-frisk encounter with\r\n\nSchiavo.  \r\n\n     Q.  And did you approach Mr. Schiavo?\r\n     A.  Yes, I did.\r\n     Q.  And did you notice anything upon approaching Mr. Schiavo\r\n         after you pulled him over?\r\n     A.  I did.\r\n     Q.  What did you observe?\r\n     A.  I noticed the large bulge in his left breast area.\r\n     Q.  After you noticed this bulge, what did you do?\r\n     A.  I did an initial pat frisk of that area and I asked if \r\n         that was all him.\r\n     Q.  And how did Mr. Schiavo respond when you pat frisked him\r\n         and asked him if it was all him?\r\n     A.  He responded \"Mostly.\"\r\n     Q.  Did  you make any other comments concerning the bulge in\r\n         his jacket at that point in time?\r\n     A.  Yes.\r\n     Q.  What did you say?\r\n     A.  I asked him more than once if he had a weapon.\r\n     Q.  Did you ask him anything else?\r\n     A.   As I was touching  that area of his  chest, I asked him\r\nwhat          it was.\r\n         He replied, \"It's a bag.\"\r\n         I said, \"It's an awful big bulge for a bag.\"\r\n         He responded, \"It's big.\" \r\n\n     Schiavo complains that  it was error to allow  any testimony\r\n\nregarding  the stop,  especially  testimony that  related to  the\r\n\nsuppressed  bag of  currency.    For  a  number  of  reasons,  we\r\n\ndisagree. \r\n\n     Most significantly, Schiavo's  motion to suppress referenced\r\n\nonly  \"items seized,\" not statements  made.  This distinction was\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nconfirmed  at the  suppression hearing,  where Schiavo's  counsel\r\n\nmade  clear that defendant's statements  were not at  issue.3  On\r\n\nNovember 14, 1994, the first day of trial, Schiavo filed a motion\r\n\nin limine  requesting exclusion  of \"any evidence  concerning the\r\n\n'serialized' currency,\" but it was  not until November 21,  1994,\r\n\nthat  Schiavo filed a motion  to suppress any  and all statements\r\n\nmade  by him on November 4, 1991.   The court properly denied the\r\n\nmotion  as untimely, see Fed.  R. Crim. P.  12(b)(3), and without\r                                  \r\n\nmerit,  but  nonetheless  suppressed statements  made  after  the\r\n\nillegal seizure of the bag of currency.  \r\n\n     We think the  court's reasoning, that the  completion of the\r\n\npat frisk  separated admissible from  inadmissible statements, is\r\n\nunassailable.   The frisk antedated the unconstitutional conduct;\r\n\naccordingly, information derived during  it cannot be  considered\r\n\nfruit of  the poisonous tree.   See United  States v. Crews,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110230\"><a href=\"/opinion/110230/united-states-v-crews/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span>\r                                                                     \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470-71  (1980).   Moreover, the  court's assessment  of\r\n\nwhere the pat  frisk ended  was cautious and  to the  defendant's\r\n\nbenefit.  The statement \"It's big\" fell well within its span.\r\n\n     Schiavo  alternatively seeks  exclusion  of  the  statements\r\n\nbased  on the absence of  Miranda warnings.   This contention was\r                                           \r\n\nnot raised in any manner below and is waived.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    The  Court:  So, in other  words, there is no motion to\r\n          suppress  any statements that  may or may  not be made,\r\n          we're just concerned with suppression of the money?\r\n\n          Schiavo's Counsel:  Correct, your Honor.\r\n\n     4  In  any event, the  statements were made during  a lawful\r\nstop and frisk  under Terry v. Ohio,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968).

Claims Based on Length of the Conspiracy\r                                                      \r\n\n     Schiavo contends  that the  government's evidence  failed to\r\n\nlink  him to a conspiracy  lasting from December  1989 to January\r\n\n1992.   He therefore argues that the jury's guilty verdict on the\r\n\nconspiracy  charge must  be  vacated and  that the  coconspirator\r\n\nstatement  made in  1990 was  improperly admitted.   We  think it\r\n\nhelpful  to set forth in  detail the evidence  presented at trial\r\n\nrelevant  to the conspiracy charge before analyzing his claims of\r\n\nerror.\r\n\nThe 1990 Transactions\r                               \r\n\n     The CI  detailed seven transactions that  took place between\r\n\nJanuary  and  November  1990,  before his  involvement  with  the\r\n\ngovernment.   The  CI arranged  these deals  through  Winter, who\r\n\nthen,  usually accompanied  by  Farina,  delivered  the  cocaine,\r\n\nthough the drugs were  once delivered by Farina and  another time\r\n\nby  Winter's son.  Without exception, the CI received the cocaine\r\n\non credit, paying Winter within a few days.\r\n\n       The CI learned of Schiavo's participation during the fifth\r\n\ntransaction, which  occurred in  May or  June of  1990.   On that\r\n\noccasion, according to his testimony, the CI drove with Winter to\r\n\nthe  Assembly Mall  parking  lot  in  Somerville,  Massachusetts.\r\n\nSchiavo  arrived  soon  thereafter  and parked  nearby.    Winter\r\n\napproached Schiavo, received a bag from him,  returned and handed\r\n\nthe bag  to the CI.   The bag contained one  kilogram of cocaine.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ntherefore,  Miranda  warnings were  not  warranted.

The  conspirators'\r\n\nawareness of the DEA investigation was further  demonstrated by a\r\n\nphone conversation intercepted on November 22, in which Schiavo's\r\n\nson indicated  to a friend that the police were listening.  Later\r\n\nthat same day, Schiavo and Winter  met briefly on a street corner\r\n\nin Medford.\r\n\n     The  CI  could  not  provide information  about  the  period\r\n\nbetween November  1990 and  May 1991.   Nonetheless,  NYNEX phone\r\n\nrecords established  that a number  of calls were  placed between\r\n\nthe residences of Schiavo and Winter during this time.6\r\n\nThe 1991 Transactions\r                               \r\n\n     The 1991 controlled transactions were documented by personal\r\n\nand  electronic surveillance.   The  CI reinitiated  contact with\r\n\nWinter  on May 20, 1991, and  met with him the next  day.  On May\r\n\n22,  Winter and Farina delivered  one kilogram of  cocaine to the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5    According  to a  DEA  agent,  3T  refers to  electronic\r\nsurveillance  authorized pursuant  to  Title III  of the  Omnibus\r\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C.    2510-2522.  From\r\nNovember to  early December  1990, the government  had wiretapped\r\none telephone of Winter's and two telephones of Schiavo's.\r\n\n     6   The phone records entered as  exhibits at trial were not\r\nincluded in the appellate record.   We accept the representations\r\nof the government at closing argument and in its brief as to what\r\nthese records  reflect about the  number and  timing of  specific\r\ncalls.   The defendant's closing argument and brief indicate that\r\nthere is no dispute as to the contents of these exhibits.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nCI; on June 13, 1991, they delivered two.7  In each case, payment\r\n\nwas rendered  the following  day.   At significant  points during\r\n\neach  deal -- on May 22, near the  time that the CI called Winter\r\n\nto  arrange for payment; on June 12, following the CI's order for\r\n\ntwo  kilograms; and  on June  14, following  the CI's  payment to\r\n\nWinter -- calls were placed from Winter's home to Schiavo's.\r\n\n     On the  morning of  August 1,  the CI picked  up Winter  and\r\n\nordered two kilograms of cocaine.  After stopping to make a phone\r\n\ncall, Winter informed  the CI that,  \"He's gonna meet me.\"   They\r\n\nproceeded to a  Caldor's parking lot  in Brighton, where  Schiavo\r\n\nsoon  arrived.    After  meeting  briefly  with  Schiavo,  Winter\r\n\nreturned to the car and told the CI, that \"[We're] gonna meet him\r\n\nat 12 o'clock.\"   Schiavo returned to Somerville, and  parked his\r\n\ncar near Farina's.  At approximately 12:00 p.m., Farina delivered\r\n\none kilogram of cocaine to the CI.  \r\n\n     On August  2, the CI paid  Winter and asked about  the other\r\n\nkilogram of cocaine.  Winter responded \"let me call  him up,\" and\r\n\nthen placed  a call to  Schiavo's home.   He then advised  the CI\r\n\nthat \"he's  still trying to --  to get that other  one,\" and that\r\n\n\"if he  can get it out  there, whatever time, I'll  just give you\r\n\nthe time  and that  kid8 will  be there.\"   The next  day, Farina\r\n\ndelivered a  kilogram of cocaine to  the CI.  The  CI paid Winter\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7  These transactions served as the basis for the two counts\r\nof the  superseding indictment  for which  Schiavo was  found not\r\nguilty.\r\n\n     8  Earlier in the conversation, Winter had referred to \"that\r\nkid Gerry\" -- i.e., Farina.\r                            \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nfor  this cocaine  on August  8.   On August  9, Winter  met with\r\n\nSchiavo  for several minutes in  the parking lot  of the Sheraton\r\n\nTara hotel in Framingham.\r\n\n     On October 31,  the CI, while  driving with Winter,  ordered\r\n\nanother  kilogram  of cocaine.   Winter  placed  a phone  call to\r\n\nSchiavo's  residence and arranged to meet him at a Dunkin Donuts.\r\n\nWinter and Schiavo met  briefly, and Winter informed the  CI that\r\n\nhe could  pick  up the  kilogram later  in  the day.    Due to  a\r\n\nmisunderstanding -- the CI apparently  went to the wrong location\r\n\n--  the cocaine  was not delivered  until the  following morning,\r\n\nwhen Winter brought it to the CI's home.\r\n\n     As discussed above, the  CI gave Winter  $9,000 in a bag  on\r\n\nNovember  4.   A  short time  later,  Winter and  Schiavo arrived\r\n\nseparately  at  the  Chandlery   Restaurant  in  Chelsea.    Upon\r\n\ndeparting and being stopped and frisked by Trooper Duffy, Schiavo\r\n\nstated that he  was carrying a  big bag.   On November 6, the  CI\r\n\npaid Winter the balance owed on the one kilogram.\r\n\n     1.  The Conspiracy Verdict\r                                         \r\n\n     Schiavo contends  that the evidence failed  to establish the\r\n\nsingle  conspiracy  charged, and  suggests  that,  at best,  only\r\n\nmultiple  conspiracies  were  proved.

For example,  Winter\r\n\nconsistently called, or arranged to meet, Schiavo whenever the CI\r\n\nordered  or paid for cocaine.  This indicated that Schiavo played\r\n\na  major role  in  the  operation.    Moreover,  the  jury  could\r\n\nreasonably infer,  based on Schiavo's comments  to Trooper Duffy,\r\n\nthat the bag on his person was the bag  of money delivered by the\r\n\nCI to Winter.       Notwithstanding    Schiavo's   protestations,\r\n\nthere  was  significant evidence  that this  conspiracy commenced\r\n\nmany  months  earlier.    First,  the  particulars  of  the  1991\r\n\ntransactions  were consistent with the 1990 ones:  the CI ordered\r\n\ncocaine  from Winter, received it  from Winter and/or Farina, and\r\n\npaid  Winter  for  it  within  a  few  days.     Both  series  of\r\n\ntransactions  involved the  same  people,  contemplated the  same\r\n\nends,  and used the same means to  reach those ends, all of which\r\n\nsignify one continuous  conspiracy.

There is no\r                          \r\n\nindication whatsoever that Schiavo withdrew from the  conspiracy.\r\n\nIndeed, phone records indicate  that Schiavo and Winter regularly\r\n\ncommunicated during the supposed period of inactivity.  Moreover,\r\n\nbased on the  events in November 1990 -- Winter's  comment to the\r\n\nCI,  Schiavo's son's  intercepted conversation,  and the  meeting\r\n\nbetween  Winter and  Schiavo --  it is  reasonable to  infer that\r\n\nSchiavo  and Winter  were  well aware  of  the increased  federal\r\n\nsurveillance,  and   resolved  to  be  more   cautious  in  their\r\n\nactivities.\r\n\n     In  short,  the fact  that there  is  no direct  evidence of\r\n\ncocaine  transactions from  late November  1990 to late  May 1991\r\n\ndoes  not  negate  the   evidence  of  a  continuing  conspiracy.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  find the  evidence  sufficient  to support  the\r\n\nverdict.10\r\n\n     2.

We review the court's\r\n\nfactual findings for clear  error and its legal rulings  de novo.\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited  States v.

We  think that  \"any pretrial  motion\"\r\n\neasily encompasses  pretrial motions relating to pretrial release\r\n\nor  detention,  and have  previously held  as  much.

Wirsing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518486\"><a href=\"/opinion/518486/united-states-v-craig-clark-wirsing-and-arthur-robert-lenz/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                          \r\n\n1230-31 (9th Cir. 1989).   We add that  the court, in  accordance\r\n\nwith 18  U.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(J),  properly allowed  only 30  days\r\n\nexclusion  after  these  motions  were  under  advisement.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1163.  \r                   \r\n\n     The motion  for return of  property was a  collateral matter\r\n\nsubsumed  in  the  pretrial motions  for  release.    It did  not\r\n\nseparately   account   for  any   time   excluded,   and  so   is\r\n\ninconsequential  to Schiavo's  claim.   We need  not address  the\r\n\ncontinuance, which accounted  for six excludable  days.  Even  if\r\n\nexclusion  were   erroneous,   there  would   still   remain   26\r\n\nnonexcludable days on the speedy trial clock.  \r\n\n                         III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n     Having found no merit to Schiavo's claims, the judgment is \r\n\nAffirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n</pre>",
