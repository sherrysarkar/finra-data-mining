Appellant  Ronald  L'Heureux  appeals  the\r                            \r\n\ndismissal by  the district  court of  his complaint  alleging\r\n\nviolation of his civil rights and seeking to hold  defendants\r\n\nin contempt for  violation of the Morris  and DeFusco consent\r                                                                 \r\n\ndecrees.  Having reviewed carefully the record in  this case,\r\n\nwe vacate the dismissal in part and affirm it in part.\r\n\n     The  district  court  in  the  instant  case  based  its\r\n\ndismissal  on the report and recommendation of the magistrate\r\n\njudge.    That  report found  that  the  complaint should  be\r\n\ndismissed  for  three  separate  reasons.     None,  however,\r\n\nsuffices to sustain dismissal of the entire complaint.\r\n\n     First,  the  magistrate  judge  found  that  L'Heureux's\r\n\namended complaint violated a court  order to file a short and\r\n\nplain statement of his claim  as required by Fed. R. Civ.  P.\r\n\n8(a)  and that violation  of that order  supported dismissal.\r\n\nYet,  while  L'Heureux's   complaint  is   indeed  long   (15\r\n\nhandwritten  single spaced pages) and at many times rambling,\r\n\nit sufficiently fulfills the purpose  of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)\r\n\nso as  not to be  in violation  of the previous  court order.\r\n\nThe purpose of Fed. R. Civ.  P. 8(a) is to give \"fair  notice\r\n\n[to the defendants]  of the claim asserted.\"   See Simmons v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nAbruzzo, 49 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir. 1995).  Dismissal is usually\r                   \r\n\n\"reserved  for  those  case  in  which  the  complaint is  so\r\n\nconfused,  vague, or otherwise  unintelligible that  its true\r\n\nsubstance,  if any, is  well disguised.\"   See  Salahuddin v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nCuomo, 861 F.2d 40, 42 (2d Cir. 1988).  L'Heureux's complaint\r                 \r\n\nseems to give fair  notice of at least two claims, neither of\r\n\nwhich  appears  frivolous on  its  face.   First,  he alleges\r\n\nvarious violations of the DeFusco consent decree and seeks to\r                                             \r\n\nhave defendants held  in contempt, the appropriate  means for\r\n\nseeking to  enforce compliance  with a  consent decree.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMartel v. Fridovich, 14 F.3d 1, 3 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993).  Also,\r                               \r\n\nhe  alleges  several  instances  of  defendants'  retaliating\r\n\nagainst him for  the exercise of  his right of access  to the\r\n\ncourts.  Therefore, dismissal of the complaint as a violation\r\n\nof the order  to comply  with Rule  8(a) was  improper.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nSimmons,  49  F.3d  at  88  (\"Dismissal  with  prejudice  was\r                   \r\n\ninappropriate   because   the    amended   complaint   stated\r\n\nnonfrivolous  claims and  sufficed  to  give  notice  of  the\r\n\nsubstance,  and   many  of  the  details,   of  [defendant's]\r\n\nclaims.\").\r\n\n     The  magistrate judge also  recommended dismissal on the\r\n\nground that L'Heureux  had not opposed defendants'  motion to\r\n\ndismiss.   However, the  local rule on  which the  magistrate\r\n\njudge  relied for his  recommendation allows for  granting an\r\n\nunopposed order only when to do  is \"just.\"  For the  reasons\r\n\nelsewhere in this  opinion, we do not find  that dismissal of\r\n\nthe entire complaint in this case to have been just.\r\n\n     Finally, the magistrate  judge recommended dismissal  on\r\n\nthe  basis of Fed.  R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6).   In particular, he\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nfound  that some  of  L'Heureux's  complaints repetitious  of\r\n\nclaims in other suits and others too insubstantial to state a\r\n\nclaim for relief.  Both grounds are sufficient for dismissing\r\n\nmost claims.   In particular,  L'Heureux's retaliation  claim\r\n\nappears  duplicative  of another  case  currently pending  in\r\n\nfederal  court and thus properly  subject to dismissal.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., I.A. Durbin v. Jefferson National Bank,  793 F.2d 1541,\r                                                        \r\n\n1551  (11th  Cir.  1986) (\"it  is  well  established  that as\r\n\nbetween  federal district courts, the general principle is to\r\n\navoid  duplicative  litigation\")(citing   cases).    However,\r\n\nnothing in the  record indicates that the  alleged violations\r\n\nof  the consents  decree are duplicative  of claims  in other\r\n\ncases.    Moreover,  at least some  of L'Heureux's  claims of\r\n\nconsent decree  violations seem  supported with  sufficiently\r\n\nspecific  allegations  to  withstand   dismissal  under  Rule\r\n\n12(b)(6),  at  least  without  further   explication  by  the\r\n\ndistrict court.  \r\n\n     We  of course  hazard no  opinion  as to  the merits  of\r\n\nL'Heureux's claims.  \r\n\n     The order of  dismissal is vacated as far  as it relates\r                                                   \r\n\nto the claims of consent decree violations.  The dismissal of\r\n\nthe  other claims  is affirmed.    The case  is remanded  for\r                                          \r\n\nfurther proceedings in accord with this opinion.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
