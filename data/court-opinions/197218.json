Having analyzed the district court's memorandum\r\n\naccompanying its order of dismissal, we agree that the\r\n\nstatute of limitations has run.  Accordingly, plaintiff-\r\n\nappellant Jonathan Ball has no basis for relief and we\r\n\naffirm.1\r\n\n          We briefly state the relevant facts.  On December\r\n\n3, 1992, defendant-appellee Roger Carroll, a Massachusetts\r\n\nstate trooper, pulled Ball over for speeding on Interstate 93\r\n\nin Massachusetts.  According to Ball and the report from a\r\n\nsubsequent investigation by the Massachusetts Attorney\r\n\nGeneral, Carroll next ordered Ball out of his car and then,\r\n\nwhen Ball did not respond quickly enough, dragged him out of\r\n\nthe vehicle and allowed his head to hit the pavement. \r\n\nCarroll then struck Ball in the face and kneed him in the\r\n\nback for no apparent reason.  Adding insult to injury,\r\n\nCarroll arrested Ball and charged him with (1) assault and\r\n\nbattery on a police officer, (2) refusing to obey a police\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We voted  to  consider this  appeal as  submitted and  to\r\ndispense with  oral argument.  The shortness  of time between\r\nour decision  and oral  argument, however, prevented  us from\r\nformally removing the case from  the February docket.  Ball's\r\ncounsel's  scheduling conflict  had  nothing to  do with  our\r\ndecision that oral argument would not be helpful in resolving\r\nthis appeal.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nofficer, (3) driving without a license, and (4) speeding. \r\n\nAll counts were subsequently nol prosed by the state\r\n\nprosecutor.  \r\n\n          We look to state law for the statute of limitations\r\n\napplicable to   1983 actions.  See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n261, 276-80 (1985) (indicating that state personal injury\r\n\nstatute of limitations governs   1983 actions). \r\n\nMassachusetts imposes a three-year statute of limitations for\r\n\npersonal injury claims, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260   2A, and\r                                       \r\n\nthus Ball had three years from the date of the incident to\r\n\nfile suit.  Ball filed his complaint on December 29, 1995. \r\n\nThe district court, noting that Ball filed his complaint 26\r\n\ndays too late, granted Carroll's motion to dismiss.\r\n\n          On appeal, Ball primarily reasserts arguments that\r\n\nfailed in the district court.  We affirm for essentially the\r\n\nsame reasons set forth in that court's memorandum of August\r\n\n8, 1996, adding only a brief response to Ball's request that\r\n\nwe consider an equitable tolling of the statute of\r\n\nlimitations.\r\n\n          Ball contends that the district court should have\r\n\ntolled the statute of limitations during the pendency of the\r\n\noriginal criminal charges against him.  He argues that his\r\n\ntardiness in no way prejudices Carroll and the other\r\n\ndefendants, and that the egregious facts, largely supported\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nby the investigatory report of the Massachusetts Attorney\r\n\nGeneral, warrant such a tolling.\r\n\n          For this argument, Ball relies on the Ninth\r\n\nCircuit's decision in Harding v. Galceran, 889 F.2d 906 (9th\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1989).  Harding involved an altercation between an\r                                \r\n\nindividual, Harding, and sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles,\r\n\nCalifornia.  See id. at 907.  Following the altercation, the\r                                \r\n\ndeputies filed criminal charges against Harding.  A jury\r\n\nacquitted him of the charges.  Subsequently, and more than\r\n\none year after the incident and after the pertinent\r\n\nlimitations period had expired, Harding commenced a   1983\r\n\naction against the deputies involved.  The district court\r\n\ndismissed Harding's complaint as time barred.  See id.\r                                                                  \r\n\n          On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reinstated Harding's\r\n\naction.  The court noted that by statute, California\r\n\nprevented plaintiffs from filing civil actions against police\r\n\nofficers during the pendency of criminal charges.  See id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n907 n.2.  The court found this provision inconsistent with\r\n\nthe purposes of   1983.  It announced that henceforth the\r\n\nstatute would be interpreted either not to prevent   1983\r\n\nactions from being filed while criminal charges were pending,\r\n\nor to toll the California statute of limitations until the\r\n\nfinal disposition of the criminal charges.  See id. at 908. \r                                                               \r\n\nThe Ninth Circuit then concluded that Harding's action was\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ntimely because his claim was filed within one year of the\r\n\ndisposition of the criminal charges against him.  See id.\r                                                                     \r\n\n          We decline to accede to Ball's request that we\r\n\nadopt the Ninth Circuit rule.  First, unlike the one-year\r\n\nlimit in California, Massachusetts allows plaintiffs a more\r\n\ngenerous three years within which to file a   1983 action. \r\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260   2A.  Second, Massachusetts has\r               \r\n\nnot enacted a statute prohibiting plaintiffs from filing\r\n\nactions against police officers during the pendency of\r\n\ncriminal charges against those plaintiffs.  Ball thus was\r\n\nfree to present his claim any time after the incident, see\r                                                                      \r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 258   4 (requiring presentation of claims\r\n\nto executive officer of agency prior to filing suit), and to\r\n\ncommence this action six months later.  See id. (indicating\r                                                           \r\n\nthat if executive officer of agency takes no action on claim\r\n\nwithin six months, claimant may file suit).  Third, neither\r\n\nthe year-long criminal action nor the six-month presentment\r\n\nperiod explains Ball's failure to timely file this suit. \r\n\nBall presented his claim on November 30, 1994.  By statute\r\n\nthe presentment period expired by May 30, 1995.  The three-\r\n\nyear statute of limitations did not run until December 3,\r\n\n1995.  Despite Ball's delay in presenting his claim, he still\r\n\nhad over six months after his claim was effectively denied to\r\n\ncommence suit. \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Although we are not unmindful of the injuries\r\n\nCarroll gratuitously inflicted on Ball, we conclude that the\r\n\nstatute of limitations has expired and we find no basis to\r\n\ngrant him a judicial exception to the operation of\r\n\nMassachusetts law.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.  No costs.\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n",

Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111415\"><a href=\"/opinion/111415/wilson-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 276-80 (1985) (indicating that state personal injury statute of limitations governs &#167; 1983 actions).  Massachusetts imposes a three-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, see Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  260 &#167; 2A, and thus Ball had three years from the date of the incident to file suit.  Ball filed his complaint on December 29, 1995.  The district court, noting that Ball filed his complaint 26 days too late, granted Carroll's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ball primarily reasserts arguments that failed in the district court.  We affirm for essentially the same reasons set forth in that court's memorandum of August 8, 1996, adding only a brief response to Ball's request that we consider an equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ball contends that the district court should have tolled the statute of limitations during the pendency of the original criminal charges against him.  He argues that his tardiness in no way prejudices Carroll and the other defendants, and that the egregious facts, largely supported by the investigatory report of the Massachusetts Attorney General, warrant such a tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this argument, Ball relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in Harding v. Galceran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532120\"><a href=\"/opinion/532120/edward-joseph-harding-v-david-galceran-terry-gingerich-lawrence-moser/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1989).  Harding involved an altercation between an individual, Harding, and sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles, California.  See id. at 907.  Following the altercation, the deputies filed criminal charges against Harding.  A jury acquitted him of the charges.  Subsequently, and more than one year after the incident and after the pertinent limitations period had expired, Harding commenced a &#167; 1983 action against the deputies involved.  The district court dismissed Harding's complaint as time barred.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reinstated Harding's action.  The court noted that by statute, California prevented plaintiffs from filing civil actions against police officers during the pendency of criminal charges.  See id. at 907 n. 2.  The court found this provision inconsistent with the purposes of &#167; 1983.  It announced that henceforth the statute would be interpreted either not to prevent &#167; 1983 actions from being filed while criminal charges were pending, or to toll the California statute of limitations until the final disposition of the criminal charges.  See id. at 908.  The Ninth Circuit then concluded that Harding's action was timely because his claim was filed within one year of the disposition of the criminal charges against him.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to accede to Ball's request that we adopt the Ninth Circuit rule.  First, unlike the one-year limit in California, Massachusetts allows plaintiffs a more generous three years within which to file a &#167; 1983 action.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  260 &#167; 2A. Second, Massachusetts has not enacted a statute prohibiting plaintiffs from filing actions against police officers during the pendency of criminal charges against those plaintiffs.  Ball thus was free to present his claim any time after the incident, see Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 258 &#167; 4 (requiring presentation of claims to executive officer of agency prior to filing suit), and to commence this action six months later.  See id.  (indicating that if executive officer of agency takes no action on claim within six months, claimant may file suit).  Third, neither the year-long criminal action nor the six-month presentment period explains Ball's failure to timely file this suit.  Ball presented his claim on November 30, 1994.  By statute the presentment period expired by May 30, 1995.  The three-year statute of limitations did not run until December 3, 1995.  Despite Ball's delay in presenting his claim, he still had over six months after his claim was effectively denied to commence suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are not unmindful of the injuries Carroll gratuitously inflicted on Ball, we conclude that the statute of limitations has expired and we find no basis to grant him a judicial exception to the operation of Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. See 1st Cir.  R. 27.1.  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We voted to consider this appeal as submitted and to dispense with oral argument.  The shortness of time between our decision and oral argument, however, prevented us from formally removing the case from the February docket.  Ball's counsel's scheduling conflict had nothing to do with our decision that oral argument would not be helpful in resolving this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
