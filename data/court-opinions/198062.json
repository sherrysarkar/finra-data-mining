Clinton, with whom Clinton &amp; Muzyka, P.C., was on\r\nbrief for Maritime Overseas Corporation and Cambridge Tankers, Inc.\r\nMichael B. Latti, with whom Carolyn M. Latti and Latti\r\nAssociates LLP, were on brief for Eric Wilson.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                    July 10, 1998\r\n                                               TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Eric Wilson, chief mate on an ocean-\r\ngoing oil tanker owned by defendant-appellant Cambridge Tankers,\r\nInc., was injured during a voyage as he attempted to repair\r\nhydraulic fluid lines that were leaking inside one of the main\r\ncargo holds.  He filed suit in the district court against\r\nCambridge Tankers, as well as against his employer, Maritime\r\nOverseas Corporation, asserting claims under the Jones Act, 46\r\nU.S.C.  688, for negligence, and under the general maritime law\r\nfor unseaworthiness and for maintenance and cure.  After trial,\r\nthe jury awarded Wilson $2,000,000 in compensatory damages.  The\r\ndefendants now appeal from the verdict, arguing that the district\r\ncourt erred both in failing to instruct the jury on comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule, and in denying their motion\r\nfor a remittitur.  We remand for a new trial on all issues.\r\n                    I.  Background\r\n     \"We . . . review the evidence developed at trial in the light\r\nmost favorable to [the verdict].\"  Toucet v. Maritime Overseas\r\n        Corp., 991 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n     The plaintiff, Eric Wilson, was employed as a chief mate by\r\nMaritime Overseas Corporation on the M/T OVERSEAS BOSTON, which\r\nwas owned, operated, and controlled by Cambridge Tankers, Inc.\r\n(collectively, \"the defendants\").  On January 19, 1994, the\r\nOVERSEAS BOSTON was approximately 75 miles off the western coast\r\nof Mexico on its way to Valdez, Alaska.  The plaintiff was in a\r\nZodiac inflatable raft in the vessel's No. 2 center cargo tank\r\n(\"tank No. 2C\") trying to patch two leaking hydraulic lines.\r\n     The decision to patch the lines while the OVERSEAS BOSTON was\r\nunderway was made jointly by the captain, the chief engineer, and\r\nWilson, the chief mate.  Several hydraulic lines had been leaking\r\nsince at least 1991, and Wilson and others had placed numerous\r\nrequests with the vessel's owners to replace the lines at a\r\nshipyard.  The hydraulic lines, made out of copper beryllium,\r\ncontrol the valves that regulate the flow of petroleum into and\r\nout of the ship.  The leaks in the lines were a constant source\r\nof worry on the OVERSEAS BOSTON because, if the hydraulic system\r\nfailed, the valves could open without warning, creating the\r\npossibility of an oil spill.  The defendants' established\r\nprocedure for patching hydraulic lines was to fill the tank with\r\nseawater to a height sufficient to allow a seaman on a raft\r\nfloating inside the tank to reach the hydraulic line in question. \r\nThe leaking section of pipe is then cut and replaced with a new\r\nstainless steel section.  There was no other equipment available\r\non the OVERSEAS BOSTON with which to repair the lines.\r\nThe lines that Wilson was patching on the day of the accident ran\r\nvertically down one side of tank no. 2C.  These lines were\r\nleaking near the top of the tank, which is seventy-five feet\r\ndeep.  To reach the lines, Wilson had the tank filled up to\r\napproximately the sixty-five foot mark, so that the raft could\r\nfloat within eight to ten feet of the deck above.  However, the\r\nunderside of the deck on the OVERSEAS BOSTON is spanned from port\r\nto starboard by large metal I-beams, whose vertical span is about\r\nfive feet.  Thus, the clearance between the bottom of each beam\r\nand the surface of the water was only approximately three to five\r\nfeet.\r\nWilson and a seaman climbed aboard the raft, and Wilson knelt in\r\nthe forward section to paddle the raft toward the leaking lines. \r\nThe beams were about one or two feet above his head.  Proceeding\r\nin this manner, Wilson and the seaman went under two beams\r\nwithout incident.  Unbeknownst to Wilson, however, the vessel\r\nchanged course while he was still paddling.  Although the captain\r\nand officers on the bridge knew that Wilson was in the tank, and\r\ncould communicate with him by hand-held radio, they failed to\r\nwarn him of the impending change of course.  Unfortunately, there\r\nwas a wave in the tank (attributed by Wilson to the change in\r\ncourse), which lifted the raft and slammed Wilson against a beam.\r\nAlthough he was in pain, Wilson assumed that he had not been\r\nseriously injured, and decided to continue patching the lines. \r\nWhen he exited the tank about an hour later, he mentioned to the\r\nchief engineer that he had hurt his back.  The captain examined\r\nWilson's back, and told him to rest in his cabin until he felt\r\nbetter.  The pain did not go away, however, and Wilson left the\r\nship to be examined by doctors.  He was told at first that his\r\npain was most likely due to a bad sprain and injury to the soft\r\ntissues along his spine.  After several months, however, Wilson\r\nwas still in pain, especially when he bent his back or climbed\r\nstairs.  Wilson thus consulted a second doctor, who determined\r\nthat Wilson had fractured his spine at the T8 vertebra.  Wilson\r\nremained on medical leave the rest of 1994, during which he\r\nunderwent various rehabilitative treatments for his injury,\r\nincluding wearing a back brace for four months, and receiving\r\nfrequent steroid injections to build up the muscles in his back.\r\nIn January 1995, Wilson's condition had improved enough that he\r\nwas allowed to go back to work as a chief mate on a trial basis. \r\nHe was assigned to work on the OVERSEAS NEW YORK while it was\r\nmoored for maintenance and repairs in Portland, Oregon.  This\r\ntrial period lasted for sixty-five days, during which it became\r\napparent that Wilson's ability to perform his duties as a chief\r\nmate was compromised by the pain that he frequently suffered\r\nwhile climbing stairs or performing other physically-strenuous\r\ntasks.  Nevertheless, his performance of other duties was\r\nexemplary, and he was recommended for promotion to captain, which\r\nwas a less physically-demanding job.\r\nDuring the summer of 1995, in preparation for his imminent\r\npromotion, he was assigned to the OVERSEAS CHICAGO for\r\napproximately one month attached to its captain in preparation\r\nfor his own promotion to captain.  Captain Olsen, the OVERSEAS\r\nCHICAGO's captain, reported that Wilson had performed very well,\r\nand that his promotion was both warranted and due.  A short time\r\nlater, Wilson was asked to obtain a medical certificate that he\r\nwas fit for administrative duties as captain.\r\nAfter obtaining a certification that he was fit for\r\nadministrative duty as a captain, Wilson was assigned to relieve\r\nCaptain Olsen on the OVERSEAS CHICAGO, which was berthed in\r\nPortland, Oregon.  On August 15, 1995, he flew out to Portland,\r\nwent to the OVERSEAS BOSTON, and exchanged command of the ship\r\nwith Captain Olsen.  An hour or two later, Captain Olsen returned\r\nand told Wilson that he had to speak to his superiors at Maritime\r\nOverseas' headquarters in New York.  When Wilson placed the call,\r\nhe was told that the medical certificate was not satisfactory,\r\nbecause it did not certify that he was fully fit for any duty on\r\nthe ship.  Captain Olsen was ordered to relieve Wilson of his\r\ncommand and march him off the ship.  Wilson was given $500 and\r\ntold to stay at a nearby hotel until the matter could be sorted\r\nout.  However, after waiting several days without hearing\r\nanything further, Wilson flew back to his home in Maine.\r\nSoon afterwards, Wilson filed the instant suit in the U.S.\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging  both\r\ndiversity and federal question jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C.\r\n1331, 1332.  In his complaint, Wilson claimed that his\r\ninjuries were caused both by the OVERSEAS BOSTON's unseaworthy\r\ncondition and by the bridge officers' failure to warn him of the\r\nimpending course change.  In their answer to the complaint, the\r\ndefendants denied Wilson's allegations of unseaworthiness and\r\nnegligence, and claimed as affirmative defenses that the sole\r\ncause of Wilson's injuries was either his own negligence, or his\r\nfailure to properly perform his duties as chief mate. \r\nA jury trial started on February 10, 1997.  At the end of the\r\nplaintiff's case, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter\r\nof law on the unseaworthiness and negligence claims.  On\r\nFebruary 19, 1997, the last day of trial, the district court\r\nsummarily denied the motion.  The court also denied the\r\ndefendants' request that he instruct the jury on comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule, as well as their request\r\nthat the jury questionnaire contain questions on those\r\naffirmative defenses.  \r\nThe following day, the jury returned a special verdict for\r\nWilson, finding that the OVERSEAS BOSTON was unseaworthy, that\r\nthe defendants had been negligent, that both the unseaworthiness\r\nand negligence had been proximate causes of Wilson's injuries,\r\nthat his pre- and post-judgment damages totaled $2,000,000, and\r\nthat he was entitled to pre-judgment interest.  On February 28,\r\n1997, the district court entered judgment in accordance with the\r\nverdict in the amount of $2,139,804.93.  \r\nThe defendants timely filed three post-judgment motions: a\r\nrenewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, a motion for a\r\nnew trial, and a motion for remittitur.  The district court\r\ndenied all three motions by means of a one-page order dated June\r\n5, 1997.  The defendants now appeal from the denial of their\r\nmotions.\r\nII.  Objections to instructions\r\nA.  Standard of review\r\nThe defendants' primary argument is that the jury's verdict\r\nshould be set aside and the case remanded for a new trial because\r\nthe jury instructions and questionnaire were incorrect as a\r\nmatter of law, and because these errors prejudiced them.  Before\r\nreaching the merits of the defendants' objections, however, we\r\nmust resolve the threshold issue of whether the defendants\r\nproperly preserved their objections.\r\nObjections to instructions must comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 51,\r\nwhich provides in pertinent part:\r\nNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an\r\ninstruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury\r\nretires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter\r\nobjected to and the grounds of the objection.\r\n\nObjections must also comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a).  Rule\r\n49(a) permits a court to require a jury to return only a special\r\nverdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue\r\nof fact, and requires the court to give such instructions to the\r\njury \"concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to\r\nenable the jury to make its findings upon each issue.\"  More to\r\nthe point, Rule 49(a) further provides:\r\nIf in so doing, the court omits any issue of fact raised by the\r\npleadings or by the evidence, each party waives the right to a\r\ntrial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury\r\nretires the party demands its submission to the jury.\r\n\nBoth Rule 49(a) and Rule 51 thus require the objecting party to\r\nstate its objections after the charge but before the jury\r\nretires.  \"The object of [these rules] is to afford the trial\r\njudge an opportunity upon second thought, and before it is too\r\nlate, to correct any inadvertent or erroneous failure to charge.\" \r\nMarshall v. Nugent, 222 F.2d 604, 615 (1st Cir. 1955).\r\nThus, \"[s]ilence after instructions, including instructions on\r\nthe form of the verdict to be returned by the jury, typically\r\nconstitutes a waiver of any objections.\"  Putnam Resources v.\r\nPateman, 958 F.2d 448, 456 (1st Cir. 1992).  It must be\r\nemphasized that \"[i]t is an ironclad rule in this circuit that\r\nfailure to renew objections after the charge constitutes waiver\r\nof any claim of error.\"  United States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d\r\n666, 670-71 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation omitted) (emphasis added);\r\nsee also Marshall, 222 F.2d at 615.\r\nIf a party's objections comply with Rules 49(a) and 51, \"then the\r\n'harmless error' standard of Rule 61 governs the trial or\r\nappellate court's consideration of any request for relief based\r\non the alleged error.\"  Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d\r\n931, 939 (1st Cir. 1995).  Rule 61 provides that \"[n]o error . .\r\n. in anything done or omitted by the court . . . is ground for\r\ngranting a new trial . . . unless refusal to take such action\r\nappears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.\" \r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 61; see also 28 U.S.C.  2111; Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n52.  An error is not harmless if the court is \"in grave doubt as\r\nto the harmlessness of an error that affects substantial rights.\" \r\nO'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 445 (1995); see also Scarfo, 54\r\nF.3d at 939-40 (citing  O'Neal).\r\nThe failure to preserve objections does not entirely preclude our\r\nreview.  In such cases, however, we review only for plain error. \r\nSee Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1995).  \"For an\r\nerror to be such, it must indeed be 'plain,' or 'obvious,' . . .\r\nand it must 'affect substantial rights,'  Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b),\r\nthat is, '[i]t must have affected the outcome of the district\r\ncourt proceedings.'\"  United States v. Fernndez,     F.3d    ,\r\n1998 WL 263427 at *3 (1st Cir. May 29, 1998) (citation omitted)\r\n(emphasis added).  Thus, whereas plain error review permits\r\nreversal only when the court is certain that substantial rights\r\nwere affected, harmless error review requires reversal whenever\r\nthe court harbors grave doubts as to whether the alleged error\r\naffected substantial rights.\r\nMoreover, even when a district court's instructions are plainly\r\nerroneous, we will not remedy any such errors \"[u]nless [we\r\nconclude] that the charge has caused a miscarriage of justice or\r\nhas undermined the integrity of the judicial process.\"  Scarfo,\r\n54 F.3d at 940.  Otherwise, \"the charge is treated as having an\r\neffect closely analogous to [the] law-of-the-case doctrine, and\r\nfor similar reasons of policy and fairness of process.\"  Id.; see\r\nalso  Coy v. Simpson Marine Safety Equip., Inc., 787 F.2d 19, 25\r\n(1st Cir. 1986); Carrillo v. Sameit Westbulk, 514 F.2d 1214, 1219\r\n(1st Cir. 1975); Bouley v. Continental Cas. Co., 454 F.2d 85, 88\r\n(1st Cir. 1972); Dunn v. St. Louis, San Francisco R.R. Co., 370\r\nF.2d 681, 684 (10th Cir. 1966) (Aldrich, J., sitting by\r\ndesignation); see generally United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725\r\n(1993) (under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), a forfeited claim of error\r\nmay be noticed on appeal only if error is plain, affects\r\nsubstantial rights, and a miscarriage of justice would otherwise\r\nresult).\r\nSatisfying Rule 51 requires more than a timely objection.  The\r\nparty making the objection must also state \"distinctly the matter\r\nobjected to and the grounds for the objection.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n51.  \"Failure to object with the requisite particularity forfeits\r\nreview under the 'harmless error' rule.\"   Play Time, Inc. v.\r\nLDDS Metromedia Comm., Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nThis is not a merely technical requirement serving no useful end. \r\nTrial judges are not mind readers.  If there is a problem with\r\nthe instructions, the judge must be told precisely what the\r\nproblem is, and as importantly, what the attorney would consider\r\na satisfactory cure.\r\n\nLinn v. Andover Newton Theological Sch., 874 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\r\n1989).  Thus, for example, this circuit has previously held that\r\nwhere a district court had first indicated that it intended to\r\ngive an instruction, but later failed to do so, the appellant's\r\nreading a list of the numbers of the requested instructions was\r\nnot sufficient to preserve an objection under Rule 51.  See CVD,\r\nInc. v. Raytheon Co., 769 F.2d 842, 858-59 (1st Cir. 1985).  The\r\npanel stated that, because the objection was not accompanied by\r\nany argumentation, it was \"impossible for this Court on appeal to\r\nknow whether the district judge reconsidered his original\r\ndecision that this instruction was proper, or simply omitted this\r\ninstruction through inadvertence.\"  Id. \r\nFinally, we note that objections to instructions need not be\r\nformal; \"it is sufficient that a party . . . makes known to the\r\ncourt the action which the party desires the court to take or the\r\nparty's objection to the action of the court and the grounds\r\ntherefor.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 46 (emphasis added); see alsoCarrillo, 514 F.2d at 1218.  The emphasis is not on the form of\r\nobjections, but rather on ensuring that the trial court had\r\nactual notice of the nature and grounds of the objection.  In one\r\ncase, therefore, a prior panel of this court found that a party\r\nhad preserved its objections under Rule 51 by reserving them in\r\nadvance, when it was clear that the court had understood the\r\nobjections.  See Bouley, 454 F.2d at 88; cf. Harrington v. United\r\nStates, 504 F.2d 1306, 1316-17 (1st Cir. 1974) (objections were\r\npreserved by brief post-charge statement on the record, where\r\nparties had discussed the requested instructions with the judge\r\nat length but off the record).  However, \"we warn parties that\r\nthere is a heavy burden upon them in such event to show that it\r\nwas done with sufficient specificity and distinctness, and we\r\ncaution district courts to be slow in tolerating such procedure.\" \r\nDunn, 370 F.2d at 685.\r\nThus, we must determine whether the defendants properly preserved\r\ntheir objections to the district court's decision not to charge\r\nthe jury on their affirmative defenses.  If the objections were\r\npreserved, then we evaluate whether the district court's decision\r\nwas erroneous.  Finally, if the district court erred, we must\r\nascertain whether the error was harmful.  Only if the answer to\r\nthe last question is affirmative may we vacate the judgment of\r\nthe district court.\r\nB.  Application\r\nThe case before us is a close one.  Taken alone, the defendants'\r\npost-charge objections might well be insufficient to satisfy Rule\r\n51.  Defendants' counsel was referring to Peymann v. Perini Corp.,\r\n507 F.2d 1318 (1st Cir. 1974), which we discuss elsewhere in this\r\nopinion.  However, this case presents a peculiar factual scenario.  A\r\nperusal of the record and trial transcript reveals that, because\r\nthe district court was familiar with the defendants' arguments,\r\nthe post-charge objections submitted by defendants' counsel were\r\nsufficient to give the district court notice of which\r\ninstructions' absence they objected to, as well as the grounds\r\ntherefor.  \r\nAs a general matter, we have noticed that throughout the trial,\r\nthe district court handled all objections to its rulings in an\r\nexpeditious and efficient manner.  Once the court had heard an\r\nargument, understood it, and ruled upon it, it did not want to go\r\nover the same ground again.  The court thus requested that\r\ncounsel subsequently state their objections for the record as\r\nconcisely as possible, discouraging them from repeating at length\r\nagain the basis for their objections.\r\nThe transcript indicates that the court was well aware of the\r\ngrounds for the defendants' objections to the lack of\r\ninstructions on comparative negligence and the primary duty rule. \r\nThe record of this case included a copy of the defendants' first\r\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, on the cover of which the\r\ncourt had written its ruling - \"Denied.\"  The motion was\r\naccompanied by a memorandum of law discussing at length the\r\ndefendants' contention that the evidence heard at trial\r\nestablished that Wilson had both been comparatively negligent and\r\nbeen injured solely as a result of his violation of his own duty\r\nto maintain a safe working environment.  Although it is not clear\r\nwhether the motion was entered on the case docket, we strongly\r\nsuspect that the  handwritten ruling denying the motion is the\r\nruling to which Mr. Clinton refers to in the following exchange:\r\nMR. LATTI [Plaintiff's counsel]: I'd like to move at this time\r\nfor a judgment as a matter of law on the issue of contributory\r\nnegligence of the plaintiff.\r\nTHE COURT: I will not charge on contributory negligence.\r\nMR. LATTI: All right.  When you say you're not going to charge,\r\nis that an issue?\r\nTHE COURT: It's not an issue.\r\nMR. LATTI: All right.\r\nMR. CLINTON [Defendants' counsel]: He addressed it the other day,\r\nand I understood the ruling. (Indicating document.)\r\n\nTranscript, at 6-57 (emphasis supplied).  In any case, this\r\nexcerpt makes it evident that by the sixth day of trial, the\r\ncourt had been presented with detailed arguments on the issues of\r\ncomparative negligence and the primary duty rule, and had\r\ndetermined that there was insufficient evidence to justify\r\ninstructing the jury on those issues.\r\nA subsequent bench conference, during which the court ordered the\r\nparties to agree upon a special verdict form, showed that all of\r\nthe participants, including the deputy clerk, knew quite well\r\nthat the court had ruled that no instruction on comparative\r\nnegligence would be given.  Wilson contends that the defendants'\r\nfailure to argue their objections forcefully and in detail\r\nindicates that those objections had been waived.  We disagree. \r\nIn light of the court's policy toward objections, in general, and\r\nof its prior rulings on the issues of comparative negligence and\r\nthe primary duty rule, in particular, we read the exchange that\r\noccurred during that bench conference as indicating only that the\r\ndefendants were following the court's instructions to hold their\r\nobjections until after the charge, when they would be restated\r\nconcisely to preserve them for appeal.\r\n After the parties' closing arguments, and immediately before the\r\ncourt began its instructions, Mr. Clinton sought some changes to\r\nthe jury instructions.  The judge denied the request, stating:\r\n\"You listen to my instructions.  I am sure you won't like them,\r\nbut you can save your rights after I am through.  Okay?\"  The\r\ncourt's response corroborates our general impression: that the\r\ndistrict court had heard, understood, and denied the defendants'\r\nrequests for instructions, but that it properly allowed the\r\ndefendants to preserve their objections for appeal.  \r\nAfter the court instructed the jury, but before the jury retired\r\nto deliberate, another bench conference was held, during which\r\nthe defendants' counsel stated his objections for the record. \r\nSee supra note 5.  As we mentioned above, if this had been the\r\nonly objection made by the defendants, it probably would not have\r\nsufficed to meet the requirements of Rule 51.  In the context of\r\nthe facts of this case, however, we deem the objection\r\nsufficiently detailed to alert the court of its nature and\r\ngrounds.  It is evident that the court clearly understood the\r\ngist of the defendants' arguments and had already reached a\r\ndetermination upon the merits of those arguments.  The court did\r\nnot, however, wish to curtail the defendants' right to appeal its\r\ndetermination, so it allowed their counsel to state their\r\nobjections for the record in abbreviated form.\r\nWe ended our discussion of practice under Rules 49(a) and 51 by\r\nnoting that, notwithstanding how strictly they are applied, there\r\nwill exist a few, rare occasions in which we will deem objections\r\nto have been preserved if it is shown that the district court had\r\nactual notice of the nature and grounds of the objections.  This\r\ncase is one such occasion.  Earlier in the trial, the district\r\ncourt had clearly rejected the defendants' motion for judgment as\r\na matter of law on the issues of comparative negligence and the\r\nprimary duty rule.  Subsequently, the court rejected their\r\nrequest for instructions on those issues, and thereafter\r\ndiscouraged the defendants' counsel from rehashing the objections\r\nrepeatedly, other than merely noting them for the record. \r\nConsidering the entire interaction between the court and counsel,\r\nwe conclude that the defendants' counsel sufficiently apprised\r\nthe court of their objections and the reasons therefor to\r\npreserve them for appeal.\r\nC.  Failure to give instructions\r\nWilson argues that even if the defendants preserved their\r\nobjections to the court's jury instructions and special verdict\r\nform, the court's decision not to instruct on comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule was correct and therefore\r\nharmless.  Wilson contends that the district court acted\r\ncorrectly in denying the defendants' request for instructions\r\nboth because the instructions they proffered were incomplete, and\r\nbecause the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient to allow\r\na reasonable jury to conclude that he had either acted\r\nnegligently or violated his duties as chief mate.  We are not\r\npersuaded by either argument.\r\nCourts often state in broad terms the rule that a trial court is\r\nunder no obligation to accept a request for an instruction if the\r\nproffered instruction is incorrect in any way.  For example, we\r\nhave remarked that \"the lawyer must propose a lawful instruction\r\nor correction, and not one that substantially overstates the law\r\nin that party's favor.\"  Parker v. City of Nashua, 76 F.3d 9, 12\r\n(1st Cir. 1996) (citing Scarfo, 54 F.3d at 944).  Other circuits\r\nhew to a similar line.  See, e.g., Robinson v. Bump, 894 F.2d\r\n758, 761 (5th Cir. 1990) (\"If an objection is raised against the\r\nfailure to grant a requested instruction, the correctness of the\r\nproposed instruction must be shown as a threshold matter.\").\r\nOf course, a court should not agree to give the specific\r\ninstruction requested by a party if that instruction is incorrect\r\nas a matter of law.  However, the position advocated by Wilson is\r\na different one - that the trial court's decision not to give any\r\ninstructions on comparative negligence and the primary duty rule\r\nwas correct precisely because the specific instructions proposed\r\nby the defendants were either incomplete or incorrect.  \r\nWilson's argument is surely wrong.  There are two separate rules:\r\na) a court must instruct the jury correctly and adequately on\r\ncontrolling issues, see Sullivan v. National Football League, 34\r\nF.3d 1091, 1107 (1st Cir. 1994), and b) a court need not accept a\r\nparticular instruction if it does not accurately state the law,\r\nsee Jerlyn Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Roman Yacht Brokerage, 950 F.2d\r\n60, 68 (1st Cir. 1991).  Consequently, even though a trial court\r\nis under no obligation to give any particular requested\r\ninstruction, \"[i]f the request directs the court's attention to a\r\npoint upon which an instruction to the jury would be helpful, the\r\ncourt's error in failing to charge may not be excused by\r\ntechnical defects in the request.\"  9A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur\r\nR. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure  2552 at 395-97\r\n(1995); see Ouimette v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., 740 F.2d 72, 76 (1st\r\nCir. 1984).  Accordingly, we need not decide whether the\r\ndefendants' proffered instructions were correct as a matter of\r\nlaw.  The requests sufficed to alert the district court to the\r\nneed for some instructions, even if not the specific ones urged\r\nby the defendants, on the affirmative defenses of comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule.\r\nD.  Harmlessness of the error\r\nWe come, therefore, to the merits of the dispute: did the\r\ndistrict court err in failing to charge the jury on comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule?  As mentioned above, a\r\ndistrict court is duty-bound to give instructions on all issues\r\nof material fact raised by the evidence adduced at trial.  The\r\nstandard for determining whether a factual issue is sufficiently\r\ncontested to require an instruction is identical to the standard\r\nfor determining whether a factual controversy prevents the entry\r\nof judgment as a matter of law.  Compare Fashion House, Inc. v. K\r\nMart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1088 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"[A] mere\r\nscintilla of evidence is not enough to forestall a directed\r\nverdict, especially on a claim as to which the burden of proof\r\nbelongs to the objecting party.\"); with Farrell v. Klein Tools,\r\nInc., 866 F.2d 1294, 1297 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"There must be more\r\nthan a scintilla of evidence to support an instruction.\"); cf.United States v. Rodrguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir. 1988) (In\r\ncriminal cases, \"the district court's task [of determining\r\nwhether an issue requires an instruction] bears a resemblance to\r\nits function in determining whether or not a directed verdict or\r\njudgment of acquittal should be ordered.\").  \r\nIn neither situation may the court weigh the evidence, make\r\ncredibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in the proof. \r\nInstead, the court must determine whether the evidence presented\r\nat trial, along with all inferences that may reasonably be drawn\r\ntherefrom, could plausibly support a finding for either party on\r\nany given issue of material fact.  Cf. Transamerica Premier Ins.\r\nCo. v. Ober, 107 F.3d 925, 929 (1st Cir. 1997) (in the Rule 50\r\ncontext, the court makes all reasonable inferences in favor of\r\nthe non-moving party).  \"Because such a decision entails not\r\ndifferential fact-finding, but merely an inquiry into the legal\r\nsufficiency of the evidence, the standard of appellate review .\r\n. . should be plenary.\"  Rodrguez, 858 F.2d at 12; see alsoAnderson, 862 F.2d at 916 (determination whether fact omitted\r\nfrom special verdict form was material to the ultimate issues in\r\nthe case reviewed de novo); Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.\r\nWyman, 718 F.2d 63, 65 (3d Cir. 1983) (trial court's decision not\r\nto give instructions on a particular issue reviewed de novo); but\r\nsee United States v. Gmez-Osorio, 957 F.2d 636, 642 (9th Cir.\r\n1992) (trial court's determination on issue whether required\r\nfactual foundation existed to warrant particular jury instruction\r\nreviewed only for abuse of discretion).\r\nWilson contends that the evidence presented at trial was\r\ninsufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that he was\r\ncontributorily negligent or that the only cause of his injuries\r\nwas his violation of his duties as chief mate.  We disagree. \r\nUnlike at common law, in both Jones Act and unseaworthiness\r\nactions, neither assumption of risk nor contributory negligence\r\nare available as complete defenses to liability.  See Socony-\r\nVacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, 305 U.S. 424, 429-33 (1939).  Instead,\r\nthe admiralty doctrine of comparative negligence applies.  SeeJacob v. New York, 315 U.S. 752, 755 (1942).  This defense\r\nrequires, among other things, evidence that the seaman chose to\r\nperform a task in a manner that placed him in danger despite the\r\nfact that there were safer alternative means available to him. \r\nSee Burden v. Evansville Materials, Inc., 840 F.2d 343, 346 (6th\r\nCir. 1988); 1 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law \r\n6-22 at 324 (2d ed. 1994).  A finding of \"contributory\r\nnegligence, however gross, is not a bar to recovery but only\r\nmitigates damages,\" see Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 305 U.S. at 431,\r\nreducing the plaintiff's recovery in proportion to his or her\r\nnegligence.  Thus, contributory negligence can be a complete\r\ndefense when a jury finds that the plaintiff's own negligence was\r\nthe sole proximate cause of the injuries.\r\nThe primary duty rule provides that a ship's officer may not\r\nrecover against his employer for negligence or unseaworthiness\r\nwhen there is no other cause of the officer's injuries other than\r\nthe officer's breach of his consciously assumed duty to maintain\r\nsafe conditions aboard the vessel.  See Walker v. Lykes Bros.\r\nS.S. Co., 193 F.2d 772, 773 (2d Cir. 1952).  In Boat Dagny, Inc.v. Todd, 224 F.2d 208, 210-11 (1st Cir. 1955), this circuit\r\nexplained that the primary duty rule does not bar recovery where\r\nthe plaintiff breached his duty but the ship's owner was also\r\nindependently at fault.   \"Our decision merely followed the\r\nself-evident proposition that not every breach of duty will\r\nassign a seaman full responsibility for his injury.\"  Peymann v.\r\nPerini Corp., 507 F.2d 1318, 1323 (1st Cir. 1974).  The primary\r\nduty rule bars recovery only if there was no cause of the\r\nofficer's injuries other than the breach of duty.  \"As Judge Hand\r\nnoted in Walker, the bar is not based on the contributory\r\nnegligence of the officer, but on a finding of no negligence of\r\nthe employer.\"  Kelley v. Sun Transp. Co., 900 F.2d 1027, 1031\r\n(7th Cir. 1990).  \r\nAn instruction on comparative negligence must therefore be given\r\nif the evidence establishes a genuine controversy as to whether\r\nWilson placed himself in foreseeable danger even though safer\r\nalternatives were available, and whether his choice was the\r\nproximate cause of his injuries.  Similarly, an instruction on\r\nthe primary duty rule must be given if the evidence establishes a\r\ngenuine controversy as to whether Wilson owed a duty to the\r\ndefendants, whether he breached the duty, and whether that breach\r\nwas the sole proximate cause of his injury.  See Peymann, 507\r\nF.2d at 1323.  We find that the evidence in this case was\r\nsufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find either that Wilson\r\nwas contributorily negligent or that his injuries were caused\r\nexclusively by his own failure to perform his primary duties.\r\nEvidence was presented at trial indicating that Wilson had not\r\nbeen ordered to patch the hydraulic lines while the OVERSEAS\r\nBOSTON was on the high seas.  Indeed, the captain testified that\r\nit had been Wilson who had proposed that the lines be patched. \r\nHe stated that the day prior to Wilson's accident, Wilson had\r\nbeen in tank No. 2C patching another set of hydraulic lines on\r\nthe tank's aft bulkhead, near the bottom.  While conducting those\r\nrepairs, Wilson noticed that some of the lines on the forward\r\nbulkhead were also leaking, but at a much greater height.  He\r\ntherefore ordered that the tank be filled overnight to the 65\r\nfoot mark, so that he could patch the second set of lines the\r\nfollowing day.  In addition to the captain's testimony, the\r\ndefendants' expert testified that no reasonable chief mate would\r\nhave entered a tank that was filled so close to the deck when the\r\nvessel was under way on the high seas, much less without wearing\r\na hard hat and life vest, because of the possibility that waves\r\ncould form in the tank as a result of the normal movement of the\r\nocean's surface.  \r\nMoreover, the plaintiff admitted that prior to this voyage, he\r\nhad never performed repairs inside a tank while the ship was on\r\nthe high seas.  He also admitted that he had the authority to\r\nabort the operations at any point.  Finally, Wilson testified\r\nthat on the morning of January 19, 1994, when he first entered\r\ntank No. 2C, he found the water level too high and thus ordered\r\nit to be lowered an additional 12 to 18 inches.  It was not until\r\nafter the water level had been adjusted that he boarded the raft.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial created a genuine issue of fact\r\nas to whether Wilson had been contributorily negligent.  For\r\nexample, a reasonable jury could find that Wilson was acting\r\nunder his own authority when he decided to patch the hydraulic\r\nlines, and that he was in control of the operation.  A jury could\r\nfind that Wilson should have known that entering a lightless tank\r\nwhen the water level is less than 10 feet from the deck (and less\r\nthan 5 feet from the beams) and the ship is on the open sea could\r\nput him in harm's way if the water level shifted, and that he\r\nshould have foreseen that the swells and waves on the ocean's\r\nsurface could cause the water inside the tanks to shift. \r\nSimilarly, a jury could infer that Wilson knew that the repairs\r\nwere dangerous from his adjustment of the water level prior to\r\nboarding the raft, and from his admission that he had never\r\nperformed this type of repair when the ship was outside of a\r\nharbor.  A jury could also believe that the wave in the tank was\r\nnot caused by the vessel's course change, which would undermine\r\nWilson's claim that his injuries were causally related to the\r\ndefendants' negligence.  \r\nFinally, and most importantly, a jury could conclude that Wilson\r\nwas negligent because a safer course of action had been available\r\nto him.  See Burden, 840 F.2d at 346.  A jury could find that it\r\nwas not necessary for the lines to be repaired while the ship was\r\nat sea.  A jury could therefore find that Wilson could have\r\nchosen to wait until the OVERSEAS BOSTON reached the port at\r\nValdez, Alaska, to perform the repairs on the hydraulic lines.\r\nThis evidence, together with testimony indicating that Wilson's\r\nduties as chief mate included responsibility for the safety and\r\nmaintenance of the ship, in general, and of the line patching\r\noperation, in particular, also suffices to permit a jury to\r\nconclude that the only proximate cause of Wilson's injuries was\r\nhis own failure to perform his duties as chief mate to maintain a\r\nsafe working environment.  \r\nOf course, we do not mean to imply that the evidence compels the\r\nconclusion that Wilson was contributorily negligent or that he\r\nwas injured solely as a result of his violation of his duties. \r\nIn fact, a jury could just as easily disbelieve all of the\r\ntestimony mentioned above, or draw different inferences from it. \r\nWe merely point out that the evidence could have been believed by\r\na jury and could justify a finding that he had acted negligently. \r\nThe defendants were therefore entitled to instructions on both\r\naffirmative defenses.  \r\nMoreover, the district court's erroneous failure to charge the\r\njury on these issues was not harmless error.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n61.  A compelling argument could be made that the failure to give\r\nany instructions on a material issue is harmful per se, but, in\r\nany case, the omission of these particular instructions was\r\nclearly harmful.  The fact that the jury found for Wilson in this\r\ncase does not persuade us otherwise, because we are in grave\r\ndoubt as to whether the jury would have found that Wilson had not\r\nbeen negligent at all, had the jury been instructed as it should\r\nhave been.  For example, even though the defendants provided\r\nevidence at trial that Wilson's breach of his duty to ensure that\r\nshipboard repairs are carried out safely was the sole cause of\r\nhis accident, the lack of an instruction on the primary duty rule\r\ncould have allowed the jury to ignore Wilson's own actions and\r\nthereby to seek another explanation for his accident.  Similarly,\r\nthe lack of an instruction on comparative negligence permitted\r\nthe jury to find that the defendants were, in effect, 100%\r\ncomparatively negligent even though the evidence could support a\r\nfinding that Wilson was at least partially responsible for his\r\nown injuries.\r\nAccordingly, a new trial is required so that a jury may properly\r\nconsider the plaintiff's actions along with the defendants' in\r\ndetermining liability.  See Allen v. Chance Mfg. Co., 873 F.2d\r\n465, 469-70 (1st Cir. 1989) (erroneous jury instruction requires\r\nnew trial if the error could have affected the result of the\r\njury's deliberations).\r\nIII.  Separability of issues on remand\r\nWilson requests that, if the case must be remanded because of an\r\nerror in the instructions, the remand be limited to issues of\r\nliability.  The defendants, on the other hand, contend that they\r\nare entitled to a new trial on all issues, including damages.\r\n\"An appellate court has broad discretion to remand for a new\r\ntrial on all, or only some, of the issues in the case.\"  Dopp v.\r\nHTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 518 (1st Cir. 1991); see also Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 59(a).  Normally, an order remanding a case for a new\r\ntrial should encompass all of the issues in the case, \"unless it\r\nclearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and\r\nseparable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had\r\nwithout injustice.\"  Gasoline Prods. Co. v. Champlin Refining\r\nCo., 283 U.S. 494, 499-500 (1934).  The decision to remand a case\r\nfor a new trial on fewer than all of the issues thus depends not\r\nonly upon a finding that the issues are logically distinct, but\r\nalso upon considerations of equity and practicality.\r\nThe question whether a plaintiff has suffered certain damages\r\ndoes not generally depend, as a matter of law, on whether that\r\nplaintiff is legally entitled to compensation for those damages. \r\nIn this case, for example, the amount of future income that\r\nWilson may have lost as a result of his injuries is independent\r\nof his legal claim to receive full, partial, or no compensation\r\nfor such damages.  In this regard, \"comparative negligence is\r\nregarded as a liability concept.\"  La Plante v. American Honda\r\nMotor Co., 27 F.3d 731, 738 (1st Cir. 1994).  We have held that\r\nthe issues of liability, including issues of comparative\r\nnegligence, were in certain cases \"so distinct and separable from\r\nthe damages issue[s] that a partial trial of the former [could]\r\nbe had without injustice.\"  Id.; see also Winn v. Lafayette Town\r\nHouse, 839 F.2d 835, 836-37 (1st Cir. 1988); Calaf v. Fernndez,\r\n239 F. 795, 799 (1st Cir. 1917).  In La Plante, for example, we\r\nfound particularly compelling the fact that \"the trial judge\r\nsubmitted detailed interrogatories to the jury, [so that] we\r\n[knew] the jury's total damage award to the plaintiff, as well as\r\nthe amount discounted due to comparative negligence.\"  27 F.3d at\r\n738.  Thus, on remand, \"if the comparative negligence figures\r\n[were] changed as a result of the new trial, the total damage\r\naward [could] be adjusted accordingly.\"  Id.\r\nIn theory, the amount awarded by a jury in the form of\r\ncompensatory damages should not be influenced by the jury's\r\nfindings as to liability.  Sometimes, however, the possibility\r\nmay arise that the jury's special verdicts on damages might have\r\nencompassed some undisclosed compromise.  For example, a jury\r\ncould raise the amount of damages awarded if the jurors perceive\r\nthe plaintiff to be particularly deserving of their solicitude,\r\nor the defendant particularly deserving of their opprobrium.  The\r\nlikelihood of this possibility occurring may increase when, as\r\nhere, the jury is given no instruction at all on comparative\r\nnegligence.  In such cases, it might happen that a jury could\r\nunderstand the judge's decision not to instruct on comparative\r\nnegligence as an implicit indication that there was not enough\r\nevidence of the plaintiff's contributory negligence to even\r\nsubmit the question to them.  It is not unimaginable for a jury\r\nto infer from the fact that there was no instruction on\r\ncomparative negligence that the award of damages should be\r\nincreased as an additional sanction.\r\nIn the end, our decision as to the scope of our remand order is a\r\nmatter of judgment.  In this particular case, because of the\r\npossibility that the jury might have been led by the lack of an\r\ninstruction on comparative negligence to increase the total award\r\nof damages, and out of an abundance of caution, we order a\r\nretrial of all issues in this case, including damages.\r\nIV.  Conclusion\r\nBecause we find that the district court's failure to instruct the\r\njury on comparative negligence and the primary duty rule was both\r\nerroneous and prejudicial to the defendants' substantial rights,\r\nwe strike the verdict, vacate the judgment, and remand this case\r\nfor a new trial on all issues, including damages.  The request\r\nfor a remittitur is therefore moot.  No costs.\r\n",

Maritime Overseas\r\n        Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604816\"><a href=\"/opinion/604816/angel-toucet-v-maritime-overseas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n     The plaintiff, Eric Wilson, was employed as a chief mate by\r\nMaritime Overseas Corporation on the M/T OVERSEAS BOSTON, which\r\nwas owned, operated, and controlled by Cambridge Tankers, Inc.\r\n(collectively, \"the defendants\").  On January 19, 1994, the\r\nOVERSEAS BOSTON was approximately 75 miles off the western coast\r\nof Mexico on its way to Valdez, Alaska.  The plaintiff was in a\r\nZodiac inflatable raft in the vessel's No. 2 center cargo tank\r\n(\"tank No. 2C\") trying to patch two leaking hydraulic lines.\r\n     The decision to patch the lines while the OVERSEAS BOSTON was\r\nunderway was made jointly by the captain, the chief engineer, and\r\nWilson, the chief mate.  Several hydraulic lines had been leaking\r\nsince at least 1991, and Wilson and others had placed numerous\r\nrequests with the vessel's owners to replace the lines at a\r\nshipyard.  The hydraulic lines, made out of copper beryllium,\r\ncontrol the valves that regulate the flow of petroleum into and\r\nout of the ship.  The leaks in the lines were a constant source\r\nof worry on the OVERSEAS BOSTON because, if the hydraulic system\r\nfailed, the valves could open without warning, creating the\r\npossibility of an oil spill.  The defendants' established\r\nprocedure for patching hydraulic lines was to fill the tank with\r\nseawater to a height sufficient to allow a seaman on a raft\r\nfloating inside the tank to reach the hydraulic line in question. \r\nThe leaking section of pipe is then cut and replaced with a new\r\nstainless steel section.  There was no other equipment available\r\non the OVERSEAS BOSTON with which to repair the lines.\r\nThe lines that Wilson was patching on the day of the accident ran\r\nvertically down one side of tank no. 2C.  These lines were\r\nleaking near the top of the tank, which is seventy-five feet\r\ndeep.  To reach the lines, Wilson had the tank filled up to\r\napproximately the sixty-five foot mark, so that the raft could\r\nfloat within eight to ten feet of the deck above.  However, the\r\nunderside of the deck on the OVERSEAS BOSTON is spanned from port\r\nto starboard by large metal I-beams, whose vertical span is about\r\nfive feet.  Thus, the clearance between the bottom of each beam\r\nand the surface of the water was only approximately three to five\r\nfeet.\r\nWilson and a seaman climbed aboard the raft, and Wilson knelt in\r\nthe forward section to paddle the raft toward the leaking lines. \r\nThe beams were about one or two feet above his head.  Proceeding\r\nin this manner, Wilson and the seaman went under two beams\r\nwithout incident.  Unbeknownst to Wilson, however, the vessel\r\nchanged course while he was still paddling.  Although the captain\r\nand officers on the bridge knew that Wilson was in the tank, and\r\ncould communicate with him by hand-held radio, they failed to\r\nwarn him of the impending change of course.  Unfortunately, there\r\nwas a wave in the tank (attributed by Wilson to the change in\r\ncourse), which lifted the raft and slammed Wilson against a beam.\r\nAlthough he was in pain, Wilson assumed that he had not been\r\nseriously injured, and decided to continue patching the lines. \r\nWhen he exited the tank about an hour later, he mentioned to the\r\nchief engineer that he had hurt his back.  The captain examined\r\nWilson's back, and told him to rest in his cabin until he felt\r\nbetter.  The pain did not go away, however, and Wilson left the\r\nship to be examined by doctors.  He was told at first that his\r\npain was most likely due to a bad sprain and injury to the soft\r\ntissues along his spine.  After several months, however, Wilson\r\nwas still in pain, especially when he bent his back or climbed\r\nstairs.  Wilson thus consulted a second doctor, who determined\r\nthat Wilson had fractured his spine at the T8 vertebra.  Wilson\r\nremained on medical leave the rest of 1994, during which he\r\nunderwent various rehabilitative treatments for his injury,\r\nincluding wearing a back brace for four months, and receiving\r\nfrequent steroid injections to build up the muscles in his back.\r\nIn January 1995, Wilson's condition had improved enough that he\r\nwas allowed to go back to work as a chief mate on a trial basis. \r\nHe was assigned to work on the OVERSEAS NEW YORK while it was\r\nmoored for maintenance and repairs in Portland, Oregon.  This\r\ntrial period lasted for sixty-five days, during which it became\r\napparent that Wilson's ability to perform his duties as a chief\r\nmate was compromised by the pain that he frequently suffered\r\nwhile climbing stairs or performing other physically-strenuous\r\ntasks.  Nevertheless, his performance of other duties was\r\nexemplary, and he was recommended for promotion to captain, which\r\nwas a less physically-demanding job.\r\nDuring the summer of 1995, in preparation for his imminent\r\npromotion, he was assigned to the OVERSEAS CHICAGO for\r\napproximately one month attached to its captain in preparation\r\nfor his own promotion to captain.  Captain Olsen, the OVERSEAS\r\nCHICAGO's captain, reported that Wilson had performed very well,\r\nand that his promotion was both warranted and due.  A short time\r\nlater, Wilson was asked to obtain a medical certificate that he\r\nwas fit for administrative duties as captain.\r\nAfter obtaining a certification that he was fit for\r\nadministrative duty as a captain, Wilson was assigned to relieve\r\nCaptain Olsen on the OVERSEAS CHICAGO, which was berthed in\r\nPortland, Oregon.  On August 15, 1995, he flew out to Portland,\r\nwent to the OVERSEAS BOSTON, and exchanged command of the ship\r\nwith Captain Olsen.  An hour or two later, Captain Olsen returned\r\nand told Wilson that he had to speak to his superiors at Maritime\r\nOverseas' headquarters in New York.  When Wilson placed the call,\r\nhe was told that the medical certificate was not satisfactory,\r\nbecause it did not certify that he was fully fit for any duty on\r\nthe ship.  Captain Olsen was ordered to relieve Wilson of his\r\ncommand and march him off the ship.  Wilson was given $500 and\r\ntold to stay at a nearby hotel until the matter could be sorted\r\nout.  However, after waiting several days without hearing\r\nanything further, Wilson flew back to his home in Maine.\r\nSoon afterwards, Wilson filed the instant suit in the U.S.\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging  both\r\ndiversity and federal question jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C.\r\n1331, 1332.  In his complaint, Wilson claimed that his\r\ninjuries were caused both by the OVERSEAS BOSTON's unseaworthy\r\ncondition and by the bridge officers' failure to warn him of the\r\nimpending course change.  In their answer to the complaint, the\r\ndefendants denied Wilson's allegations of unseaworthiness and\r\nnegligence, and claimed as affirmative defenses that the sole\r\ncause of Wilson's injuries was either his own negligence, or his\r\nfailure to properly perform his duties as chief mate. \r\nA jury trial started on February 10, 1997.  At the end of the\r\nplaintiff's case, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter\r\nof law on the unseaworthiness and negligence claims.  On\r\nFebruary 19, 1997, the last day of trial, the district court\r\nsummarily denied the motion.  The court also denied the\r\ndefendants' request that he instruct the jury on comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule, as well as their request\r\nthat the jury questionnaire contain questions on those\r\naffirmative defenses.  \r\nThe following day, the jury returned a special verdict for\r\nWilson, finding that the OVERSEAS BOSTON was unseaworthy, that\r\nthe defendants had been negligent, that both the unseaworthiness\r\nand negligence had been proximate causes of Wilson's injuries,\r\nthat his pre- and post-judgment damages totaled $2,000,000, and\r\nthat he was entitled to pre-judgment interest.  On February 28,\r\n1997, the district court entered judgment in accordance with the\r\nverdict in the amount of $2,139,804.93.  \r\nThe defendants timely filed three post-judgment motions: a\r\nrenewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, a motion for a\r\nnew trial, and a motion for remittitur.  The district court\r\ndenied all three motions by means of a one-page order dated June\r\n5, 1997.  The defendants now appeal from the denial of their\r\nmotions.\r\nII.  Objections to instructions\r\nA.  Standard of review\r\nThe defendants' primary argument is that the jury's verdict\r\nshould be set aside and the case remanded for a new trial because\r\nthe jury instructions and questionnaire were incorrect as a\r\nmatter of law, and because these errors prejudiced them.  Before\r\nreaching the merits of the defendants' objections, however, we\r\nmust resolve the threshold issue of whether the defendants\r\nproperly preserved their objections.\r\nObjections to instructions must comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 51,\r\nwhich provides in pertinent part:\r\nNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an\r\ninstruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury\r\nretires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter\r\nobjected to and the grounds of the objection.\r\n\nObjections must also comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(a).  Rule\r\n49(a) permits a court to require a jury to return only a special\r\nverdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue\r\nof fact, and requires the court to give such instructions to the\r\njury \"concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to\r\nenable the jury to make its findings upon each issue.\"  More to\r\nthe point, Rule 49(a) further provides:\r\nIf in so doing, the court omits any issue of fact raised by the\r\npleadings or by the evidence, each party waives the right to a\r\ntrial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury\r\nretires the party demands its submission to the jury.\r\n\nBoth Rule 49(a) and Rule 51 thus require the objecting party to\r\nstate its objections after the charge but before the jury\r\nretires.  \"The object of [these rules] is to afford the trial\r\njudge an opportunity upon second thought, and before it is too\r\nlate, to correct any inadvertent or erroneous failure to charge.\" \r\nMarshall v.

In such cases, however, we review only for plain error. \r\nSee Moore v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195886\"><a href=\"/opinion/195886/moore-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir. 1995).  \"For an\r\nerror to be such, it must indeed be 'plain,' or 'obvious,' . . .\r\nand it must 'affect substantial rights,'  Fed.

Thus, whereas plain error review permits\r\nreversal only when the court is certain that substantial rights\r\nwere affected, harmless error review requires reversal whenever\r\nthe court harbors grave doubts as to whether the alleged error\r\naffected substantial rights.\r\nMoreover, even when a district court's instructions are plainly\r\nerroneous, we will not remedy any such errors \"[u]nless [we\r\nconclude] that the charge has caused a miscarriage of justice or\r\nhas undermined the integrity of the judicial process.\"  Scarfo,\r\n54 F.3d at 940.

Thus, for example, this circuit has previously held that\r\nwhere a district court had first indicated that it intended to\r\ngive an instruction, but later failed to do so, the appellant's\r\nreading a list of the numbers of the requested instructions was\r\nnot sufficient to preserve an objection under Rule 51.  See CVD,\r\nInc. v. Raytheon Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"456324\"><a href=\"/opinion/456324/cvd-incorporated-v-raytheon-company-and-third-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858-59 (1st Cir. 1985).  The\r\npanel stated that, because the objection was not accompanied by\r\nany argumentation, it was \"impossible for this Court on appeal to\r\nknow whether the district judge reconsidered his original\r\ndecision that this instruction was proper, or simply omitted this\r\ninstruction through inadvertence.\"  Id. \r\nFinally, we note that objections to instructions need not be\r\nformal; \"it is sufficient that a party . . . makes known to the\r\ncourt the action which the party desires the court to take or the\r\nparty's objection to the action of the court and the grounds\r\ntherefor.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 46 (emphasis added); see alsoCarrillo, 514 F.2d at 1218.  The emphasis is not on the form of\r\nobjections, but rather on ensuring that the trial court had\r\nactual notice of the nature and grounds of the objection.  In one\r\ncase, therefore, a prior panel of this court found that a party\r\nhad preserved its objections under Rule 51 by reserving them in\r\nadvance, when it was clear that the court had understood the\r\nobjections.  See Bouley, 454 F.2d at 88; cf. Harrington v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322472\"><a href=\"/opinion/322472/harold-e-harrington-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1316-17 (1st Cir. 1974) (objections were\r\npreserved by brief post-charge statement on the record, where\r\nparties had discussed the requested instructions with the judge\r\nat length but off the record).  However, \"we warn parties that\r\nthere is a heavy burden upon them in such event to show that it\r\nwas done with sufficient specificity and distinctness, and we\r\ncaution district courts to be slow in tolerating such procedure.\" \r\nDunn, 370 F.2d at 685.\r\nThus, we must determine whether the defendants properly preserved\r\ntheir objections to the district court's decision not to charge\r\nthe jury on their affirmative defenses.  If the objections were\r\npreserved, then we evaluate whether the district court's decision\r\nwas erroneous.  Finally, if the district court erred, we must\r\nascertain whether the error was harmful.  Only if the answer to\r\nthe last question is affirmative may we vacate the judgment of\r\nthe district court.\r\nB.  Application\r\nThe case before us is a close one.  Taken alone, the defendants'\r\npost-charge objections might well be insufficient to satisfy Rule\r\n51.  Defendants' counsel was referring to Peymann v. Perini Corp.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"323989\"><a href=\"/opinion/323989/hans-peymann-v-perini-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1974), which we discuss elsewhere in this\r\nopinion.  However, this case presents a peculiar factual scenario.  A\r\nperusal of the record and trial transcript reveals that, because\r\nthe district court was familiar with the defendants' arguments,\r\nthe post-charge objections submitted by defendants' counsel were\r\nsufficient to give the district court notice of which\r\ninstructions' absence they objected to, as well as the grounds\r\ntherefor.  \r\nAs a general matter, we have noticed that throughout the trial,\r\nthe district court handled all objections to its rulings in an\r\nexpeditious and efficient manner.  Once the court had heard an\r\nargument, understood it, and ruled upon it, it did not want to go\r\nover the same ground again.  The court thus requested that\r\ncounsel subsequently state their objections for the record as\r\nconcisely as possible, discouraging them from repeating at length\r\nagain the basis for their objections.\r\nThe transcript indicates that the court was well aware of the\r\ngrounds for the defendants' objections to the lack of\r\ninstructions on comparative negligence and the primary duty rule. \r\nThe record of this case included a copy of the defendants' first\r\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, on the cover of which the\r\ncourt had written its ruling - \"Denied.\"  The motion was\r\naccompanied by a memorandum of law discussing at length the\r\ndefendants' contention that the evidence heard at trial\r\nestablished that Wilson had both been comparatively negligent and\r\nbeen injured solely as a result of his violation of his own duty\r\nto maintain a safe working environment.  Although it is not clear\r\nwhether the motion was entered on the case docket, we strongly\r\nsuspect that the  handwritten ruling denying the motion is the\r\nruling to which Mr. Clinton refers to in the following exchange:\r\nMR. LATTI [Plaintiff's counsel]: I'd like to move at this time\r\nfor a judgment as a matter of law on the issue of contributory\r\nnegligence of the plaintiff.\r\nTHE COURT: I will not charge on contributory negligence.\r\nMR. LATTI: All right.  When you say you're not going to charge,\r\nis that an issue?\r\nTHE COURT: It's not an issue.\r\nMR. LATTI: All right.\r\nMR. CLINTON [Defendants' counsel]: He addressed it the other day,\r\nand I understood the ruling. (Indicating document.)\r\n\nTranscript, at 6-57 (emphasis supplied).  In any case, this\r\nexcerpt makes it evident that by the sixth day of trial, the\r\ncourt had been presented with detailed arguments on the issues of\r\ncomparative negligence and the primary duty rule, and had\r\ndetermined that there was insufficient evidence to justify\r\ninstructing the jury on those issues.\r\nA subsequent bench conference, during which the court ordered the\r\nparties to agree upon a special verdict form, showed that all of\r\nthe participants, including the deputy clerk, knew quite well\r\nthat the court had ruled that no instruction on comparative\r\nnegligence would be given.  Wilson contends that the defendants'\r\nfailure to argue their objections forcefully and in detail\r\nindicates that those objections had been waived.  We disagree. \r\nIn light of the court's policy toward objections, in general, and\r\nof its prior rulings on the issues of comparative negligence and\r\nthe primary duty rule, in particular, we read the exchange that\r\noccurred during that bench conference as indicating only that the\r\ndefendants were following the court's instructions to hold their\r\nobjections until after the charge, when they would be restated\r\nconcisely to preserve them for appeal.\r\n After the parties' closing arguments, and immediately before the\r\ncourt began its instructions, Mr. Clinton sought some changes to\r\nthe jury instructions.  The judge denied the request, stating:\r\n\"You listen to my instructions.  I am sure you won't like them,\r\nbut you can save your rights after I am through.  Okay?\"  The\r\ncourt's response corroborates our general impression: that the\r\ndistrict court had heard, understood, and denied the defendants'\r\nrequests for instructions, but that it properly allowed the\r\ndefendants to preserve their objections for appeal.  \r\nAfter the court instructed the jury, but before the jury retired\r\nto deliberate, another bench conference was held, during which\r\nthe defendants' counsel stated his objections for the record. \r\nSee supra note 5.  As we mentioned above, if this had been the\r\nonly objection made by the defendants, it probably would not have\r\nsufficed to meet the requirements of Rule 51.  In the context of\r\nthe facts of this case, however, we deem the objection\r\nsufficiently detailed to alert the court of its nature and\r\ngrounds.  It is evident that the court clearly understood the\r\ngist of the defendants' arguments and had already reached a\r\ndetermination upon the merits of those arguments.  The court did\r\nnot, however, wish to curtail the defendants' right to appeal its\r\ndetermination, so it allowed their counsel to state their\r\nobjections for the record in abbreviated form.\r\nWe ended our discussion of practice under Rules 49(a) and 51 by\r\nnoting that, notwithstanding how strictly they are applied, there\r\nwill exist a few, rare occasions in which we will deem objections\r\nto have been preserved if it is shown that the district court had\r\nactual notice of the nature and grounds of the objections.  This\r\ncase is one such occasion.  Earlier in the trial, the district\r\ncourt had clearly rejected the defendants' motion for judgment as\r\na matter of law on the issues of comparative negligence and the\r\nprimary duty rule.  Subsequently, the court rejected their\r\nrequest for instructions on those issues, and thereafter\r\ndiscouraged the defendants' counsel from rehashing the objections\r\nrepeatedly, other than merely noting them for the record. \r\nConsidering the entire interaction between the court and counsel,\r\nwe conclude that the defendants' counsel sufficiently apprised\r\nthe court of their objections and the reasons therefor to\r\npreserve them for appeal.\r\nC.  Failure to give instructions\r\nWilson argues that even if the defendants preserved their\r\nobjections to the court's jury instructions and special verdict\r\nform, the court's decision not to instruct on comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule was correct and therefore\r\nharmless.  Wilson contends that the district court acted\r\ncorrectly in denying the defendants' request for instructions\r\nboth because the instructions they proffered were incomplete, and\r\nbecause the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient to allow\r\na reasonable jury to conclude that he had either acted\r\nnegligently or violated his duties as chief mate.  We are not\r\npersuaded by either argument.\r\nCourts often state in broad terms the rule that a trial court is\r\nunder no obligation to accept a request for an instruction if the\r\nproffered instruction is incorrect in any way.  For example, we\r\nhave remarked that \"the lawyer must propose a lawful instruction\r\nor correction, and not one that substantially overstates the law\r\nin that party's favor.\"  Parker v.

Other circuits\r\nhew to a similar line.  See, e.g., Robinson v.

However, the position advocated by Wilson is\r\na different one - that the trial court's decision not to give any\r\ninstructions on comparative negligence and the primary duty rule\r\nwas correct precisely because the specific instructions proposed\r\nby the defendants were either incomplete or incorrect.  \r\nWilson's argument is surely wrong.  There are two separate rules:\r\na) a court must instruct the jury correctly and adequately on\r\ncontrolling issues, see Sullivan v.

Consequently, even though a trial court\r\nis under no obligation to give any particular requested\r\ninstruction, \"[i]f the request directs the court's attention to a\r\npoint upon which an instruction to the jury would be helpful, the\r\ncourt's error in failing to charge may not be excused by\r\ntechnical defects in the request.\"  9A Charles A.

Accordingly, we need not decide whether the\r\ndefendants' proffered instructions were correct as a matter of\r\nlaw.  The requests sufficed to alert the district court to the\r\nneed for some instructions, even if not the specific ones urged\r\nby the defendants, on the affirmative defenses of comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule.\r\nD.  Harmlessness of the error\r\nWe come, therefore, to the merits of the dispute: did the\r\ndistrict court err in failing to charge the jury on comparative\r\nnegligence and the primary duty rule?  As mentioned above, a\r\ndistrict court is duty-bound to give instructions on all issues\r\nof material fact raised by the evidence adduced at trial.  The\r\nstandard for determining whether a factual issue is sufficiently\r\ncontested to require an instruction is identical to the standard\r\nfor determining whether a factual controversy prevents the entry\r\nof judgment as a matter of law.

A finding of \"contributory\r\nnegligence, however gross, is not a bar to recovery but only\r\nmitigates damages,\" see Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 305 U.S. at 431,\r\nreducing the plaintiff's recovery in proportion to his or her\r\nnegligence.  Thus, contributory negligence can be a complete\r\ndefense when a jury finds that the plaintiff's own negligence was\r\nthe sole proximate cause of the injuries.\r\nThe primary duty rule provides that a ship's officer may not\r\nrecover against his employer for negligence or unseaworthiness\r\nwhen there is no other cause of the officer's injuries other than\r\nthe officer's breach of his consciously assumed duty to maintain\r\nsafe conditions aboard the vessel.

Similarly, an instruction on\r\nthe primary duty rule must be given if the evidence establishes a\r\ngenuine controversy as to whether Wilson owed a duty to the\r\ndefendants, whether he breached the duty, and whether that breach\r\nwas the sole proximate cause of his injury.  See Peymann, 507\r\nF.2d at 1323.  We find that the evidence in this case was\r\nsufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find either that Wilson\r\nwas contributorily negligent or that his injuries were caused\r\nexclusively by his own failure to perform his primary duties.\r\nEvidence was presented at trial indicating that Wilson had not\r\nbeen ordered to patch the hydraulic lines while the OVERSEAS\r\nBOSTON was on the high seas.  Indeed, the captain testified that\r\nit had been Wilson who had proposed that the lines be patched. \r\nHe stated that the day prior to Wilson's accident, Wilson had\r\nbeen in tank No. 2C patching another set of hydraulic lines on\r\nthe tank's aft bulkhead, near the bottom.  While conducting those\r\nrepairs, Wilson noticed that some of the lines on the forward\r\nbulkhead were also leaking, but at a much greater height.  He\r\ntherefore ordered that the tank be filled overnight to the 65\r\nfoot mark, so that he could patch the second set of lines the\r\nfollowing day.  In addition to the captain's testimony, the\r\ndefendants' expert testified that no reasonable chief mate would\r\nhave entered a tank that was filled so close to the deck when the\r\nvessel was under way on the high seas, much less without wearing\r\na hard hat and life vest, because of the possibility that waves\r\ncould form in the tank as a result of the normal movement of the\r\nocean's surface.  \r\nMoreover, the plaintiff admitted that prior to this voyage, he\r\nhad never performed repairs inside a tank while the ship was on\r\nthe high seas.  He also admitted that he had the authority to\r\nabort the operations at any point.  Finally, Wilson testified\r\nthat on the morning of January 19, 1994, when he first entered\r\ntank No. 2C, he found the water level too high and thus ordered\r\nit to be lowered an additional 12 to 18 inches.  It was not until\r\nafter the water level had been adjusted that he boarded the raft.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial created a genuine issue of fact\r\nas to whether Wilson had been contributorily negligent.  For\r\nexample, a reasonable jury could find that Wilson was acting\r\nunder his own authority when he decided to patch the hydraulic\r\nlines, and that he was in control of the operation.  A jury could\r\nfind that Wilson should have known that entering a lightless tank\r\nwhen the water level is less than 10 feet from the deck (and less\r\nthan 5 feet from the beams) and the ship is on the open sea could\r\nput him in harm's way if the water level shifted, and that he\r\nshould have foreseen that the swells and waves on the ocean's\r\nsurface could cause the water inside the tanks to shift. \r\nSimilarly, a jury could infer that Wilson knew that the repairs\r\nwere dangerous from his adjustment of the water level prior to\r\nboarding the raft, and from his admission that he had never\r\nperformed this type of repair when the ship was outside of a\r\nharbor.  A jury could also believe that the wave in the tank was\r\nnot caused by the vessel's course change, which would undermine\r\nWilson's claim that his injuries were causally related to the\r\ndefendants' negligence.  \r\nFinally, and most importantly, a jury could conclude that Wilson\r\nwas negligent because a safer course of action had been available\r\nto him.  See Burden, 840 F.2d at 346.  A jury could find that it\r\nwas not necessary for the lines to be repaired while the ship was\r\nat sea.  A jury could therefore find that Wilson could have\r\nchosen to wait until the OVERSEAS BOSTON reached the port at\r\nValdez, Alaska, to perform the repairs on the hydraulic lines.\r\nThis evidence, together with testimony indicating that Wilson's\r\nduties as chief mate included responsibility for the safety and\r\nmaintenance of the ship, in general, and of the line patching\r\noperation, in particular, also suffices to permit a jury to\r\nconclude that the only proximate cause of Wilson's injuries was\r\nhis own failure to perform his duties as chief mate to maintain a\r\nsafe working environment.  \r\nOf course, we do not mean to imply that the evidence compels the\r\nconclusion that Wilson was contributorily negligent or that he\r\nwas injured solely as a result of his violation of his duties. \r\nIn fact, a jury could just as easily disbelieve all of the\r\ntestimony mentioned above, or draw different inferences from it. \r\nWe merely point out that the evidence could have been believed by\r\na jury and could justify a finding that he had acted negligently. \r\nThe defendants were therefore entitled to instructions on both\r\naffirmative defenses.  \r\nMoreover, the district court's erroneous failure to charge the\r\njury on these issues was not harmless error.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n61.  A compelling argument could be made that the failure to give\r\nany instructions on a material issue is harmful per se, but, in\r\nany case, the omission of these particular instructions was\r\nclearly harmful.  The fact that the jury found for Wilson in this\r\ncase does not persuade us otherwise, because we are in grave\r\ndoubt as to whether the jury would have found that Wilson had not\r\nbeen negligent at all, had the jury been instructed as it should\r\nhave been.  For example, even though the defendants provided\r\nevidence at trial that Wilson's breach of his duty to ensure that\r\nshipboard repairs are carried out safely was the sole cause of\r\nhis accident, the lack of an instruction on the primary duty rule\r\ncould have allowed the jury to ignore Wilson's own actions and\r\nthereby to seek another explanation for his accident.  Similarly,\r\nthe lack of an instruction on comparative negligence permitted\r\nthe jury to find that the defendants were, in effect, 100%\r\ncomparatively negligent even though the evidence could support a\r\nfinding that Wilson was at least partially responsible for his\r\nown injuries.\r\nAccordingly, a new trial is required so that a jury may properly\r\nconsider the plaintiff's actions along with the defendants' in\r\ndetermining liability.  See Allen v. Chance Mfg. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522150\"><a href=\"/opinion/522150/paul-h-allen-v-chance-manufacturing-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469-70 (1st Cir. 1989) (erroneous jury instruction requires\r\nnew trial if the error could have affected the result of the\r\njury's deliberations).\r\nIII.  Separability of issues on remand\r\nWilson requests that, if the case must be remanded because of an\r\nerror in the instructions, the remand be limited to issues of\r\nliability.  The defendants, on the other hand, contend that they\r\nare entitled to a new trial on all issues, including damages.\r\n\"An appellate court has broad discretion to remand for a new\r\ntrial on all, or only some, of the issues in the case.\"  Dopp v.\r\nHTP Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570480\"><a href=\"/opinion/570480/paul-s-dopp-v-htp-corporation-paul-s-dopp-v-htp-corporation-paul-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518 (1st Cir. 1991); see also Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 59(a).  Normally, an order remanding a case for a new\r\ntrial should encompass all of the issues in the case, \"unless it\r\nclearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and\r\nseparable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had\r\nwithout injustice.\"  Gasoline Prods. Co. v. Champlin Refining\r\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499-500 (1934).  The decision to remand a case\r\nfor a new trial on fewer than all of the issues thus depends not\r\nonly upon a finding that the issues are logically distinct, but\r\nalso upon considerations of equity and practicality.\r\nThe question whether a plaintiff has suffered certain damages\r\ndoes not generally depend, as a matter of law, on whether that\r\nplaintiff is legally entitled to compensation for those damages. \r\nIn this case, for example, the amount of future income that\r\nWilson may have lost as a result of his injuries is independent\r\nof his legal claim to receive full, partial, or no compensation\r\nfor such damages.  In this regard, \"comparative negligence is\r\nregarded as a liability concept.\"  La Plante v. American Honda\r\nMotor Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672852\"><a href=\"/opinion/672852/39-fed-r-evid-serv-987-prodliabrep-cch-p-13935-arthur-h-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738 (1st Cir. 1994).  We have held that\r\nthe issues of liability, including issues of comparative\r\nnegligence, were in certain cases \"so distinct and separable from\r\nthe damages issue[s] that a partial trial of the former [could]\r\nbe had without injustice.\"  Id.; see also Winn v. Lafayette Town\r\nHouse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501805\"><a href=\"/opinion/501805/frederick-winn-of-the-estate-of-marguerite-winn-v-lafayette-town-house/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836-37 (1st Cir. 1988); Calaf v. Fernndez,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799 (1st Cir. 1917).  In La Plante, for example, we\r\nfound particularly compelling the fact that \"the trial judge\r\nsubmitted detailed interrogatories to the jury, [so that] we\r\n[knew] the jury's total damage award to the plaintiff, as well as\r\nthe amount discounted due to comparative negligence.\"  27 F.3d at\r\n738.  Thus, on remand, \"if the comparative negligence figures\r\n[were] changed as a result of the new trial, the total damage\r\naward [could] be adjusted accordingly.\"  Id.\r\nIn theory, the amount awarded by a jury in the form of\r\ncompensatory damages should not be influenced by the jury's\r\nfindings as to liability.  Sometimes, however, the possibility\r\nmay arise that the jury's special verdicts on damages might have\r\nencompassed some undisclosed compromise.  For example, a jury\r\ncould raise the amount of damages awarded if the jurors perceive\r\nthe plaintiff to be particularly deserving of their solicitude,\r\nor the defendant particularly deserving of their opprobrium.  The\r\nlikelihood of this possibility occurring may increase when, as\r\nhere, the jury is given no instruction at all on comparative\r\nnegligence.  In such cases, it might happen that a jury could\r\nunderstand the judge's decision not to instruct on comparative\r\nnegligence as an implicit indication that there was not enough\r\nevidence of the plaintiff's contributory negligence to even\r\nsubmit the question to them.  It is not unimaginable for a jury\r\nto infer from the fact that there was no instruction on\r\ncomparative negligence that the award of damages should be\r\nincreased as an additional sanction.\r\nIn the end, our decision as to the scope of our remand order is a\r\nmatter of judgment.  In this particular case, because of the\r\npossibility that the jury might have been led by the lack of an\r\ninstruction on comparative negligence to increase the total award\r\nof damages, and out of an abundance of caution, we order a\r\nretrial of all issues in this case, including damages.\r\nIV.  Conclusion\r\nBecause we find that the district court's failure to instruct the\r\njury on comparative negligence and the primary duty rule was both\r\nerroneous and prejudicial to the defendants' substantial rights,\r\nwe strike the verdict, vacate the judgment, and remand this case\r\nfor a new trial on all issues, including damages.  The request\r\nfor a remittitur is therefore moot.  No costs.\r\n</pre>",
