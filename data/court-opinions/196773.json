Felix Gonzalez-Aleman  (claimant) appeals\r                            \r\r\n\nfrom a district  court judgment affirming  a decision of  the\r\n\nSecretary  of  Health  and  Human Services  finding  him  not\r\n\ndisabled as of April 28, 1992.  For the following reasons, we\r\n\nvacate and remand.\r\n\n     On September 7,  1990, claimant was involved  in a motor\r\n\nvehicle accident and sustained  fractures of the pelvis, left\r\n\nhip,  left femur,  and  left ankle.    On October  25,  1990,\r\n\nclaimant  applied  for disability  benefits alleging  that he\r\n\ncould  not stand or  walk due  to these  fractures.   He also\r\n\nalleged that sitting  caused pain  in the  pelvic region  and\r\n\nhips.  The  Social Security Administration  denied claimant's\r\n\napplication initially and on reconsideration.  \r\n\n     After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found\r\n\nthat claimant  was under a disability  beginning September 7,\r\n\n1990 and continuing through April 27, 1992.  However, the ALJ\r\n\nfound   that  after  April   27,  1992,  claimant's  residual\r\n\nfunctional  capacity  increased  to  a  capacity  to  perform\r\n\nsedentary work.   Since  claimant's past  work  as a  machine\r\n\noperator  required more  than  sedentary  exertion,  the  ALJ\r\n\ndetermined that he could not perform this work.  The ALJ then\r\n\nproceeded to step  five of the sequential  analysis.  Relying\r\n\non  the Grid,  the ALJ  found that  claimant is  not disabled\r\n\nbecause there is  a broad range of  unskilled, sedentary jobs\r\n\nexisting in the national economy which he can perform.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     The Appeals Council denied review.  Claimant appealed to\r\n\nthe  district court which  affirmed the Secretary's decision.\r\n\nThis appeal followed. \r\n\n     Claimant  argues that the ALJ erred at step three of the\r\n\nsequential analysis  in not finding  that he met  or equalled\r\n\nListed Impairment   1.03 (arthritis of a major weight-bearing\r\n\njoint), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1.1  We  disagree.\r                                                         1\r\n\nThe  record  does  contain  some  evidence  of  arthritis  in\r\n\nclaimant's left  ankle, as well as  significant limitation of\r\n\nmovement  in  this  joint.    However,  although  the  record\r\n\ncontains X-rays,  there is no indication  of gross anatomical\r\n\ndeformity   of  a  hip  or  knee  as  required  by     1.03A.\r\n\nSimilarly, it  does not appear that the  surgery performed on\r\n\nclaimant's left leg satisfies    1.03B.  In any  event, given\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1The following condition is listed at   1.03:\r               1\r\n\n               Arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint (due\r\n          to any cause):\r\n\n               With  history of  persistent  joint  pain  and\r\n          stiffness with signs of marked limitation of motion\r\n          or abnormal motion of the affected joint on current\r\n          physical examination.  With:\r\n\n          A.   Gross  anatomical  deformity  of  hip  or knee\r\n          (e.g.  subluxation,  contracture,  bony or  fibrous\r\n          ankylosis, instability) supported by X-ray evidence\r\n          of  either  significant  joint  space  narrowing or\r\n          significant bony destruction and  markedly limiting\r\n          ability to walk and stand; or\r\n\n          B.   Reconstructive surgery or surgical arthrodesis\r\n          of a major weight-bearing  joint and return to full\r\n          weight-bearing  status did  not  occur, or  is  not\r\n          expected to occur, within 12 months of onset.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nevidence in  the record  that claimant's fractures  are well-\r\n\nhealed, that  he can walk or stand for up to three hours, and\r\n\nthat he can carry up to thirty pounds, we think the ALJ could\r\n\nfind that  claimant's condition neither met  nor equalled the\r\n\nlisting.  We add that although claimant was continuing to see\r\n\nhis orthopedic  surgeon, he  proffered no medical  opinion to\r\n\nsupport his claim that  he was still markedly limited  in his\r\n\nability to  walk and  his leg  had not  yet returned to  full\r\n\nweight-bearing status.  See  Torres v. Secretary of Health  &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman Servs., 870  F.2d 742, 745  (1st Cir. 1989)  (observing\r                        \r\n\nthat  it is  the claimant's  burden to  show that  he has  an\r\n\nimpairment that meets or equals a listing).\r\n\n     Similarly, we  reject claimant's  argument that  the ALJ\r\n\ncould not  properly find  that his  condition improved.   The\r\n\northopedic  evaluations  by  examining  consultants  for  the\r\n\nSecretary  reflect steady  progress.   On  January 18,  1991,\r\n\nclaimant  could not carry any  body weight, and  he could not\r\n\nstand or walk without the use of crutches.  On June 25, 1991,\r\n\nthe femur  fracture was  still healing and  claimant required\r\n\nthe  assistance of a  walker.  By  April 27,  1992, the femur\r\n\nfracture was well-healed.  Dr. Marrero, who examined claimant\r\n\non  that  date,  completed  a  residual  functional  capacity\r\n\nassessment  (RFC) which amply  supports the  ALJ's conclusion\r\n\nthat claimant has the exertional capacity for sedentary work.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     We  are,  however,  persuaded  that there  is  merit  to\r\n\nclaimant's argument that the ALJ's determination at step five\r\n\ncannot be  upheld under the  \"substantial evidence\" standard.\r\n\nAt this  stage in the sequential analysis,  the burden shifts\r\n\nto the Secretary  to prove that there  are sufficient numbers\r\n\nof jobs  in the national  economy that claimant  can perform.\r\n\nSee Heggarty  v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 995 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                     \r\n\nWhere   claimant's   impairments   involve    only   strength\r\n\nlimitations, the ALJ may rely on the Grid to meet its burden.\r\n\nId.     However,   where   a  claimant   has   non-exertional\r               \r\n\nimpairments,  the  Grid   may  not  accurately   reflect  the\r\n\navailability of suitable jobs.  Id. \r                                               \r\n\n     Dr. Marrero's  RFC indicates that claimant  has a number\r\n\nof  non-exertional  limitations.     Most  notably,  the  RFC\r\n\nindicates that claimant can never climb and is limited in his\r\n\nability  to  be  around  moving  machinery.    The  narrative\r\n\ncomments do  not  further illuminate,  at least  for the  lay\r\n\nreader,  the   nature   or   extent   of   these   particular\r\n\nrestrictions.  The ALJ does not mention these restrictions at\r\n\nall  in her decision.  Under the circumstances, this court is\r\n\nleft without any basis for determining whether the claimant's\r\n\nnon-exertional limitations are sufficiently minimal to permit\r\n\nthe  ALJ to rely on  the Grid or  whether vocational evidence\r\n\nwas required.  We  note that even sedentary work  may require\r\n\nthe ability to  ascend or  descend stairs on  a daily  basis.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nSee SSR  85-15 (observing  that usual everyday  activities at\r               \r\n\nwork  include ascending or descending ramps or a few stairs).\r\n\nMoreover,   the  Secretary's   own  regulations   state  that\r\n\napproximately 85 percent of  unskilled, sedentary jobs are in\r\n\nthe machine trades and benchwork occupational categories.  20\r\n\nC.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 2,   201.00.  \r\n\n     Accordingly, a  remand is required for  further findings\r\n\nwhich  may in  turn require  the consideration  of vocational\r\n\nevidence.   In  light  of our  disposition  we leave  to  the\r\n\nsecretary to consider  in the first  instance, to the  extent\r\n\nrelevant, claimant's argument that  additional non-exertional\r\n\nlimitations found  by Dr.  Marrero precluded reliance  on the\r\n\nGrid.   With  respect to  claimant's allegation  of disabling\r\n\npain, however,  we note  that the  ALJ found  that claimant's\r\n\n\"subjective symptomatology  does not significantly  affect or\r\n\ncompromise  his ability to do  sedentary work.\"  Claimant has\r\n\nmade no meaningful argument that this finding was in error.  \r\n\n     Vacated and remanded.\r                                     \r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n",

For the following reasons, we vacate and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1990, claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained fractures of the pelvis, left hip, left femur, and left ankle.   On October 25, 1990, claimant applied for disability benefits alleging that he could not stand or walk due to these fractures.   He also alleged that sitting caused pain in the pelvic region and hips.   The Social Security Administration denied claimant's application initially and on reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that claimant was under a disability beginning September 7, 1990 and continuing through April 27, 1992.   However, the ALJ found that after April 27, 1992, claimant's residual functional capacity increased to a capacity to perform sedentary work.   Since claimant's past work as a machine operator required more than sedentary exertion, the ALJ determined that he could not perform this work.   The ALJ then proceeded to step five of the sequential analysis.   Relying on the Grid, the ALJ found that claimant is not disabled because there is a broad range of unskilled, sedentary jobs existing in the national economy which he can perform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appeals Council denied review.   Claimant appealed to the district court which affirmed the Secretary's decision.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant argues that the ALJ erred at step three of the sequential analysis in not finding that he met or equalled Listed Impairment &#167; 1.03 (arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt.   P, App. 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We disagree.   The record does contain some evidence of arthritis in claimant's left ankle, as well as significant limitation of movement in this joint.   However, although the record contains X-rays, there is no indication of gross anatomical deformity of a hip or knee as required by &#167; 1.03A. Similarly, it does not appear that the surgery performed on claimant's left leg satisfies &#167; 1.03B. In any event, given evidence in the record that claimant's fractures are well-healed, that he can walk or stand for up to three hours, and that he can carry up to thirty pounds, we think the ALJ could find that claimant's condition neither met nor equalled the listing.   We add that although claimant was continuing to see his orthopedic surgeon, he proffered no medical opinion to support his claim that he was still markedly limited in his ability to walk and his leg had not yet returned to full weight-bearing status.  See Torres v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520289\"><a href=\"/opinion/520289/25-socsecrepser-206-unemplinsrep-cch-14558a-ernesto-del-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 745 (1st Cir.1989) (observing that it is the claimant's burden to show that he has an impairment that meets or equals a listing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we reject claimant's argument that the ALJ could not properly find that his condition improved.   The orthopedic evaluations by examining consultants for the Secretary reflect steady progress.   On January 18, 1991, claimant could not carry any body weight, and he could not stand or walk without the use of crutches.   On June 25, 1991, the femur fracture was still healing and claimant required the assistance of a walker.   By April 27, 1992, the femur fracture was well-healed.   Dr. Marrero, who examined claimant on that date, completed a residual functional capacity assessment (RFC) which amply supports the ALJ's conclusion that claimant has the exertional capacity for sedentary work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, however, persuaded that there is merit to claimant's argument that the ALJ's determination at step five cannot be upheld under the \"substantial evidence\" standard.   At this stage in the sequential analysis, the burden shifts to the Secretary to prove that there are sufficient numbers of jobs in the national economy that claimant can perform.  See Heggarty v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571056\"><a href=\"/opinion/571056/35-socsecrepser-400-unemplinsrep-cch-p-16302a-david-heggarty-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span>, 995 (1st Cir.1991).   Where claimant's impairments involve only strength limitations, the ALJ may rely on the Grid to meet its burden.   Id. However, where a claimant has non-exertional impairments, the Grid may not accurately reflect the availability of suitable jobs.   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Marrero's RFC indicates that claimant has a number of non-exertional limitations.   Most notably, the RFC indicates that claimant can never climb and is limited in his ability to be around moving machinery.   The narrative comments do not further illuminate, at least for the lay reader, the nature or extent of these particular restrictions.   The ALJ does not mention these restrictions at all in her decision.   Under the circumstances, this court is left without any basis for determining whether the claimant's non-exertional limitations are sufficiently minimal to permit the ALJ to rely on the Grid or whether vocational evidence was required.   We note that even sedentary work may require the ability to ascend or descend stairs on a daily basis.   See SSR 85-15 (observing that usual everyday activities at work include ascending or descending ramps or a few stairs).   Moreover, the Secretary's own regulations state that approximately 85 percent of unskilled, sedentary jobs are in the machine trades and benchwork occupational categories.   20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt.   P, App. 2, &#167; 201.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, a remand is required for further findings which may in turn require the consideration of vocational evidence.   In light of our disposition we leave to the secretary to consider in the first instance, to the extent relevant, claimant's argument that additional non-exertional limitations found by Dr. Marrero precluded reliance on the Grid.  With respect to claimant's allegation of disabling pain, however, we note that the ALJ found that claimant's \"subjective symptomatology does not significantly affect or compromise his ability to do sedentary work.\"   Claimant has made no meaningful argument that this finding was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The following condition is listed at &#167; 1.03:</p>\n        <p>Arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint (due to any cause):</p>\n        <p>With history of persistent joint pain and stiffness with signs of marked limitation of motion or abnormal motion of the affected joint on current physical examination.
