Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Victor Davila on Memorandum pro se.\n     Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\nJoel J. Berner, Counsel, Department of Correction, on Memorandum\nof Law for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       December 27, 2000\n\f          Per Curiam. Appellant Victor Davila presently is\n\nincarcerated at M.C.I. Cedar Junction in Massachusetts.                  He\n\nfiled the instant civil rights action against various prison\n\nofficials.      The    district   court    granted       the   defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss the case and appellant now appeals.\n\n          As its first reason for dismissal, the court held\n\nthat there currently was pending a class-action suit in the\n\nMassachusetts        Suffolk    Superior   Court     which       concerned\n\nsubstantially the same issues appellant was raising in the\n\nfederal action and in which appellant was a class member.\n\nAlthough the district court did not cite to any authority in\n\nrelying   on   the    pending   state   case   as    a    reason   not   to\n\nconsider appellant's claims, the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nColorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,\n\n424 U.S. 800 (1976), covers this situation.\n\n               In Colorado River . . . the Supreme\n          Court listed various circumstances under\n          which a federal district court might\n          decline to exercise jurisdiction based\n          on the pendency of a state action\n          arising out of the same transaction.\n          The Colorado River approach was premised\n          upon \"consideration of 'wise judicial\n          administration,    giving   regard    to\n          conservation of judicial resources and\n          comprehensive       disposition       of\n          litigation.'\"\n\fGonzalez v. Cruz, 926 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n              Based on the particular circumstances of this case,\n\nwe think that the deferral of federal jurisdiction under\n\nColorado      River    is     warranted.        The   federal    case    is\n\nduplicative of the state case, appellant essentially having\n\nconceded that he is a member of the plaintiff class of\n\nprisoners in the state suit and that the suit concerns\n\nsubstantially the same issues as in the federal action.                 See\n\nCongress Credit Corp. v. AJC Int'l, Inc., 42 F.3d 686, 689-\n\n90 (1st Cir. 1994).          The state court was the first to obtain\n\njurisdiction and the litigation there has progressed much\n\nfurther.      See Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).     Finally, there is no question that the state court\n\nis     adequate   to       protect   appellant's      rights.     Indeed,\n\nappellant basically was asking for a deferral of federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction, as per Colorado River, when he requested\n\na stay due to the pendency of the state court suit.\n\n              In closing, we note that, in referring to the\n\npending state case and opining that the issues in that case\n\nwere    the   same    as    the   issues   in   the   federal   case,   the\n\ndistrict court specifically declined to offer any views\n\nconcerning the merits of these issues.                 Because we agree\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fwith the district court's conclusion regarding the nature of\n\nthe    state   case        and    because   we   find    Colorado      River\n\napplicable, we emphasize that we, too, express no view on\n\nthe merits of appellant's claims or on the second part of\n\nthe district court's decision.              In this second part, the\n\ndistrict court, in paragraphs labeled A through D, concluded\n\nthat   if   appellant       were   attempting    to    raise    any   claims\n\nseparate from the ones involved in the state litigation, he\n\nhad failed to state a claim.            Appellant has not adequately\n\nidentified any separate claims, so we need not pass on\n\nparagraphs A through D.\n\n            Based     on    the    foregoing,    the    order    dismissing\n\nappellant's action is vacated and the case is remanded for\n\nreinstatement and for issuance of a stay of the proceedings\n\npending the disposition of the prisoner-plaintiffs' case\n\nagainst the defendants in the state court.                     The district\n\ncourt is, of course, free to vacate the stay, or to issue\n\nother orders in the event the circumstances change.\n\n            So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
