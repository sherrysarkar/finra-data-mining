Quite  the  contrary,\r\n\nhowever, the  district court's explicit adoption  of the findings\r\n\nproposed in  the PSR  left no doubt  whatever, either  as to  the\r\n\ngrounds  relied upon  or their  adequacy.   See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTracy,  36 F.3d 199, 203  (1st Cir. 1994)  (sentencing court need\r               \r\n\nnot set  out subsidiary  findings provided its  ultimate findings\r\n\nand grounds plainly appear  in record).  Nor were  the statements\r\n\nupon  which the district court findings were based susceptible to\r\n\ninnocent interpretation.   See  United States  v. Clark,  84 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n506,  509-10 (1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, 117  S.

See id. at 510.\r                          \r\n\n          Second, Smith challenges the special  condition imposed\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Although Smith  failed to assert his  claims below, thereby\r\nimplicating \"plain  error\" review, see United  States v.

Smith  contends  that the  prohibition\r\n\nagainst  using alcohol  constituted an  abuse of  discretion, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.

See id. (no abuse of discretion in requiring\r                                      \r\n\ndefendant  to abstain from using  and possessing alcohol in light\r\n\nof personal history and continuing alcohol abuse).  Smith conced-\r\n\ned  that he has an \"abjectly appalling record of driving vehicles\r\n\nwhile under the  influence of alcohol\"  and admitted violating  a\r\n\ncondition  of his  bail by  consuming alcohol  within twenty-four\r\n\nhours before  entering his guilty plea  in this case.
