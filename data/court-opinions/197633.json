Plaintiff  Russell Brown has  appealed the\r                            \r\n\ngrant of  summary judgment in  favor of defendants.   Brown's\r\n\nappellate brief  is inappropriately  styled  as if  it was  a\r\n\nmotion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).  We do not consider\r\n\nsuch motions  in the first instance.   In any event,  we have\r\n\ncarefully  considered the parties'  briefs and the  record on\r\n\nappeal.    Nothing  that  Brown  has  raised in  this  appeal\r\n\nwarrants overturning  the district  court's grant  of summary\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  Loc.
