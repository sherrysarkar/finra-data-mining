Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n          Aldrich and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Paul F. Galvin with whom Randal C. Fritz was on brief for\r\nappellants.\r\n   John F. Daly with whom Mark B. Stern, Attorneys, Appellate\r\nStaff, Stephen W. Preston, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Frank W. Hunger,\r\nAssistant Attorney General, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 1, 1998\r\n\n ALDRICH, Senior Circuit Judge.  On November 15, 1993\r\nSenator Edward M. Kennedy, in Boston, following a campaign\r\nfund-raising luncheon, addressed a group of reporters in\r\nconnection with a bill protecting access to clinics serving\r\nwomen's health, including abortions.  The bill, of which he was\r\nthe prime sponsor, was to be debated in the Senate the\r\nfollowing day.  In the course of his remarks, in answer to a\r\nquestion regarding this legislation, the Senator stated that\r\norganizations like Operation Rescue National (\"Operation\r\nRescue\") had a \"national policy [of] firebombing and even\r\nmurder.\"  Operation Rescue brought suit for defamation against\r\nthe Senator in the Massachusetts Superior Court.  Pursuant to\r\n28 U.S.C.  2679(d) of the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), the\r\nUnited States Attorney filed therein a certification to the\r\neffect that Senator Kennedy \"was acting within the scope of his\r\nemployment as an officer and employee of the United States at\r\nthe time of the conduct alleged in the complaint,\" and moved to\r\nremove the action to the United States District Court.  The\r\nremoval was effected and the district court thereupon granted\r\nthe United States' motion for its substitution for Senator\r\nKennedy as a defendant immunized by the FTCA.  Because the FTCA\r\nexcepts liability for defamation, see id.  2680(h), the court\r\nthereafter granted summary judgment for the United States,\r\nleaving Operation Rescue with no claim against either it or the\r\nSenator.  See id.  2679(b)(1) (providing that an action\r\nagainst the United States is the exclusive remedy); United\r\nStates v. Smith, 499 U.S. 160, 166-67 (1991) (holding that the\r\nexclusivity of remedy provision applies even if government\r\nliability is precluded).\r\n  We affirm those actions, but, before proceeding\r\nfurther, we review the Westfall Act, so-called, the first step\r\nin producing this result, starting with the history leading to\r\nits enactment.\r\n  One Erwin suffered injuries allegedly as a result of\r\nthe negligence of Westfall and others, employees of the United\r\nStates executive branch, in performing official acts   the\r\nstorage of dangerous chemicals.  See Westfall v. Erwin, 484\r\nU.S. 292, 293-94 (1988).  He brought suit against the\r\nindividual defendants in the state court, but this action was\r\nremoved to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n 1442(a)(1).  This court held, by summary judgment, that\r\ndefendants were absolutely immune because their conduct had\r\nbeen in the course of their government employment.  The Court\r\nof Appeals reversed, holding that government employees were\r\nimmune only for conduct of a discretionary character.  It\r\nordered the case remanded for a determination whether\r\ndefendants' conduct was of that nature.  On defendants'\r\nobtaining certiorari, the Court agreed with the Court of\r\nAppeals.  Inter alia, it stated, \"[O]fficial immunity comes at\r\na great cost. . . . [A]bsolute immunity for federal officials\r\nis justified only when 'the contributions of immunity to\r\neffective government in particular contexts outweigh the\r\nperhaps recurring harm to individual citizens.'\"  Id. at 295-96\r\n(citation omitted).  Without laying down standards, the Court\r\naffirmed.  In so doing, it remarked that Congress was in the\r\nbest position to rule on what was required for immunity.  Seeid. at 300.\r\n  This Congress promptly did by the Federal Employees\r\nLiability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, Pub. L. No.\r\n100-694, 102 Stat. 4563, the so-called Westfall Act.  Beside\r\nremoving the Westfall v. Erwin discretionary requirement, it\r\nincreased the scope of the FTCA by adding employees of the\r\njudicial and legislative branches to those of the executive\r\nbranch.\r\n  In a comprehensive Memorandum, Operation Rescue\r\nNational v. United States, 975 F. Supp. 92 (D. Mass. 1997), the\r\ndistrict court, in addition to disposing of other matters no\r\nlonger involved,  considered the following issues: (1) Whether,\r\nas a result of the Westfall Act, the FTCA is to be read as\r\nincluding the members of Congress; and (2) Whether, if the FTCA\r\ndoes include Congressmen, its application to these facts is\r\nconstitutional.  We review its resolutions in the affirmative\r\nde novo, as rulings of law.  See, e.g., Inmates of Suffolk\r\nCounty Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 653, 655 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nBeginning with the first, we agree with the district court's\r\nresult, but approach it differently.\r\nCongressmen   as Officers or Employees?\r\n    At the time of Westfall v. Erwin, the list of\r\ngovernment employees covered by the FTCA did not include those\r\nof the judicial and legislative branches:\r\n Definitions\r\n         As used in this chapter and sections\r\n    1346(b) and 2401(b) of this title, the term\r\n    \"Federal agency\" includes the executive\r\n    departments, the military departments . . . .\r\n\n         \"Employee of the government\" includes\r\n    officers or employees of any federal agency,\r\n    members of the military . . . .\r\n\nThe Westfall Act added the words \"the judicial and legislative\r\nbranches\" to follow \"the executive departments\" in the first\r\nparagraph.  It made no change in the second.\r\n    In almost unlimited number, Operation Rescue has shown,\r\nfrom the Constitution and widespread federal statutes, uses of\r\nthe phrase, \"officers, members and employees,\" with \"members\"\r\nmeaning members of Congress.  From this it would have us\r\nconclude that when Congress said \"officers or employees\" here,\r\nit made a deliberate and meaningful omission.  We quote its\r\nbrief, pp. 7 and 14,\r\n         Section 3 of the Westfall Act makes the\r\n    FTCA applicable to \"officers or employees\" of\r\n    the \"legislative branch[]\".  A United States\r\n    Senator is neither.  Congress' historical\r\n    practice, since its (sic) 1789, has been to\r\n    reference the three classes of persons found\r\n    in the halls of Congress as either \"Member\",\r\n    \"officer\", or \"employee\".  Congress chose\r\n    defining, restrictive language, \"officers or\r\n    employees\" of the \"legislative branch[]\", when\r\n    it wrote its 1988 Westfall Act.  So choosing,\r\n    Congress identified a readily identified body\r\n    of congressional personnel which does notinclude United States Senators.\r\n\n                            . . . .\r\n\n         Of course the Members of the 100thCongress knew to whom they were referring when\r\n    they wrote into the Westfall Act the\r\n    restrictive language, \"officers or employees\"\r\n    of the \"legislative branch[]\".\r\n         In writing statutes, Congress chooses\r\n    its words carefully . . . .\r\n\n(Emphases added).\r\n\n    Aside from the final sentence, the rest is fiction.  A\r\nvoting Congressman who went beyond reading \"FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\r\nLIABILITY\" in the Westfall Act title would not find the\r\nclaimed-to-be restrictive language even once.  The Act's\r\nexpressly declared purpose was to \"protect Federal employees\r\nfrom personal liability for common law torts\"; the phrase\r\n\"Federal employee\" occurred ten times, and the word \"officer\" and\r\nthe phrase \"officers and employees\" never.  See Westfall Act\r\n 2, 102 Stat. 4563-64.  How many astute legal minds who\r\nbothered to go further and read the FTCA, and saw there the\r\nphrase \"officers or employees\", would have thought of Operation\r\nRescue's omission argument?   We cannot think the Westfall\r\nCongress should be charged with plaintiff's connotation.\r\n    Alternatively, Operation Rescue would say that, as a\r\nmatter of law, Congressmen are neither \"officers\" nor \"employees\"\r\nof the federal government.  The district court has compiled\r\nmuch detail rejecting this assertion that we need not repeat. \r\nSee, e.g., Lamar v. United States, 241 U.S. 103 (1916). \r\nOperation Rescue, incomprehensibly, persists. \r\n    We add that even were this correct, circumstances speak\r\nlouder than words.  We ask a simple question   Why would\r\nCongressmen vote to exclude themselves from a universal grant\r\nof immunity given to all others; to all employees below them;\r\nto all officers, up to the president, above them?  The district\r\ncourt noted some, concededly weak, post-Westfall Act\r\nlegislative history favoring inclusion of Congressmen.  We\r\nthink it more important to look to contemporary legislative\r\nhistory.  Here we find nothing relevant.  Like the famous dog\r\nthat remained silent, the silence is telling.  If the Westfall\r\nAct clearly and carefully intended to exclude Congressmen from\r\nthe FTCA's otherwise universal benefits, would there not have\r\nbeen, at the least, some Congressmen who would have\r\nremonstrated?\r\n    There is no such legislative history, or Operation\r\nRescue's counsel would have found it.  If, which we consider it\r\ndoes not, the strict language should be read as Operation\r\nRescue would have it, this would be a clear case where contrary\r\ncircumstances as a whole would surely prevail.  Cf. Griffin v.\r\nOceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571-74 (1982).\r\n    Failing here, Operation Rescue would supplement with\r\nconstitutional claims.  These have been well answered by the\r\ndistrict court. We pass without comment the contention that\r\n\"Congress does not have a general power to legislate,\" except to\r\nnote McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 406, 413\r\n(1819), and turn to Operation Rescue's main theme, that this is\r\nan immunity from which Congressmen are uniquely exempt. \r\nAccordingly, Congress could grant immunity from defamation\r\nclaims to other federal officers or employees, but it could not\r\nvote such benefits for itself.  Further, the Speech or Debate\r\nClause is a ceiling rather than a floor.  For this last, the\r\nbasic contention is, by its having given Congressmen some\r\nprotection not given to others, the Constitution implicitly\r\nforbad any increase by statute, even when giving greater\r\nprotection to others.  This is singular logic.  We need not\r\nrepeat the district court's extensive rejections, with which we\r\nagree.\r\n    In all respects the decision below is affirmed.\n",

Kennedy, in Boston, following a campaign fund-raising luncheon, addressed a group of reporters in connection with a bill protecting access to clinics serving women's health, including abortions.  The bill, of which he was the prime sponsor, was to be debated in the Senate the following day.  In the course of his remarks, in answer to a question regarding this legislation, the Senator stated that organizations like Operation Rescue National (\"Operation Rescue\") had a \"national policy [of] firebombing and even murder.\"   Operation Rescue brought suit for defamation against the Senator in the Massachusetts Superior Court.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d) of the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), the United States Attorney filed therein a certification to the effect that Senator Kennedy \"was acting within the scope of his employment as an officer and employee of the United States at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint,\" and moved to remove the action to the United States District Court.  The removal was effected and the district court thereupon granted the United States' motion for its substitution for Senator Kennedy as a defendant immunized by the FTCA.  Because the FTCA excepts liability for defamation, see id. &#167; 2680(h), the court thereafter granted summary judgment for the United States, leaving Operation Rescue with no claim against either it or the Senator.

He brought suit against the individual defendants in the state court, but this action was removed to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1442(a)(1).  This court held, by summary judgment, that defendants were absolutely immune because their conduct had been in the course of their government employment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that government employees were immune only for conduct of a discretionary character.  It ordered the case remanded for a determination whether defendants' conduct was of that nature.  On defendants' obtaining certiorari, the Court agreed with the Court of Appeals.  Inter alia, it stated, \"[O]fficial immunity comes at a great cost....  [A]bsolute immunity for federal officials is justified only when 'the contributions of immunity to effective government in particular contexts outweigh the perhaps recurring harm to individual citizens.' \"  Id. at 295-96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111980\"><a href=\"/opinion/111980/westfall-v-erwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In so doing, it remarked that Congress was in the best position to rule on what was required for immunity.

No. 100-694, 102 Stat. 4563, the so-called Westfall Act.  Beside removing the Westfall v. Erwin discretionary requirement, it increased the scope of the FTCA by adding employees of the judicial and legislative branches to those of the executive branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a comprehensive Memorandum, Operation Rescue National v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We review its resolutions in the affirmative de novo, as rulings of law.  See, e.g., Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197630\"><a href=\"/opinion/197630/inmates-of-suffolk-v-rouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span>, 653, 655 (1st Cir.1997).  Beginning with the first, we agree with the district court's result, but approach it differently.Congressmen</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">2</a>\n        <p> as Officers or Employees?</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Westfall v. Erwin, the list of government employees covered by the FTCA did not include those of the judicial and legislative branches:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Definitions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As used in this chapter and sections 1346(b) and 2401(b) of this title, the term \"Federal agency\" includes the executive departments, the military departments....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Employee of the government\" includes officers or employees of any federal agency, members of the military....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Westfall Act added the words \"the judicial and legislative branches\" to follow \"the executive departments\" in the first paragraph.  It made no change in the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In almost unlimited number, Operation Rescue has shown, from the Constitution and widespread federal statutes, uses of the phrase, \"officers, members and employees,\" with \"members\" meaning members of Congress.  From this it would have us conclude that when Congress said \"officers or employees\" here, it made a deliberate and meaningful omission.  We quote its brief, pp. 7 and 14,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3 of the Westfall Act makes the FTCA applicable to \"officers or employees\" of the \"legislative branch[ ]\".  A United States Senator is neither.  Congress' historical practice, since its (sic) 1789, has been to reference the three classes of persons found in the halls of Congress as either \"Member\", \"officer\", or \"employee\".  Congress chose defining, restrictive language, \"officers or employees\" of the \"legislative branch[ ]\", when it wrote its 1988 Westfall Act.  So choosing, Congress identified a readily identified body of congressional personnel which does not include United States Senators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course the Members of the 100th Congress knew to whom they were referring when they wrote into the Westfall Act the restrictive language, \"officers or employees\" of the \"legislative branch[ ]\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In writing statutes, Congress chooses its words carefully....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphases added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the final sentence, the rest is fiction.  A voting Congressman who went beyond reading \"FEDERAL EMPLOYEES LIABILITY\" in the Westfall Act title would not find the claimed-to-be restrictive language even once.  The Act's expressly declared purpose was to \"protect Federal employees from personal liability for common law torts\";  the phrase \"Federal employee\" occurred ten times, and the word \"officer\" and the phrase \"officers and employees\" never.  See Westfall Act &#167; 2, 102 Stat. 4563-64.  How many astute legal minds who bothered to go further and read the FTCA, and saw there the phrase \"officers or employees\", would have thought of Operation Rescue's omission argument?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We cannot think the Westfall Congress should be charged with plaintiff's connotation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Operation Rescue would say that, as a matter of law, Congressmen are neither \"officers\" nor \"employees\" of the federal government.  The district court has compiled much detail rejecting this assertion that we need not repeat.  See, e.g., Lamar v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98721\"><a href=\"/opinion/98721/lamar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98721\"><a href=\"/opinion/98721/lamar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98721\"><a href=\"/opinion/98721/lamar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span> (1916).  Operation Rescue, incomprehensibly, persists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that even were this correct, circumstances speak louder than words.  We ask a simple question--Why would Congressmen vote to exclude themselves from a universal grant of immunity given to all others; to all employees below them;  to all officers, up to the president, above them?   The district court noted some, concededly weak, post-Westfall Act legislative history favoring inclusion of Congressmen.  We think it more important to look to contemporary legislative history.  Here we find nothing relevant.  Like the famous dog that remained silent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the silence is telling.  If the Westfall Act clearly and carefully intended to exclude Congressmen from the FTCA's otherwise universal benefits, would there not have been, at the least, some Congressmen who would have remonstrated?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no such legislative history, or Operation Rescue's counsel would have found it.  If, which we consider it does not, the strict language should be read as Operation Rescue would have it, this would be a clear case where contrary circumstances as a whole would surely prevail.  Cf. Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110787\"><a href=\"/opinion/110787/griffin-v-oceanic-contractors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 571-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110787\"><a href=\"/opinion/110787/griffin-v-oceanic-contractors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3245</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110787\"><a href=\"/opinion/110787/griffin-v-oceanic-contractors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span> (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failing here, Operation Rescue would supplement with constitutional claims.  These have been well answered by the district court.  We pass without comment the contention that \"Congress does not have a general power to legislate,\" except to note MCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S.  (4 Wheat.) 316, 406, 413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span> (1819), and turn to Operation Rescue's main theme, that this is an immunity from which Congressmen are uniquely exempt.  Accordingly, Congress could grant immunity from defamation claims to other federal officers or employees, but it could not vote such benefits for itself.  Further, the Speech or Debate Clause is a ceiling rather than a floor.  For this last, the basic contention is, by its having given Congressmen some protection not given to others, the Constitution implicitly forbad any increase by statute, even when giving greater protection to others.  This is singular logic.  We need not repeat the district court's extensive rejections, with which we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all respects the decision below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> E.g., plaintiff did not appeal from the finding that the Senator was acting within the scope of his employment when he made his remarks</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">2</a>\n        <p> We use this word throughout to include members of both Houses, as well as both sexes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2671</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note, in passing, that when written, this phrase did not \"omit\" members because the legislative branch was not then in the Act</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> It would even disregard common meanings given in all dictionaries.
