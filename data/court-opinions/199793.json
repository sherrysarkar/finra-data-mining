Bustamante, Special Assistant United States\nAttorney, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and\nJorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Chief, Criminal Division, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 28, 2002\n\f\f                SELYA, Circuit Judge.               In a three-count information,\n\nthe government charged defendant-appellant Alberto de Jesús\n\nMercado        with    two     counts    of   trespassing        at   Camp   Garcia    (a\n\nmilitary installation situated on the island of Vieques, Puerto\n\nRico) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1382, and one count of simple\n\nassault (allegedly committed during the second trespass) in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 7, 113(a)(4).                          The district court\n\ndenied the appellant's motion to dismiss the information, United\n\nStates v.        de Jesús, 108 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.P.R. 2000), and\n\nthereafter found him guilty of all charges.                      The court sentenced\n\nthe appellant to time served (approximately 34 days), together\n\nwith       a   one-year      term   of    probation.       The    probationary     term\n\nencompassed,           inter    alia,      the      following     conditions:         the\n\nappellant        was    directed     to    (1)      refrain   from    committing      any\n\ncriminal act, (2) stay away from Vieques, and (3) observe all\n\nthe standard conditions of probation (such as notifying the\n\nProbation Department before leaving the jurisdiction or in the\n\nevent of an arrest).1\n\n                The appellant proved to be a serial probation violator.\n\nWithin a matter of weeks, he traveled to New York without\n\n\n       1\n     The court originally imposed a special condition of\nprobation   requiring    psychological    counseling.      Upon\nreconsideration, however, the court vacated that condition. See\nUnited States v. de Jesús, 116 F. Supp. 2d 256, 257 (D.P.R.\n2000).\n\n                                              -3-\n\fnotifying his probation officer; engaged in criminal conduct\n\nthere on November 5, 2000 (adorning the Statue of Liberty with\n\na protest banner reading \"Peace for Vieques\"); and failed to\n\nadvise   the   probation    officer    of    his    ensuing   arrest.    The\n\nincident resulted in the appellant's conviction in a New York\n\ncourt on a charge of criminal trespass, for which he paid a $500\n\nfine.    In addition to these activities, the appellant traveled\n\nto   Vieques   at   least   twice,   in    direct   contradiction   of   the\n\nconditions of his probation.         He was arrested, but again failed\n\nto inform his probation officer.\n\n           The appellant's antics eventually were brought to the\n\nattention of the district court.            The court issued a violation\n\nwarrant and conducted a probation revocation hearing on June 20,\n\n2001.    It found that the appellant had violated the conditions\n\nof his probation in myriad respects.          This brought into play the\n\npenalty provisions of the original charges, see United States v.\n\nBynoe, 562 F.2d 126, 129 (1st Cir. 1977) (explaining that \"the\n\ncourt may, upon revocation of probation, impose any sentence it\n\nmight originally have imposed\"), and the court sentenced the\n\nappellant to imprisonment for a term of six months on each of\n\nthe two original trespassing counts (those sentences to run\n\nconcurrently) and for a further term of six months on the\n\noriginal assault count (that sentence to be served consecutively\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fto the sentences imposed on the other two counts).                    This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n            The statutes of conviction each authorize incarceration\n\nof an offender for a maximum period of six months.                        In this\n\ncase, then, the three counts, in the ensemble, exposed the\n\nappellant to an overall total of eighteen months behind bars.\n\nBecause the offenses limned in these counts constitute Class B\n\nmisdemeanors, see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(7), the court's sentencing\n\ndeterminations         are   not    subject    to   the    federal     sentencing\n\nguidelines.      See USSG § 1B1.9; see also United States v. Burgos-\n\nAndujar, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 01-2062, slip\n\nop. at 5].       Accordingly, appellate review ordinarily will be\n\nlimited    to    ascertaining        whether    a   particular        sentence   is\n\n\"plainly unreasonable.\"            18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(4); see also United\n\nStates v.    Sharpton, 252 F.3d 536, 540 (1st Cir. 2001) (per\n\ncuriam).     That standard governs for sentences imposed following\n\nrevocation      of   probation      in   respect    to    Class   B   misdemeanor\n\nconvictions.\n\n            Under any circumstances, the \"plainly unreasonable\"\n\nstandard is extremely deferential.              United States v. Underwood,\n\n880 F.2d 612, 620 (1st Cir. 1989).             Here, however, the degree of\n\ndeference due is magnified because the appellant refused to\n\nacknowledge      the    sentencing       court's    jurisdiction       and,   thus,\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\feschewed    any    attempt      to   secure     leniency.         Inasmuch    as   the\n\narguments       advanced    on     appeal      were   not    raised     below,     the\n\nsentences imposed can be set aside only for plain error.                           See\n\nUnited States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            How the \"plain error\" doctrine interacts with the\n\n\"plainly unreasonable\" standard of review presents a potentially\n\ninteresting legal question.             In this instance, however, we need\n\nnot pursue so fine a point.                   The short of it is that the\n\nsentencing record reflects no error, plain or otherwise.                            We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n            At the initial sentencing hearing, the district court\n\nimposed a term of probation, thus leaving the matter of further\n\npunishment very much in the appellant's hands.                      The appellant\n\ndid not capitalize on this opportunity.                    He chose not to abide\n\nby   the   conditions      of    his    probation,     but,    rather,       traveled\n\noutside    of    Puerto    Rico      without     authorization,         committed    a\n\nfurther criminal offense, neglected to notify his probation\n\nofficer     of    the    ensuing       arrest,    journeyed        to   Vieques     (a\n\nspecifically forbidden destination) at least twice, and failed\n\nto inform the probation officer of his arrest there.\n\n            These       multiple       violations     of    the     conditions      of\n\nprobation forge a solid predicate for the district court's\n\nfinding that the appellant was unrepentant and demonstrated\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f\"blatant disregard for the law and for the rule of the law.\"\n\nThe court's conclusion that it should sentence the appellant\n\nwith a view toward \"achiev[ing] the statutory objective of\n\npromoting respect for the law and affording . . . adequate\n\ndeterrence\" follows logically from this finding.             These are\n\nproper purposes, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and the aggregate\n\nsentence imposed — twelve months' immurement — seems amply\n\njustified    by   the   appellant's    obduracy.     After   all,   the\n\nappellant's persistent pattern of violative conduct, especially\n\nwhen coupled with his continued display of defiance at the\n\nprobation revocation hearing itself, gave the court every reason\n\nto consider a punishment severe enough to get his attention.\n\n            The appellant's rejoinder is unpersuasive.       He neither\n\ndenies that he violated the conditions of his probation nor\n\nchallenges the lower court's decision to revoke the probationary\n\nterm in favor of a period of incarceration.        He contends instead\n\nthat the sentences imposed, while within the statutory maxima,\n\nare in the aggregate plainly unreasonable.            To support this\n\ncontention, however, he offers only rank conjecture, arguing\n\nthat, notwithstanding the district court's carefully articulated\n\nstatement of its concerns, the court had either a hidden agenda\n\nor an imperfect view of the law.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f               It    would      serve     no    useful      purpose     to      answer      the\n\nappellant's          charges      in      exegetic     detail.          The         probation\n\nrevocation hearing was meticulously conducted, and there is not\n\nso much as a hint of legal error.                    By the same token, the record\n\noffers    no    basis      for    doubting       the   court's      statement         of    the\n\nreasons underlying its sentencing determinations. Those reasons\n\nare not only plausible on their face but also responsive to the\n\ncircumstances of the case — and we are unwilling to disregard\n\nthem   on      the    strength       of       arguments     woven   entirely          out     of\n\nspeculation and surmise.                  Put bluntly, there is no credible\n\nfoundation on which to rest a conclusion that the district\n\ncourt's sentencing judgments were influenced by an unspoken\n\npremise,       driven      by    some     improper     purpose,       or     shaped      by    a\n\nmistaken view of the applicable legal principles.                                    On this\n\nrecord, the aggregate sentence was not unreasonable to any\n\ndegree.\n\n               We need go no further.                  We understand, as did the\n\ndistrict court, that the appellant acted out of conviction — but\n\nallegiance to a cause, no matter how deeply grounded, does not\n\nrequire     endless        leniency       in     sentencing.        When        a    criminal\n\ndefendant,          subject     to   unambiguous           conditions      of   probation,\n\ndeliberately flouts them, the rule of law consequences must\n\nattach.        So     it   is    here     —    and   the    cumulative       twelve-month\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\fsentence    imposed   by   the   district   court   appears   to   be   a\n\nreasonable response to the appellant's stubborn insistence on\n\ncontinuing his chosen course of conduct notwithstanding the\n\nconstraints imposed by the conditions of his probation.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

Hon. Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge Linda Backiel for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frank J. Bustamante, Special Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Chief, Criminal Division, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Circuit Judge, Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge, and Lynch, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a three-count information, the government charged defendant-appellant Alberto de Jesus Mercado with two counts of trespassing at Camp Garcia (a military installation situated on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico) in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382, and one count of simple assault (allegedly committed during the second trespass) in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7, 113(a)(4). The district court denied the appellant's motion to dismiss the information, United States v. de Jesus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428625\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428625/united-states-v-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span> (D.P.R. 2000), and thereafter found him guilty of all charges. The court sentenced the appellant to time served (approximately 34 days), together with a one-year term of probation. The probationary term encompassed, inter alia, the following conditions: the appellant was directed to (1) refrain from committing any criminal act, (2) stay away from Vieques, and (3) observe all the standard conditions of probation (such as notifying the Probation Department before leaving the jurisdiction or in the event of an arrest).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant proved to be a serial probation violator. Within a matter of weeks, he traveled to New York without notifying his probation officer; engaged in criminal conduct there on November 5, 2000 (adorning the Statue of Liberty with a protest banner reading \"Peace for Vieques\"); and failed to advise the probation officer of his ensuing arrest. The incident resulted in the appellant's conviction in a New York court on a charge of criminal trespass, for which he paid a $500 fine. In addition to these activities, the appellant traveled to Vieques at least twice, in direct contradiction of the conditions of his probation. He was arrested, but again failed to inform his probation officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's antics eventually were brought to the attention of the district court. The court issued a violation warrant and conducted a probation revocation hearing on June 20, 2001. It found that the appellant had violated the conditions of his probation in myriad respects. This brought into play the penalty provisions of the original charges, see United States v. Bynoe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349223\"><a href=\"/opinion/349223/united-states-v-victor-c-bynoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 129 (1st Cir. 1977) (explaining that \"the court may, upon revocation of probation, impose any sentence it might originally have imposed\"), and the court sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of six months on each of the two original trespassing counts (those sentences to run concurrently) and for a further term of six months on the original assault count (that sentence to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed on the other two counts). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutes of conviction each authorize incarceration of an offender for a maximum period of six months. In this case, then, the three counts, in the ensemble, exposed the appellant to an overall total of eighteen months behind bars. Because the offenses limned in these counts constitute Class B misdemeanors, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)(7), the court's sentencing determinations are not subject to the federal sentencing guidelines. See USSG &#167; 1B1.9; see also United States v. Burgos-Andujar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775958\"><a href=\"/opinion/775958/united-states-v-norma-burgos-andjar/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 01-2062, slip op. at 5]. Accordingly, appellate review ordinarily will be limited to ascertaining whether a particular sentence is \"plainly unreasonable.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(4); see also United States v. Sharpton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199452\"><a href=\"/opinion/199452/united-states-v-sharpton/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 540 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam). That standard governs for sentences imposed following revocation of probation in respect to Class B misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under any circumstances, the \"plainly unreasonable\" standard is extremely deferential. United States v. Underwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526738\"><a href=\"/opinion/526738/united-states-v-peter-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 620 (1st Cir. 1989). Here, however, the degree of deference due is magnified because the appellant refused to acknowledge the sentencing court's jurisdiction and, thus, eschewed any attempt to secure leniency. Inasmuch as the arguments advanced on appeal were not raised below, the sentences imposed can be set aside only for plain error. See United States v. Duarte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How the \"plain error\" doctrine interacts with the \"plainly unreasonable\" standard of review presents a potentially interesting legal question. In this instance, however, we need not pursue so fine a point. The short of it is that the sentencing record reflects no error, plain or otherwise. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the initial sentencing hearing, the district court imposed a term of probation, thus leaving the matter of further punishment very much in the appellant's hands. The appellant did not capitalize on this opportunity. He chose not to abide by the conditions of his probation, but, rather, traveled outside of Puerto Rico without authorization, committed a further criminal offense, neglected to notify his probation officer of the ensuing arrest, journeyed to Vieques (a specifically forbidden destination) at least twice, and failed to inform the probation officer of his arrest there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These multiple violations of the conditions of probation forge a solid predicate for the district court's finding that the appellant was unrepentant and demonstrated \"blatant disregard for the law and for the rule of the law.\" The court's conclusion that it should sentence the appellant with a view toward \"achiev[ing] the statutory objective of promoting respect for the law and affording . . . adequate deterrence\" follows logically from this finding. These are proper purposes, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), and the aggregate sentence imposed -- twelve months' immurement -- seems amply justified by the appellant's obduracy. After all, the appellant's persistent pattern of violative conduct, especially when coupled with his continued display of defiance at the probation revocation hearing itself, gave the court every reason to consider a punishment severe enough to get his attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's rejoinder is unpersuasive. He neither denies that he violated the conditions of his probation nor challenges the lower court's decision to revoke the probationary term in favor of a period of incarceration. He contends instead that the sentences imposed, while within the statutory maxima, are in the aggregate plainly unreasonable. To support this contention, however, he offers only rank conjecture, arguing that, notwithstanding the district court's carefully articulated statement of its concerns, the court had either a hidden agenda or an imperfect view of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would serve no useful purpose to answer the appellant's charges in exegetic detail. The probation revocation hearing was meticulously conducted, and there is not so much as a hint of legal error. By the same token, the record offers no basis for doubting the court's statement of the reasons underlying its sentencing determinations. Those reasons are not only plausible on their face but also responsive to the circumstances of the case -- and we are unwilling to disregard them on the strength of arguments woven entirely out of speculation and surmise. Put bluntly, there is no credible foundation on which to rest a conclusion that the district court's sentencing judgments were influenced by an unspoken premise, driven by some improper purpose, or shaped by a mistaken view of the applicable legal principles. On this record, the aggregate sentence was not unreasonable to any degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We understand, as did the district court, that the appellant acted out of conviction -- but allegiance to a cause, no matter how deeply grounded, does not require endless leniency in sentencing. When a criminal defendant, subject to unambiguous conditions of probation, deliberately flouts them, the rule of law consequences must attach. So it is here -- and the cumulative twelve-month sentence imposed by the district court appears to be a reasonable response to the appellant's stubborn insistence on continuing his chosen course of conduct notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the conditions of his probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court originally imposed a special condition of probation requiring psychological counseling. Upon reconsideration, however, the court vacated that condition.
