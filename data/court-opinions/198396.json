  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION   NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n                            No. 98-1838\r\n\n                   PABLO LUGO ALICEA,\r\n\n                 Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n                 JOSE L. CABAN, ET AL.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n     [Hon. Jos Antonio Fust, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\nCoffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Selya, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJos R. Franco for appellant.\r\nLeticia Casalduc-Rabell, Asst. Solicitor General, with whom Carlos Lugo Fiol, Solicitor General, and Edda Serrano Blasini, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\nMarch 22, 1999\r\n\n                             SELYA, Circuit Judge.  After a jury acquitted plaintiff-\r\nappellant Pablo Lugo Alicea (Lugo) of involuntary manslaughter,\r\nLugo turned the tables and sued the prosecution team   Secretary of\r\nJustice Pedro Pierluisi and District Attorneys Jos L. Cabn,\r\nElmer Cuerda, Jaime Zambrana, and Mabel Ruiz   for money damages in\r\nPuerto Rico's federal district court.  Within a few weeks, Lugo\r\nfiled an amended complaint.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (permitting\r\nplaintiffs to amend once as of right before a responsive pleading\r\nis filed).\r\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint\r\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Lugo did not oppose the motion,\r\nand the district court, after waiting nearly a year, granted the\r\nrequested relief in a brief, unpublished rescript.  We affirm,\r\nalbeit on slightly different reasoning.  See Hachikian v. FDIC, 96\r\nF.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating that the court of appeals is\r\nnot wedded to the trial court's rationale, but may affirm its\r\nruling on any ground made manifest by the record); Polyplastics,\r\nInc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st Cir. 1987)\r\n(similar).\r\nFederal pleading requirements are liberal, but they are\r\nnot entirely toothless.  See Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d\r\n513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).  Here, Lugo's complaint contains four\r\nstatements of claim.  Two do not articulate separate causes of\r\naction, but merely contain recitals of damages allegedly incurred. \r\nOf the other two, the first alleges an abridgment of Lugo's\r\nconstitutional rights, and the second alleges violations of local\r\nlaw (specifically, Articles 1802 and 1805 of Puerto Rico's Civil\r\nCode).  Because Lugo premises jurisdiction on the existence of a\r\nfederal question, 28 U.S.C.  1331, we focus our attention on the\r\nfirst of these claims.\r\nRefined to bare essence, the claim in question recounts\r\nthat, following an automobile accident in which a fatality\r\noccurred, the authorities charged Lugo with involuntary\r\nmanslaughter.  His complaint then recites that, in connection with\r\nthe ensuing criminal trial, \"the defendants produced two different\r\ncroquis evincing two disparaging versions of how the accident took\r\nplace,\" and that one defendant, Cabn, \"ordered the sworn version\r\nof facts of one of the key witnesses to be changed in order to\r\nbetter accommodate the Government's official version.\"  These acts,\r\nthe complaint avers, constituted \"an illegal, unjustified, abusive\r\nand excessive use of authority under color of law\" and hence were\r\n\"in violation of the Due Process Clause [of the] Fifth Amendment to\r\nthe United States Constitution.\"\r\nThe district court did not err in ruling that these\r\nallegations failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\r\ngranted under federal law.  In order to transform a garden-variety\r\nmalicious prosecution claim into a claim that is actionable under\r\n42 U.S.C.  1983, a plaintiff must establish both (1) action under\r\ncolor of state law, and (2) a deprivation of a constitutional right\r\nin consequence of that action.  See Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life\r\nIns. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 253-54 (1st Cir. 1996).  Lugo's complaint\r\nadequately limns state action, but it does not allege a\r\nconstitutional deprivation.  The claim invokes the Fifth\r\nAmendment.  As pertinent here, the Fifth Amendment guarantees both\r\nprocedural due process and substantive due process.  Neither\r\nguaranty helps Lugo.\r\nA section 1983 claim based on malicious prosecution\r\ncannot be maintained under the rubric of procedural due process\r\nwhere, as here, local tort law affords an anodyne for malicious\r\nprosecution.  See Roche, 81 F.3d at 256; Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-\r\nGuilln, 25 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Raldiris v.\r\nLevitt &amp; Sons, 103 P.R.R. 778, 781 (1975) (confirming that Puerto\r\nRico law grants such remediation).\r\nSuch a claim is on even shakier ground when viewed under\r\nthe substantive due process rubric.  In recent years, both the\r\nSupreme Court and this court have held that there is no substantive\r\ndue process right to be free from malicious prosecution.  SeeAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271 n.4 (1994) (plurality op.);\r\nMeehan v. Town of Plymouth,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1999) [No.\r\n97-2235, slip op. at 7]; Roche, 81 F.3d at 256.  Consequently, the\r\ndistrict court did not err in dismissing, under Rule 12(b)(6), a\r\ncomplaint that sought to transform a standard malicious prosecution\r\ncase into a due process violation.\r\nLugo offers two rejoinders, neither of which has much\r\nforce.  First, he says that he may have a cause of action under the\r\nFourth Amendment.  That is a theoretical possibility, see, e.g.,\r\nRoche, 81 F.3d at 256 n.5 (noting that \"the Supreme Court left open\r\nthe possibility that a malicious prosecution claim might lie under\r\n1983 on the basis of the Fourth Amendment\"), but it is not the\r\ncause of action that Lugo asserted in his complaint.  The facts, as\r\npleaded, do not bring a Fourth Amendment violation to mind.  At any\r\nrate, the district court was entitled to consider the claim that\r\nLugo pleaded, and had no obligation to go outside the complaint in\r\nsearch of new and different causes of action.  See Gooley, 851 F.2d\r\nat 514.  This is especially so where, as here,  Lugo did not deign\r\neven to file a memorandum in opposition to the defendants' motion\r\nto dismiss.\r\nSecond, Lugo says that the district court erred in not\r\naffording him an opportunity to amend his complaint.  The short,\r\nfully dispositive answer to this remonstrance is that Lugo never\r\nasked the district court for leave to amend.  We have held with a\r\nregularity bordering on the monotonous that a party who fails to\r\nseek available relief in the nisi prius court cannot anticipate\r\nreceiving that relief in the first instance from this court.  SeeViquiera v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A party\r\nwho neglects to ask the district court for leave to amend cannot\r\nexpect to receive such a dispensation from the court of appeals.\");\r\nBeaulieu v. United States IRS, 865 F.2d 1351, 1352 (1st Cir. 1989)\r\n(similar).\r\nWe need go no further.  Because Lugo failed to plead a\r\ncognizable federal claim, his pendent claims under Puerto Rico's\r\nCivil Code were properly dismissed as well.  See Martinez v. Colon,\r\n54 F.3d 980, 990-91 (1st Cir. 1995); see also 28 U.S.C. \r\n1367(c)(3).\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",
