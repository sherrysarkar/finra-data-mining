Hampton has appealed a decision\n\nof the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) that affirmed a decision of\n\nthe bankruptcy court declaring Hampton's debt to her ex-husband\n\nnondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6). In an appeal\n\nfrom a BAP ruling, \"we focus on the bankruptcy court's decision,\n\nscrutinize that court's findings of fact for clear error, and\n\nafford de novo review to its conclusions of law\", giving \"no\n\nparticular deference\" to the conclusions of the BAP tribunal. In\n\nre Healthco Intern., Inc., 132 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          We have carefully reviewed the parties' briefs and the\n\nrecord before us. The Bankruptcy Code excepts from discharge any\n\ndebt \"for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another\n\nentity or to the property of another entity.\"         11 U.S.C. §\n\n523(a)(6).   Hampton disputes the bankruptcy court's factual\n\nconclusions that the injury she caused was willful and malicious.\n\nBut, the bankruptcy court is \"entitled to make reasonable\n\ncredibility determinations,\" In re Strangie, 192 F.3d 192, 197 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) and the bankruptcy court's conclusions were not clearly\n\nerroneous. We, therefore, affirm the bankruptcy court's judgment,\n\ndated June 14, 2000, essentially for the reasons stated in the\n\ncourt's Memorandum of Decision of that same date.\n\n          The appellee not having submitted a separately filed\n\nmotion pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 38, his request recited in the\n\ffinal paragraph in his brief for costs and damages for a frivolous\n\nappeal is denied.
