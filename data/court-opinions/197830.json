Second, the ADAR  and the\r\n\nexpert  testimony  from  Schultz conclusively  refuted  the Pagan\r          expert  testimony  from  Schultz conclusively  refuted  the Pagan\r\n\neyewitness  testimony, since  the  sensor  is  designed  to  stop\r          eyewitness  testimony, since  the  sensor  is  designed  to  stop\r\n\nrecording data once  the air bag deploys, and  therefore a prema-\r          recording data once  the air bag deploys, and  therefore a prema-\r\n\nture deployment would have disabled the sensor from recording the\r          ture deployment would have disabled the sensor from recording the\r\n\nsubsequent collision.   Finally,  the district  court noted  that\r          subsequent collision.   Finally,  the district  court noted  that\r\n\nPerez presented  no competent  scientific  information  to demon-\r          Perez presented  no competent  scientific  information  to demon-\r\n\nstrate that  the air  bag had   functioned  differently from  any\r          strate that  the air  bag had   functioned  differently from  any\r\n\nother  produced  by  Volvo in  that  year,   nor any   scientific\r          other  produced  by  Volvo in  that  year,   nor any   scientific\r\n\nexplanation  how the  air bag  in  question malfunctioned  or was\r          explanation  how the  air bag  in  question malfunctioned  or was\r\n\npoorly designed.

Since the 600-page  NHTSA\r\nreport was  on microfilm, Perez proffered only  a few transcribed\r\npages,  but made  clear  his willingness  to  produce the  entire\r\nreport  to  the  district  court on  request.    However,  before\r\ndismissing  the case,  the  district  court  instead  decided  to\r\nreserve  for trial any  question concerning the  admissibility of\r\nthe  report on  the  defect  issue.
