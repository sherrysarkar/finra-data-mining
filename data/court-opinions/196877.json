Clary   William  Wester  was\r                                        \r\n\nformerly   president,  chairman  of   the  board,  and  chief\r\n\nexecutive officer  of First Service Bank  for Savings (\"First\r\n\nService\"),   a  federally   insured   bank   in   Leominster,\r\n\nMassachusetts.   In the  late 1980s, Wester  arranged various\r\n\ntransactions at First Service, including a series of loans by\r\n\nFirst Service to Webster's partners in a separate real estate\r\n\nventure, made with the  understanding that the partners would\r\n\nuse  the loaned  funds to  buy out  Wester's interest  in the\r\n\npartnership.  At  trial, Wester  was convicted by  a jury  of\r\n\nseveral  different  crimes.    He  now  challenges  the  jury\r\n\ninstructions and two adjustments to his sentence.\r\n\n     Although   Wester  does   not   directly   dispute   the\r\n\nsufficiency of the  evidence, one  of his claims  as to  jury\r\n\ninstructions  can be taken to raise  the issue of sufficiency\r\n\nindirectly.  For that reason, we begin by describing what the\r\n\nevidence would have permitted the  jury to find. A  reviewing\r\n\ncourt's perspective on the  evidence depends on the claim  of\r\n\nerror being considered, and for a  sufficiency claim, we take\r\n\nthe evidence  most favorable  to the verdict.   E.g.,  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Dodd, 43 F.3d 759, 760-61 (1st Cir. 1995).  \r                          \r\n\n     In  June 1986,  Wester formed  a partnership  with three\r\n\nother men  to construct a condominium  project in Manchester,\r\n\nNew Hampshire.   The three  others were Robert  Fredo, senior\r\n\nvice president at First  Service, Robert George, a developer,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nand  Charles  Morgan, a  broker.   Wester and  Fredo supplied\r\n\nstart-up  money, and  Wester helped  arrange a  $12.4 million\r\n\nloan  organized  by  New  England  Financial  Resources, Inc.\r\n\n(\"NEFR\"), a commercial real estate lender not affiliated with\r\n\nFirst  Service.   The  loan was  secured  by land  and future\r\n\nimprovements and a personal guaranty of the debt from each of\r\n\nthe partners.\r\n\n     Since  Morgan  had been  a  frequent  borrower at  First\r\n\nService,  NEFR  was  concerned  that  Wester's   and  Fredo's\r\n\nparticipation in  the partnership might  create conflicts  of\r\n\ninterest.    As  a condition  of  the  loan  NEFR required  a\r\n\ncertificate from  First Service acknowledging that Wester and\r\n\nFredo had  disclosed their  interest  in the  project to  the\r\n\nboard of directors of First  Service.  The certificate issued\r\n\nby First Service stated,  inter alia, that the bank  \"was not\r                                                \r\n\ninvolved  in the  financing of  this project  and  would not,\r\n\nwithout specific  prior approval, grant  any additional loans\r\n\nto Messrs. Morgan or George.\"  \r\n\n     In the fall of 1986, Morgan  and George proposed another\r\n\ncondominium  project,  this  one in  Massachusetts.    Wester\r\n\nsuggested that First Service participate  in the project as a\r\n\njoint  venturer, but  said that  he and  Fredo would  need to\r\n\ndivest their interests in the  earlier partnership.  The four\r\n\nmen  agreed that Wester and Fredo  would sell their interests\r\n\nto George and Morgan for $425,000 each, and be reimbursed for\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nadditional start-up money they  had provided, all to  be paid\r\n\nfrom future profits  from the New Hampshire project.   Before\r\n\nthe  details of  the  buyout plan  had  been resolved,  First\r\n\nService (through  a subsidiary)  joined the new  project with\r\n\nMorgan and George, and the bank provided a $5 million loan to\r\n\nthe venture.\r\n\n     By June 1987, the New Hampshire project had yet to begin\r\n\nearning profits.  Wester grew  impatient and told George  and\r\n\nMorgan  that he wanted his buyout payments.  When George said\r\n\nthis was not feasible  because of cash flow  problems, Wester\r\n\noffered to provide  First Service loans to George  and Morgan\r\n\nto  fund the buyout payments.  These loans, and the resulting\r\n\nbuyout  payments,  became the  basis  for most  of  the later\r\n\ncharges against Wester.  \r\n\n     On June 12, 1987, George signed two promissory notes for\r\n\nunsecured loans  by First  Service totalling $200,000.   That\r\n\nsame day, George paid Wester and Fredo $100,000 each.  Morgan\r\n\nreceived  a $300,000  loan  from First  Service  on June  12;\r\n\nseveral days later he paid Wester and Fredo $25,000 each, and\r\n\nGeorge and  Morgan (through the partnership)  gave Wester and\r\n\nFredo $250,000 for the start-up money previously contributed.\r\n\n     Neither Wester  nor Fredo disclosed the  true purpose of\r\n\nthese  loans  to  First  Service's  loan  review   committee,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nexecutive committee, or  board of  directors.1   Nor did  the\r\n\nsupporting  documentation reveal that  the loaned  funds were\r\n\nbeing used  to fund the  buyout.   In one instance,  the loan\r\n\nset-up  sheets stated  that the  purpose of  the loan  was to\r\n\n\"finance acquisition of real property\"; in other instances no\r\n\npurpose for the loan was provided.  The jury could have found\r\n\nthat the failure to disclose the purpose of the loans to  the\r\n\nloan  review   committee   was  material,   deliberate,   and\r\n\ndishonest.  \r\n\n     This  process was  repeated  several times  over in  the\r\n\nfollowing months,  with Wester  and Fredo arranging  loans or\r\n\nletters  of  credit  to   Morgan,  George  or  entities  they\r\n\ncontrolled--and   in   one  instance   George's  father--with\r\n\nportions  of the  proceeds returned  to Wester  and Fredo  to\r\n\nsatisfy the buyout.  The last  such loan was made on March 9,\r\n\n1988.   On March 10, 1988, the buyout agreement was executed,\r\n\nand Wester's  and Fredo's  interests in the  partnership were\r\n\nterminated \"retroactive\" to January 1, 1987.     \r\n\n     There was one more  wrinkle of considerable  importance.\r\n\nThe  buyout  agreement  included a  provision  for  releasing\r\n\nWester  and  Fredo  from  their personal  guaranties  on  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Under the bank's rules, all insider loans and all loans\r\nof over  $5 million had  to be  approved by the  board.   The\r\nexecutive committee  had to approve loans  between $1 million\r\nand  $5 million;  and  the loan  review  committee, on  which\r\nWester and Fredo sat with other officers, could approve loans\r\nup to $1 million.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nearlier $12.4 million  loan from  NEFR.   NEFR, however,  was\r\n\nconcerned  about the  financial health  of the  New Hampshire\r\n\ncondominium  project.   It  made  clear  that it  would  only\r\n\nconsent  to the  release if the  partnership obtained  a $2.3\r\n\nmillion bank  loan or  line of  credit to  provide additional\r\n\nsecurity for the $12.4 million loan.\r\n\n     Ultimately,  Wester and  Fredo arranged  a $2.3  million\r\n\nloan  by  First  Service  for the  partnership,  without  any\r\n\ndisclosure to other bank  officials of the connection to  the\r\n\nproposed  release and  without  approval by  First  Service's\r\n\nexecutive  committee or board of directors.  Under the bank's\r\n\nrules, approval by the  former was evidently required because\r\n\nof the size of the loan.  This loan and  the promised release\r\n\nwere each specified as offenses in the subsequent indictment.\r\n\n     After a portion of the $2.3 million was disbursed to the\r\n\npartnership, and  before NEFR formally  executed Wester's and\r\n\nFredo's  releases  from   the  guaranties,  the   FDIC  began\r\n\ninvestigating  the goings-on  at First  Service.   Wester and\r\n\nFredo  were subsequently  fired.   First Service  honored its\r\n\ncommitment to the partnership and released the balance of the\r\n\n$2.3  million  loan  proceeds.     NEFR  never  executed  the\r\n\nreleases, but neither did it call upon Wester or Fredo to pay\r\n\nbased on their guaranties.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     On August 11, 1990, Wester and Fredo were named in a 22-\r\n\ncount   federal  indictment  charging   them  primarily  with\r\n\nconspiracy, 18 U.S.C.   371, misapplication of bank funds, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.     656, and  bank  bribery, i.e.,  the  soliciting or\r                                                    \r\n\nreceiving of bribes or  rewards for the making of  the loans,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    215.  The loans for the  buyout payments and for\r\n\nthe  release were  charged as  misapplications under  section\r\n\n656; the payments and promised release were charged as bribes\r\n\nor rewards under section 215.\r\n\n     Fredo  pled  guilty before  trial to  one count  each of\r\n\nconspiracy,  misapplication, and bank  bribery, and testified\r\n\nfor  the government at Wester's  trial.  After  a 13-day jury\r\n\ntrial  in July  1994, Wester  was convicted  of one  count of\r\n\nconspiracy, five counts of  misapplication, and six counts of\r\n\nbank  bribery.   He  was  acquitted  of  one  count  each  of\r\n\nmisapplication and bank bribery,  and two tax evasion counts.\r\n\nIn  December  1994,  Wester  was sentenced  to  46  months in\r\n\nprison.   This appeal followed.  For the reasons that follow,\r\n\nwe affirm the convictions but remand for resentencing.  \r\n\n     1.   Wester's  main challenge  to the  trial proceedings\r\n\nconcerns  the  district  court's  jury  instructions  on  the\r\n\nmisapplication  counts.   In  relevant part, 18  U.S.C.   656\r\n\nprovides criminal penalties for \"an officer, director, agent,\r\n\nor employee  of .  . . national  bank or insured  bank .  . .\r\n\n[who]  willfully  misapplies  any  of the  moneys,  funds  or\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ncredits  of  such bank.\"    Formally, the  dispute  on appeal\r\n\ncenters around the phrase \"willfully misapplies\"; in reality,\r\n\nWester's  argument also  presents  the question  whether  the\r\n\nevidence was adequate.\r\n\n     The problem that has confronted and perplexed the courts\r\n\nis that  there  is  no  statutory definition  or  common  law\r\n\nheritage  that   gives  content  to  the   phrase  \"willfully\r\n\nmisapplies.\"  United States  v. Gens, 493 F.2d 216,  221 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1974).   And  to focus  simply  on the  deprivation  of\r\n\nproperty is hardly much  help since it is a  purpose of banks\r\n\nto lend money.   In response, the case law  has developed two\r\n\nnotions  that help  to clarify  and delimit  the statute--one\r\n\nrelating primarily to conduct and the other to intent.\r\n\n     First, \"misapplication\" has been taken by most courts to\r\n\nmean \"wrongful\" use  of the bank's  moneys.  See  1 Sand,  et\r                                                                         \r\n\nal.,  Modern Federal Jury Instructions    24.01 (1995).  And,\r                                                  \r\n\nsecond, the courts have uniformly read back  into the statute\r\n\nan earlier  requirement, removed by a  careless revisor, that\r\n\nthe defendant have intended \"to injure  or defraud\" the bank.\r\n\nE.g., United States v.  Angelos, 763 F.2d 859, 861  (7th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1985).  Of course, the same facts can easily be the basis for\r\n\ndeeming the conduct to be wrongful and the intent fraudulent;\r\n\nbut both misapplication and scienter are required.\r\n\n     In this  case, the district  court's affirmative  charge\r\n\ndescribing  the offense  of misapplication  was for  the most\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\npart conventional.  What  Wester objects to on appeal  is the\r\n\ncourt's  refusal   to   give  certain   additional   language\r                            \r\n\nspecifically requested by Wester.  The language--which Wester\r\n\nbelieves to  have been  required  by our  decision in  Gens--\r                                                                       \r\n\nappears  at   two  different  points  in  Wester's  requested\r\n\ninstruction no. 37:\r\n\n          I  instruct   you  that   a  loan   to  a\r\n          financially  capable   person  who  fully\r\n          understands that it is his responsibility\r\n          to  repay  the loan  does  not constitute\r\n          misapplication, even if the  bank officer\r\n          involved with the loan  receives proceeds\r\n          of  the  loan,  or  some  other  benefit.\r\n          Thus, in  this case, with respect  to the\r\n          loans  charged,  if   the  debtors   were\r\n          financially capable of repaying the loans\r\n          and  that [sic]  they understood  that it\r\n          was  their  responsibility  to repay  the\r\n          loans,  Mr. Wester  must be  acquitted on\r\n          those counts irrespective  of whether  or\r\n          not  he received  proceeds, or  any other\r\n          benefit, from those loans. . . .\r\n\n                               . . .\r\n\n             Therefore, in this case, for each loan\r\n          alleged   in   the   Indictment    as   a\r\n          misapplication  of  bank  funds,  if  the\r\n          named debtor was  financially capable  of\r\n          repaying  the  loan  and  recognized  his\r\n          responsibility to repay  the loan,  there\r\n          is no misapplication as a matter  of law,\r\n          even if  proceeds of those loans  or some\r\n          other  benefits  were  received   by  Mr.\r\n          Wester.\r\n\n     Needless  to say,  such  language would  have been  very\r\n\nuseful to Wester.  The government, it appears, did not try to\r\n\nshow   that  any   of   the  designated   borrowers  in   the\r\n\nmisapplication   counts  (E.g.,   George  and   Morgan)  were\r                                          \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nfictitious or financially irresponsible or  had never assumed\r\n\nliability for the loan.   Wester suggests that for  bona fide\r\n\nloans  to  financially  responsible  borrowers,  there  is no\r\n\nserious  risk of harm to  the bank and  therefore, even apart\r\n\nfrom the authority of Gens, no reason to apply the statute.\r                                      \r\n\n     Wester's position is far  from absurd, cf. United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Dochtery, 468 F.2d 989 (2d Cir.  1972), but in the end it\r                        \r\n\nreads  the statute too narrowly.  There is no indication that\r\n\ninsider loans  are inflexibly  forbidden by federal  law, but\r\n\nthey obviously create a special set of dangers.  At least one\r\n\ndanger--quis  custodiet ipsos  custodes--is that  the insider\r                                                   \r\n\nwho approves or fosters the loan  may do so too readily if he\r\n\nhimself benefits by  it.  Controls  on such loans,  including\r\n\nauthorizations  and disclosures,  are therefore  pertinent to\r\n\nthe safety of the bank.  \r\n\n     Further, financial  responsibility  on the  part of  the\r\n\nborrower is not an absolute  but a matter of degree.   To say\r\n\nthat  the  nominal  borrower  is at  the  outset  financially\r\n\ncapable of repayment hardly  proves that the bank  would have\r\n\nmade the  loan if it had been fully apprised of the risks and\r\n\ncircumstances.     Here,  two  members  of   First  Service's\r\n\nexecutive  committee  testified  that  they  would  not  have\r\n\napproved the loans if Wester  had disclosed that the proceeds\r\n\nwere  going  to  fund  the  buyout  of  Wester   and  Fredo's\r\n\ninterests.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     In this  instance, the jury could  reasonably have found\r\n\nthat Wester caused the loans  to be made for his  own benefit\r\n\nwithout obtaining  approvals from the  executive committee or\r\n\nboard of directors required under the bank's own rules (as to\r\n\nthe largest $2.3  million loan) and (as to it and all others)\r\n\nbecause  he deliberately  suppressed or  withheld information\r\n\nthat the purpose of the loans was one that the bank would not\r\n\nhave approved.2  This wrongful conduct permitted  the jury in\r\n\nturn to  find that Wester had engaged in the \"misapplication\"\r\n\nof bank funds.  All that remained was to find scienter.\r\n\n     The   scienter  requirement--an  intent   to  injure  or\r\n\ndefraud--is  stated  in  the  alternative.   In  the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt's  classic summary,  \"the words  `to defraud'  commonly\r\n\nrefer `to  wronging one in  his property rights  by dishonest\r\n\nmeans or  schemes,' and  `usually signify the  deprivation of\r\n\nsomething   of   value   by   trick,   deceit,   chicane   or\r\n\noverreaching.'\"  McNally v. United States, 483  U.S. 350, 358\r                                                     \r\n\n(1987) (citation omitted).  Whether or not Wester intended to\r\n\ninjure  the bank, a jury could properly find that he intended\r\n\nto  \"defraud\"  the bank  by  causing  it through  consciously\r\n\ndishonest  means  to  part  with its  property  for  his  own\r\n\nbenefit.    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2The government's  brief conveys the impression that, as\r\nto  all of the  loans there was a  failure to obtain required\r                                                                         \r\napprovals by a  bank board or  committee.  On our  reading of\r\nthe transcript pages  cited by the government, this  is clear\r\nonly as to the $2.3 million loan.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     This brings us  to Gens.   In that  case, the  defendant\r                                        \r\n\nGens, a director of the bank, had persuaded others (e.g., one\r                                                                    \r\n\nof his friends)  to borrow from the bank and  to transfer the\r\n\nfunds  to  him;  and  bank  officers  working  with  Gens had\r\n\napproved  the loans knowing that  he would obtain  use of the\r\n\nfunds.  As this court read the  trial court's charge, it told\r\n\nthe jury that  misapplication had occurred  \"if it was  found\r\n\nthat [the officers] granted  loans to the [nominal borrowers]\r\n\nknowing that the proceeds would be turned over to Gens.\"  493\r\n\nF.2d at 221.  The jury convicted Gens and he appealed.\r\n\n     On appeal in Gens,  this court rejected the government's\r                                  \r\n\nbroad  notion that  \"willful  misapplication occurs  whenever\r                                                                         \r\n\nbank officials grant loans to parties with the knowledge that\r\n\nthe proceeds  will go to  a third  party.\"  492  F.2d at  223\r\n\n(emphasis added).  Our  opinion pointed out that most  of the\r\n\npertinent  cases  under the  misapplication  statute involved\r\n\nloans   to   borrowers   who   were   fictitious,  unwitting,\r\n\nirresponsible or had not assumed liability.  The contrary was\r\n\nso in Gens, except arguably as to one borrower; and the count\r                      \r\n\nas  to that borrower  was remanded for a  new trial under new\r\n\ninstructions.\r\n\n     Gens held that  the government's  \"whenever\" theory  was\r                     \r\n\noverbroad but  Gens did  not bar  a misapplication  charge in\r                                        \r\n\nevery  case where  the  straw happened  to  be a  financially\r\n\nresponsible borrower.    We  so noted  in  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nBrennan, 994 F.2d 918 (1st Cir. 1993).  There we  said that a\r                   \r\n\nmisapplication  charge could be made out where a bank officer\r\n\nmade loans to  named debtors knowing that  the proceeds would\r\n\ngo to  a third party and where  the surrounding circumstances\r                                    \r\n\ninvolved  dishonesty  (e.g.,  false  entries  in  the  bank's\r                                       \r\n\nrecords).  Id. at 923-24.\r                          \r\n\n     Wester's requested instruction 37 was thus not warranted\r\n\nby  Gens because it  would have  converted a  circumstance in\r                    \r\n\nGens--financial  responsibility  of  the   borrower--into  an\r                \r\n\nautomatic  defense  requiring acquittal  regardless  of other\r\n\nevidence of dishonesty.  Misapplication and intent to defraud\r\n\nturn  largely on  the facts;  the facts  here were  enough to\r\n\nconvict; and the requested  instruction was overbroad and was\r\n\nproperly denied.\r\n\n     2.   Wester's  other  complaint  about the  jury  charge\r\n\nconcerns the district court's instruction based  on Pinkerton\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), that a conspirator may\r                            \r\n\nbe    accountable for  actions  of  co-conspirators taken  in\r\n\nfurtherance of the  conspiracy.   Wester was  charged with  a\r\n\nconspiracy that  had as  its objects misapplication  and bank\r\n\nbribery.   Wester claims that the  district court's Pinkerton\r                                                                         \r\n\ninstruction was mistaken in two respects. \r\n\n     First,  Wester  argues  that  the  Pinkerton instruction\r                                                             \r\n\nallowed  the jury  to  find him  vicariously  liable for  the\r\n\nsubstantive crimes  of a co-conspirator even  if those crimes\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nwere  not the object of  the conspiracy or  in furtherance of\r\n\nit.  For example, he says that the jury could have found that\r\n\nWester was  guilty of the  substantive crime of  bank bribery\r\n\nbecause  one of  his co-conspirators committed  that offense;\r\n\nyet the  jury could have  found that the  conspiracy's object\r\n\nwas limited to misapplication. \r\n\n     One wonders  if Wester carefully read  the transcript of\r\n\nthe jury charge before making this argument.  After correctly\r\n\ndescribing the other elements  of the Pinkerton doctrine, the\r                                                           \r\n\ndistrict  court  stated that  the  jury must  find  \"that the\r\n\nsubstantive  crime (attributed to  the defendant vicariously)\r\n\nwas committed  pursuant to the common  plan and understanding\r\n\nyou  found to  exist among the  conspirators,\" and  that \"the\r\n\ndefendant could have reasonably foreseen that the substantive\r\n\ncrime  might be committed by his  co-conspirator.\"  In short,\r\n\nthe instruction itself answers Wester's hypothetical.   \r\n\n     Second, Wester argues that  it was inappropriate to give\r\n\na  Pinkerton  instruction at  all,  because  \"where there  is\r                        \r\n\nevidence  of various substantive offenses . . . it raises the\r\n\nrisk  that the jury will  resort to the  inverse of Pinkerton\r                                                                         \r\n\nand  infer the existence of the conspiracy from the series of\r\n\nsubstantive  criminal  offenses.\"    He says  this  risk  was\r\n\nespecially high here because the government  concentrated its\r\n\nefforts on  proving only the  substantive charges.   We agree\r\n\nneither with the premise nor the conclusion.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\n     In  a  case like  this one,  some interplay  between the\r\n\njury's  assessment of guilt on the substantive counts and the\r\n\nconspiracy charge  is both natural and  appropriate.  Indeed,\r\n\nthe fact  that substantive  crimes  were carried  out by  the\r\n\ndefendants, following discussions between them, may well make\r\n\nthe  fact of agreement more  likely.  Rossetti  v. Curran, 80\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 1,  5 (1st  Cir. 1996).   This  is so  whether or not  a\r\n\nPinkerton charge is  given; the  charge is at  most an  added\r                     \r\n\ncomplication for the jury but one well within its ken.\r\n\n     Here,   the   government  offered   ample   evidence  of\r\n\ndiscussions between  the four  partners that provided  a firm\r\n\nbasis  for  the  conspiracy  charge.   There  were  pages  of\r\n\ntestimony concerning the meetings among Wester, Fredo, George\r\n\nand  Morgan, that led to  the various loans  and the payments\r\n\nback to Wester.  This testimony provided grounds for the jury\r\n\nto find  that Wester participated in  the charged conspiracy.\r\n\nAnd, because Wester argued  that he was unaware of  many acts\r\n\nundertaken by his co-conspirators  (i.e, the false entries on\r                                                   \r\n\nloan  documents   by  Fredo),  a  Pinkerton  instruction  was\r                                                       \r\n\nespecially apt.\r\n\n     3.   Wester's  challenges  to  his  sentence  have  more\r\n\nmerit.  One  argument is that  the district court  improperly\r\n\ncalculated  the  victim loss  figures  for  one of  the  bank\r\n\nbribery counts.  The other concerns an adjustment for role in\r\n\nthe offense.  We address the claims in that order, describing\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nat the outset the calculation of the sentence.  Citations are\r\n\nto  the 1987 edition of  the guidelines which  was applied in\r\n\nthis case. \r\n\n     At  sentencing,  the  misapplication  and  bank  bribery\r\n\ncounts were grouped as  closely related counts under U.S.S.G.\r\n\n   3D1.2(d); and the bribery guideline  was used to determine\r\n\nthe base offense level because its level is the higher of the\r\n\ntwo.    Id.    3D1.3(b).   The  base offense  level  for bank\r                       \r\n\nbribery is eight, id.    2B4.1, to be increased based on  the\r                                 \r\n\ngreater of the  value of  the bribe or  the improper  benefit\r\n\nconferred  in return, according to the table at section 2F1.1\r\n\n(fraud).  In this case, the figure employed was  the value of\r\n\nthe bribe.\r\n\n     At the sentencing hearing, the district court found that\r\n\nWester  received,  or intended  to receive,  bribes totalling\r\n\n$12,650,000.   From the  presentence report, it  appears that\r\n\nthis total reflected Wester's release from personal liability\r\n\non the $12.4 million NEFR loan (in exchange for arranging the\r\n\n$2.3  million loan to Morgan and George), and the $250,000 in\r\n\nbuyout payments  he received  from Morgan and  George.   This\r\n\n$12,650,000 figure  subjected Wester to the  maximum 11-level\r\n\nincrease. U.S.S.G.   2F1.1.\r\n\n     The  resulting  offense level  of  19  (8 plus  11)  was\r\n\nfurther  adjusted  upward  by  4  levels  to  23,  reflecting\r\n\nWester's role  as an  organizer or  leader (a separate  issue\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\naddressed below).  There  was no reduction for  acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility.    The  resulting  range, for  a  first  time\r\n\noffender, is  46 to  57 months'  imprisonment.   The district\r\n\ncourt sentenced Wester,  at the  bottom of the  range, to  46\r\n\nmonths.\r\n\n     On  appeal, Wester  first  maintains  that the  district\r\n\ncourt should not  have included the  $12.4 million figure  as\r\n\nany part  of the value of  the bribes.  He  contends that the\r\n\nrelease from  his personal guaranty on the $12.4 million loan\r\n\nshould  not  count because  NEFR  did not  consider  the $2.3\r\n\nmillion loan a quid pro quo for the release, an argument that\r\n\nhe supports by pointing out that NEFR never formally executed\r\n\nthe release.  He also asserts that First Service would likely\r\n\nhave  made  the  $2.3  million  loan  to  Morgan  and  George\r\n\nregardless whether  NEFR offered to release  Wester and Fredo\r\n\nfrom personal liability.\r\n\n     18 U.S.C.   215 makes it criminal  corruptly to solicit,\r\n\naccept or agree to  accept anything of value intending  to be\r\n\ninfluenced or rewarded in connection with a bank transaction.\r\n\nThe jury was entitled to find that Wester did foster the $2.3\r\n\nmillion  loan to NEFR on  the understanding that  he would be\r\n\nrelieved of his  personal guaranty.   Whether the bank  would\r\n\nhave  made  the  loan  anyway, and  whether  Wester  actually\r\n\nreceived the  promised benefit, are  of no  moment under  the\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nstatute; and the guidelines apply to a promised payment quite\r\n\nas much as to payment actually received.3\r\n\n     Wester  is on  more solid  ground when  he argues  that,\r\n\nassuming that  the promised release of  his personal guaranty\r\n\ncould be counted for  sentencing purposes, the district court\r\n\nincorrectly valued  the release at the  $12.4 million figure,\r\n\nwhich  represented the full  amount of the  loan.  It  is far\r\n\nfrom clear that this issue was properly preserved, a point to\r\n\nwhich we will  return; but  the issue was  discussed in  oral\r\n\nargument in this court,  and the government has  furnished us\r\n\nwith the  Eighth Circuit's helpful decision  in United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Fitzhugh, 78 F.3d 1326, 1331 (8th Cir. 1996).\r                       \r\n\n     In Fitzhugh,  the court  was concerned with  valuing the\r                            \r\n\nimproper benefit conferred on the borrower by a loan obtained\r\n\nby bank bribery.  The trial  court had taken this value to be\r\n\nsimply the face amount of the loan; but as the Eighth Circuit\r\n\nexplained, citing  authority and examples, \"[t]he  value of a\r\n\ntransaction is  often quite different than the face amount of\r\n\nthat transaction.\"   78 F.3d  at 1331.   Indeed, the  current\r\n\nguideline  commentary  makes  clear that  (depending  on  the\r\n\nfacts) the value of a loan might be no more than the value of\r\n\na lower interest rate procured through the bribe.  Id.\r                                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3The statute  by its own terms  applies to solicitations\r\nand  agreements to accept as well as to bribes actually paid.\r\nAs to the guidelines, see, e.g., United States v. Gillis, 951\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d  580, 585 (4th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 3030\r                                                        \r\n(1992); U.S.S.G.   2C1.1 (lack of completion irrelevant).\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\n     Obviously, if  Wester had been bribed  with a one-dollar\r\n\nlottery ticket for a million dollar prize, no one would claim\r\n\nthat  the  ticket should  be  valued  at the  full  potential\r\n\nwinnings.  So,  too, if  he had been  given a  million-dollar\r\n\nterm  life  insurance policy.    Here,  the actual  value  of\r\n\nWester's promised release from  his personal guaranty for the\r\n\n$12.4 million loan  depends on such factors as the likelihood\r\n\nof default and the worth of the collateral securing the loan.\r\n\nIt is unlikely that  the economic value of the  release comes\r\n\nclose to $12.4 million.\r\n\n     At sentencing,  neither the  parties  nor the  probation\r\n\nofficer made any attempt to develop the information necessary\r\n\nto  estimate reasonably the value of the release.  It appears\r\n\nthat in  the district court  Wester's primary concern  was to\r\n\nexclude any consideration of the release (on grounds  we have\r                       \r\n\nalready rejected); and neither  the probation officer nor the\r\n\ngovernment seems to have  noticed the underlying problem with\r\n\nusing face  value when  the presentence report  was prepared.\r\n\nThus, the district court was not fairly alerted to the issue.\r\n\n     Nevertheless, we think that the miscalculation should be\r\n\nnoticed as plain error.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725\r                                                           \r\n\n(1993).  Prejudice exists since it is almost certain that the\r\n\nmisevaluation affected the guideline range, quite possibly to\r\n\na  significant extent;  for  example, eliminating  the  $12.4\r\n\nmillion figure entirely  would lower  the range to  30 to  37\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\nmonths.  And while an appeals court is not required to notice\r\n\nevery such  unpreserved error in sentencing,  Olano, 507 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 736, we think  that this is a proper case for us to notice\r\n\na  significant mistake.   United States  v. Whiting,  28 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1296, 1312 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 378 (1994). \r                                                \r\n\n     Wester's other main claim as to his sentence is that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in adjusting  his offense level up  four\r\n\nlevels for his role in the offense, under U.S.S.G   3B1.1(a).\r\n\nThis provision  provides for a four-level  enhancement if the\r\n\ncourt finds that \"the defendant was an organizer or leader of\r\n\na criminal activity which  included five or more participants\r\n\nor  was  otherwise  extensive.\"   On  appeal,  Wester's  only\r\n\ndeveloped  challenge is  to the  latter requirement  that the\r\n\nactivity include  five or more participants  or be \"otherwise\r\n\nextensive.\"\r\n\n     At the sentencing hearing, the district judge found that\r\n\nWester was an organizer or leader, based on his capacity as a\r\n\ntop official at First  Service and because the  scheme likely\r\n\ncould not have taken place without Wester's leadership.  From\r\n\nthis the court concluded  that the enhancement was warranted,\r\n\nwithout making  any additional  record finding as  to whether\r\n\nthe  enterprise involved  five  or more  participants or  was\r\n\n\"otherwise extensive.\"   \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\n     The court  did adopt the presentence  report by checking\r\n\nthe appropriate box,  but the  report is itself  a source  of\r\n\nuncertainty.  The initial report appears to rely on the \"five\r\n\nor  more participants\"  prong,  stating that  Wester was  the\r\n\norganizer  of  criminal  activity  involving  himself, Fredo,\r\n\nGeorge,  Morgan, and  then naming  several other  individuals\r\n\nsuch as  Morgan's accountant,  George's lawyer,  officials at\r\n\nNEFR,  and employees of First Service.  There was no reliance\r\n\non other variables such  as duration, number of episodes,  or\r\n\namount.  \r\n\n     Before  sentencing, Wester  objected to this  finding on\r\n\nthe grounds that the necessary five participants must each be\r\n\ncriminally  responsible,  not  merely  involved,  see  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70,  75 (1st Cir. 1995), and that\r                              \r\n\nnone of the persons named in the report beyond the  four main\r\n\nactors were criminally responsible for the  relevant actions.\r\n\nIn response, the probation officer prepared an amended report\r\n\nthat  took  the   position  that  Wester's   activities  were\r\n\n\"otherwise extensive\"  because of  the number of  individuals\r\n\ndirectly involved  and the  necessary use of  other unknowing\r\n\nemployees of First Service in order to effect the scheme.  \r\n\n     But  the  amended report  did  not  clearly abandon  the\r\n\nearlier  position   that  there   were  also  five   or  more\r\n\nparticipants, and the district judge did not make clear which\r\n\nof the report's two alternative grounds he was adopting.  The\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n\nproblem  is not  that  independent detailed  findings by  the\r\n\ndistrict court  are required;  rather, it is  that we  cannot\r\n\neffectively  review the  decision  to impose  the  four-level\r\n\nincrease  without  knowing  the  ground on  which  it  rests.\r\n\nUnited States v.  Anh Van, 1996 WL  324615 at *3-4  (1st Cir.\r                                     \r\n\nJune 18, 1996).\r\n\n     None  of  this  would  matter if  the  undisputed  facts\r\n\nrequired   a   finding  that   there  were   five  criminally\r                    \r\n\nresponsible  participants or that  the activity was otherwise\r\n\nextensive.   But that is not  the case here.   On appeal, the\r\n\ngovernment concedes  that  the five  participant  requirement\r\n\ncannot  be met, and, in our  view, the district court was not\r\n\ncompelled   to  find   that  the   activity  was   \"otherwise\r\n\nextensive,\" a  label that incorporates a  number of variables\r\n\nprimarily within the  ken of  the district court.   Anh  Van,\r                                                                        \r\n\n1996 WL 324615 at *4.\r\n\n     On  remand,  the  district  court  should  address   the\r\n\n\"otherwise  extensive\" issue  in the course  of resentencing.\r\n\nThe court  is free  to make  new findings  in support of  its\r\n\nearlier   determination  or  to   reconsider  the  adjustment\r\n\nentirely,  as it sees fit.

In the late 1980s, Wester arranged various transactions at First Service, including a series of loans by First Service to Webster's partners in a separate real estate venture, made with the understanding that the partners would use the loaned funds to buy out Wester's interest in the partnership.  At trial, Wester was convicted by a jury of several different crimes.  He now challenges the jury instructions and two adjustments to his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Wester does not directly dispute the sufficiency of the evidence, one of his claims as to jury instructions can be taken to raise the issue of sufficiency indirectly.  For that reason, we begin by describing what the evidence would have permitted the jury to find.  A reviewing court's perspective on the evidence depends on the claim of error being considered, and for a sufficiency claim, we take the evidence most favorable to the verdict.  E.g., United States v. Dodd, 43 F.3d 759, 760-61 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1986, Wester formed a partnership with three other men to construct a condominium project in Manchester, New Hampshire.  The three others were Robert Fredo, senior vice president at First Service, Robert George, a developer, and Charles Morgan, a broker.  Wester and Fredo supplied start-up money, and Wester helped arrange a $12.4 million loan organized by New England Financial Resources, Inc.  (\"NEFR\"), a commercial real estate lender not affiliated with First Service.  The loan was secured by land and future improvements and a personal guaranty of the debt from each of the partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Morgan had been a frequent borrower at First Service, NEFR was concerned that Wester's and Fredo's participation in the partnership might create conflicts of interest.  As a condition of the loan NEFR required a certificate from First Service acknowledging that Wester and Fredo had disclosed their interest in the project to the board of directors of First Service.  The certificate issued by First Service stated, inter alia, that the bank \"was not involved in the financing of this project and would not, without specific prior approval, grant any additional loans to Messrs.  Morgan or George.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1986, Morgan and George proposed another condominium project, this one in Massachusetts.  Wester suggested that First Service participate in the project as a joint venturer, but said that he and Fredo would need to divest their interests in the earlier partnership.  The four men agreed that Wester and Fredo would sell their interests to George and Morgan for $425,000 each, and be reimbursed for additional start-up money they had provided, all to be paid from future profits from the New Hampshire project.  Before the details of the buyout plan had been resolved, First Service (through a subsidiary) joined the new project with Morgan and George, and the bank provided a $5 million loan to the venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By June 1987, the New Hampshire project had yet to begin earning profits.  Wester grew impatient and told George and Morgan that he wanted his buyout payments.  When George said this was not feasible because of cash flow problems, Wester offered to provide First Service loans to George and Morgan to fund the buyout payments.  These loans, and the resulting buyout payments, became the basis for most of the later charges against Wester.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 1987, George signed two promissory notes for unsecured loans by First Service totalling $200,000.  That same day, George paid Wester and Fredo $100,000 each.  Morgan received a $300,000 loan from First Service on June 12;  several days later he paid Wester and Fredo $25,000 each, and George and Morgan (through the partnership) gave Wester and Fredo $250,000 for the start-up money previously contributed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Wester nor Fredo disclosed the true purpose of these loans to First Service's loan review committee, executive committee, or board of directors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Nor did the supporting documentation reveal that the loaned funds were being used to fund the buyout.  In one instance, the loan set-up sheets stated that the purpose of the loan was to \"finance acquisition of real property\";  in other instances no purpose for the loan was provided.  The jury could have found that the failure to disclose the purpose of the loans to the loan review committee was material, deliberate, and dishonest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This process was repeated several times over in the following months, with Wester and Fredo arranging loans or letters of credit to Morgan, George or entities they controlled--and in one instance George's father--with portions of the proceeds returned to Wester and Fredo to satisfy the buyout.  The last such loan was made on March 9, 1988.  On March 10, 1988, the buyout agreement was executed, and Wester's and Fredo's interests in the partnership were terminated \"retroactive\" to January 1, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was one more wrinkle of considerable importance.  The buyout agreement included a provision for releasing Wester and Fredo from their personal guaranties on the earlier $12.4 million loan from NEFR.  NEFR, however, was concerned about the financial health of the New Hampshire condominium project.  It made clear that it would only consent to the release if the partnership obtained a $2.3 million bank loan or line of credit to provide additional security for the $12.4 million loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Wester and Fredo arranged a $2.3 million loan by First Service for the partnership, without any disclosure to other bank officials of the connection to the proposed release and without approval by First Service's executive committee or board of directors.  Under the bank's rules, approval by the former was evidently required because of the size of the loan.  This loan and the promised release were each specified as offenses in the subsequent indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a portion of the $2.3 million was disbursed to the partnership, and before NEFR formally executed Wester's and Fredo's releases from the guaranties, the FDIC began investigating the goings-on at First Service.  Wester and Fredo were subsequently fired.  First Service honored its commitment to the partnership and released the balance of the $2.3 million loan proceeds.  NEFR never executed the releases, but neither did it call upon Wester or Fredo to pay based on their guaranties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1990, Wester and Fredo were named in a 22-count federal indictment charging them primarily with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, misapplication of bank funds, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 656, and bank bribery, i.e., the soliciting or receiving of bribes or rewards for the making of the loans, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 215.  The loans for the buyout payments and for the release were charged as misapplications under section 656;  the payments and promised releases were charged as bribes or rewards under section 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fredo pled guilty before trial to one count each of conspiracy, misapplication, and bank bribery, and testified for the government at Wester's trial.  After a 13-day jury trial in July 1994, Wester was convicted of one count of conspiracy, five counts of misapplication, and six counts of bank bribery.  He was acquitted of one count each of misapplication and bank bribery, and two tax evasion counts.  In December 1994, Wester was sentenced to 46 months in prison.  This appeal followed.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions but remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Wester's main challenge to the trial proceedings concerns the district court's jury instructions on the misapplication counts.  In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 656 provides criminal penalties for \"an officer, director, agent, or employee of ... national bank or insured bank ... [who] willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of such bank.\"   Formally, the dispute on appeal centers around the phrase \"willfully misapplies\";  in reality, Wester's argument also presents the question of whether the evidence was adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem that has confronted and perplexed the courts is that there is no statutory definition or common law heritage that gives content to the phrase \"willfully misapplies.\"  United States v. Gens, 493 F.2d 216, 221 (1st Cir.1974).  And to focus simply on the deprivation of property is hardly much help since it is a purpose of banks to lend money.  In response, the case law has developed two notions that help to clarify and delimit the statute--one relating primarily to conduct and the other to intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, \"misapplication\" has been taken by most courts to mean \"wrongful\" use of the bank's moneys.  See 1 Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions &#167; 24.01 (1995).  And, second, the courts have uniformly read back into the statute an earlier requirement, removed by a careless revisor, that the defendant have intended \"to injure or defraud\" the bank.  E.g., United States v. Angelos, 763 F.2d 859, 861 (7th Cir.1985).  Of course, the same facts can easily be the basis for deeming the conduct to be wrongful and the intent fraudulent;  but both misapplication and scienter are required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court's affirmative charge describing the offense of misapplication was for the most part conventional.  What Wester objects to on appeal is the court's refusal to give certain additional language specifically requested by Wester.  The language--which Wester believes to have been required by our decision in Gens--appears at two different points in Wester's requested instruction no. 37:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I instruct you that a loan to a financially capable person who fully understands that it is his responsibility to repay the loan does not constitute misapplication, even if the bank officer involved with the loan receives proceeds of the loan, or some other benefit.  Thus, in this case, with respect to the loans charged, if the debtors were financially capable of repaying the loans and that [sic] they understood that it was their responsibility to repay the loans, Mr. Wester must be acquitted on those counts irrespective of whether or not he received proceeds, or any other benefit, from those loans....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in this case, for each loan alleged in the Indictment as a misapplication of bank funds, if the named debtor was financially capable of repaying the loan and recognized his responsibility to repay the loan, there is no misapplication as a matter of law, even if proceeds of those loans or some other benefits were received by Mr. Wester.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, such language would have been very useful to Wester.  The government, it appears, did not try to show that any of the designated borrowers in the misapplication counts (E.g., George and Morgan) were fictitious or financially irresponsible or had never assumed liability for the loan.  Wester suggests that for bona fide loans to financially responsible borrowers, there is no serious risk of harm to the bank and therefore, even apart from the authority of Gens, no reason to apply the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wester's position is far from absurd, cf.  United States v. Docherty, 468 F.2d 989 (2d Cir.1972), but in the end it reads the statute too narrowly.  There is no indication that insider loans are inflexibly forbidden by federal law, but they obviously create a special set of dangers.  At least one danger--quis custodiet ipsos custodes--is that the insider who approves or fosters the loan may do so too readily if he himself benefits by it.  Controls on such loans, including authorizations and disclosures, are therefore pertinent to the safety of the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, financial responsibility on the part of the borrower is not an absolute but a matter of degree.  To say that the nominal borrower is at the outset financially capable of repayment hardly proves that the bank would have made the loan if it had been fully apprised of the risks and circumstances.  Here, two members of First Service's executive committee testified that they would not have approved the loans if Wester had disclosed that the proceeds were going to fund the buyout of Wester and Fredo's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the jury could reasonably have found that Wester caused the loans to be made for his own benefit without obtaining approvals from the executive committee or board of directors required under the bank's own rules (as to the largest $2.3 million loan) and (as to it and all others) because he deliberately suppressed or withheld information that the purpose of the loans was one that the bank would not have approved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This wrongful conduct permitted the jury in turn to find that Wester had engaged in the \"misapplication\" of bank funds.  All that remained was to find scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scienter requirement--an intent to injure or defraud--is stated in the alternative.  In the Supreme Court's classic summary, \"the words 'to defraud' commonly refer 'to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest means or schemes,' and 'usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.' \"  McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 358, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 2881, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987) (citation omitted).  Whether or not Wester intended to injure the bank, a jury could properly find that he intended to \"defraud\" the bank by causing it through consciously dishonest means to part with its property for his own benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Gens.  In that case, the defendant Gens, a director of the bank, had persuaded others (e.g., one of his friends) to borrow from the bank and to transfer the funds to him;  and bank officers working with Gens had approved the loans knowing that he would obtain use of the funds.  As this court read the trial court's charge, it told the jury that misapplication had occurred \"if it was found that [the officers] granted loans to the [nominal borrowers] knowing that the proceeds would be turned over to Gens.\" 493 F.2d at 221.   The jury convicted Gens and he appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal in Gens, this court rejected the government's broad notion that \"willful misapplication occurs whenever bank officials grant loans to parties with the knowledge that the proceeds will go to a third party.\"  493 F.2d at 223 (emphasis added).  Our opinion pointed out that most of the pertinent cases under the misapplication statute involved loans to borrowers who were fictitious, unwitting, irresponsible or had not assumed liability.  The contrary was so in Gens, except arguably as to one borrower;  and the count as to that borrower was remanded for a new trial under new instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gens held that the government's \"whenever\" theory was overbroad but Gens did not bar a misapplication charge in every case where the straw happened to be a financially responsible borrower.  We so noted in United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918 (1st Cir.1993).  There we said that a misapplication charge could be made out where a bank officer made loans to named debtors knowing that the proceeds would go to a third party and where the surrounding circumstances involved dishonesty (e.g., false entries in the bank's records).  Id. at 923-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wester's requested instruction 37 was thus not warranted by Gens because it would have converted a circumstance in Gens--financial responsibility of the borrower--into an automatic defense requiring acquittal regardless of other evidence of dishonesty.  Misapplication and intent to defraud turn largely on the facts;  the facts here were enough to convict;  and the requested instruction was overbroad and was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Wester's other complaint about the jury charge concerns the district court's instruction based on Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), that a conspirator may be accountable for actions of co-conspirators taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Wester was charged with a conspiracy that had as its objects misapplication and bank bribery.  Wester claims that the district court's Pinkerton instruction was mistaken in two respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Wester argues that the Pinkerton instruction allowed the jury to find him vicariously liable for the substantive crimes of a co-conspirator even if those crimes were not the object of the conspiracy or in furtherance of it.  For example, he says that the jury could have found that Wester was guilty of the substantive crime of bank bribery because one of his co-conspirators committed that offense;  yet the jury could have found that the conspiracy's object was limited to misapplication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One wonders if Wester carefully read the transcript of the jury charge before making this argument.  After correctly describing the other elements of the Pinkerton doctrine, the district court stated that the jury must find \"that the substantive crime (attributed to the defendant vicariously) was committed pursuant to the common plan and understanding you found to exist among the conspirators,\" and that \"the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that the substantive crime might be committed by his co-conspirator.\"   In short, the instruction itself answers Wester's hypothetical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Wester argues that it was inappropriate to give a Pinkerton instruction at all, because \"where there is evidence of various substantive offenses ... it raises the risk that the jury will resort to the inverse of Pinkerton and infer the existence of the conspiracy from the series of substantive criminal offenses.\"   He says this risk was especially high here because the government concentrated its efforts on proving only the substantive charges.  We agree neither with the premise nor the conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case like this one, some interplay between the jury's assessment of guilt on the substantive counts and the conspiracy charge is both natural and appropriate.  Indeed, the fact that substantive crimes were carried out by the defendants, following discussions between them, may well make the fact of agreement more likely.  Rossetti v. Curran, 80 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1996).  This is so whether or not a Pinkerton charge is given;  the charge is at most an added complication for the jury but one well within its ken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government offered ample evidence of discussions between the four partners that provided a firm basis for the conspiracy charge.  There were pages of testimony concerning the meetings among Wester, Fredo, George and Morgan, that led to the various loans and the payments back to Wester.  This testimony provided grounds for the jury to find that Wester participated in the charged conspiracy.  And, because Wester argued that he was unaware of many acts undertaken by his co-conspirators (i.e, the false entries on loan documents by Fredo), a Pinkerton instruction was especially apt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Wester's challenges to his sentence have more merit.  One argument is that the district court improperly calculated the victim loss figures for one of the bank bribery counts.  The other concerns an adjustment for role in the offense.  We address the claims in that order, describing at the outset the calculation of the sentence.  Citations are to the 1987 edition of the guidelines which was applied in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the misapplication and bank bribery counts were grouped as closely related counts under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(d);  and the bribery guideline was used to determine the base offense level because its level is the higher of the two.  Id. &#167; 3D1.3(b).  The base offense level for bank bribery is eight, id.  &#167; 2B4.1, to be increased based on the greater of the value of the bribe or the improper benefit conferred in return, according to the table at section 2F1.1 (fraud).  In this case, the figure employed was the value of the bribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court found that Wester received, or intended to receive, bribes totalling $12,650,000.  From the presentence report, it appears that this total reflected Wester's release from personal liability on the $12.4 million NEFR loan (in exchange for arranging the $2.3 million loan to Morgan and George), and the $250,000 in buyout payments he received from Morgan and George.  This $12,650,000 figure subjected Wester to the maximum 11-level increase.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting offense level of 19 (8 plus 11) was further adjusted upward by 4 levels to 23, reflecting Wester's role as an organizer or leader (a separate issue addressed below).  There was no reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  The resulting range, for a first time offender, is 46 to 57 months' imprisonment.  The district court sentenced Wester, at the bottom of the range, to 46 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Wester first maintains that the district court should not have included the $12.4 million figure as any part of the value of the bribes.  He contends that the release from his personal guaranty on the $12.4 million loan should not count because NEFR did not consider the $2.3 million loan a quid pro quo for the release, an argument that he supports by pointing out that NEFR never formally executed the release.  He also asserts that First Service would likely have made the $2.3 million loan to Morgan and George regardless of whether NEFR offered to release Wester and Fredo from personal liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 215 makes it criminal corruptly to solicit, accept or agree to accept anything of value intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with a bank transaction.  The jury was entitled to find that Wester did foster the $2.3 million loan to NEFR on the understanding that he would be relieved of his personal guaranty.  Whether the bank would have made the loan anyway, and whether Wester actually received the promised benefit, are of no moment under the statute;  and the guidelines apply to a promised payment quite as much as to payment actually received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wester is on more solid ground when he argues that, assuming that the promised release of his personal guaranty could be counted for sentencing purposes, the district court incorrectly valued the release at the $12.4 million figure, which represented the full amount of the loan.  It is far from clear that this issue was properly preserved, a point to which we will return;  but the issue was discussed in oral argument in this court, and the government has furnished us with the Eighth Circuit's helpful decision in United States v. Fitzhugh, 78 F.3d 1326, 1331 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fitzhugh, the court was concerned with valuing the improper benefit conferred on the borrower by a loan obtained by bank bribery.  The trial court had taken this value to be simply the face amount of the loan;  but as the Eighth Circuit explained, citing authority and examples, \"[t]he value of a transaction is often quite different than the face amount of that transaction.\"  78 F.3d at 1331.   Indeed, the current guideline commentary makes clear that (depending on the facts) the value of a loan might be no more than the value of a lower interest rate procured through the bribe.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, if Wester had been bribed with a one-dollar lottery ticket for a million dollar prize, no one would claim that the ticket should be valued at the full potential winnings.  So, too, if he had been given a million-dollar term life insurance policy.  Here, the actual value of Wester's promised release from his personal guaranty for the $12.4 million loan depends on such factors as the likelihood of default and the worth of the collateral securing the loan.  It is unlikely that the economic value of the release comes close to $12.4 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, neither the parties nor the probation officer made any attempt to develop the information necessary to estimate reasonably the value of the release.  It appears that in the district court Wester's primary concern was to exclude any consideration of the release (on grounds we have already rejected);  and neither the probation officer nor the government seems to have noticed the underlying problem with using face value when the presentence report was prepared.  Thus, the district court was not fairly alerted to the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we think that the miscalculation should be noticed as plain error.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  Prejudice exists since it is almost certain that the misevaluation affected the guideline range, quite possibly to a significant extent;  for example, eliminating the $12.4 million figure entirely would lower the range to 30 to 37 months.  And while an appeals court is not required to notice every such unpreserved error in sentencing, Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1778, we think that this is a proper case for us to notice a significant mistake.  United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1312 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 956, 115 S.Ct. 378, 130 L.Ed.2d 328 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wester's other main claim as to his sentence is that the district court erred in adjusting his offense level up four levels for his role in the offense, under U.S.S.G &#167; 3B1.1(a).  This provision provides for a four-level enhancement if the court finds that \"the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity which included five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"   On appeal, Wester's only developed challenge is to the latter requirement that the activity include five or more participants or be \"otherwise extensive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district judge found that Wester was an organizer or leader, based on his capacity as a top official at First Service and because the scheme likely could not have taken place without Wester's leadership.  From this the court concluded that the enhancement was warranted, without making any additional record finding as to whether the enterprise involved five or more participants or was \"otherwise extensive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did adopt the presentence report by checking the appropriate box, but the report is itself a source of uncertainty.  The initial report appears to rely on the \"five or more participants\" prong, stating that Wester was the organizer of criminal activity involving himself, Fredo, George, Morgan, and then naming several other individuals such as Morgan's accountant, George's lawyer, officials at NEFR, and employees of First Service.  There was no reliance on other variables such as duration, number of episodes, or amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sentencing, Wester objected to this finding on the grounds that the necessary five participants must each be criminally responsible, not merely involved, see United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.1995), and that none of the persons named in the report beyond the four main actors were criminally responsible for the relevant actions.  In response, the probation officer prepared an amended report that took the position that Wester's activities were \"otherwise extensive\" because of the number of individuals directly involved and the necessary use of other unknowing employees of First Service in order to effect the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the amended report did not clearly abandon the earlier position that there were also five or more participants, and the district judge did not make clear which of the report's two alternative grounds he was adopting.  The problem is not that independent detailed findings by the district court are required;  rather, it is that we cannot effectively review the decision to impose the four-level increase without knowing the ground on which it rests.  United States v. Anh Van, 87 F.3d 1, 2-4 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of this would matter if the undisputed facts required a finding that there were five criminally responsible participants or that the activity was otherwise extensive.  But that is not the case here.  On appeal, the government concedes that the five participant requirement cannot be met, and, in our view, the district court was not compelled to find that the activity was \"otherwise extensive,\" a label that incorporates a number of variables primarily within the ken of the district court.  Anh Van, 87 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court should address the \"otherwise extensive\" issue in the course of resentencing.  The court is free to make new findings in support of its earlier determination or to reconsider the adjustment entirely, as it sees fit.  Since resentencing will likely be required based on the re-valuation of the bribes, we affirm the convictions but vacate the existing sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the bank's rules, all insider loans and all loans of over $5 million had to be approved by the board.  The executive committee had to approve loans between $1 million and $5 million;  and the loan review committee, on which Wester and Fredo sat with other officers, could approve loans up to $1 million</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The government's brief conveys the impression that as to all of the loans there was a failure to obtain required approvals by a bank board or committee.

In the late 1980s, Wester arranged various transactions at First Service, including a series of loans by First Service to Webster's partners in a separate real estate venture, made with the understanding that the partners would use the loaned funds to buy out Wester's interest in the partnership.  At trial, Wester was convicted by a jury of several different crimes.  He now challenges the jury instructions and two adjustments to his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Wester does not directly dispute the sufficiency of the evidence, one of his claims as to jury instructions can be taken to raise the issue of sufficiency indirectly.  For that reason, we begin by describing what the evidence would have permitted the jury to find.  A reviewing court's perspective on the evidence depends on the claim of error being considered, and for a sufficiency claim, we take the evidence most favorable to the verdict.  E.g., United States v. Dodd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685591\"><a href=\"/opinion/685591/united-states-v-leon-j-dodd/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 760-61 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1986, Wester formed a partnership with three other men to construct a condominium project in Manchester, New Hampshire.  The three others were Robert Fredo, senior vice president at First Service, Robert George, a developer, and Charles Morgan, a broker.  Wester and Fredo supplied start-up money, and Wester helped arrange a $12.4 million loan organized by New England Financial Resources, Inc.  (\"NEFR\"), a commercial real estate lender not affiliated with First Service.  The loan was secured by land and future improvements and a personal guaranty of the debt from each of the partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Morgan had been a frequent borrower at First Service, NEFR was concerned that Wester's and Fredo's participation in the partnership might create conflicts of interest.  As a condition of the loan NEFR required a certificate from First Service acknowledging that Wester and Fredo had disclosed their interest in the project to the board of directors of First Service.  The certificate issued by First Service stated, inter alia, that the bank \"was not involved in the financing of this project and would not, without specific prior approval, grant any additional loans to Messrs.  Morgan or George.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1986, Morgan and George proposed another condominium project, this one in Massachusetts.  Wester suggested that First Service participate in the project as a joint venturer, but said that he and Fredo would need to divest their interests in the earlier partnership.  The four men agreed that Wester and Fredo would sell their interests to George and Morgan for $425,000 each, and be reimbursed for additional start-up money they had provided, all to be paid from future profits from the New Hampshire project.  Before the details of the buyout plan had been resolved, First Service (through a subsidiary) joined the new project with Morgan and George, and the bank provided a $5 million loan to the venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By June 1987, the New Hampshire project had yet to begin earning profits.  Wester grew impatient and told George and Morgan that he wanted his buyout payments.  When George said this was not feasible because of cash flow problems, Wester offered to provide First Service loans to George and Morgan to fund the buyout payments.  These loans, and the resulting buyout payments, became the basis for most of the later charges against Wester.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 1987, George signed two promissory notes for unsecured loans by First Service totalling $200,000.  That same day, George paid Wester and Fredo $100,000 each.  Morgan received a $300,000 loan from First Service on June 12;  several days later he paid Wester and Fredo $25,000 each, and George and Morgan (through the partnership) gave Wester and Fredo $250,000 for the start-up money previously contributed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Wester nor Fredo disclosed the true purpose of these loans to First Service's loan review committee, executive committee, or board of directors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Nor did the supporting documentation reveal that the loaned funds were being used to fund the buyout.  In one instance, the loan set-up sheets stated that the purpose of the loan was to \"finance acquisition of real property\";  in other instances no purpose for the loan was provided.  The jury could have found that the failure to disclose the purpose of the loans to the loan review committee was material, deliberate, and dishonest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This process was repeated several times over in the following months, with Wester and Fredo arranging loans or letters of credit to Morgan, George or entities they controlled--and in one instance George's father--with portions of the proceeds returned to Wester and Fredo to satisfy the buyout.  The last such loan was made on March 9, 1988.  On March 10, 1988, the buyout agreement was executed, and Wester's and Fredo's interests in the partnership were terminated \"retroactive\" to January 1, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was one more wrinkle of considerable importance.  The buyout agreement included a provision for releasing Wester and Fredo from their personal guaranties on the earlier $12.4 million loan from NEFR.  NEFR, however, was concerned about the financial health of the New Hampshire condominium project.  It made clear that it would only consent to the release if the partnership obtained a $2.3 million bank loan or line of credit to provide additional security for the $12.4 million loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Wester and Fredo arranged a $2.3 million loan by First Service for the partnership, without any disclosure to other bank officials of the connection to the proposed release and without approval by First Service's executive committee or board of directors.  Under the bank's rules, approval by the former was evidently required because of the size of the loan.  This loan and the promised release were each specified as offenses in the subsequent indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a portion of the $2.3 million was disbursed to the partnership, and before NEFR formally executed Wester's and Fredo's releases from the guaranties, the FDIC began investigating the goings-on at First Service.  Wester and Fredo were subsequently fired.  First Service honored its commitment to the partnership and released the balance of the $2.3 million loan proceeds.  NEFR never executed the releases, but neither did it call upon Wester or Fredo to pay based on their guaranties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 1990, Wester and Fredo were named in a 22-count federal indictment charging them primarily with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, misapplication of bank funds, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 656, and bank bribery, i.e., the soliciting or receiving of bribes or rewards for the making of the loans, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 215.  The loans for the buyout payments and for the release were charged as misapplications under section 656;  the payments and promised releases were charged as bribes or rewards under section 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fredo pled guilty before trial to one count each of conspiracy, misapplication, and bank bribery, and testified for the government at Wester's trial.  After a 13-day jury trial in July 1994, Wester was convicted of one count of conspiracy, five counts of misapplication, and six counts of bank bribery.  He was acquitted of one count each of misapplication and bank bribery, and two tax evasion counts.  In December 1994, Wester was sentenced to 46 months in prison.  This appeal followed.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions but remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Wester's main challenge to the trial proceedings concerns the district court's jury instructions on the misapplication counts.  In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 656 provides criminal penalties for \"an officer, director, agent, or employee of ... national bank or insured bank ... [who] willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of such bank.\"   Formally, the dispute on appeal centers around the phrase \"willfully misapplies\";  in reality, Wester's argument also presents the question of whether the evidence was adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem that has confronted and perplexed the courts is that there is no statutory definition or common law heritage that gives content to the phrase \"willfully misapplies.\"  United States v. Gens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"317625\"><a href=\"/opinion/317625/united-states-v-richard-h-gens-united-states-of-america-v-anthony-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 221 (1st Cir.1974).  And to focus simply on the deprivation of property is hardly much help since it is a purpose of banks to lend money.  In response, the case law has developed two notions that help to clarify and delimit the statute--one relating primarily to conduct and the other to intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, \"misapplication\" has been taken by most courts to mean \"wrongful\" use of the bank's moneys.  See 1 Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions &#167; 24.01 (1995).  And, second, the courts have uniformly read back into the statute an earlier requirement, removed by a careless revisor, that the defendant have intended \"to injure or defraud\" the bank.  E.g., United States v. Angelos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453235\"><a href=\"/opinion/453235/united-states-v-anthony-angelos/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span>, 861 (7th Cir.1985).  Of course, the same facts can easily be the basis for deeming the conduct to be wrongful and the intent fraudulent;  but both misapplication and scienter are required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court's affirmative charge describing the offense of misapplication was for the most part conventional.  What Wester objects to on appeal is the court's refusal to give certain additional language specifically requested by Wester.  The language--which Wester believes to have been required by our decision in Gens--appears at two different points in Wester's requested instruction no. 37:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I instruct you that a loan to a financially capable person who fully understands that it is his responsibility to repay the loan does not constitute misapplication, even if the bank officer involved with the loan receives proceeds of the loan, or some other benefit.  Thus, in this case, with respect to the loans charged, if the debtors were financially capable of repaying the loans and that [sic] they understood that it was their responsibility to repay the loans, Mr. Wester must be acquitted on those counts irrespective of whether or not he received proceeds, or any other benefit, from those loans....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in this case, for each loan alleged in the Indictment as a misapplication of bank funds, if the named debtor was financially capable of repaying the loan and recognized his responsibility to repay the loan, there is no misapplication as a matter of law, even if proceeds of those loans or some other benefits were received by Mr. Wester.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, such language would have been very useful to Wester.  The government, it appears, did not try to show that any of the designated borrowers in the misapplication counts (E.g., George and Morgan) were fictitious or financially irresponsible or had never assumed liability for the loan.  Wester suggests that for bona fide loans to financially responsible borrowers, there is no serious risk of harm to the bank and therefore, even apart from the authority of Gens, no reason to apply the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wester's position is far from absurd, cf.  United States v. Docherty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"306402\"><a href=\"/opinion/306402/united-states-v-robert-h-docherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1972), but in the end it reads the statute too narrowly.  There is no indication that insider loans are inflexibly forbidden by federal law, but they obviously create a special set of dangers.  At least one danger--quis custodiet ipsos custodes--is that the insider who approves or fosters the loan may do so too readily if he himself benefits by it.  Controls on such loans, including authorizations and disclosures, are therefore pertinent to the safety of the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, financial responsibility on the part of the borrower is not an absolute but a matter of degree.  To say that the nominal borrower is at the outset financially capable of repayment hardly proves that the bank would have made the loan if it had been fully apprised of the risks and circumstances.  Here, two members of First Service's executive committee testified that they would not have approved the loans if Wester had disclosed that the proceeds were going to fund the buyout of Wester and Fredo's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the jury could reasonably have found that Wester caused the loans to be made for his own benefit without obtaining approvals from the executive committee or board of directors required under the bank's own rules (as to the largest $2.3 million loan) and (as to it and all others) because he deliberately suppressed or withheld information that the purpose of the loans was one that the bank would not have approved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This wrongful conduct permitted the jury in turn to find that Wester had engaged in the \"misapplication\" of bank funds.  All that remained was to find scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scienter requirement--an intent to injure or defraud--is stated in the alternative.  In the Supreme Court's classic summary, \"the words 'to defraud' commonly refer 'to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest means or schemes,' and 'usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.' \"  McNally v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111945\"><a href=\"/opinion/111945/mcnally-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 358, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111945\"><a href=\"/opinion/111945/mcnally-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2875</span></a></span>, 2881, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111945\"><a href=\"/opinion/111945/mcnally-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span> (1987) (citation omitted).  Whether or not Wester intended to injure the bank, a jury could properly find that he intended to \"defraud\" the bank by causing it through consciously dishonest means to part with its property for his own benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Gens.  In that case, the defendant Gens, a director of the bank, had persuaded others (e.g., one of his friends) to borrow from the bank and to transfer the funds to him;  and bank officers working with Gens had approved the loans knowing that he would obtain use of the funds.  As this court read the trial court's charge, it told the jury that misapplication had occurred \"if it was found that [the officers] granted loans to the [nominal borrowers] knowing that the proceeds would be turned over to Gens.\" 493 F.2d at 221.   The jury convicted Gens and he appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal in Gens, this court rejected the government's broad notion that \"willful misapplication occurs whenever bank officials grant loans to parties with the knowledge that the proceeds will go to a third party.\"  493 F.2d at 223 (emphasis added).  Our opinion pointed out that most of the pertinent cases under the misapplication statute involved loans to borrowers who were fictitious, unwitting, irresponsible or had not assumed liability.  The contrary was so in Gens, except arguably as to one borrower;  and the count as to that borrower was remanded for a new trial under new instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gens held that the government's \"whenever\" theory was overbroad but Gens did not bar a misapplication charge in every case where the straw happened to be a financially responsible borrower.  We so noted in United States v. Brennan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608079\"><a href=\"/opinion/608079/united-states-v-james-f-brennan-united-states-v-j-edward-mchugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993).  There we said that a misapplication charge could be made out where a bank officer made loans to named debtors knowing that the proceeds would go to a third party and where the surrounding circumstances involved dishonesty (e.g., false entries in the bank's records).  Id. at 923-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wester's requested instruction 37 was thus not warranted by Gens because it would have converted a circumstance in Gens--financial responsibility of the borrower--into an automatic defense requiring acquittal regardless of other evidence of dishonesty.  Misapplication and intent to defraud turn largely on the facts;  the facts here were enough to convict;  and the requested instruction was overbroad and was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Wester's other complaint about the jury charge concerns the district court's instruction based on Pinkerton v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1489</span></a></span> (1946), that a conspirator may be accountable for actions of co-conspirators taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Wester was charged with a conspiracy that had as its objects misapplication and bank bribery.  Wester claims that the district court's Pinkerton instruction was mistaken in two respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Wester argues that the Pinkerton instruction allowed the jury to find him vicariously liable for the substantive crimes of a co-conspirator even if those crimes were not the object of the conspiracy or in furtherance of it.  For example, he says that the jury could have found that Wester was guilty of the substantive crime of bank bribery because one of his co-conspirators committed that offense;  yet the jury could have found that the conspiracy's object was limited to misapplication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One wonders if Wester carefully read the transcript of the jury charge before making this argument.  After correctly describing the other elements of the Pinkerton doctrine, the district court stated that the jury must find \"that the substantive crime (attributed to the defendant vicariously) was committed pursuant to the common plan and understanding you found to exist among the conspirators,\" and that \"the defendant could have reasonably foreseen that the substantive crime might be committed by his co-conspirator.\"   In short, the instruction itself answers Wester's hypothetical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Wester argues that it was inappropriate to give a Pinkerton instruction at all, because \"where there is evidence of various substantive offenses ... it raises the risk that the jury will resort to the inverse of Pinkerton and infer the existence of the conspiracy from the series of substantive criminal offenses.\"   He says this risk was especially high here because the government concentrated its efforts on proving only the substantive charges.  We agree neither with the premise nor the conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case like this one, some interplay between the jury's assessment of guilt on the substantive counts and the conspiracy charge is both natural and appropriate.  Indeed, the fact that substantive crimes were carried out by the defendants, following discussions between them, may well make the fact of agreement more likely.  Rossetti v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196645\"><a href=\"/opinion/196645/rossetti-v-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1996).  This is so whether or not a Pinkerton charge is given;  the charge is at most an added complication for the jury but one well within its ken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government offered ample evidence of discussions between the four partners that provided a firm basis for the conspiracy charge.  There were pages of testimony concerning the meetings among Wester, Fredo, George and Morgan, that led to the various loans and the payments back to Wester.  This testimony provided grounds for the jury to find that Wester participated in the charged conspiracy.  And, because Wester argued that he was unaware of many acts undertaken by his co-conspirators (i.e, the false entries on loan documents by Fredo), a Pinkerton instruction was especially apt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Wester's challenges to his sentence have more merit.  One argument is that the district court improperly calculated the victim loss figures for one of the bank bribery counts.  The other concerns an adjustment for role in the offense.  We address the claims in that order, describing at the outset the calculation of the sentence.  Citations are to the 1987 edition of the guidelines which was applied in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the misapplication and bank bribery counts were grouped as closely related counts under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(d);  and the bribery guideline was used to determine the base offense level because its level is the higher of the two.  Id. &#167; 3D1.3(b).  The base offense level for bank bribery is eight, id.  &#167; 2B4.1, to be increased based on the greater of the value of the bribe or the improper benefit conferred in return, according to the table at section 2F1.1 (fraud).  In this case, the figure employed was the value of the bribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court found that Wester received, or intended to receive, bribes totalling $12,650,000.  From the presentence report, it appears that this total reflected Wester's release from personal liability on the $12.4 million NEFR loan (in exchange for arranging the $2.3 million loan to Morgan and George), and the $250,000 in buyout payments he received from Morgan and George.  This $12,650,000 figure subjected Wester to the maximum 11-level increase.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting offense level of 19 (8 plus 11) was further adjusted upward by 4 levels to 23, reflecting Wester's role as an organizer or leader (a separate issue addressed below).  There was no reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  The resulting range, for a first time offender, is 46 to 57 months' imprisonment.  The district court sentenced Wester, at the bottom of the range, to 46 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Wester first maintains that the district court should not have included the $12.4 million figure as any part of the value of the bribes.  He contends that the release from his personal guaranty on the $12.4 million loan should not count because NEFR did not consider the $2.3 million loan a quid pro quo for the release, an argument that he supports by pointing out that NEFR never formally executed the release.  He also asserts that First Service would likely have made the $2.3 million loan to Morgan and George regardless of whether NEFR offered to release Wester and Fredo from personal liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 215 makes it criminal corruptly to solicit, accept or agree to accept anything of value intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with a bank transaction.  The jury was entitled to find that Wester did foster the $2.3 million loan to NEFR on the understanding that he would be relieved of his personal guaranty.  Whether the bank would have made the loan anyway, and whether Wester actually received the promised benefit, are of no moment under the statute;  and the guidelines apply to a promised payment quite as much as to payment actually received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wester is on more solid ground when he argues that, assuming that the promised release of his personal guaranty could be counted for sentencing purposes, the district court incorrectly valued the release at the $12.4 million figure, which represented the full amount of the loan.  It is far from clear that this issue was properly preserved, a point to which we will return;  but the issue was discussed in oral argument in this court, and the government has furnished us with the Eighth Circuit's helpful decision in United States v. Fitzhugh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714853\"><a href=\"/opinion/714853/united-states-v-eugene-fitzhugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1326</span></a></span>, 1331 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fitzhugh, the court was concerned with valuing the improper benefit conferred on the borrower by a loan obtained by bank bribery.  The trial court had taken this value to be simply the face amount of the loan;  but as the Eighth Circuit explained, citing authority and examples, \"[t]he value of a transaction is often quite different than the face amount of that transaction.\"  78 F.3d at 1331.   Indeed, the current guideline commentary makes clear that (depending on the facts) the value of a loan might be no more than the value of a lower interest rate procured through the bribe.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, if Wester had been bribed with a one-dollar lottery ticket for a million dollar prize, no one would claim that the ticket should be valued at the full potential winnings.  So, too, if he had been given a million-dollar term life insurance policy.  Here, the actual value of Wester's promised release from his personal guaranty for the $12.4 million loan depends on such factors as the likelihood of default and the worth of the collateral securing the loan.  It is unlikely that the economic value of the release comes close to $12.4 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, neither the parties nor the probation officer made any attempt to develop the information necessary to estimate reasonably the value of the release.  It appears that in the district court Wester's primary concern was to exclude any consideration of the release (on grounds we have already rejected);  and neither the probation officer nor the government seems to have noticed the underlying problem with using face value when the presentence report was prepared.  Thus, the district court was not fairly alerted to the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we think that the miscalculation should be noticed as plain error.  United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993).  Prejudice exists since it is almost certain that the misevaluation affected the guideline range, quite possibly to a significant extent;  for example, eliminating the $12.4 million figure entirely would lower the range to 30 to 37 months.  And while an appeals court is not required to notice every such unpreserved error in sentencing, Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1778, we think that this is a proper case for us to notice a significant mistake.  United States v. Whiting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673817\"><a href=\"/opinion/673817/united-states-v-darryl-whiting-aka-g-god-rah-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>, 1312 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This provision provides for a four-level enhancement if the court finds that \"the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity which included five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"   On appeal, Wester's only developed challenge is to the latter requirement that the activity include five or more participants or be \"otherwise extensive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district judge found that Wester was an organizer or leader, based on his capacity as a top official at First Service and because the scheme likely could not have taken place without Wester's leadership.  From this the court concluded that the enhancement was warranted, without making any additional record finding as to whether the enterprise involved five or more participants or was \"otherwise extensive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did adopt the presentence report by checking the appropriate box, but the report is itself a source of uncertainty.  The initial report appears to rely on the \"five or more participants\" prong, stating that Wester was the organizer of criminal activity involving himself, Fredo, George, Morgan, and then naming several other individuals such as Morgan's accountant, George's lawyer, officials at NEFR, and employees of First Service.  There was no reliance on other variables such as duration, number of episodes, or amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sentencing, Wester objected to this finding on the grounds that the necessary five participants must each be criminally responsible, not merely involved, see United States v. Graciani, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.1995), and that none of the persons named in the report beyond the four main actors were criminally responsible for the relevant actions.  In response, the probation officer prepared an amended report that took the position that Wester's activities were \"otherwise extensive\" because of the number of individuals directly involved and the necessary use of other unknowing employees of First Service in order to effect the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the amended report did not clearly abandon the earlier position that there were also five or more participants, and the district judge did not make clear which of the report's two alternative grounds he was adopting.  The problem is not that independent detailed findings by the district court are required;  rather, it is that we cannot effectively review the decision to impose the four-level increase without knowing the ground on which it rests.  United States v. Anh Van, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196815\"><a href=\"/opinion/196815/united-states-v-van/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2-4 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of this would matter if the undisputed facts required a finding that there were five criminally responsible participants or that the activity was otherwise extensive.  But that is not the case here.  On appeal, the government concedes that the five participant requirement cannot be met, and, in our view, the district court was not compelled to find that the activity was \"otherwise extensive,\" a label that incorporates a number of variables primarily within the ken of the district court.  Anh Van, 87 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court should address the \"otherwise extensive\" issue in the course of resentencing.  The court is free to make new findings in support of its earlier determination or to reconsider the adjustment entirely, as it sees fit.  Since resentencing will likely be required based on the re-valuation of the bribes, we affirm the convictions but vacate the existing sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the bank's rules, all insider loans and all loans of over $5 million had to be approved by the board.  The executive committee had to approve loans between $1 million and $5 million;  and the loan review committee, on which Wester and Fredo sat with other officers, could approve loans up to $1 million</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The government's brief conveys the impression that as to all of the loans there was a failure to obtain required approvals by a bank board or committee.  On our reading of the transcript pages cited by the government, this is clear only as to the $2.3 million loan</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute by its own terms applies to solicitations and agreements to accept as well as to bribes actually paid.
