Hunger, Assistant\r\nAttorney General, Department of Justice, Civil Division, and Karen\r\nAnn Hunold, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration\r\nLitigation, were on brief for respondent.\r\n\nMarch 5, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  In this immigration appeal, the\r\nbackground facts are not disputed.  Emmanuel J. Foroglou\r\n(\"Foroglou\"), a native and citizen of Greece, entered the United\r\nStates on a student visa in August 1983, to pursue graduate studies\r\nin economics at Brown University.  When he left Brown to teach at\r\nUtica University in 1987, his visa status was changed to H-1B, a\r\nnon-immigrant professional visa.  However, when Foroglou left his\r\njob at Utica in 1989 (and thus became ineligible for an H-1B visa),\r\nhe did not inform the INS.\r\nAfter working in Chicago for several years, Foroglou\r\nmoved to Houlton, Maine.  Shortly after he moved to Houlton, he\r\ncame to the attention of the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService.  In October 1993, Foroglou was served with an order to\r\nshow cause why he should not be deported--the beginning of\r\ndeportation proceedings.  See 8 C.F.R.  242.1 (1993).  Foroglou\r\ndid not dispute the facts as to entry and visa status but claimed\r\nrefugee status based on his objections to the military draft laws\r\nof Greece.  He has no family or relatives in the United States.\r\nShortly after entering the United States, Foroglou,\r\nprofessedly an atheist, began to develop a belief in Objectivism,\r\na philosophy developed by the twentieth-century author Ayn Rand.  \r\nHe says that he now believes that the draft \"negates man's\r\nfundamental right to life and established [sic] the fundamental\r\nprinciple of statism:  that a man's life belongs to the state, and\r\nthat the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in\r\nbattle.\"  Ayn Rand, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, 227 (1967)\r\n(quoted in Foroglou's application for asylum).  Although he is\r\nopposed to any military draft, Foroglou is not opposed to war or\r\nfighting; his beliefs are only concerned with the fact that the\r\ndraft is involuntary.\r\nBased on the administrative record in this case, it\r\nappears that under Greek law, all males between the ages of 18 and\r\n50 are subject to military service for 24 months.  Since 1977,\r\ndraftees may choose instead to serve, for twice the usual amount of\r\ntime, in non-combatant roles.  In addition, in 1997, an alternative\r\ncivilian service option was instituted for conscientious objectors;\r\nit is about 12-18 months longer than combatant military service,\r\nand Foroglou would probably not qualify for this alternative\r\nbecause he is not opposed to the use of weapons.\r\nIn 1980, Foroglou had received a 10-year student\r\ndeferment of military service but he apparently did nothing in 1990\r\nto renew it or to declare himself a conscientious objector. \r\nHowever, after the INS served its show cause order, Foroglou says\r\nthat he wrote to the Greek Consulate in May 1994, to request a\r\npassport to replace the one being held by the INS and to declare\r\nhimself a conscientious objector.  The Greek consul responded that\r\nit could not issue Foroglou a passport until he had completed his\r\nmilitary service and that Foroglou would have to deal with his\r\nlocal draft office (in Greece) about declaring himself a\r\nconscientious objector.\r\nThe first hearing on Foroglou's deportation was held on\r\nDecember 1, 1993, and thereafter continued so Foroglou could file\r\napplications for political asylum and suspension of deportation. \r\nSee 8 U.S.C.  1158, 1253(h).  Foroglou filed these applications\r\nand also applied for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation,\r\nsee 8 U.S.C.  1254(e).  Testimony, consistent with the facts\r\ndescribed above, was completed on December 1, 1994.  The hearing\r\nwas reconvened again on September 6, 1995, and Foroglou moved to\r\nwithdraw his application for suspension of deportation.  The\r\nimmigration judge granted his motion with prejudice and proceeded\r\nto present his decision.\r\nIn the decision, the immigration judge found that\r\nForoglou had not established that he had a well-founded fear of\r\npersecution on account of his religion, race, nationality,\r\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion if he\r\nwere to return to Greece, or that any punishment for failing to\r\ncomply with Greek conscription law would be disproportionately\r\nsevere on account of any one of these factors.  He denied\r\nForoglou's application for asylum, but granted Foroglou voluntary\r\ndeparture within 30 days in lieu of deportation.\r\nEight days later, Foroglou filed a notice of appeal with\r\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals.  In February 1998, before his\r\nappeal was heard, Foroglou filed with the Board additional evidence\r\nand a motion to remand to the immigration judge.  The new evidence\r\nrelated to the new 1997 civilian service option and Foroglou's\r\nclaim that he would not qualify for this alternative service.  On\r\nApril 30, 1998, the Board dismissed Foroglou's appeal, denied his\r\nmotion to remand, and again granted him 30 days in which to\r\nvoluntarily depart.  Foroglou filed a petition for review with this\r\ncourt and moved for a stay of deportation, which was granted on May\r\n21, 1998.\r\nOn this appeal, we begin with the Board's denial of\r\nForoglou's application for political asylum.  Its factual\r\ndeterminations are conclusive if \"supported by reasonable,\r\nsubstantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a\r\nwhole.\"  8 U.S.C.  1105a(a)(4); see also Gebremichael v. INS, 10\r\nF.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 1993).  The Board's application of the legal\r\nstandards to specific facts is also entitled to deference.  SeeRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992).  Abstract\r\nrulings of law are subject to de novo review.  See Maldonado-Cruzv. INS, 883 F.2d 788, 791 (9th Cir. 1989). \r\nThe statute governing asylum, 8 U.S.C.  1158(b), states\r\nthat an alien can be granted asylum, in the discretion of the\r\nAttorney General, if the alien is a \"refugee\" within the meaning of\r\n8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(42)(A), namely, someone who is unable or\r\nunwilling to return to his home country because of \"persecution or\r\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\r\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\r\nopinion.\"  The Attorney General does not resist review of the\r\nBoard's determination as to whether an applicant meets any of the\r\nfive enumerated grounds.\r\nTo qualify for asylum, the applicant must show that he\r\nactually fears persecution (a subjective issue), and that there is\r\na \"reasonable possibility\" that persecution would actually occur\r\n(an objective issue), Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 758, but no more than\r\nthis is required.  See Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 430-32.  If the\r\napplicant has shown no personal threat against him, he must show\r\nthat there is a practice of persecution against a group or category\r\nof persons within the five enumerated grounds, and that he is\r\nidentified with that group.  See 8 C.F.R.  208.13(b)(2)(i);\r\nMeguenine v. INS, 139 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIt is not persecution for a government to require\r\nmilitary service of its citizens.  See Krastev v. INS, 101 F.3d\r\n1213, 1217 (7th Cir. 1996); see also Umanzor-Alvarado v. INS, 896\r\nF.2d 14, 15 (1st Cir. 1990).  However, a person may qualify as a\r\nrefugee if he is singled out for service because he is a member of\r\nan enumerated group or if--when he refuses service--he is subject\r\nto disproportionate punishment on account of his group membership. \r\nSee M.A. A26851062 v. INS, 899 F.2d 304, 312 (4th Cir. 1990) (en\r\nbanc); Matter of R--R--, 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 547, 551 (1992).\r\nIn this case, Greek law subjects all men to military\r\nservice.  There is no evidence that the Greek government has\r\nthreatened Foroglou with military service because he is an\r\nObjectivist, nor is there any evidence that the Greek government\r\ntargets Objectivists who refuse to serve for disproportionate\r\npunishment.  According to Foroglou's submissions, Amnesty\r\nInternational apparently believes that the Greek government has\r\ndisproportionately punished Jehovah's Witnesses who refuse the\r\ndraft, but Foroglou is not a Jehovah's Witness.\r\nForoglou's main argument on this appeal is built on two\r\nrelated premises:  first, that under the federal statutes, it is\r\n\"persecution,\" without more, for a country to refuse conscientious-\r\nobjector status to a bona fide conscientious objector and instead\r\nto punish the objector for refusing to serve; and second, that a\r\nbelief in Objectivism is as good a basis for such conscientious-\r\nobjector status as being a religious pacifist opposed to\r\nparticipating in war in any form.  We once reserved judgment on the\r\nfirst premise, see Umanzor-Alvarado, 896 F.2d at 15, and now think\r\nthe issue is resolved by later Supreme Court cases.\r\nNothing in the language of the federal definition of\r\nrefugee (requiring persecution on one of the five enumerated\r\ngrounds) suggests that it applies when a foreign country simply\r\ninsists on universal military service for all citizens and provides\r\nno exemptions.  In such a case, the resistor might refuse service\r\nout of religious or political conviction; but punishment for\r\nrefusing to serve would not be \"persecution\" (even assuming the\r\nthat term is apt) \"on account of\" the objector's religious or\r\npolitical opinion, see 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(42)(A), but instead would\r\nbe \"because of his refusal to fight\" for the government.  INS v. \r\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992).\r\nSome might think that refugee status should be offered to\r\nall persons fleeing from punishment for anything done \"by reason of\r\nconscience,\" regardless of whether the \"persecutor\" singles out\r\nvictims on account of their religion, political beliefs, or the\r\nlike.  However, this country itself makes criminal various refusals\r\nbased on reasons of conscience, so it is hard to imagine an\r\nimmigration statute being cast quite so broadly.  In all events,\r\nthe refugee definition enacted by Congress is limited to\r\npersecution \"on account of\" the enumerated grounds, and it is for\r\nCongress -not the courts--to enlarge it.\r\nIt is quite true that the Ninth Circuit once took the\r\nopposite view in Canas-Segovia v. INS, 902 F.2d 717, 725-26 (9th\r\nCir. 1990) (Canas-Segovia I), relying in part upon a U.N.\r\n\"handbook\" on refugee matters; but its decision was vacated by the\r\nSupreme Court, INS v. Canas-Segovia, 502 U.S. 1086 (1992).  Nor\r\ndoes it matter that the U.N. advises that it is \"open [to states]\r\nto grant refugee status\" to conscientious objectors.  It is open\r\nto Congress to adopt that course, but it has not done so here. \r\nForoglou's argument thus founders on its first premise, and we need\r\nnot address the merits of his second--namely, that Objectivism\r\nshould be equated with traditional conscientious objector status.\r\nA different issue is raised by Foroglou's motion to\r\nremand.  Pointing to Greece's new 1997 law providing for non-\r\nmilitary alternative service, he says that conventionally religious\r\nobjectors would qualify but Objectivists would not.  Why this\r\nshould matter to Foroglou is not clear, since his objection is to\r\nany compelled service by the state.  In any event, we do not\r\nbelieve that providing religious objectors an exemption constitutes\r\npersecution of all other non-exempted Greek citizens.\r\nThe asylum statute does not inflict on foreign\r\ngovernments the obligation to construct to their own draft laws to\r\nconform to this nation's own highly complex equal protection\r\njurisprudence.  Indeed, it is doubtful that the kinds of\r\ndistinctions that Foroglou attributes to the 1997 law would be\r\nunconstitutional in this country, if Congress chose to draw them. \r\nSee Gillette, 401 U.S. at 446-48 (requiring absolute pacifist\r\nbelief does not run afoul of equal protection concerns).  To\r\ndescribe as \"persecution\" a set of foreign-country exemption rules\r\nnot all that different than our own is a view that would be hard to\r\nascribe to Congress under any reading of the refugee statute.\r\nForoglou's remaining arguments need only the briefest\r\nmention.  The Ninth Circuit's decision on remand in Canas-Segovia,\r\nalthough cited by Foroglou, is not on point.  It is beside the\r\npoint whether Foroglou will be punished for draft evasion in\r\nGreece, so long as it is routine punishment that would be inflicted\r\non any evader.  Finally, we agree that the immigration judge showed\r\nconsiderable annoyance with Foroglou's claims, but disagreement\r\nwith Foroglou's arguments is not proof of bias. \r\nAffirmed.\n",

However, this country itself makes criminal various refusals based on reasons of conscience,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> so it is hard to imagine an immigration statute being cast quite so broadly.  In all events, the refugee definition enacted by Congress is limited to persecution \"on account of\" the enumerated grounds, and it is for Congress---not the courts--to enlarge it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that the Ninth Circuit once took the opposite view in Canas-Segovia v. INS, 902 F.2d 717, 725-26 (9th Cir.1990) (Canas-Segovia I ), relying in part upon a U.N. \"handbook\" on refugee matters;  but its decision was vacated by the Supreme Court, INS v. Canas-Segovia, 502 U.S. 1086, 112 S.Ct. 1152, 117 L.Ed.2d 401 (1992).  Nor does it matter that the U.N. advises that it is \"open [to states] to grant refugee status\" to conscientious objectors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  It is open to Congress to adopt that course, but it has not done so here.

Pointing to Greece's new 1997 law providing for non-military alternative service, he says that conventionally religious objectors would qualify but Objectivists would not.  Why this should matter to Foroglou is not clear, since his objection is to any compelled service by the state.  In any event, we do not believe that providing religious objectors an exemption constitutes persecution of all other non-exempted Greek citizens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The asylum statute does not inflict on foreign governments the obligation to construct their own draft laws to conform to this nation's own highly complex equal protection jurisprudence.  Indeed, it is doubtful that the kinds of distinctions that Foroglou attributes to the 1997 law would be unconstitutional in this country, if Congress chose to draw them.  See Gillette, 401 U.S. at 446-48, 91 S.Ct. 828 (requiring absolute pacifist belief does not run afoul of equal protection concerns).  To describe as \"persecution\" a set of foreign-country exemption rules not all that different than our own is a view that would be hard to ascribe to Congress under any reading of the refugee statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foroglou's remaining arguments need only the briefest mention.  The Ninth Circuit's decision on remand in Canas-Segovia, although cited by Foroglou, is not on point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  It is beside the point whether Foroglou will be punished for draft evasion in Greece, so long as it is routine punishment that would be inflicted on any evader.  Finally, we agree that the immigration judge showed considerable annoyance with Foroglou's claims, but disagreement with Foroglou's arguments is not proof of bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The same five grounds can be made the subject of an application for mandatory withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1253(h) (1995) (amended in 1996, and now covered by 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208), but the burden of proof is greater and the relief less far reaching.

Emmanuel J. Foroglou (\"Foroglou\"), a native and citizen of Greece, entered the United States on a student visa in August 1983, to pursue graduate studies in economics at Brown University.  When he left Brown to teach at Utica University in 1987, his visa status was changed to H-1B, a non-immigrant professional visa.  However, when Foroglou left his job at Utica in 1989 (and thus became ineligible for an H-1B visa), he did not inform the INS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After working in Chicago for several years, Foroglou moved to Houlton, Maine.  Shortly after he moved to Houlton, he came to the attention of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  In October 1993, Foroglou was served with an order to show cause why he should not be deported--the beginning of deportation proceedings.  See 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.1 (1993).  Foroglou did not dispute the facts as to entry and visa status but claimed refugee status based on his objections to the military draft laws of Greece.  He has no family or relatives in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after entering the United States, Foroglou, professedly an atheist, began to develop a belief in Objectivism, a philosophy developed by the twentieth-century author Ayn Rand.  He says that he now believes that the draft \"negates man's fundamental right to life and established [sic] the fundamental principle of statism:  that a man's life belongs to the state, and that the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle.\"   Ayn Rand, Capitalism:  The Unknown Ideal, 227 (1967) (quoted in Foroglou's application for asylum).  Although he is opposed to any military draft, Foroglou is not opposed to war or fighting;  his beliefs are only concerned with the fact that the draft is involuntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the administrative record in this case, it appears that under Greek law, all males between the ages of 18 and 50 are subject to military service for 24 months.  Since 1977, draftees may choose instead to serve, for twice the usual amount of time, in non-combatant roles.  In addition, in 1997, an alternative civilian service option was instituted for conscientious objectors;  it is about 12-18 months longer than combatant military service, and Foroglou would probably not qualify for this alternative because he is not opposed to the use of weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1980, Foroglou had received a 10-year student deferment of military service but he apparently did nothing in 1990 to renew it or to declare himself a conscientious objector.  However, after the INS served its show cause order, Foroglou says that he wrote to the Greek Consulate in May 1994, to request a passport to replace the one being held by the INS and to declare himself a conscientious objector.  The Greek consul responded that it could not issue Foroglou a passport until he had completed his military service and that Foroglou would have to deal with his local draft office (in Greece) about declaring himself a conscientious objector.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first hearing on Foroglou's deportation was held on December 1, 1993, and thereafter continued so Foroglou could file applications for political asylum and suspension of deportation.  See 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158, 1253(h).  Foroglou filed these applications and also applied for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation, see 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(e).  Testimony, consistent with the facts described above, was completed on December 1, 1994.  The hearing was reconvened again on September 6, 1995, and Foroglou moved to withdraw his application for suspension of deportation.  The immigration judge granted his motion with prejudice and proceeded to present his decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the decision, the immigration judge found that Foroglou had not established that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his religion, race, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if he were to return to Greece, or that any punishment for failing to comply with Greek conscription law would be disproportionately severe on account of any one of these factors.  He denied Foroglou's application for asylum, but granted Foroglou voluntary departure within 30 days in lieu of deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eight days later, Foroglou filed a notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals.  In February 1998, before his appeal was heard, Foroglou filed with the Board additional evidence and a motion to remand to the immigration judge.  The new evidence related to the new 1997 civilian service option and Foroglou's claim that he would not qualify for this alternative service.  On April 30, 1998, the Board dismissed Foroglou's appeal, denied his motion to remand, and again granted him 30 days in which to voluntarily depart.  Foroglou filed a petition for review with this court and moved for a stay of deportation, which was granted on May 21, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, we begin with the Board's denial of Foroglou's application for political asylum.

See Gillette, 401 U.S. at 446-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108285\"><a href=\"/opinion/108285/gillette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To describe as \"persecution\" a set of foreign-country exemption rules not all that different than our own is a view that would be hard to ascribe to Congress under any reading of the refugee statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Foroglou's remaining arguments need only the briefest mention.  The Ninth Circuit's decision on remand in Canas-Segovia, although cited by Foroglou, is not on point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  It is beside the point whether Foroglou will be punished for draft evasion in Greece, so long as it is routine punishment that would be inflicted on any evader.  Finally, we agree that the immigration judge showed considerable annoyance with Foroglou's claims, but disagreement with Foroglou's arguments is not proof of bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The same five grounds can be made the subject of an application for mandatory withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1253(h) (1995) (amended in 1996, and now covered by 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208), but the burden of proof is greater and the relief less far reaching.
