After carefully considering the\n\nrecord and briefs on appeal, we affirm the Commissioner’s\n\ndecision for substantially the reasons developed below.\n\n              A few issues bear mention.                          The claimant argues\n\nthat he had a spinal disorder listed under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404,\n\nSubpt. P, App. 1, 1.05C (other vertebrogenic disorders).                                   In\n\naddition      to     a   primary,           vertebrogenic           disorder,       such    a\n\ndisorder required the simultaneous presence, over a period\n\nof    at    least    three       months,          of    pain,      muscle     spasm,      and\n\nsignificant         limitation         of     motion         in    the   spine;     and    an\n\nappropriate radicular distribution of significant motor loss,\n\nwith muscle weakness and sensory and reflex loss.                               20 C.F.R.\n\nPt.    404,    Subpt.      P,        App.    1,    1.05C.         Although    the     record\n\ncontains evidence that the claimant periodically displayed\n\nsuch       symptoms,       it    does        not       establish,        or   compel      the\n\ninference,          that        he     possessed          all       of    the     symptoms\n\nsimultaneously           and     for    the       required        period.       The    ALJ’s\n\nfinding,        then,      was       supported          by    substantial       evidence.\n\nRodriguez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d\n\n218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981)(substantial evidence may support a\n\nfinding even if the record contains evidence that would also\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fsupport a contrary finding, if a reasonable mind reviewing\n\nthe record as a whole could accept the evidence as confirming\n\nthe finding).\n\n           The claimant also argues that the Commissioner\n\nshould have given controlling or significant weight to his\n\ntreating     physician’s   opinion   that   he   had    the   listed\n\ncondition.      Such an opinion is not, however, a medical\n\nopinion entitled to deference, but a conclusion on an issue\n\nreserved for the Commissioner.       20 C.F.R. 404.1527(e)(2).\n\nMoreover, the opinion was at odds with other medical evidence\n\nin the record, including the physician’s own findings.            20\n\nC.F.R. 404.1527(d).\n\n           Finally, the claimant argues that the ALJ erred in\n\nrefusing to consider chiropractic records.             The claimant\n\nmisreads the opinion.      The ALJ stated only that he refused\n\nto credit the chiropractor’s conclusion that the claimant was\n\ntotally disabled.      Again, this issue is reserved for the\n\nCommissioner.     20 C.F.R. 404.1527(e)(2).
