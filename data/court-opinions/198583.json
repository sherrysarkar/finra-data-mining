Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n        Benicio Snchez Rivera on brief for appellant.\r\n        Carlos Lugo Fiol, Solicitor General, Edda Serrano\r\nBlasini, Deputy Solicitor General, and Irene S. Soroeta-Kodesh,\r\nAssistant Solicitor General, Department of Justice, on brief for\r\nappellee Honorable Felipe Prez-Cruz.\r\n\nJuly 28, 1999\r\n\n                                Per Curiam.  On July 30, 1997, Phryne Arroyo-Santiago\r\nbrought suit in the district court for the District of Puerto Rico\r\nagainst her ex-husband, Jos Garca-Vicario, and the Puerto Rico\r\nSuperior Court Judge who presided over their divorce proceedings,\r\nthe Honorable Felipe Prez-Cruz.  Charging violations of 42 U.S.C.\r\n1983 &amp; 1985, Arroyo-Santiago alleged that as a result of Judge\r\nPrez-Cruz's personal relationship with her then-husband, Judge\r\nPrez-Cruz treated her unfairly during their 1984 divorce\r\nproceedings.  She further alleged that \"[h]er civil rights were\r\ntrampled and obliterated\" when the financial support that she had\r\nbeen receiving from Garca-Vicario was reduced and eventually\r\neliminated in 1996 by another judge who might have been influenced\r\nby Judge Prez-Cruz.  Finally, Arroyo-Santiago complained that a\r\nhearing to divide the dissolved marriage's community property,\r\nallegedly scheduled for August 7, 1997, was going \"to take away\r\nwhatever ruminants [sic] of property are left . . . and award them\r\nto [her ex-husband] Garca-Vicario.\"\r\nThe district court dismissed Arroyo-Santiago's complaint\r\nby order of May 29, 1998.  Applying Puerto Rico's one-year statute\r\nof limitations for tort actions, the district court concluded that\r\nthe complaint was time barred.  The district court also held in the\r\nalternative that: (i) there was no allegation of state action on\r\nthe part of Garca-Vicario and (ii) Judge Prez-Cruz was entitled\r\nto judicial immunity.  This appeal followed, and we now affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\nGiven our review of the court's dismissal of the\r\ncomplaint, we rely on the complaint for a statement of the facts\r\nrelevant to this appeal.  See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-\r\nBelendez, 903 F.2d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"In reviewing a Rule\r\n12(b)(6) dismissal, we take the well-pleaded facts as they appear\r\nin the complaint, indulging every reasonable inference in\r\nplaintiff's favor.\").  On October 18, 1984, Garca-Vicario filed an\r\naction in the Puerto Rico Superior Court alleging \"cruel treatment\"\r\nand seeking a divorce from Arroyo-Santiago.  On November 5, 1984,\r\nArroyo-Santiago, \"having failed to obtain legal\r\nrepresentation . . . filed a motion requesting an extension of 30\r\ndays to answer the complaint, specifying that she had 'legitimate\r\ndefenses' to the allegations\" contained in the divorce pleadings. \r\nJudge Prez-Cruz \"denied the request [for an extension of time],\r\nstating no reason for the denial.\"  Default was entered on November\r\n15, 1984.   \"Trial\" was nonetheless scheduled for December 18, 1984\r\nat 8:30 AM, even though \"[a]ccording to the Rules of the Courts of\r\nPuerto Rico, proceedings start at 9 AM.\"  The divorce was\r\nallegedly granted that morning in her absence.\r\n\"From this date on, 18 December, 1984, Mrs. Arroyo[-\r\nSantiago] has had an uphill bat[t]le with little chance of success,\r\nto clearly overturned [sic] this hideous situation . . . .\" \r\nAnother judge, \"without ever setting or holding a hearing,\" reduced\r\nher alimony.  Yet another judge subsequently concluded that Arroyo-\r\nSantiago was ineligible for alimony and that any financial support\r\nprovided by her husband would be \"chargeable to the amount she\r\nwould receive as part of the [c]ommunity property's final\r\ndisposition.\"  \"Lastly,\" Arroyo-Santiago alleges, \"in 1996, the\r\namount of monies she was receiving was rescinded and eliminated.\" \r\nFinally, the complaint predicts that \"[t]he stage is set to take\r\naway whatever ruminants [sic] of property are left\" at a hearing to\r\ndispose of the community property which was scheduled for August 7,\r\n1997.\r\nIn the complaint's penultimate paragraph, Arroyo-Santiago\r\nstates her claims:\r\n    Both defendants have engaged in a\r\ncommon design or mutually implied\r\nunderstanding to deprive plaintiff of her\r\nfight [sic] to the due process and equal\r\nprotection of [l]aw.\r\n    Mrs. Arroyo has been denied assistance\r\nof counsel.\r\n    Acting in excess of his jurisdictional\r\npowers, the judge denied Plaintiff an\r\nopportunity to retain counsel before rendering\r\na decision on the case.\r\n    Plaintiff was denied a fair [t]rial and\r\nfound to be the \"guilty party\".\r\n    There was nothing \"judicial\" in\r\nsummarily entering default judgment against\r\nher and the holding of the [t]rial out of the\r\nregular hours as set by the Courts.\r\n\nOn the basis of these alleged infirmities, Arroyo-Santiago\r\nrequested that \"a permanent injunction be issued against the\r\ndefendants forbidding them to take any further action of any kind\r\nin any Court of law or agency against Mrs. Arroyo and to cease and\r\ndesist trying to hold hearings of any kind in any case until this\r\nHonorable Court orders otherwise and [j]udgement should be issued\r\nagainst defendants in the amounts requested.\"  Arroyo-Santiago \r\nrequested damages of $2,500,000.00 against Garca-Vicario and \"an\r\namount to be determined by the jury against Judge Felipe [Prez-\r\nCruz].\"  The court granted the motions of defendants requesting\r\ndismissal, thereby prompting this appeal.\r\n                             II.\r\nA district court's dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule\r\n12(b)(6) is reviewed de novo.  See Vartanian v. Monsanto Co., 14\r\nF.3d 697, 700 (1st Cir. 1994).  Because we operate \"under the same\r\nconstraints that bind the district court . . . we may affirm a\r\ndismissal for failure to state a claim only if it clearly appears,\r\naccording to the facts alleged, that the plaintiff cannot recover\r\non any viable theory.\"  Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 52.  In\r\nreviewing whether dismissal was warranted, we accept as true all\r\nfactual allegations within the complaint and indulge all reasonable\r\ninferences in the plaintiff's favor.  See Brown v. Hot, Sexy &amp;\r\nSafer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 530 (1st Cir. 1995).  In making\r\nthis legal determination, however, we are not limited to the\r\nreasoning articulated by the district court but may affirm on the\r\nbasis of \"any independently sufficient grounds.\"  Id.\r\nWhen evaluating the timeliness of a claim under 42 U.S.C.\r\n1983, courts \"should borrow the state statute of limitations for\r\npersonal injury actions.\"  Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 236\r\n(1989).  In cases arising in Puerto Rico, we have repeatedly\r\napplied Puerto Rico's one-year statute of limitations pertaining to\r\ntort actions, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5298.  See Ramirez Morales\r\nv. Rosa Viera, 815 F.2d 2, 3 (1st Cir. 1987); Altair Corp. v.\r\nPesquera de Busquets, 769 F.2d 30, 31 (1st Cir. 1985).  The one-\r\nyear statute of limitations \"begins running one day after the date\r\nof accrual, which is the date plaintiff knew or had reason to know\r\nof the injury.\"  Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 136\r\nF.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nArroyo-Santiago's claims, save one discussed separately\r\nbelow, accrued in excess of one year prior to the filing of her\r\ncomplaint on July 30, 1997.  In the underlying divorce case,\r\njudgment was entered in December 1984, more than twelve years prior\r\nto the filing of Arroyo-Santiago's complaint.  With regard to the\r\nfinancial support proceedings, while it is unclear from the\r\ncomplaint exactly when the alimony was eliminated by judicial\r\ndecision, Arroyo-Santiago's complaint tells us all that we need to\r\nknow.  The complaint avers that as a result of orders of the Puerto\r\nRico courts, Arroyo-Santiago had received no alimony \"for more than\r\n12 months\" at the time the complaint was filed, thus placing the\r\ncomplaint, by its own terms, outside the one-year statute of\r\nlimitations. \r\nArroyo-Santiago argues that these claims are saved from\r\noperation of the statute of limitations by her allegation that a\r\n\"conspiracy,\" of which these alleged events were a part, was\r\ncontinuing at the time of her complaint.  In support of this\r\ncontention, Arroyo-Santiago cites to our decision in Velazquez v.\r\nChardon, 736 F.2d 831 (1st Cir. 1984).  Velazquez does indeed stand\r\nfor the proposition that if a complaint alleges an ongoing series\r\nof violations, \"then the limitations period begins anew with each\r\nviolation.\"  Id. at 833 (quoting Perez v. Laredo Junior College,\r\n706 F.2d 731, 733-34 (5th Cir. 1983)(footnotes omitted)).  However,\r\nVelazquez also stated that because each discrete violation is\r\nsubject to a new application of the statute of limitations, \"those\r\nviolations preceding the filing of the complaint by the full\r\nlimitations period are foreclosed.\"  Id.  Therefore, all claims\r\nwhich accrued more than one year before the filing of the complaint\r\non July 30, 1997 are time-barred.  Assuming, dubitante, that\r\nArroyo-Santiago ever had an actionable federal claim, any such\r\nclaim was extinguished one year after the alleged injurious events. \r\nOne claim in the complaint is not susceptible to\r\ndismissal on statute of limitations grounds.  Arroyo-Santiago\r\nalleged that a hearing to divide the dissolved marriage's community\r\nproperty was scheduled for August 7, 1997.  Arroyo-Santiago asked\r\nthe district court to enjoin that hearing from taking place,\r\nostensibly because Judge Prez-Cruz, while not presiding over the\r\ncommunity property proceedings, \"maybe\" had used his influence with\r\nanother judge of the Superior Court of Puerto Rico to Arroyo-\r\nSantiago's prejudice.  Although this claim was not time-barred,\r\nbecause of the date of the community property hearing (August 7,\r\n1997), the complaint fails to state a claim which is cognizable\r\nunder federal law.\r\nThe only accusation against either defendant even\r\narguably applicable to the August 7, 1997 hearing states: \"Upon\r\ninformation and belief Judge Prez-Cruz exercised undue influence\r\nupon all personnel and maybe the other judges of the Superior Court\r\nof Ponce with the sole purpose of obtaining many rulings on behalf\r\nof Jos Garca-Vicario.\"  Such speculation falls far short of even\r\na minimally adequate claim: \"Pleading conspiracy under sections\r\n1983 &amp; 1985(3) requires at least minimum factual support of the\r\nexistence of a conspiracy.\"  Francis-Sobel v. Univ. of Maine, 597\r\nF.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1979); see also Slotnick v. Garfinkle, 632\r\nF.2d 163, 166 (1st Cir. 1980) (affirming dismissal because\r\ncomplaint \"neither elaborates nor substantiates its bald claims\r\nthat certain defendants 'conspired' with one another\"). \r\nEven though we give plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt\r\nin reviewing a complaint's sufficiency, \"we need not credit bald\r\nassertions, periphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated\r\nconclusions, or outright vituperation.\"  Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d\r\nat 52.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), establishing the\r\nrequirements for an adequate complaint, \"does not entitle a\r\nplaintiff to rest on 'subjective characterizations' or conclusory\r\ndescriptions of 'a general scenario which could be dominated by\r\nunpleaded facts.'\"  Id. at 52-53 (quoting Dewey v. Univ. of New\r\nHampshire, 694 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1982)).  Even under the modern\r\n\"notice pleading\" regime, a plaintiff is \"required to set forth\r\nfactual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting each\r\nmaterial element necessary to sustain recovery under some\r\nactionable legal theory.\"  Romero-Barcelo v. Hernandez-Agosto, 75\r\nF.3d 23, 28 n.2 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,\r\n851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir. 1988)).\r\nBecause Arroyo-Santiago's complaint about the hearing on\r\nAugust 7, 1997, fails to provide a minimally sufficient factual\r\npredicate to support the defendants' liability, the complaint fails\r\nto state a claim as a matter of law. \r\nAffirmed.\n",

With regard to the\r\nfinancial support proceedings, while it is unclear from the\r\ncomplaint exactly when the alimony was eliminated by judicial\r\ndecision, Arroyo-Santiago's complaint tells us all that we need to\r\nknow.  The complaint avers that as a result of orders of the Puerto\r\nRico courts, Arroyo-Santiago had received no alimony \"for more than\r\n12 months\" at the time the complaint was filed, thus placing the\r\ncomplaint, by its own terms, outside the one-year statute of\r\nlimitations. \r\nArroyo-Santiago argues that these claims are saved from\r\noperation of the statute of limitations by her allegation that a\r\n\"conspiracy,\" of which these alleged events were a part, was\r\ncontinuing at the time of her complaint.  In support of this\r\ncontention, Arroyo-Santiago cites to our decision in Velazquez v.\r\nChardon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437233\"><a href=\"/opinion/437233/juan-a-valles-velazquez-v-carlos-e-chardon-etc-agustin-lao-colon-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1984).  Velazquez does indeed stand\r\nfor the proposition that if a complaint alleges an ongoing series\r\nof violations, \"then the limitations period begins anew with each\r\nviolation.\"  Id. at 833 (quoting Perez v. Laredo Junior College,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418018\"><a href=\"/opinion/418018/alejandro-perez-v-laredo-junior-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733-34 (5th Cir. 1983)(footnotes omitted)).  However,\r\nVelazquez also stated that because each discrete violation is\r\nsubject to a new application of the statute of limitations, \"those\r\nviolations preceding the filing of the complaint by the full\r\nlimitations period are foreclosed.\"  Id.  Therefore, all claims\r\nwhich accrued more than one year before the filing of the complaint\r\non July 30, 1997 are time-barred.  Assuming, dubitante, that\r\nArroyo-Santiago ever had an actionable federal claim, any such\r\nclaim was extinguished one year after the alleged injurious events. \r\nOne claim in the complaint is not susceptible to\r\ndismissal on statute of limitations grounds.  Arroyo-Santiago\r\nalleged that a hearing to divide the dissolved marriage's community\r\nproperty was scheduled for August 7, 1997.  Arroyo-Santiago asked\r\nthe district court to enjoin that hearing from taking place,\r\nostensibly because Judge Prez-Cruz, while not presiding over the\r\ncommunity property proceedings, \"maybe\" had used his influence with\r\nanother judge of the Superior Court of Puerto Rico to Arroyo-\r\nSantiago's prejudice.  Although this claim was not time-barred,\r\nbecause of the date of the community property hearing (August 7,\r\n1997), the complaint fails to state a claim which is cognizable\r\nunder federal law.\r\nThe only accusation against either defendant even\r\narguably applicable to the August 7, 1997 hearing states: \"Upon\r\ninformation and belief Judge Prez-Cruz exercised undue influence\r\nupon all personnel and maybe the other judges of the Superior Court\r\nof Ponce with the sole purpose of obtaining many rulings on behalf\r\nof Jos Garca-Vicario.\"  Such speculation falls far short of even\r\na minimally adequate claim: \"Pleading conspiracy under sections\r\n1983 &amp; 1985(3) requires at least minimum factual support of the\r\nexistence of a conspiracy.\"  Francis-Sobel v.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), establishing the\r\nrequirements for an adequate complaint, \"does not entitle a\r\nplaintiff to rest on 'subjective characterizations' or conclusory\r\ndescriptions of 'a general scenario which could be dominated by\r\nunpleaded facts.'\"  Id. at 52-53 (quoting Dewey v. Univ. of New\r\nHampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411302\"><a href=\"/opinion/411302/richard-dewey-v-the-university-of-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1982)).  Even under the modern\r\n\"notice pleading\" regime, a plaintiff is \"required to set forth\r\nfactual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting each\r\nmaterial element necessary to sustain recovery under some\r\nactionable legal theory.\"  Romero-Barcelo v.
