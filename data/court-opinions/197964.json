Hans Isbrandtsen was found in contempt\r\nof court and fined $500 for failing to comply with a court\r\norder directing the release of certain cargo from the M/V\r\nAllison.  He filed a timely notice of appeal.\r\n          The imposition of the $500 fine could not have been\r\ncoercive   the classic indication of a civil contempt finding\r\n  as at that time Isbrandtsen had already complied, if tardily,\r\nand so could not \"purge\" himself by complying.  Rather, the $500\r\nfine, payable to the court, was clearly to punish Isbrandtsen\r\nfor his past behavior and to vindicate the court's authority,\r\nthe classic indication of a finding of criminal contempt.  SeeHicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624, 631-32 (1988) (describing the\r\ncritical features of the two types of contempt).  Either a\r\nparty or a nonparty can immediately appeal a criminal contempt\r\nadjudication imposing sanctions in a pending case.  See 15B\r\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper,\r\nFederal Practice and Procedure  3917 (2d ed. 1991).  We,\r\ntherefore, reject the contention of appellee Productora de Gas\r\nCarbonico, S.A. (\"GASCARB\") that we lack jurisdiction over\r\nIsbrandtsen's appeal because he failed to file a notice of\r\nappeal after the subsequent entry of final judgment disposing\r\nof all the claims against the Allison.  Similarly, we reject\r\nGASCARB's contention that the payment of the $500 fine has\r\nmooted this appeal.\r\n          Nonetheless, we affirm the finding of contempt.  In\r\nthe first place, Isbrandtsen's failure to procure a transcript\r\nof the contempt hearing, see Fed. R. App. 10(b) (outlining the\r\nappellant's duty), precludes a reasoned review of that finding. \r\nSee Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1995).  And, in\r\nany event, we conclude that Isbrandtsen's contention that the \r\ncourt order was \"transparently invalid\" is frivolous.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
