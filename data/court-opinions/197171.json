The plaintiff, Rossy\r                    DICLERICO, Chief District Judge.\r                                                   \r\n\nCoyante, filed  a complaint  against the defendants,  Puerto Rico\r\n\nPorts  Authority  ( Ports  Authority )  and  Mangual  Maintenance\r\n\nServices, Inc.  ( Mangual ), seeking  damages she claims  to have\r\n\nsuffered  as a result of slipping and falling on certain premises\r\n\nallegedly owned  or controlled by the defendants.  Following nine\r\n\ndays  of  testimony  at  trial,  the  plaintiff  rested  and  the\r\n\ndefendants moved  for judgment as a  matter of law under  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P.  50(a) asserting  that  the  plaintiff had  produced  no\r\n\nevidence to establish that the defendants owned or controlled the\r\n\narea  where the plaintiff slipped  and fell.   The district court\r\n\nagreed  with  the  defendants  and, finding  that  ownership  and\r\n\ncontrol were necessary elements  of the plaintiff s case, entered\r\n\na judgment against her.  In this appeal, the plaintiff challenges\r\n\nthe district  court s ruling on the defendants  motion under Fed.\r\n\nR. Civ. P. 50(a) and several other rulings made during the course\r\n\nof  the litigation.  For  the reasons expressed  below, we affirm\r\n\nthe district court s judgment.\r\n\n                Factual and Procedural Background\r                          Factual and Procedural Background\r                                                           \r\n\n          On  July  24, 1990,  the  plaintiff  slipped and  fell,\r\n\nsuffering    personal   injury   after   disembarking   from   an\r\n\ninternational  flight  at  the  Luis  Mu oz  Mar n  International\r\n\nAirport in San Juan, Puerto Rico.   On January 3, 1991, she filed\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nsuit against  the defendants,  Ports Authority and  Mangual,1 for\r\n\nnegligently  failing to  make  safe a  dangerous condition  about\r\n\nwhich they knew or should have known.2  The plaintiff claimed she\r\n\nsuffered  damages arising not only  from the accident itself, but\r\n\nalso from the pain she suffered and medical expenses she incurred\r\n\nwhen she  became addicted  to and  went  through withdrawal  from\r\n\nprescription medications she was taking because of the accident.\r\n\n          On March 30, 1993,  the district court, after resolving\r\n\nan initial  challenge to its jurisdiction,  granted the plaintiff\r\n\nleave to amend her complaint and ordered the defendants to answer\r\n\nthe amended complaint   on or before April  12, 1993.   On  March\r\n\n31, 1993, the plaintiff  resubmitted her amended complaint (first\r\n\nsubmitted on February 25, 1992) but the defendants did not answer\r\n\nby April  12  as required  by the  court s order.   However,  the\r\n\nplaintiff  did not  bring this  failure to the  court s attention\r\n\nuntil more than two years later.\r\n\n          On  December  16, 1993,  the  district  court issued  a\r\n\npretrial conference report requiring the parties to submit a list\r\n\nof uncontested facts.   The parties agreed to a   Joint Statement\r\n\nof Uncontested  Material  Facts  to  Supplement  Pretrial  Order \r\n\n( joint statement ) on December 17, 1993.  The plaintiff attaches\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Mangual is a janitorial company with which the Ports Authority\r\nhas contracted.\r\n\n2   Coyante brought a  separate action  asserting similar  claims\r\nagainst L nea Aeropostal Venezolana, the airline on which she had\r\ntraveled.  On June 22, 1992, the two cases were consolidated.  On\r\nJanuary 25,  1994, the  plaintiff and  the airline  settled their\r\ndispute, leaving as defendants only Ports Authority and Mangual.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nparticular significance to the  following provisions of the joint\r\n\nstatement:\r\n\n            7.  On July 24,  1990, co-defendant Mangual\r\n          provided  janitorial  services  at  the  Luis\r\n          Mu oz Mar n International Airport pursuant to\r\n          a  contract   with  the  Puerto   Rico  Ports\r\n          Authority.\r\n\n            8.  On July 24, 1990, the Puerto Rico Ports\r\n          Authority  owned and operated  the Luis Mu oz\r\n          Mar n International Airport.\r\n\nHowever,  the  plaintiff alleges  that she  did  not know  of the\r\n\nexistence of this document until after she filed her appeal.  \r\n\n          On  February  9,  1994,  the   plaintiff  attempted  to\r\n\nsupplement  her list  of expert  witnesses with  a loss-of-income\r\n\nexpert.3   On  June 9,  1995,  the court  denied  her request  to\r\n\ninclude this expert as a witness without articulating the reasons\r\n\nfor its denial.\r\n\n          On December  12, 1994,  the court entered  a scheduling\r\n\norder requiring discovery to be concluded  by April 20, 1995.  On\r\n\nFebruary  22,  1995, the  plaintiff  fired  her  counsel and,  on\r\n\nFebruary 27,  1995, filed a pro se motion so informing the court.\r\n\nOn  March 16, 1995, the court held  a status conference.  At that\r\n\nconference, the court  granted a motion filed  by the plaintiff s\r\n\ncounsel to  withdraw from the  case and  for scheduling  purposes\r\n\nasked counsel whether further discovery was pending at that time.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  The plaintiff also attempted to add other witnesses  who would\r\nhave bolstered her case on the issue of damages.  We focus on the\r\ndistrict  court s ruling on the loss-of-income expert because the\r\nissues involved are identical.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nCounsel informed the court that no further discovery was pending,\r\n\nand the court let stand its April 20, 1995, discovery deadline.\r\n\n          On  March 23,  1995,  current counsel  appeared on  the\r\n\nplaintiff s behalf.4  The file he received from prior counsel was\r\n\nreportedly  in  disarray and  reflected  that  the plaintiff  had\r\n\nundertaken  no discovery of the  defendants.  On  April 19, 1995,\r\n\none day before the   deadline set for discovery to  be completed,\r\n\nthe plaintiff moved to  extend the discovery deadline and  take a\r\n\ndeposition.  This motion was denied by the court on May 24, 1995.\r\n\n          On June 9, 1995, the plaintiff moved to supplement  the\r\n\npretrial order issued on December 17, 1993, to reflect subsequent\r\n\nchanges in  her case.   The same day,  the court held  a pretrial\r\n\nconference  and ruled  that it  would use  without  amendment the\r\n\nDecember 17, 1993, pretrial  order, that the plaintiff s loss-of-\r\n\nincome  expert would  not  be allowed  to  testify, and  that  no\r\n\nfurther discovery would be allowed. \r\n\n          In  July 1995,  after  four and  one-half years,  trial\r\n\nappeared  imminent.    However,   three  days  before  trial  the\r\n\nplaintiff submitted  a motion requesting that  default be entered\r\n\nagainst the  defendants for their  failure to answer  her amended\r\n\ncomplaint.  The  district court did not rule on this motion until\r\n\nAugust 3, 1995, after the conclusion of  the trial, at which time\r\n\nit declared the motion moot.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  The plaintiff s counsel at trial and on appeal was the seventh\r\nlawyer to  appear for  her in this  litigation, not  counting her\r\nbrief  pro se appearance.   Prior lawyers were  fired or left the\r\nplaintiff s  employ   for   such   reasons   as    irreconcilable\r\ndifferences  and  loss of confidence. \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          At   trial,   the  plaintiff s   case   focused  almost\r\n\nexclusively on her damages  resulting from the fall.   Beyond her\r\n\nown testimony,  she produced  only one occurrence  witness, Mirta\r\n\nSilva,  to describe the scene of the accident.  The two witnesses\r\n\nprovided a detailed description both of the scene of the accident\r\n\nand  of how the accident  occurred.5  However,  neither Silva nor\r\n\nthe plaintiff  identified specifically  where within the  airport\r\n\nthe  accident occurred.  There  was no testimony  about what gate\r\n\nthe flight used, which hallway  the passengers traveled, or where\r\n\ncustoms was  located.   No testimony specifically  identified the\r\n\nlocation  of  the  accident  within the  larger  context  of  the\r\n\nairport.6    No  testimony  connected  either  defendant  to  the\r\n\nlocation where the accident occurred or established what duty, if\r\n\nany,  the defendants owed to  the plaintiff to  make the location\r\n\nsafe.   In fact, at  trial the plaintiff  made little mention  of\r\n\ndefendant  Ports  Authority  and  produced no  testimony  at  all\r\n\nmentioning defendant Mangual.\r\n\n          At  the close  of  the plaintiff s  nine-day case,  the\r\n\ndefendants moved  for judgment as a  matter of law under  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P. 50(a), alleging that the plaintiff had not presented any\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  The  accident occurred in a  hallway which connected the  area\r\nwhere the passengers left the airplane with  an adjoining customs\r\narea.  A pool of water, which apparently formed due to a crack in\r\nthe ceiling,  covered almost the  entire width of the  hallway in\r\nfront  of  the  door  to  customs.    The  plaintiff  fell  while\r\nattempting to traverse the pool.\r\n\n6  For example, an employee connected with the airport prepared a\r\nreport  about the  accident shortly  after it  happened  that was\r\npresented at trial but the  report failed to specify the location\r\nof the accident.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nevidence from which it could be found that the defendants were in\r\n\ncontrol of and responsible for maintaining the location where the\r\n\naccident occurred.  The district court granted the motion.\r\n\n          On  September 1, 1995, the  plaintiff filed a notice of\r\n\nappeal  from  the  district  court s  Rule  50(a) decision.    In\r\n\nconnection with her appeal, the plaintiff requested a copy of the\r\n\nfile from the  district court  clerk and upon  inspection of  the\r\n\nfile allegedly discovered for the first time the joint statement.\r\n\nThe plaintiff  had not mentioned  the joint statement  during the\r\n\npresentation  of  evidence  in  her  case  or  when  opposing the\r\n\ndefendants  Rule 50(a) motion.\r\n\n                            Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          The plaintiff on appeal has assigned as  error a number\r\n\nof  decisions by  the district  court during  the course  of this\r\n\nlitigation. \r\n\n          A.

Rule 50(a).\r\n\nRule 50(a)(1) states:\r\n\n          If during  a trial by  jury a party  has been\r\n          fully  heard  on an  issue  and  there is  no\r\n          legally  sufficient  evidentiary basis  for a\r\n          reasonable  jury to  find  for that  party on\r\n          that issue, the court may determine the issue\r\n          against that party and may grant a motion for\r\n          judgment  as  a matter  of  law  against that\r\n          party with respect to a claim or defense that\r\n          cannot   under   the   controlling   law   be\r\n          maintained  or  defeated without  a favorable\r\n          finding on that issue.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nWe review the grant of a Rule 50(a) motion de novo.

In doing so, we\r                     \r\n\nuse the same standards as the district court, considering all the\r\n\nevidence and inferences  reasonably to  be drawn from  it in  the\r\n\nlight most  favorable to the  non-movant.

However,  [t]o warrant  submission of\r                 \r\n\nan issue  to the jury,  the plaintiff  must present  more  than a\r\n\nmere scintilla  of  evidence and  may not rely  on conjecture  or\r\n\nspeculation.    Katz, 87 F.3d at 28 (quoting Richmond Steel, Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Puerto Rican  American Ins.

The Joint Statement\r                               1.  The Joint Statement\r                                                      \r\n\n          The plaintiff  argues that  the joint  statement should\r\n\nhave been considered as  part of her  case, and contends that  it\r\n\nwas  sufficient  to  establish  that Ports  Authority  owned  and\r\n\nMangual maintained the  area of  the airport  where the  accident\r\n\noccurred. However, the plaintiff s  argument suffers from a fatal\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ndefect,  namely, the  joint statement  was never  introduced into\r\n\nevidence.7    It  is a  basic  tenet  of trial  procedure  that a\r\n\nstipulation concerning uncontested facts must  be introduced into\r\n\nevidence  by the  party who intends  to rely  on it  in order for\r\n\nthose facts  to be considered by the trier of fact, whether it be\r\n\njury or judge.  Contrary to the plaintiff s assertion, it was her\r\n\nresponsibility, and not the court s or the defendants , to ensure\r\n\nthat the joint  statement was  introduced into evidence.   As  we\r\n\nhave explained,\r\n\n          in our adversary system  of justice it is the\r\n          parties   responsibility to  marshal evidence\r\n          and prove  their  points.   Litigants  cannot\r\n          expect  the court  to do  their homework  for\r\n          them.  [Citations omitted].\r\n\nOndine Shipping Corp. v.  Cataldo, 24 F.3d 353, 356-57  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1994).   The  plaintiff, for  whatever  reason having  failed  to\r\n\nintroduce the joint statement into evidence, cannot now avoid the\r\n\nconsequences  of  her  inaction  by  claiming the  court  or  the\r\n\ndefendants had the responsibility to introduce it.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  Even if the plaintiff  had introduced the joint statement into\r\nevidence, it is by no  means a foregone conclusion that it  would\r\nhave  sufficiently  cured  the  deficiency  in  her  evidence  to\r\nwithstand  the Rule  50(a) motion.    We need  not confront  this\r\nissue,  however, because the plaintiff never introduced the joint\r\nstatement into evidence.\r\n\n8   The  plaintiff has  also offered  two other  related theories\r\nconcerning the effect of the  joint statement.  First, she claims\r\nthat the  agreement that produced the joint statement should have\r\nbarred the defendants from moving for judgment as a matter of law\r\non the issues of ownership and control.  She further asserts that\r\nthe joint statement functioned as a contract between the parties,\r\none of the implied terms of which was the defendants  promise not\r\nto  contest  ownership and  control,  and  that  breach  of  this\r\nagreement  requires  reversal.   As  the  plaintiff  has produced\r\nneither  legal authority  nor well-reasoned  arguments for  these\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n                    2.  The Jury s Experience\r                              2.  The Jury s Experience\r                                                       \r\n\n          The plaintiff  next contends  that she  produced enough\r\n\nevidence  at trial to  allow the jurors to  infer, based on their\r\n\nown   experience,  that  defendant   Ports  Authority  owned  and\r\n\ncontrolled  the  area  of  the airport  where  the  accident took\r\n\nplace.9  The trial  judge, the plaintiff maintains, impermissibly\r\n\nsubstituted  his  judgment  for that  of  the  trier  of fact  by\r\n\nremoving this decision from the jury.\r\n\n          This case  clearly does  not present a  situation where\r\n\nthe  jury could rely on  its general knowledge  and experience to\r\n\ndetermine something  as specific as  the location and  control of\r\n\nthe area where the plaintiff fell.  It would be pure  speculation\r\n\nto  assume  what,  if any,  knowledge  the  members  of the  jury\r\n\npossessed  concerning   these  specific  issues.    Although  the\r\n\nplaintiff correctly  notes that she is entitled to all reasonable\r\n\ninferences in  her favor,  tenuous conclusions  extrapolated from\r\n\nconjectural knowledge attributed to jurors  cannot substitute for\r\n\nevidence tested by the adversary process.  As we have said,  [t]o\r\n\nwarrant  submission of an issue  to the jury,  the plaintiff must\r\n\npresent  more than a mere scintilla  of evidence and may not rely\r\n\non  conjecture or  speculation.

A  thorough\r\n\nsearch of the appellate  record reveals no evidence  more helpful\r\n\nto  the   plaintiff  than   that  considered,  and   rejected  as\r\n\ninadequate, by the district court.\r\n\n          The trial  judge  made the  following  statement  after\r\n\nconsidering the Rule 50(a) motion:\r\n\n            I  cannot take  judicial notice of  a place\r\n          that I  don t even  know which is  the place.\r\n          We cannot, by any stretch of the imagination,\r\n          and  even viewing the  evidence in  the light\r\n          most  favorable to  the [plaintiff],  reach a\r\n          reasonable  conclusion  . . . that  the place\r\n          where she fell, which  we don t know where it\r\n          is, we  don t know which gate,  we don t know\r\n          which  area  of the  airport,  was  under the\r\n          control of the Ports Authority . . . .\r\n\nOur  independent  evaluation  of  the  paucity  of  evidence  the\r\n\nplaintiff managed to  produce on  this point after  nine days  of\r\n\ntrial  draws us inexorably to the same conclusion -- the evidence\r\n\nproduced by the plaintiff  was insufficient to withstand judgment\r\n\nfor the defendants as a matter of law.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          We conclude  that the  district court  properly granted\r\n\nthe  defendants  Rule  50(a)  motion.   The  plaintiff had  ample\r\n\nopportunity at trial to produce evidence from which  the location\r\n\nof  the accident and the  ownership and control  of that location\r\n\ncould be determined, but she failed to do so.\r\n\n          B.

Discovery\r                                    1.  Discovery\r                                                 \r\n\n          The plaintiff asserts that  the district court erred in\r\n\nprematurely ordering  that discovery be concluded  when it failed\r\n\nto extend the discovery  deadline.  She argues that  the district\r\n\ncourt  improperly decided  that no  further discovery  was needed\r\n\nbased on a conference  in which an attorney previously  dismissed\r\n\nby the plaintiff purported to act as her counsel.   We review the\r\n\ndistrict  court s  decision  refusing  to  extend  the  discovery\r\n\ndeadline  for abuse  of discretion.   Mulero-Rodr guez  v. Ponte,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 98 F.3d 670, 679 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r              \r\n\n          The  persuasiveness  of  the  plaintiff s  argument  is\r\n\nundercut by its lack of supporting legal authority.  In fact, the\r\n\nrelevant  extant  authority  runs  contrary  to  the  plaintiff s\r\n\nposition.  As we have noted, courts have discretion\r\n\n          under the inherent power   necessarily vested\r\n          in [them]  to manage their own  affairs so as\r\n          to  achieve  the   orderly  and   expeditious\r\n          disposition of cases. \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nLuis C.  Forteza &amp; Hijos, Inc.  v. Mills, 534 F.2d  415, 418 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1976) (quoting Link v. Wabash, 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962)).\r                                            \r\n\n          The minutes  of the  March 16, 1995,  status conference\r\n\nindicate that the  trial judge  did not abuse  his discretion  in\r\n\nconducting the  conference.  At  that conference the  trial judge\r\n\nproperly  recognized  the  plaintiff s  former  counsel  for  the\r\n\nlimited purpose of  granting him permission to withdraw  from the\r\n\ncase and at  the same time made an appropriate  inquiry of him as\r\n\nto the status of  any pending discovery.  Counsel  indicated that\r\n\nno  discovery was  pending.   The trial  judge s decision  not to\r\n\nextend  discovery at that time based on counsel s response was an\r\n\nappropriate exercise  of his case management  authority given the\r\n\nfact that the  case had  been languishing on  the district  court\r\n\ndocket for more than four years and there had been ample time for\r\n\ndiscovery  to be completed.   There was still  an opportunity for\r\n\nthe  plaintiff s successor counsel to attempt in a timely fashion\r\n\nto have  the deadline extended.  However, he waited for one month\r\n\nafter  appearing in this case  to request an  extension, and that\r\n\nrequest was filed  on the  day before the  existing deadline  for\r\n\ndiscovery.    The  trial  judge  had  provided  ample   time  for\r\n\ndiscovery, and the  plaintiff s failure to take advantage of that\r\n\nopportunity,  whether attributable  to her  personally or  to her\r\n\nattorneys,  does  not provide  an adequate  basis  for us  now to\r\n\nsecond-guess the  trial  judge s determination  that, after  four\r\n\nyears, the time to conclude discovery had come.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n                       2.

As we have noted,   [a] default judgment\r\n\nis  itself a drastic sanction that  should be employed only in an\r\n\nextreme  situation.   Forteza, 534  F.2d at 419;  cf. Anderson v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBeatrice Foods  Co.,  900 F.2d  388,  396 (1st  Cir.)

The facts of this  case do not present  an\r\n\nextreme situation justifying the entry of default.\r\n\n          It is  certainly  not  without  significance  that  the\r\n\nplaintiff took no action in  response to the defendants   failure\r\n\nto  answer until  more  than two  years  after the  deadline  had\r\n\npassed.  In  addition, the  defendants had  already answered  the\r\n\nplaintiff s initial  complaint and the amended  complaint did not\r\n\nmaterially  alter the plaintiff s theory  of the case.   There is\r\n\nnothing  in the  record  to  suggest  that the  district  court s\r\n\nfailure to enter a default judgment under these circumstances was\r\n\nan abuse of discretion.  In another context, we have endorsed the\r\n\nauthority of district courts to impose less than the most extreme\r\n\nsanction  available.  See  Anderson, 900  F.2d at  396 (discovery\r                                             \r\n\nabuse).  We will  not upset the district court s  decision, which\r\n\nrested  within  its  sound discretion,  not  to  enter a  default\r\n\njudgment against the defendants.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n           3.  Exclusion of Plaintiff s Expert Witness\r                     3.  Exclusion of Plaintiff s Expert Witness\r                                                                \r\n\n          The  plaintiff  next  argues that  the  district  court\r\n\nimproperly barred  her from amending her  pretrial submissions to\r\n\ninclude her loss-of-income  expert.  She argues that allowing her\r\n\nloss-of-income expert  to testify would have  created no surprise\r\n\nor  prejudice to the defendants because  he was known to them and\r\n\nthat excluding him deprived the plaintiff of her right to present\r\n\nthose facts to the jury.  \r\n\n          We need not reach  the merits of this argument.   Since\r\n\nthe plaintiff failed to  establish the defendants  liability, the\r\n\ndistrict court s ruling on this matter did not affect the outcome\r\n\nof the case.\r\n\n                      4.  Costs and Expenses\r                                4.

Since the plaintiff did not prevail at\r\n\ntrial and has provided neither justification nor legal authority\r\n\nto support her claim that she is entitled to costs and expenses\r\n\nas a non-prevailing party, we find no abuse of discretion in the\r\n\ntrial court s decision not to award her any costs or expenses.\r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.

Following nine days of testimony at trial, the plaintiff rested and the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) asserting that the plaintiff had produced no evidence to establish that the defendants owned or controlled the area where the plaintiff slipped and fell.

The same day, the court held a pretrial conference and ruled that it would use without amendment the December 17, 1993, pretrial order, that the plaintiff's loss-of-income expert would not be allowed to testify, and that no further discovery would be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1995, after four and one-half years, trial appeared imminent.  However, three days before trial the plaintiff submitted a motion requesting that default be entered against the defendants for their failure to answer her amended complaint.  The district court did not rule on this motion until August 3, 1995, after the conclusion of the trial, at which time it declared the motion moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the plaintiff's case focused almost exclusively on her damages resulting from the fall.  Beyond her own testimony, she produced only one occurrence witness, Mirta Silva, to describe the scene of the accident.  The two witnesses provided a detailed description both of the scene of the accident and of how the accident occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  However, neither Silva nor the plaintiff identified specifically where within the airport the accident occurred.  There was no testimony about what gate the flight used, which hallway the passengers traveled, or where customs was located.  No testimony specifically identified the location of the accident within the larger context of the airport.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  No testimony connected either defendant to the location where the accident occurred or established what duty, if any, the defendants owed to the plaintiff to make the location safe.  In fact, at trial the plaintiff made little mention of defendant Ports Authority and produced no testimony at all mentioning defendant Mangual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the plaintiff's nine-day case, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), alleging that the plaintiff had not presented any evidence from which it could be found that the defendants were in control of and responsible for maintaining the location where the accident occurred.  The district court granted the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 1, 1995, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the district court's Rule 50(a) decision.  In connection with her appeal, the plaintiff requested a copy of the file from the district court clerk and upon inspection of the file allegedly discovered for the first time the joint statement.  The plaintiff had not mentioned the joint statement during the presentation of evidence in her case or when opposing the defendants' Rule 50(a) motion.Discussion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff on appeal has assigned as error a number of decisions by the district court during the course of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Rule 50(a)</p>\n    <p>Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff contends that the district court improperly dismissed her case under Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 50(a).  Rule 50(a)(1) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of a Rule 50(a) motion de novo.  Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.1996);  Andrade v. Jamestown Hous.  Auth., 82 F.3d 1179, 1186 (1st Cir.1996).  In doing so, we use the same standards as the district court, considering all the evidence and inferences reasonably to be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the non-movant.  Katz, 87 F.3d at 28;  Andrade, 82 F.3d at 1186.   However, \"[t]o warrant submission of an issue to the jury, the plaintiff must present 'more than a mere scintilla' of evidence and may not rely on conjecture or speculation.\"  Katz, 87 F.3d at 28 (quoting Richmond Steel, Inc. v. Puerto Rican American Ins. Co., 954 F.2d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's attack on the trial court's decision to enter judgment against her as a matter of law centers on two factors that she claims bolster the minimal evidence she presented:  the joint statement and the knowledge of the jurors.  According to the plaintiff, either factor, when combined with the testimony about the location of the accident, was sufficient to allow the jurors to make an inference in her favor as to the ownership and control of the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Joint Statement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff argues that the joint statement should have been considered as part of her case, and contends that it was sufficient to establish that Ports Authority owned and Mangual maintained the area of the airport where the accident occurred.  However, the plaintiff's argument suffers from a fatal defect, namely, the joint statement was never introduced into evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  It is a basic tenet of trial procedure that a stipulation concerning uncontested facts must be introduced into evidence by the party who intends to rely on it in order for those facts to be considered by the trier of fact, whether it be jury or judge.  Contrary to the plaintiff's assertion, it was her responsibility, and not the court's or the defendants', to ensure that the joint statement was introduced into evidence.  As we have explained,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>in our adversary system of justice it is the parties' responsibility to marshal evidence and prove their points.  Litigants cannot expect the court to do their homework for them.  [Citations omitted].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ondine Shipping Corp. v. Cataldo, 24 F.3d 353, 356-57 (1st Cir.1994).  The plaintiff, for whatever reason having failed to introduce the joint statement into evidence, cannot now avoid the consequences of her inaction by claiming the court or the defendants had the responsibility to introduce it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>2. The Jury's Experience</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff next contends that she produced enough evidence at trial to allow the jurors to infer, based on their own experience, that defendant Ports Authority owned and controlled the area of the airport where the accident took place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The trial judge, the plaintiff maintains, impermissibly substituted his judgment for that of the trier of fact by removing this decision from the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case clearly does not present a situation where the jury could rely on its general knowledge and experience to determine something as specific as the location and control of the area where the plaintiff fell.  It would be pure speculation to assume what, if any, knowledge the members of the jury possessed concerning these specific issues.  Although the plaintiff correctly notes that she is entitled to all reasonable inferences in her favor, tenuous conclusions extrapolated from conjectural knowledge attributed to jurors cannot substitute for evidence tested by the adversary process.  As we have said, \"[t]o warrant submission of an issue to the jury, the plaintiff must present 'more than a mere scintilla' of evidence and may not rely on conjecture or speculation.\"  Katz, 87 F.3d at 28 (quoting Richmond Steel, Inc. v. Puerto Rican American Ins. Co., 954 F.2d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1992)).  Speculation about what the jurors might have inferred based on their personal knowledge of airports cannot and does not save the plaintiff's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>3. Other Evidence from which an Inference of Ownership or</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Control Might Arise</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next review de novo the record upon which the plaintiff rested her case for any evidence that might raise a reasonable inference that Ports Authority owned and Mangual maintained the area where the accident occurred.  A thorough search of the appellate record reveals no evidence more helpful to the plaintiff than that considered, and rejected as inadequate, by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge made the following statement after considering the Rule 50(a) motion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I cannot take judicial notice of a place that I don't even know which is the place.  We cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, and even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the [plaintiff], reach a reasonable conclusion ... that the place where she fell, which we don't know where it is, we don't know which gate, we don't know which area of the airport, was under the control of the Ports Authority....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our independent evaluation of the paucity of evidence the plaintiff managed to produce on this point after nine days of trial draws us inexorably to the same conclusion--the evidence produced by the plaintiff was insufficient to withstand judgment for the defendants as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court properly granted the defendants' Rule 50(a) motion.  The plaintiff had ample opportunity at trial to produce evidence from which the location of the accident and the ownership and control of that location could be determined, but she failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Pre- and Post-Trial Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff next challenges several pre- and post-trial rulings by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff asserts that the district court erred in prematurely ordering that discovery be concluded when it failed to extend the discovery deadline.  She argues that the district court improperly decided that no further discovery was needed based on a conference in which an attorney previously dismissed by the plaintiff purported to act as her counsel.  We review the district court's decision refusing to extend the discovery deadline for abuse of discretion.  Mulero-Rodrguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 679 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The persuasiveness of the plaintiff's argument is undercut by its lack of supporting legal authority.  In fact, the relevant extant authority runs contrary to the plaintiff's position.  As we have noted, courts have discretion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>under the inherent power \"necessarily vested in [them] to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luis C. Forteza e Hijos, Inc. v. Mills, 534 F.2d 415, 418 (1st Cir.1976) (quoting Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1389, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The minutes of the March 16, 1995, status conference indicate that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in conducting the conference.  At that conference the trial judge properly recognized the plaintiff's former counsel for the limited purpose of granting him permission to withdraw from the case and at the same time made an appropriate inquiry of him as to the status of any pending discovery.  Counsel indicated that no discovery was pending.  The trial judge's decision not to extend discovery at that time based on counsel's response was an appropriate exercise of his case management authority given the fact that the case had been languishing on the district court docket for more than four years and there had been ample time for discovery to be completed.  There was still an opportunity for the plaintiff's successor counsel to attempt in a timely fashion to have the deadline extended.  However, he waited for one month after appearing in this case to request an extension, and that request was filed on the day before the existing deadline for discovery.  The trial judge had provided ample time for discovery, and the plaintiff's failure to take advantage of that opportunity, whether attributable to her personally or to her attorneys, does not provide an adequate basis for us now to second-guess the trial judge's determination that, after four years, the time to conclude discovery had come.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Entry of Default</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also asserts that the district court should have entered a default against the defendants for their failure to answer her amended complaint rather than allowing the motion to become moot.  As we have noted, \"[a] default judgment is itself a drastic sanction that should be employed only in an extreme situation.\"  Forteza, 534 F.2d at 419;  cf.  Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 396 (1st Cir.)  (discovery abuse, while sanctionable, does not require as a matter of law imposition of most severe sanctions available), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 891, 111 S.Ct. 233, 112 L.Ed.2d 193 (1990).  The facts of this case do not present an extreme situation justifying the entry of default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is certainly not without significance that the plaintiff took no action in response to the defendants' failure to answer until more than two years after the deadline had passed.  In addition, the defendants had already answered the plaintiff's initial complaint and the amended complaint did not materially alter the plaintiff's theory of the case.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court's failure to enter a default judgment under these circumstances was an abuse of discretion.  In another context, we have endorsed the authority of district courts to impose less than the most extreme sanction available.  See Anderson, 900 F.2d at 396 (discovery abuse).  We will not upset the district court's decision, which rested within its sound discretion, not to enter a default judgment against the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Exclusion of Plaintiff's Expert Witness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff next argues that the district court improperly barred her from amending her pretrial submissions to include her loss-of-income expert.  She argues that allowing her loss-of-income expert to testify would have created no surprise or prejudice to the defendants because he was known to them and that excluding him deprived the plaintiff of her right to present those facts to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the merits of this argument.  Since the plaintiff failed to establish the defendants' liability, the district court's ruling on this matter did not affect the outcome of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Costs and Expenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the plaintiff seeks the \"costs and expenses\" she incurred at trial.  Since the plaintiff did not prevail at trial and has provided neither justification nor legal authority to support her claim that she is entitled to costs and expenses as a non-prevailing party, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision not to award her any costs or expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.   Costs are awarded to the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mangual is a janitorial company with which the Ports Authority has contracted</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Coyante brought a separate action asserting similar claims against Lnea Aeropostal Venezolana, the airline on which she had traveled.

We focus on the district court's ruling on the loss-of-income expert because the issues involved are identical</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The plaintiff's counsel at trial and on appeal was the seventh lawyer to appear for her in this litigation, not counting her brief pro se appearance.

A pool of water, which apparently formed due to a crack in the ceiling, covered almost the entire width of the hallway in front of the door to customs.  The plaintiff fell while attempting to traverse the pool</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> For example, an employee connected with the airport prepared a report about the accident shortly after it happened that was presented at trial but the report failed to specify the location of the accident</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Even if the plaintiff had introduced the joint statement into evidence, it is by no means a foregone conclusion that it would have sufficiently cured the deficiency in her evidence to withstand the Rule 50(a) motion.  We need not confront this issue, however, because the plaintiff never introduced the joint statement into evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The plaintiff has also offered two other related theories concerning the effect of the joint statement.  First, she claims that the agreement that produced the joint statement should have barred the defendants from moving for judgment as a matter of law on the issues of ownership and control.  She further asserts that the joint statement functioned as a contract between the parties, one of the implied terms of which was the defendants' promise not to contest ownership and control, and that breach of this agreement requires reversal.  As the plaintiff has produced neither legal authority nor well-reasoned arguments for these propositions, we decline to find that either one is viable under the facts of this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, the plaintiff conceded that defendant Mangual's liability could be established only by the joint statement, and not by the jurors' experience and knowledge, because the plaintiff produced no evidence at trial that referred to Mangual</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(\"Mangual\"), seeking damages she claims to have suffered as a result of slipping and falling on certain premises allegedly owned or controlled by the defendants.  Following nine days of testimony at trial, the plaintiff rested and the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) asserting that the plaintiff had produced no evidence to establish that the defendants owned or controlled the area where the plaintiff slipped and fell.  The district court agreed with the defendants and, finding that ownership and control were necessary elements of the plaintiff's case, entered a judgment against her.  In this appeal, the plaintiff challenges the district court's ruling on the defendants' motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) and several other rulings made during the course of the litigation.  For the reasons expressed below, we affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 1990, the plaintiff slipped and fell, suffering personal injury after disembarking from an international flight at the Luis Munoz Marn International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  On January 3, 1991, she filed suit against the defendants, Ports Authority and Mangual,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for negligently failing to make safe a dangerous condition about which they knew or should have known.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The plaintiff claimed she suffered damages arising not only from the accident itself, but also from the pain she suffered and medical expenses she incurred when she became addicted to and went through withdrawal from prescription medications she was taking because of the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 30, 1993, the district court, after resolving an initial challenge to its jurisdiction, granted the plaintiff leave to amend her complaint and ordered the defendants to answer the amended complaint \"on or before April 12, 1993.\"   On March 31, 1993, the plaintiff resubmitted her amended complaint (first submitted on February 25, 1992) but the defendants did not answer by April 12 as required by the court's order.

The plaintiff attaches particular significance to the following provisions of the joint statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7.

On February 22, 1995, the plaintiff fired her counsel and, on February 27, 1995, filed a pro se motion so informing the court.  On March 16, 1995, the court held a status conference.  At that conference, the court granted a motion filed by the plaintiff's counsel to withdraw from the case and for scheduling purposes asked counsel whether further discovery was pending at that time.  Counsel informed the court that no further discovery was pending, and the court let stand its April 20, 1995, discovery deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 1995, current counsel appeared on the plaintiff's behalf.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The file he received from prior counsel was reportedly in disarray and reflected that the plaintiff had undertaken no discovery of the defendants.  On April 19, 1995, one day before the deadline set for discovery to be completed, the plaintiff moved to extend the discovery deadline and take a deposition.  This motion was denied by the court on May 24, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 1995, the plaintiff moved to supplement the pretrial order issued on December 17, 1993, to reflect subsequent changes in her case.  The same day, the court held a pretrial conference and ruled that it would use without amendment the December 17, 1993, pretrial order, that the plaintiff's loss-of-income expert would not be allowed to testify, and that no further discovery would be allowed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1995, after four and one-half years, trial appeared imminent.  However, three days before trial the plaintiff submitted a motion requesting that default be entered against the defendants for their failure to answer her amended complaint.  The district court did not rule on this motion until August 3, 1995, after the conclusion of the trial, at which time it declared the motion moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the plaintiff's case focused almost exclusively on her damages resulting from the fall.  Beyond her own testimony, she produced only one occurrence witness, Mirta Silva, to describe the scene of the accident.  The two witnesses provided a detailed description both of the scene of the accident and of how the accident occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  However, neither Silva nor the plaintiff identified specifically where within the airport the accident occurred.  There was no testimony about what gate the flight used, which hallway the passengers traveled, or where customs was located.  No testimony specifically identified the location of the accident within the larger context of the airport.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  No testimony connected either defendant to the location where the accident occurred or established what duty, if any, the defendants owed to the plaintiff to make the location safe.  In fact, at trial the plaintiff made little mention of defendant Ports Authority and produced no testimony at all mentioning defendant Mangual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the plaintiff's nine-day case, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), alleging that the plaintiff had not presented any evidence from which it could be found that the defendants were in control of and responsible for maintaining the location where the accident occurred.

In connection with her appeal, the plaintiff requested a copy of the file from the district court clerk and upon inspection of the file allegedly discovered for the first time the joint statement.  The plaintiff had not mentioned the joint statement during the presentation of evidence in her case or when opposing the defendants' Rule 50(a) motion.Discussion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff on appeal has assigned as error a number of decisions by the district court during the course of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

According to the plaintiff, either factor, when combined with the testimony about the location of the accident, was sufficient to allow the jurors to make an inference in her favor as to the ownership and control of the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Joint Statement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff argues that the joint statement should have been considered as part of her case, and contends that it was sufficient to establish that Ports Authority owned and Mangual maintained the area of the airport where the accident occurred.  However, the plaintiff's argument suffers from a fatal defect, namely, the joint statement was never introduced into evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  It is a basic tenet of trial procedure that a stipulation concerning uncontested facts must be introduced into evidence by the party who intends to rely on it in order for those facts to be considered by the trier of fact, whether it be jury or judge.  Contrary to the plaintiff's assertion, it was her responsibility, and not the court's or the defendants', to ensure that the joint statement was introduced into evidence.  As we have explained,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>in our adversary system of justice it is the parties' responsibility to marshal evidence and prove their points.

The plaintiff, for whatever reason having failed to introduce the joint statement into evidence, cannot now avoid the consequences of her inaction by claiming the court or the defendants had the responsibility to introduce it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>2. The Jury's Experience</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff next contends that she produced enough evidence at trial to allow the jurors to infer, based on their own experience, that defendant Ports Authority owned and controlled the area of the airport where the accident took place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The trial judge, the plaintiff maintains, impermissibly substituted his judgment for that of the trier of fact by removing this decision from the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case clearly does not present a situation where the jury could rely on its general knowledge and experience to determine something as specific as the location and control of the area where the plaintiff fell.  It would be pure speculation to assume what, if any, knowledge the members of the jury possessed concerning these specific issues.  Although the plaintiff correctly notes that she is entitled to all reasonable inferences in her favor, tenuous conclusions extrapolated from conjectural knowledge attributed to jurors cannot substitute for evidence tested by the adversary process.  As we have said, \"[t]o warrant submission of an issue to the jury, the plaintiff must present 'more than a mere scintilla' of evidence and may not rely on conjecture or speculation.\"  Katz, 87 F.3d at 28 (quoting Richmond Steel, Inc. v.

A thorough search of the appellate record reveals no evidence more helpful to the plaintiff than that considered, and rejected as inadequate, by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge made the following statement after considering the Rule 50(a) motion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I cannot take judicial notice of a place that I don't even know which is the place.

Pre- and Post-Trial Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff next challenges several pre- and post-trial rulings by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff asserts that the district court erred in prematurely ordering that discovery be concluded when it failed to extend the discovery deadline.  She argues that the district court improperly decided that no further discovery was needed based on a conference in which an attorney previously dismissed by the plaintiff purported to act as her counsel.  We review the district court's decision refusing to extend the discovery deadline for abuse of discretion.  Mulero-Rodrguez v.

At that conference the trial judge properly recognized the plaintiff's former counsel for the limited purpose of granting him permission to withdraw from the case and at the same time made an appropriate inquiry of him as to the status of any pending discovery.  Counsel indicated that no discovery was pending.  The trial judge's decision not to extend discovery at that time based on counsel's response was an appropriate exercise of his case management authority given the fact that the case had been languishing on the district court docket for more than four years and there had been ample time for discovery to be completed.  There was still an opportunity for the plaintiff's successor counsel to attempt in a timely fashion to have the deadline extended.  However, he waited for one month after appearing in this case to request an extension, and that request was filed on the day before the existing deadline for discovery.  The trial judge had provided ample time for discovery, and the plaintiff's failure to take advantage of that opportunity, whether attributable to her personally or to her attorneys, does not provide an adequate basis for us now to second-guess the trial judge's determination that, after four years, the time to conclude discovery had come.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Entry of Default</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also asserts that the district court should have entered a default against the defendants for their failure to answer her amended complaint rather than allowing the motion to become moot.  As we have noted, \"[a] default judgment is itself a drastic sanction that should be employed only in an extreme situation.\"  Forteza, 534 F.2d at 419;  cf.  Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539792\"><a href=\"/opinion/539792/anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 396 (1st Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span> (1990).  The facts of this case do not present an extreme situation justifying the entry of default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is certainly not without significance that the plaintiff took no action in response to the defendants' failure to answer until more than two years after the deadline had passed.  In addition, the defendants had already answered the plaintiff's initial complaint and the amended complaint did not materially alter the plaintiff's theory of the case.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court's failure to enter a default judgment under these circumstances was an abuse of discretion.  In another context, we have endorsed the authority of district courts to impose less than the most extreme sanction available.  See Anderson, 900 F.2d at 396 (discovery abuse).  We will not upset the district court's decision, which rested within its sound discretion, not to enter a default judgment against the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Exclusion of Plaintiff's Expert Witness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff next argues that the district court improperly barred her from amending her pretrial submissions to include her loss-of-income expert.  She argues that allowing her loss-of-income expert to testify would have created no surprise or prejudice to the defendants because he was known to them and that excluding him deprived the plaintiff of her right to present those facts to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach the merits of this argument.  Since the plaintiff failed to establish the defendants' liability, the district court's ruling on this matter did not affect the outcome of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Costs and Expenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the plaintiff seeks the \"costs and expenses\" she incurred at trial.  Since the plaintiff did not prevail at trial and has provided neither justification nor legal authority to support her claim that she is entitled to costs and expenses as a non-prevailing party, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision not to award her any costs or expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

We need not confront this issue, however, because the plaintiff never introduced the joint statement into evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The plaintiff has also offered two other related theories concerning the effect of the joint statement.  First, she claims that the agreement that produced the joint statement should have barred the defendants from moving for judgment as a matter of law on the issues of ownership and control.  She further asserts that the joint statement functioned as a contract between the parties, one of the implied terms of which was the defendants' promise not to contest ownership and control, and that breach of this agreement requires reversal.  As the plaintiff has produced neither legal authority nor well-reasoned arguments for these propositions, we decline to find that either one is viable under the facts of this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, the plaintiff conceded that defendant Mangual's liability could be established only by the joint statement, and not by the jurors' experience and knowledge, because the plaintiff produced no evidence at trial that referred to Mangual</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
