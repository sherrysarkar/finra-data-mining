Fulmer was sentenced to\r\n\na term of five months imprisonment to be followed by two years of\r\n\nsupervised release.  On appeal, Fulmer challenges his conviction,\r\n\na number of evidentiary  rulings, and the jury instructions.   We\r\n\nfind that several improper  evidentiary rulings were not harmless\r\n\nerror, and, accordingly, we vacate Fulmer's conviction and remand\r\n\nfor a new trial.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  sketch the  facts  presented  at  trial,  providing\r\n\nfurther  details as they become  relevant to the  discussion.  In\r\n\nMay 1994, the  Office of  the United States  Trustee referred  to\r\n\nEgan  a complaint in which Fulmer alleged that his former father-\r\n\nin-law,  Antonio Boschetti (\"Boschetti\"),  and his brother, David\r\n\nFulmer,  had  failed to  disclose  assets in  bankruptcy  and had\r\n\ncommitted pension fraud and  income tax fraud.  Egan  arranged to\r\n\nmeet  Fulmer in  August or  September of  1994.  At  the meeting,\r\n\nFulmer  explained to  Egan that  he and  his brother  had married\r\n\nBoschetti's daughters,  and that Fulmer had  since been divorced.\r\n\nFulmer indicated that Boschetti  and David Fulmer had engaged  in\r\n\nillegal business  activities.   Fulmer explained that  these were\r\n\n\"vicious\" people and that  they had \"used the courts  to keep him\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\naway  from  his family.\"    Egan described  Fulmer's  demeanor as\r\n\n\"polite, articulate\" and  \"tense.\"  Egan noted  that, although he\r\n\ntried  repeatedly to  steer the  conversation toward  the alleged\r\n\nconcealment  of  assets,  Fulmer  would return  to  his  strained\r\n\nrelationship with his family.\r\n\n          Over the  next  three  months,  Fulmer  contacted  Egan\r\n\n\"every week or ten  days.\"  Fulmer delivered documents  to Egan's\r\n\noffice and stopped by to inquire about the investigation.  Fulmer\r\n\nalso  sent  letters and  faxes  to Egan  and  called Egan  on the\r\n\ntelephone,  leaving   messages  when  he  did   not  reach  Egan.\r\n\nThroughout this  interaction, Fulmer continued to  comment on his\r\n\npoor relationship with his family.\r\n\n          Egan   interviewed  Boschetti  and  David  Fulmer,  and\r\n\nobtained and reviewed documents related to the bankruptcy.  After\r\n\nEgan investigated  Fulmer's allegations,  Egan consulted  with an\r\n\nAssistant United States  Attorney.  In  January 1995, the  United\r\n\nStates Attorney's office advised Egan that it would not prosecute\r\n\nthe case.  Egan in turn  informed Fulmer that the records did not\r\n\nsupport  prosecution.   Fulmer protested  the decision,  but said\r\n\n\"good-bye\"  and hung  up after  Egan told  him there  was nothing\r\n\nfurther to discuss.   Fulmer may have asked Egan whether he could\r\n\nprovide  further  information to  make  a  stronger case  against\r\n\nBoschetti and David Fulmer.\r\n\n          There  were  no further  interactions between  Egan and\r\n\nFulmer until April  25, 1995,  when Egan  received the  following\r\n\nvoicemail message from Fulmer at approximately 5:40 p.m.:\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Hi Dick, Kevan Fulmer.  Hope things are well,\r\n          hope you had an  enjoyable Easter and all the\r\n          other holidays  since  I've spoken  with  you\r\n          last.  I want you to look something up.  It's\r\n          known  as misprision.   Just  think of  it in\r\n          terms of misprision of a felony.  Hope all is\r\n          well.   The silver bullets are  coming.  I'll\r\n          talk to you.  Enjoy the intriguing unraveling\r\n          of  what I said to  you.  Talk  to you, Dick.\r\n          It's been a pleasure.  Take care.\r\n\n          At Fulmer's trial, Egan testified that he was \"shocked\"\r\n\nby  the message,  which  he found  \"chilling\"  and \"scary.\"    He\r\n\ntestified  that  he had  never  heard the  term  \"silver bullets\"\r\n\nbefore  and believed that the term indicated a threat.  He stated\r\n\nthat  he  intended to  report the  message  to the  United States\r\n\nAttorney's   office.     Egan's  supervisor,   Robert  Schlabach,\r\n\ntestified that Egan played  the message for him the  next morning\r\n\nand told Schlabach that he believed  the message was a threat and\r\n\nintended  to  take it  to  the United  States  Attorney's office.\r\n\nSchlabach  also  testified  that  Egan  appeared  \"clearly upset,\r\n\nconcerned, [and] agitated.\"  Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 130.\r\n\n          Fulmer  presented two  witnesses who  testified  to the\r\n\nmeaning  Fulmer associated with  the term \"silver  bullets.\"  The\r\n\nfirst,  John Noonan,  a lawyer  and former  federal investigator,\r\n\ntestified  that  he  had  heard  Fulmer use  the  phrase  \"silver\r\n\nbullets\"  to  describe \"a  clear-cut  simple  violation of  law.\"\r\n\nNoonan stated  that Fulmer used  the phrase to  describe specific\r\n\nevidence, including an $8,200 check from a bankruptcy estate that\r\n\nnever reached its intended recipient.\r\n\n          The second  witness, David Tremblay, testified  that he\r\n\nhad known Fulmer for more than  twenty years and that Fulmer  had\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nused the phrase \"silver bullets\" to mean \"information that he was\r\n\ngoing to provide to banks proving the illegality of some of David\r\n\nFulmer's transactions.\"\r\n\n          David Baarlaer,  a  portfolio analyst  for GE  Capital,\r\n\ntestified  that  in  April   1995  Fulmer  prompted  Baarlaer  to\r\n\ninvestigate  whether   GE  Capital  had  received   a  check  for\r\n\napproximately $8,300  from the  Boschettis.  Baarlaer  found that\r\n\nthe check  had not been  received.   In April, David  Fulmer sent\r\n\nBaarlaer a copy  of the check,  which showed no  signs of  having\r\n\nbeen canceled, endorsed, or deposited.  Sometime before April 25,\r\n\n1995, Baarlaer told Fulmer about the check.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\nI.        Sufficiency of the Evidence\r          I.        Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\n\n          Fulmer   contests  the  sufficiency   of  the  evidence\r\n\nsupporting  his  conviction  on   two  grounds,  first,  that  an\r\n\nambiguous  statement cannot  be considered  a \"true  threat,\" and\r\n\nsecond, that the evidence  did not support a finding  that Fulmer\r\n\nhad  the  requisite  intent.   We  begin  with  the  now-familiar\r\n\nstandard of review:\r\n\n          In  assessing a challenge  to the sufficiency\r\n          of  the  evidence, we  \"review the  record to\r\n          determine whether the evidence and reasonable\r\n          inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in\r\n          the  light most favorable to the prosecution,\r\n          would  allow  a  rational jury  to  determine\r\n          beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant[\r\n          was] guilty as charged.\"\r\n\nUnited  States  v. Sullivan,  85 F.3d  743,  747 (1st  Cir. 1996)\r                                     \r\n\n(quoting United  States v. Mena-Robles,  4 F.3d  1026, 1031  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1993)).\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          A.   \"True threat\"\r                    A.   \"True threat\"\r\n\n          Fulmer   argues  that  the   appropriate  standard  for\r\n\ndetermining  a true threat is whether  \"a reasonable person would\r\n\nforesee  that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom\r\n\nthe maker communicates the statement  as a serious expression  of\r\n\nintent to harm or  assault.\"  United States v.

The government argues that\r\n\nthe proper standard is whether an \"ordinary, reasonable recipient\r\n\nwho  is  familiar  with  the context  of  the  [statement]  would\r\n\ninterpret it as  a threat of injury.\"  United States v. Maisonet,\r                                                                          \r\n\n484 F.2d  1356, 1358 (4th Cir.  1973).  This circuit  has not yet\r\n\nruled on the appropriate standard regarding the nature of a \"true\r\n\nthreat.\"   Although our  sister circuits  that have reviewed  the\r\n\nstandard under this and other1 federal threat statutes agree that\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  18 U.S.C.   871 provides, in part:\r\n\n     Threats  against   President  and  successors   to  the\r\n     Presidency\r\n\n          (a)  Whoever knowingly and willfully  deposits for\r\n     conveyance  in the mail or for a delivery from any post\r\n     office  or by  any  letter carrier  any letter,  paper,\r\n     writing,  print, missive,  or  document containing  any\r\n     threat  to take the life  of, to kidnap,  or to inflict\r\n     bodily harm  upon the  President of the  United States,\r\n     the  President-elect,  the   Vice  President  or  other\r\n     officer next in  the order of succession to  the office\r\n     of  President  of  the   United  States,  or  the  Vice\r\n     President-elect, or knowingly  and willfully  otherwise\r\n     makes any such threat against the President, President-\r\n     elect,  Vice President  or  other officer  next in  the\r\n     order of succession to the office of President, or Vice\r\n     President-elect,  shall be  fined under  this  title or\r\n     imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   875 provides, in part:\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nan objective  standard is  required, they disagree  regarding the\r\n\nappropriate vantage point  -- what a person  making the statement\r\n\nshould  have  reasonably foreseen  or  what  a reasonable  person\r\n\nreceiving the statement  would believe.

DeAndino, 958  F.2d 146, 148  (6th Cir.  1992) (\"[T]he\r                             \r\n\nstandard . . . is an objective standard, i.e., would a reasonable\r                                                       \r\n\nperson consider the statement to be a threat.\").\r\n\n          We believe that the  appropriate standard under which a\r\n\ndefendant  may be  convicted for  making a  threat is  whether he\r\n\nshould  have reasonably  foreseen that  the statement  he uttered\r\n\nwould be  taken as a threat  by those to  whom it is made.   This\r\n\nstandard not only takes into account the factual context in which\r\n\nthe  statement was made, but  also better avoids  the perils that\r\n\ninhere in  the \"reasonable-recipient standard,\"  namely that  the\r\n\njury will consider the  unique sensitivity of the recipient.   We\r\n\nfind  it particularly untenable that, were we to apply a standard\r\n\nguided  from the perspective of the recipient, a defendant may be\r\n\nconvicted for  making an  ambiguous statement that  the recipient\r\n\nmay find threatening because  of events not within the  knowledge\r\n\nof the defendant.   Therefore, we follow the approach  of several\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncircuits by holding  that the  appropriate focus is  on what  the\r\n\ndefendant reasonably should have foreseen.\r\n\n          Fulmer  contends  that   the  statement  was  at   most\r\n\nambiguous  and could not have been a \"true threat.\"  Fulmer cites\r\n\nUnited States v.

This  is so  because . .  .\r\n          where  an equal  or  nearly  equal theory  of\r\n          guilt  and a theory of innocence is supported\r\n          by  the  evidence viewed  in  the  light most\r\n          favorable to  the verdict, a  reasonable jury\r\n          must   necessarily  entertain   a  reasonable\r\n          doubt.\r\n\n49  F.3d 16,  20 (1st  Cir.  1995) (citation,  internal quotation\r\n\nmarks, and emphasis omitted).\r\n\n          Although Fulmer properly recites  the law, we find that\r\n\nAnd jar's  wisdom does not apply  here.  A  reasonable jury could\r                 \r\n\nhave found the following.  A bankruptcy trustee referred Fulmer's\r\n\ncomplaint to Egan in May 1994.  In August or  September, Egan met\r\n\nwith  Fulmer,  and  found   his  demeanor  regarding  his  family\r\n\n\"intense.\"   Fulmer expressed his belief that Boschetti and David\r\n\nFulmer had engaged in illegal activities and further claimed that\r\n\nthey were \"vicious\" people who had used the courts to keep Fulmer\r\n\naway from  his family.   Thereafter, Egan had  conversations with\r\n\nBoschetti and David Fulmer who reiterated the ill feelings Fulmer\r\n\nbore toward  them.  Fulmer  contacted Egan frequently,  by letter\r\n\nand by  telephone, leaving voicemail  messages when Egan  was not\r\n\navailable.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          After a  thorough investigation, Egan and  an Assistant\r\n\nUnited  States   Attorney  determined   that  the   evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient  to support  a prosecution.   Fulmer  protested, but\r\n\nwhen  Egan told him there was nothing further to discuss, he said\r\n\n\"goodbye\" and  hung  up.   Egan's  next interaction  with  Fulmer\r\n\noccurred  three  months later,  when  Fulmer  left the  voicemail\r\n\nmessage at issue.\r\n\n          The jury could have also found that, although the usage\r\n\nof the term \"silver bullets\" varies,  the phrase may be used as a\r\n\nthreat.\r\n\n          Reviewing   all  of  these   facts,  and   drawing  all\r\n\ninferences  in  favor  of the  verdict,  we  cannot  say that  no\r\n\nrational jury  could have  found beyond  a reasonable doubt  that\r\n\nFulmer's  statement was a  threat.  \"Whether  a given [statement]\r\n\nconstitutes a  threat is an  issue of fact  for the trial  jury.\"\r\n\nMalik, 16 F.3d  at 49.   The use of  ambiguous language does  not\r               \r\n\npreclude  a statement from being  a threat.   See id.; Schneider,\r                                                                          \r\n\n910 F.2d at 1570 (\"The threat in this case was ambiguous, but the\r\n\ntask of interpretation was for the jury.\"); Orozco-Santillan, 903\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 1265 (\"The fact that a threat is subtle does not  make it\r\n\nless  of  a threat.\"  (citation  and  quotation marks  omitted));\r\n\nMaisonet,  484 F.2d  at  1358 (finding  determination of  whether\r                  \r\n\nstatement constitutes a threat a jury question);  see also United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

While  the statement on its face may be\r\n\nsusceptible  to more  than one  interpretation, some  factors not\r\n\ndiscernable  from the record, such as the tone of the defendant's\r\n\nvoice  or  the  credibility  of  the  government's  and  Fulmer's\r\n\nwitnesses,  may legitimately lead  a rational  jury to  find that\r\n\nthis statement was a threat.\r\n\n          Fulmer further suggests that we must strictly apply the\r\n\n\"true threat\" standard in  order to avoid trampling on  his First\r\n\nAmendment rights,  citing Watts  v. United  States, 394  U.S. 705\r                                                            \r\n\n(1969).  Watts involved a statement made against the president in\r                        \r\n\nthe context  of a political rally  against a war.   The Court was\r\n\nconcerned  with  punishing   Watts'  constitutionally   protected\r\n\npolitical  speech.   See  id.  at  1401  (\"The  language  of  the\r                                       \r\n\npolitical arena, like the language used in labor  disputes, . . .\r\n\nis often  vituperative, abusive  and inexact.  .  . .   Taken  in\r\n\ncontext, and  regarding the  expressly conditional nature  of the\r\n\nstatement and the reaction of the listeners, we do not see how it\r\n\ncould be interpreted otherwise.\").  In this case, Fulmer does not\r\n\nargue  his message was one  criticizing either Egan  or any other\r\n\ngovernment figure.  Moreover, a true threat is unprotected by the\r\n\nFirst  Amendment.  Orozco-Santillan, 903  F.2d at 1265.   Thus, a\r                                             \r\n\nconviction under  this  statute,  based on  a  finding  that  the\r\n\nstatement  was   a  true  threat,  would   not  violate  Fulmer's\r\n\nconstitutionally protected right to speech.\r\n\n          B.

Drawing all inferences\r\n\nand credibility determinations in favor of the government's case,\r\n\nwe  find  that  a rational  jury  could  have  found that  Fulmer\r\n\nknowingly made the statement alleged to be  a threat, and that he\r\n\ndid so with the intent to \"impede, intimidate, or interfere with\"\r\n\nEgan  in the performance of his duties, or to \"retaliate\" against\r\n\nhim, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.   115(a)(1)(B).\r\n\n            Although   we  find   that  the   evidence  was   not\r\n\ninsufficient as  a matter of law,  we come to this  conclusion by\r\n\nviewing  the  properly  admitted   evidence  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to   the  verdict  and  by   drawing  all  credibility\r\n\ndeterminations in favor of the verdict.  As we discuss in section\r\n\nIII,  we believe  that the  improperly admitted  evidence was  so\r\n\ninflammatory that it  may have prompted the jury at the outset to\r\n\nweigh the  properly admitted evidence in  the government's favor.\r\n\nThis  sort of taint we  cannot condone, and  justifies a reversal\r\n\neven  where Fulmer's  argument  as  to  the  sufficiency  of  the\r\n\nevidence fails.\r\n\nII.

Intent to Threaten Egan\r\n\n          Fulmer  argues that  the district  court erred  when it\r\n\nfailed  to instruct the jury  that the statute  requires both the\r\n\nstatutory intent and an intent \"to put Mr. Egan in  fear of being\r\n\nassaulted or murdered.\"   He also claims that the  district court\r\n\nerred  when it declined to instruct  \"to say or do something that\r\n\nwould cause a person  of ordinary sensibilities to be  fearful of\r\n\nharm to himself or another.\"\r\n\n          The  district  court  set forth  the  jury  instruction\r\n\nregarding the elements of the statute2 as follows:\r\n\n            To  prove  the  defendant   committed  this\r\n          crime,  the  Government must  prove  that the\r\n          defendant  knowingly threatened  the officer.\r\n          The  term  \"knowingly,\"  as  used   in  these\r\n          instructions,  means  that the  defendant was\r\n          conscious and aware  of his actions, realized\r\n          what  he was doing,  and did  not act  out of\r\n          ignorance, mistake, or accident.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  18 U.S.C.   115(a)(1)(B) states:\r\n\n          (a)(1) Whoever --\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n            (B)  threatens  to   assault,  kidnap,   or\r\n          murder,  a United  States official,  judge, a\r\n          Federal  law  enforcement   officer,  or   an\r\n          official whose killing would be a crime under\r\n          such section,\r\n\n          with   intent   to  impede,   intimidate,  or\r\n          interfere with such  official, judge, or  law\r\n          enforcement  officer  while  engaged  in  the\r\n          performance  of  official  duties,   or  with\r\n          intent  to retaliate  against such  person on\r\n          account of the performance of official duties\r\n          during the  term of service  of such  person,\r\n          shall be punished . . . .\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n            Now, what is a  threat for purposes of this\r\n          statute?    A  threat  is  a  statement  that\r\n          expresses an intent to inflict bodily harm on\r\n          someone.  To be a threat, a statement must be\r\n          of  such  a nature  as can  reasonably induce\r\n          fear.  You must determine whether a statement\r\n          was a true threat when judged in this context\r\n          -- in its context.\r\n\n            Among  other  things,  you should  consider\r\n          whether  on its face and in the circumstances\r\n          in which the statement is  made, a reasonable\r\n          person would foresee that the statement would\r\n          convey  to  the  recipient a  seriousness  of\r\n          purpose   and   the   apparent  prospect   of\r\n          execution.  Whether a particular statement is\r\n          a threat is governed by an objective standard\r\n          whether   a   reasonable   person    in   the\r\n          circumstances   would    foresee   that   the\r\n          statement would be  interpreted by the person\r\n          to whom it is made as a serious expression of\r\n          intent to harm or assault.\r\n\n            This means  that  you should  consider  the\r\n          statement  in light  of  its  entire  factual\r\n          context,  including  the surrounding  events,\r\n          reaction of the listeners, and the manner and\r\n          tone  in  which  it  is  made  --  was  made.\r\n          Sometimes the  tone or  the way  something is\r\n          expressed can  make  a difference  between  a\r\n          threat and something that is not a threat.\r\n\n            Keep in mind that the Government must prove\r\n          its case  beyond a  reasonable doubt.   So if\r\n          there  is something  ambiguous about  the way\r\n          the statement is made  and you think that the\r\n          statement can be reasonably interpreted under\r\n          the circumstances, either  as threatening  or\r\n          nonthreatening, the case has not been proven.\r\n          However, the fact that  a threat is subtle or\r\n          lacks  explicitly  threatening language  does\r\n          not make it less of a threat.\r\n\n            Now, a threat  can be made in  person, in a\r\n          phone  call, or in a letter.  To be a threat,\r\n          it's not necessary that the statement be made\r\n          face to  face.  The Government  does not have\r\n          to prove that the defendant actually intended\r\n          to carry out the  threat or that he  was able\r\n          to.   That is not a part of the definition of\r\n          threat.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n            If the Government proves  that a threat was\r\n          made by  the defendant, then  you must decide\r\n          whether  the person threatened  was a federal\r\n          law  enforcement officer  and whether  at the\r\n          time  the  threat was  made, the  officer was\r\n          engaged  in the  performance of  his official\r\n          duties.\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n            If  you find  that a  threat to  assault or\r\n          murder a federal law enforcement  officer was\r\n          made, then you must consider the next element\r\n          of the offense.  The indictment says that the\r\n          threat  was  made  with  intent   to  impede,\r\n          intimidate,  and  interfere  with Agent  Egan\r\n          while  engaged  in  the  performance  of  his\r\n          official duties and to retaliate  against him\r\n          on   account  of  the  performance  of  those\r\n          duties.\r\n\n            Even  though the  indictment uses  the word\r\n          \"and,\"   you   must  determine   whether  the\r\n          defendant made the threat  with the intent to\r\n          impede  or intimidate  or interfere  with the\r\n          federal law enforcement officer's performance\r\n          of his other official  duties or whether  the\r\n          defendant made the threat with the  intent to\r\n          retaliate against the law enforcement officer\r\n          because  of his  performance of  his official\r\n          duties.\r\n\n            The Government may satisfy this  element of\r\n          the   offense   by  proving   any   of  these\r\n          intentions.   It  is not  necessary that  the\r\n          Government prove that the  defendant intended\r\n          all of these  things.  If  you find that  the\r\n          Government has proven any of these intentions\r\n          beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  and  you  agree\r\n          unanimously as  to which one it  is, then the\r\n          Government would  have proven the  element of\r\n          intent.\r\n\n            When we  talk about a  defendant's -- about\r\n          the defendant's intent, we are  talking about\r\n          what he meant to do and what was in his mind.\r\n          This is difficult  to prove directly, because\r\n          there is  no way  directly to scrutinize  the\r\n          works of someone else's  mind or his state of\r\n          mind.     But  you  may  infer   .  .  .  the\r\n          defendant's   intent  from   the  surrounding\r\n          circumstances, that  is to say, you  may rely\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          on circumstantial evidence in determining the\r\n          defendant's  intent.   You  may consider  any\r\n          statement made,  act done, or omitted  by the\r\n          defendant   and   all    other   facts    and\r\n          circumstances in evidence which  indicate his\r\n          intent.\r\n\nTrial Transcript, vol. 4, at 84-87.\r\n\n          \"We  review  allegedly erroneous  jury  instructions de\r                                                                           \r\n\nnovo to determine  [whether] the instructions, taken  as a whole,\r              \r\n\nshow a tendency to  confuse or mislead the  jury with respect  to\r\n\nthe applicable principles of law.\"   Tatro v.

Definition of \"threat\"\r\n\n          Fulmer states  his objections  to the  district court's\r\n\ndefinition of threat as:\r\n\n          1) to  the absence  of an instruction  that a\r\n          threat is \"a serious  expression of intent to\r\n          inflict injury  and not merely  a vehement or\r\n          emotional  expression  of political  opinion,\r\n          hyperbole,  or  arguments against  Government\r\n          officials\";  2)  that the  instruction should\r\n          not  define a  threat  as  an  expression  of\r\n          intent to  harm or assault, since  the threat\r                                   \r\n          charged was  one to assault or  murder; 3) to\r\n          the  phrase \"reasonably  induce fear\";  4) to\r\n          the instruction that the  tone could make the\r\n          difference   between   a    threat   and    a\r\n          nonthreatening  statement;  and  5)   to  the\r\n          instruction  that  the absence  of explicitly\r\n          threatening language  or  the use  of  subtle\r\n          words  does not  make a  statement less  of a\r\n          threat.\r\n\nAppellant's Brief at 44-45.\r\n\n          Regarding Fulmer's first argument, that  an instruction\r\n\nthat  the statement  was not  \"merely . .  . arguments  against a\r\n\ngovernment  official,\" exclusion  of  this  language was  proper.\r\n\nAlthough a defendant is  entitled to an instruction on  a defense\r\n\ntheory that is  \"sufficiently supported by both  the evidence and\r\n\nthe law,\" United States v. Olmstead,  832 F.2d 642, 647 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1987), there is  no evidence in  the record to  support a  theory\r\n\nthat Fulmer  intended any statement  in this message  to register\r\n\nhis  displeasure with the manner in which Egan was conducting his\r\n\nofficial duties.   No such argument was presented  to the jury in\r\n\nFulmer's   closing  arguments.      Furthermore,  the   statutory\r\n\nrequirement  of an  intent  to impede,  intimidate, or  interfere\r\n\nwith, or to  retaliate against a federal law  enforcement officer\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n\"serves to insulate the statute from unconstitutional application\r\n\nto protect speech.\"   United  States v. Gilbert,  813 F.2d  1523,\r                                                         \r\n\n1529  (9th  Cir. 1987).    We  find that  there  is  a risk  that\r\n\nincluding  such language would serve  to confuse the  jury in its\r\n\nreview of the facts in the case and its exclusion was not error.\r\n\n          Fulmer   next   argues   that  the   district   court's\r\n\ninstruction that  a threat could mean an intent to harm creates a\r\n\nrisk that the  jury would convict Fulmer for making  a \"threat of\r\n\nnonphysical  harm, such  as  harm to  the  agent's reputation  or\r\n\ncareer.\"  Appellant's Brief at 46.  Fulmer's argument  obfuscates\r\n\nthe  actual instruction, which creates  no such risk.   The court\r\n\ninstructed  that \"[a]  threat  is a  statement that  expresses an\r\n\nintent  to inflict bodily harm on someone.\"  The district court's\r\n\nlimitation of the jury's attention  to only bodily harm  protects\r                                                            \r\n\nFulmer from the situation  against which he protests.   There was\r\n\nno error in the district court's use of the word \"harm\" to define\r\n\n\"threat.\"\r\n\n          Fulmer fails to present any further argument, let alone\r\n\ndeveloped argument, regarding the term \"reasonably induce  fear,\"\r\n\nand thus the argument is waived.  See United States v. Tracy, 989\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1279, 1286  (1st Cir. 1993) (\"It is well settled that issues\r\n\nare  deemed waived  when 'adverted  to in  a  perfunctory manner,\r\n\nunaccompanied  by  some  effort  at   developed  argumentation.'\"\r\n\n(quoting  United  States v.

There was\r\n\nnothing improper  with so  instructing the  jury, and,  given the\r\n\ndistrict court's repeated admonitions that the jury must find all\r\n\nof the elements  beyond a  reasonable doubt in  order to  convict\r\n\nFulmer,  to do  so did  not  diminish the  standard the  jury was\r\n\nrequired to apply.\r\n\n          C.

Even when we consider  the supplemental instruction\r\n\nin  the light of the  instructions in their  entirety, see United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

The instructions in  their entirety may  have had a\r\n\ntendency  to  confuse  the   jury  regarding  the  definition  of\r\n\n\"assault\" in  the context of a threat  to assault and the court's\r\n\nprovision of such conflicting instructions was error.  Because we\r\n\nare  remanding on  other grounds,  we need  not venture  into the\r\n\nweighing  necessary  to  determine   whether  any  error  in  the\r\n\ninstructions was harmless.   It  is sufficient that  we note  the\r\n\npotentially confusing nature of the instructions and  the need to\r\n\ntailor them so as to avoid any such confusion.\r\n\nIII.

Yes.\r\n\n          Q.  What was that?\r\n\n          A.   There had been a series of recent events\r\n          . . . that  involved threats  to federal  law\r\n          enforcement officials and, in fact, a bombing\r\n          of the federal building in Oklahoma.\r\n\n          Q.   And  what did  you understand  about the\r\n          bombing of  the federal building  in Oklahoma\r\n          City?\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n            THE WITNESS:  I understand that 169 federal\r\n          employees died.\r\n\n          Q.

And after the bombing in Oklahoma City of\r\n          the federal  building and  the time that  you\r\n          heard the  message, had anything  happened in\r\n          the interim that affected your interpretation\r\n          of the statement?\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n            THE WITNESS:   I think  we are  at --  yes,\r\n          there  were incidents  in Oklahoma  City that\r\n          concerned me.\r\n\n          Q.  Were those local incidents?\r\n\n          A.  There had  been a series of bomb  threats\r\n          and  evacuations  of  buildings   to  include\r\n          specific   bomb  threats  to  the  FBI,  bomb\r\n          threats to the JFK  Federal Building which is\r\n          across the street which was evacuated, and  a\r\n          bunch of other ones around the city.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n          Q.

The government referred to\r\n\nthe  bombing  in  both  its opening  statement  and  its  closing\r\n\nargument.   In the opening statement,  the prosecutor stated that\r\n\nFulmer's statement occurred\r\n\n          just  one  week   after  someone   apparently\r\n          unhappy with the  way the Federal  Government\r\n          was doing its business had killed hundreds of\r\n          federal   agents,   federal  employees,   and\r\n          civilians.    And  in  the  week  after  that\r\n          threat, came  threats near Boston  to various\r\n          federal buildings including the FBI Building,\r\n          and  the need  to  evacuate  those  buildings\r\n          based on those threats.\r\n\nId. at 46.  The government returned to this topic  in its closing\r             \r\n\nargument:\r\n\n          One  week after  the  Oklahoma City  bombing,\r\n          bomb [sic] that can turn the federal building\r\n          out  there into  rubble, killing  hundreds of\r\n          federal law enforcement agents, employees and\r\n          civilians, an  event  that so  dominated  the\r\n          airways, it  [was] almost the  only thing  in\r\n          almost  a year,  [to] take  the O.J.  Simpson\r\n          trial off the page.\r\n\nId., vol. 4, at 41.\r             \r\n\n          We review  a trial  court's on-the-spot  weighing under\r\n\nRule   403   for  abuse   of   discretion,   reversing  only   in\r\n\nextraordinarily  compelling   circumstances.    United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLewis,  40 F.3d 1325,  1339 (1st Cir. 1994).   The district court\r               \r\n\nadmitted the evidence as  \"relevant to the agent's state  of mind\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nat  the time he  received the communication  and to why  he might\r\n\nhave considered  it threatening.\"   Order  on Motions  in Limine,\r\n\nOctober  24, 1995,  at  2.   Fulmer  challenges this  assessment,\r\n\narguing that, \"[w]hile the  context of a statement may  well cast\r\n\nlight  on  its  meaning,  that  fact  does  not  permit,  without\r\n\nlimitation, any and all facts to be bootstrapped into the trial.\"\r\n\nAppellant's  Brief at  28.   The government,  on the  other hand,\r\n\nargues  that the testimony was properly admissible as evidence of\r\n\nthe context in which Fulmer's statement was made.  The government\r\n\nsuggests  that there was no  risk of prejudice  to Fulmer because\r\n\n\"there was no  suggestion of, and no  serious risk that the  jury\r\n\nwould infer,  any  link  between  Fulmer and  the  Oklahoma  City\r\n\nbombing.\"  Appellee's Brief at 29.  We agree with Fulmer.\r\n\n          The  probative value  of  this evidence  was, at  best,\r\n\nslight.    Fulmer's  \"silver  bullets\"  statement  did  not  make\r\n\nreference to Oklahoma City, bomb threats,  or the use of bombs or\r\n\nany other  type of explosive.  The statement could not be read as\r\n\nrelated to  the events that took  place in Oklahoma  City, nor to\r\n\nthe bomb  threats in Boston.   True, such evidence may  have shed\r\n\nlight on what  the person making the  statement reasonably should\r\n\nhave  foreseen.   The  danger of  unfair  prejudice, however,  is\r\n\ntremendous.  Undue focus on evidence of the Oklahoma City bombing\r\n\nand resulting  deaths,  as well  as subsequent  bomb threats  and\r\n\nevacuations, serves only to  evoke an improper emotional response\r\n\nfrom the jury, distracting the jury from careful consideration of\r\n\nthe  relevant issues  before it  and thereby  prejudicing Fulmer.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nWhile some reference  to the bombing  may have been  permissible,\r\n\nthe  scope  of the  evidence  admitted  constituted an  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n          We  turn to  consider whether  the error  was harmless.\r\n\n\"In  determining whether or  not error was  harmless, a reviewing\r\n\ncourt must assess the record as a whole to determine the probable\r\n\nimpact of the improper evidence upon the jury.\"  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMelvin,  27 F.3d 703, 708 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation and quotation\r                \r\n\nmarks omitted).  \"An error will be treated as harmless only if it\r\n\nis 'highly probable'  that the  error did not  contribute to  the\r\n\nverdict.\"  Id.

Admission of actual bullets\r                    B.   Admission of actual bullets\r\n\n          During  a pre-trial  conference, the  government sought\r\n\npermission  to  introduce bullets  obtained  from  Egan to  rebut\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nFulmer's  suggestion  that a  silver bullet  is  a solution  to a\r\n\nproblem.  The district court allowed the introduction of four .38\r\n\ncaliber  bullet  taken  from  Egan's desk  and  two  9-millimeter\r\n\nbullets taken  from his  handgun, instructing  the jury that  the\r\n\nammunition was admitted\r\n\n          to demonstrate what it is Mr. Egan had in his\r\n          desk drawer.  So far  there is no evidence in\r                                        \r\n          this  case that  the defendant  knew anything\r\n          about this exhibit at all.\r\n\nTrial Transcript, vol. 2, at 104 (emphasis added).\r\n\n          On  appeal, Fulmer  contends that the  district court's\r\n\nadmission of this ammunition  was \"grossly improper.\"  He  argues\r\n\nthat the introduction  of these bullets  could not have  assisted\r\n\nthe jury in  understanding the phrase \"silver bullets,\"  that the\r\n\ncourt's suggestion that they were  offered \"to demonstrate what .\r\n\n. . Mr. Egan had in his desk\" bears no  relevance to any issue in\r\n\nthe case, and  that the presence of  live ammunition in  the jury\r\n\nroom  only served  to inflame  the jury  and provoke  an improper\r\n\nresponse.\r\n\n          The government supports the admission of the bullets as\r\n\na means of showing  that a reasonable person would  interpret the\r\n\nterm  \"silver bullets\" to mean actual bullets that are silvery in\r\n\ncolor.    The government  suggests that  there  was no  danger of\r\n\nprejudice here because the bullets were clearly identified in the\r\n\nlimiting instruction as belonging to Egan rather than Fulmer.  We\r\n\nfind this distinction unconvincing.\r\n\n          The  probative value of actual bullets  in this case is\r\n\nminimal.  If the jury were in need of the  suggestion that actual\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nbullets  may  be silvery  in color,  a  proposition that  we find\r\n\ndubious, the government could have presented testimonial evidence\r\n\nto that  effect.  The  introduction of  ammunition was  certainly\r\n\nunnecessary.   We  also  find  that  the  risk  of  prejudice  or\r\n\nconfusion  to  the  jury  substantially  outweighed  any  minimal\r\n\nprobative value  this evidence may have had.  Notwithstanding the\r\n\ndistrict court's  admonition that the ammunition  was intended to\r\n\nshow what  was in Egan's desk, the jury may have been confused as\r\n\nto  the significance and role  of the ammunition  in this threats\r\n\ncase.4  Furthermore, more  central to the issue of  the relevancy\r\n\nof this evidence and, consequentially, to its potential to unduly\r\n\ninfluence  the jury improperly, we fail to see what possession by\r\n\nthe   victim  of  these  bullets  has  to  do  with  whether  the\r                      \r\n\ndefendant's statement constituted a threat, particularly since he\r\n\nwas unaware of their existence.\r\n\n          In light of  the entire  case and  the significance  of\r\n\nactual  bullets in evidence, we  cannot find that  this error was\r\n\nharmless.

During this testimony,  Egan stated that  he\r\n\nbelieved that  Fulmer's initial pleasantries were  \"dripping with\r\n\nsarcasm.\"  He also indicated that he believed  Fulmer's reference\r\n\nto \"misprision of a  felony\" meant that Fulmer believed  Egan had\r\n\ncommitted the crime of  misprision by failing to pursue  the case\r\n\nagainst  Fulmer's  family.    Egan  stated  that  he  interpreted\r\n\nFulmer's  use of  the term  \"silver bullets\"  as a  death threat.\r\n\nEgan  testified that he found the message \"chilling\" and \"scary,\"\r\n\nand  that  he was  \"shocked, couldn't  believe  he would  do it.\"\r\n\nTrial Transcript, vol.  2, at 97.   In response to  the question,\r\n\n\"Did you do anything different in going  home that night than you\r\n\nordinarily did,\" Egan responded that he \"[t]ook some  comfort out\r\n\nof the fact  that I could hear  an extra magazine.   There was an\r\n\nextra magazine in my car, and I took some comfort out of the fact\r\n\nthat  it was in there.\"  Fulmer's trial counsel objected that the\r\n\nstatement was  both non-responsive and should  have been excluded\r\n\nunder  Federal Rule of Evidence 403. The district court overruled\r\n\nthe objection, and Egan continued to testify:\r\n\n          Q.   Special  Agent  Egan, what  do you  mean\r\n          there was an extra magazine in your car?\r\n\n          A.

Yes.\r\n\n          Q.   -- that was in your car that night after\r\n          you heard the message?\r\n\n          A.   I could hear it rattling.  It was in the\r\n          glove box.\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nId. at 98.\r             \r\n\n          On appeal, Fulmer raises three arguments regarding this\r\n\ntestimony.  First, he  claims that such reaction evidence  is not\r\n\nrelevant to  determining  whether, under  an objective  standard,\r\n\nFulmer  made a  threat.   Second, Fulmer  objects to  portions of\r\n\nEgan's testimony  in which  he interpreted  each  portion of  the\r\n\nmessage.  Third, Fulmer claims that even if it were relevant, the\r\n\nreaction evidence was unfairly prejudicial.\r\n\n          Those  circuits that  have  considered  the issue  have\r\n\nfound evidence of the recipient's reactions to the alleged threat\r\n\nrelevant to the determination of whether the statement is a \"true\r\n\nthreat.\"    See   Malik,  16   F.3d  at  49   (\"In  making   this\r                                 \r\n\ndetermination, proof of the effect of the alleged threat upon the\r\n\naddressee is highly relevant.\");   United States v.

United States v. Goodoak, 836 F.2d 708,\r                                                            \r\n\n712  (1st Cir.  1988).   We  determined  that the  \"state-of-mind\r\n\nevidence  will be  most  relevant to  th[e] question  [of whether\r\n\nthere was an  attempt to  frighten] where the  defendant knew  or\r\n\nreasonably should have known that his actions  would produce such\r\n\na  state of mind in  the victim.\"   Id.  Thus, even  when, in the\r                                                 \r\n\nextortion context, we have  employed the legal standard advocated\r\n\nby  Fulmer -- determining a \"true threat\" from the perspective of\r\n\nthe person who makes the statement -- we have found that evidence\r\n\nof the effect of the threat upon its listener is relevant to what\r\n\na  reasonable person in the  position of the  speaker should have\r\n\nforeseen.   Therefore,  although  the proper  standard is  what a\r\n\nperson making  the statement should have  reasonably foreseen, we\r\n\nfind  that evidence of  the recipient's reactions  is relevant to\r\n\nthat  inquiry.   Because  Egan's  interpretation  of the  message\r\n\nprovided the basis for his reactions thereto, it is also relevant\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nunder  the  same  analysis  as  his  reaction  and  was  properly\r\n\nadmitted.\r\n\n          Fulmer further contends  that, even if Egan's  reaction\r\n\nis relevant,  its relevance  was substantially outweighed  by its\r\n\nprejudicial impact and it should have  been excluded.  It is well\r\n\nestablished that \"[i]f the evidence brings unwanted baggage, say,\r\n\nunfair  prejudice or a cognizable risk of confusing the jury, and\r\n\nif the baggage's weight  substantially overbalances any probative\r\n\nvalue, then  the evidence  must be  excluded.\"   United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRodr guez-Estrada,  877  F.2d  153,  155  (1st  Cir.  1989).   We\r                           \r\n\nrecognize that all  evidence mustered by the  government is meant\r\n\nto prejudice the defendant.   Rule 403  is meant only to  exclude\r\n\nthat  evidence that poses a  danger of unfair  prejudice.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Wood, 982 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                        \r\n\n          The actual recipient's reaction  to the statement shows\r\n\nthat the  recipient did perceive the  message as a threat.   This\r\n\nreaction is probative of  whether one who makes such  a statement\r\n\nmight  reasonably foresee that such a statement would be taken as\r\n\na threat.  On the other side of the equation,  any prejudice, let\r\n\nalone  unfair  prejudice,  did  not  substantially  outweigh  the\r\n\nprobative value  of  much  of  the proffered  evidence.    Egan's\r\n\nreaction  to and interpretation of the message did not infect the\r\n\nproceedings with unfair prejudice.\r\n\n          The weighing of  Egan's testimony  regarding the  extra\r\n\nmagazine  of   ammunition   \"rattling\"  around   in   his   glove\r\n\ncompartment, however, is  a closer call.  Although  this evidence\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nmay have been probative of Egan's reaction to receiving  Fulmer's\r\n\nmessage,  and may have indicated the extent of Egan's fear, there\r\n\nis a  risk that it may  also have aroused an  emotional or biased\r\n\nresponse in  the jury that  may have confused  the issues in  the\r\n\ncase.      This   risk   was  increased   by   the   government's\r\n\nmischaracterization of  Egan's testimony in its  closing, when it\r\n\nerroneously  stated that  Egan made  sure to  take home  an extra\r\n\neighteen  rounds of ammunition the night he received the message.\r\n\nFinally, the  prejudicial effect of this  testimony is compounded\r\n\nwhen we view it in light  of the contested evidence discussed  in\r\n\nsections I.A and I.B.  We find that its use could have evoked  an\r\n\nemotional response in the jury, and that this  likely prejudicial\r\n\neffect substantially outweighed any probative value.  We find the\r\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by admitting  evidence as to\r\n\nthe  ammunition  carried by  Egan on  the  night he  received the\r\n\nthreat.\r\n\n          D.   Admission  of  discussion  between  Egan  and  his\r                    D.   Admission  of  discussion  between  Egan  and  his\r\n               supervisor\r                         supervisor\r\n\n          Fulmer next contests the introduction of testimony from\r\n\nboth Egan and his supervisor, Schlabach, regarding a conversation\r\n\nthat  took place between them the morning after Egan received the\r\n\nmessage.  Egan testified  that he played the tape  for Schlabach,\r\n\nand  told Schlabach that he thought  the message was a threat and\r\n\nintended  to bring  it  to the  attention  of the  United  States\r\n\nAttorney.\r\n\n          Schlabach testified  that Egan said that  he considered\r\n\nthe message  a threat,  particularly the statement  \"[t]he silver\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nbullets are coming  for you.\"5   Schlabach stated  that Egan  was\r\n\n\"clearly upset,  concerned, agitated.  His  motions were somewhat\r\n\nexaggerated.    Typical  reaction   you  would  see  under  those\r\n\ncircumstances.\"   Trial Transcript,  vol. 2,  at 130.   Schlabach\r\n\nindicated that  Egan  intended to  discuss the  message with  the\r\n\nUnited States Attorney's office and with a squad in  the FBI unit\r\n\nresponsible for investigating threatening matters.\r\n\n          In  a pre-trial  conference, the  district court  ruled\r\n\nthat  these statements  were admissible  as either  statements of\r\n\npresent  sense impression or of then-existing state of mind.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed.  R. Evid. 803(1), 803(3).   Fulmer argues  that the district\r\n\ncourt   misinterpreted  and/or   misapplied  these   two  hearsay\r\n\nexceptions.   He  further argues  that the  introduction  of this\r\n\ntestimony was  grossly prejudicial  because it emphasized  Egan's\r\n\nconclusion  on  the  ultimate issue,  that  the  statement  was a\r\n\nthreat, and should have been excluded on those grounds.\r\n\n          We  have already  noted that  a victim's  reactions and\r\n\nactions  taken in response to  an alleged threat  are relevant to\r\n\nthe determination of whether a statement is a \"true threat.\"  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nsupra section I.C.  The statements made by Egan in the context of\r               \r\n\nthis conversation are  not offered  for the truth  of the  matter\r\n\nasserted, that the statements  were a threat and that  Egan would\r\n\nbring  the  message  to  the  attention  of   the  United  States\r\n\nAttorney's  office.   Rather,  Egan's  statements  relate to  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   The actual statement in the message was \"[t]he silver bullets\r\nare coming.\"\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nnature  and extent of the impact of Fulmer's statement upon Egan.\r\n\nThey, thus, are not hearsay.\r\n\n          Regarding  Schlabach's  testimony,  we  find  that  his\r\n\ntestimony as  to Egan's  statements are  cumulative and that  his\r\n\ncomments  regarding Egan's  demeanor  during the  course of  this\r\n\nconversation were not hearsay at all.  The district court did not\r\n\nerr in admitting this evidence.\r\n\n          E.   Admission of bad character evidence\r                    E.   Admission of bad character evidence\r\n\n          Egan testified  at trial that, at  their first meeting,\r\n\nFulmer indicated that  Boschetti and David  Fulmer \"had used  the\r\n\ncourts against  him, . .  . to  keep him away  from the  family.\"\r\n\nTrial Transcript, vol.  2, at  59-60.  Egan  also testified  that\r\n\nFulmer  told Egan  that he  had been  restrained from  seeing his\r\n\nfamily by the court.  Id. at 108-09.  Egan further testified that\r                                   \r\n\nBoschetti informed him that Fulmer's allegations were \"vengeance\"\r\n\non Fulmer's part.  Id. at 77.  Egan stated that David Fulmer told\r                                \r\n\nEgan that  \"this is the  last episode in  a continuing  series of\r\n\nhard feelings between Kevan Fulmer and his family.\"  Id. at 79.\r                                                                  \r\n\n          Fulmer   first  contends  that  these  statements  were\r\n\nhearsay.   We  agree with  the district  court's assessment  that\r\n\nthese statements were not  hearsay, but were offered to  show the\r\n\ncontext in which Fulmer's statement was made.\r\n\n          Fulmer also contends that  introduction of both his own\r\n\nstatements and those of others violates Federal Rules of Evidence\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\n404(b),6  because the  acts mentioned  had a  tendency to  show a\r\n\npropensity toward bad acts, and Rule 403, because the prejudicial\r\n\neffect  of  the evidence  substantially outweighed  its probative\r\n\nvalue.   Rule 404(b) is  intended to \"forbid  judging a person on\r\n\nthe basis of innuendo arising  from conduct [that] is  irrelevant\r\n\nto  the charges for which he  or she is presently standing trial,\r\n\ni.e., against finding  present guilt  based on  a 'bad  character\r              \r\n\nprofile.'\"  United States  v. Cortijo-D az, 875 F.2d 13,  15 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1989).   We employ a  two-pronged test to  determine whether\r\n\nevidence of a defendant's \"other acts\" is admissible.\r\n\n          First   the   evidence   must  overcome   the\r\n          \"absolute  bar\" of  Fed. R.  Evid. 404(b)  by\r\n          being specially probative of an issue in  the\r\n          case  --  such  as  intent  or  knowledge  --\r\n          without including bad character or propensity\r\n          as a necessary link in the inferential chain.\r\n          Probative value  \"must be considered in light\r\n          of the  remoteness in  time of the  other act\r\n          and the  degree of  resemblance to  the crime\r\n          charged.\"    If  the  proffered  evidence has\r\n          \"special   relevance,\"   it  is   nonetheless\r\n          inadmissible  if  its   probative  value   is\r\n          \"substantially outweighed by the  danger of,\"\r\n          inter alia, \"unfair  prejudice, confusion  of\r\n          the issues, or misleading the jury.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648-49 (1st Cir. 1996)\r                                      \r\n\n(citations omitted).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides:\r\n\n          Other crimes,  wrongs, or acts.   Evidence of\r\n          other   crimes,   wrongs  or   acts   is  not\r\n          admissible to prove the character of a person\r\n          in   order  to  show   action  in  conformity\r\n          therewith.   It  may, however,  be admissible\r\n          for other purposes, such  as proof of motive,\r\n          opportunity,  preparation,  plan,  knowledge,\r\n          identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\n          We  find  first that  the  evidence  did have  \"special\r\n\nrelevance\" to an  issue in  this case, namely,  whether a  person\r\n\nmaking  the statement  should have  reasonably foreseen  that his\r\n\nstatement, viewed in light of the factual context in which it was\r\n\nmade, was a \"true threat.\"  Whether  Fulmer's family relationship\r\n\nwas strained,  whether he  had been  restrained  from seeing  his\r\n\nfamily,  whether  he  harbored  ill feelings  toward  his  former\r\n\nfather-in-law and brother  -- all of these things  are especially\r\n\nrelevant to  understanding Fulmer's motivation in  his pursuit of\r\n\nsanctions against his former family and perhaps the extent of his\r\n\npotential disappointment at the government's failure to prosecute\r\n\nBoschetti and David Fulmer.  We find that the district court  did\r\n\nnot  abuse  its discretion  in  finding that  this  evidence fell\r\n\noutside  the prohibitions  of  Rule 404(b)  because the  evidence\r\n\ncould  go both to Fulmer's  possible motive and  to his intent to\r\n\nthreaten Egan.\r\n\n          Under  Rule  403,  the  district court  is  to  exclude\r\n\nevidence  that creates unfair prejudice or a risk of confusing or\r\n\nmisleading the  jury that substantially  outweighs any  probative\r\n\nvalue.   Id. at 649.  Certainly  evidence that Fulmer had engaged\r                      \r\n\nin  other acts  that might  show  that he  has a  tendency to  be\r\n\nviolent or  vengeful are  prejudicial.   The question is  whether\r\n\nthis  prejudice is unfair.  In a threats prosecution, the general\r\n\nfactual   context  in   which  the   statement  was   made  bears\r\n\nsignificantly on whether an ambiguous statement  could reasonably\r\n\nbe read as a  threat.  Given that the  interaction between Fulmer\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\nand Egan is  related directly to  Fulmer's relationship with  his\r\n\nfamily,   indeed  that   their   interaction   arose  from   that\r\n\nrelationship,   admitting   evidence    regarding   the    family\r\n\nrelationship was not  likely to unfairly prejudice Fulmer and any\r\n\nprejudice certainly did not substantially outweigh any  probative\r\n\nvalue.\r\n\n          The  district   court  was  careful  to  exclude  other\r\n\nevidence of Fulmer's prior acts as overly prejudicial.  Given the\r\n\ndistrict court's  careful weighing of the  \"other acts\" evidence,\r\n\nwe find no abuse of discretion here.7\r\n\n          One nuance of Fulmer's  argument remains.  While Fulmer\r\n\nconcedes  that  the context  of a  statement  is relevant  to the\r\n\ninquiry  under  the objective  standard  of a  \"true  threat,\" he\r\n\ncontends  that  the  evidence  should focus  exclusively  on  the\r\n\ncontext of  the statement itself  and on the  interaction between\r\n\nthe parties to the statement, here Fulmer and Egan.  He maintains\r\n\nthat any evidence from sources other than Fulmer are not relevant\r\n\nto the  inquiry under the objective  standard.  We  find that the\r\n\nevidence of Fulmer's other acts from sources other than Fulmer so\r\n\nclosely  mirrors  statements  from  Fulmer to  Egan  that  it  is\r\n\ncumulative of  Fulmer's  statements.    We find  that,  if  their\r\n\nadmission  was error,  that error  could not  have  been anything\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  Fulmer  argues that evidence that he had  been arrested for or\r\neven convicted of assault was  improperly placed before the jury.\r\nFulmer fails to cite where in the transcript such evidence may be\r\nfound.  Having reviewed the trial transcript as well as the trial\r\nexhibits, we  find no  indication that such  evidence was  placed\r\nbefore the jury.\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nother than harmless.

Government's admission of newspapers that depicted\r\n               murders, shootings, and threats\r                         murders, shootings, and threats\r\n\n          On  direct  examination,  Erika  Liem, a  paralegal  in\r\n\ndefense  counsel's office, testified that she  had found only one\r\n\narticle in a  search of both  the Boston Globe  and the New  York\r\n\nTimes for 1995  in which  the term \"silver  bullets\" referred  to\r\n\nactual ammunition.  She further testified that, in several of the\r\n\narticles, \"silver bullets\" referred  to a solution to  a problem.\r\n\nOn cross-examination,  the government asked Liem  whether she had\r\n\nfound  several articles,  in  which the  phrase \"silver  bullets\"\r\n\nappeared,  that depicted  murders and  shootings.   She testified\r\n\nthat she  had not  found these articles,  all of which  were from\r\n\nnewspapers  outside the Northeast and  all but one  of which were\r\n\npublished  before 1995.  The prosecutor then read a sentence from\r\n\none of the articles and asked Liem about other facts discussed in\r\n\nthe  article.  Each of  the articles was  admitted into evidence.\r\n\nOn redirect-examination, defense counsel introduced into evidence\r\n\nthe articles found in Liem's search.\r\n\n          On appeal, Fulmer contends that the government's use of\r\n\nthese  articles was  outside the scope  of the use  of the phrase\r\n\n\"silver bullets.\"  The government  responds that the evidence was\r\n\nproper rebuttal  to Fulmer's implication that  the term typically\r\n\nis used in a benign manner.  We find that,  because Fulmer opened\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nthe door  to introducing evidence from newspapers  reports of the\r\n\ndifferent  usages of the term \"silver bullets,\" the court did not\r\n\nabuse  its  discretion  by  allowing the  government  to  provide\r\n\nevidence from similar sources to rebut Fulmer's evidence.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          This appeal presents a variety of claims of error, most\r\n\nof which concern difficult  decisions made by the  district court\r\n\nthat  we are  wary  to reverse.   We  find,  however, that  three\r\n\nevidentiary rulings by the district court were errors that cannot\r\n\nbe  deemed harmless  because of the  unacceptable risk  of unfair\r\n\nprejudice they created.  Specifically,  we find that the district\r\n\ncourt  erred  in  admitting   into  evidence:    actual  bullets;\r\n\ntestimony  regarding ammunition  in Egan's  car on  the  night he\r\n\nreceived the alleged threat; and testimony regarding the Oklahoma\r\n\nCity bombing.   Therefore, Fulmer's conviction is vacated and the\r                                                            vacated\r                                                                   \r\n\ncase  remanded  for  further   proceedings  consistent  with  the\r                remanded\r                        \r\n\ndiscussion in this opinion.\r\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n",

Following a jury trial, Fulmer was convicted on November 3, 1995, of threatening Richard Egan (\"Egan\"), a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\").  Fulmer was sentenced to a term of five months imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release.  On appeal, Fulmer challenges his conviction, a number of evidentiary rulings, and the jury instructions.  We find that several improper evidentiary rulings were not harmless error, and, accordingly, we vacate Fulmer's conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the facts presented at trial, providing further details as they become relevant to the discussion.  In May 1994, the Office of the United States Trustee referred to Egan a complaint in which Fulmer alleged that his former father-in-law, Antonio Boschetti (\"Boschetti\"), and his brother, David Fulmer, had failed to disclose assets in bankruptcy and had committed pension fraud and income tax fraud.  Egan arranged to meet Fulmer in August or September of 1994.  At the meeting, Fulmer explained to Egan that he and his brother had married Boschetti's daughters, and that Fulmer had since been divorced.  Fulmer indicated that Boschetti and David Fulmer had engaged in illegal business activities.  Fulmer explained that these were \"vicious\" people and that they had \"used the courts to keep him away from his family.\"   Egan described Fulmer's demeanor as \"polite, articulate\" and \"tense.\"   Egan noted that, although he tried repeatedly to steer the conversation toward the alleged concealment of assets, Fulmer would return to his strained relationship with his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next three months, Fulmer contacted Egan \"every week or ten days.\"   Fulmer delivered documents to Egan's office and stopped by to inquire about the investigation.  Fulmer also sent letters and faxes to Egan and called Egan on the telephone, leaving messages when he did not reach Egan.  Throughout this interaction, Fulmer continued to comment on his poor relationship with his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egan interviewed Boschetti and David Fulmer, and obtained and reviewed documents related to the bankruptcy.  After Egan investigated Fulmer's allegations, Egan consulted with an Assistant United States Attorney.  In January 1995, the United States Attorney's office advised Egan that it would not prosecute the case.  Egan in turn informed Fulmer that the records did not support prosecution.  Fulmer protested the decision, but said \"good-bye\" and hung up after Egan told him there was nothing further to discuss.  Fulmer may have asked Egan whether he could provide further information to make a stronger case against Boschetti and David Fulmer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no further interactions between Egan and Fulmer until April 25, 1995, when Egan received the following voicemail message from Fulmer at approximately 5:40 p.m.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Hi Dick, Kevan Fulmer.

He stated that he intended to report the message to the United States Attorney's office.  Egan's supervisor, Robert Schlabach, testified that Egan played the message for him the next morning and told Schlabach that he believed the message was a threat and intended to take it to the United States Attorney's office.  Schlabach also testified that Egan appeared \"clearly upset, concerned, [and] agitated.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer presented two witnesses who testified to the meaning Fulmer associated with the term \"silver bullets.\"   The first, John Noonan, a lawyer and former federal investigator, testified that he had heard Fulmer use the phrase \"silver bullets\" to describe \"a clear-cut simple violation of law.\"   Noonan stated that Fulmer used the phrase to describe specific evidence, including an $8,200 check from a bankruptcy estate that never reached its intended recipient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second witness, David Tremblay, testified that he had known Fulmer for more than twenty years and that Fulmer had used the phrase \"silver bullets\" to mean \"information that he was going to provide to banks proving the illegality of some of David Fulmer's transactions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Baarlaer, a portfolio analyst for GE Capital, testified that in April 1995 Fulmer prompted Baarlaer to investigate whether GE Capital had received a check for approximately $8,300 from the Boschettis.  Baarlaer found that the check had not been received.  In April, David Fulmer sent Baarlaer a copy of the check, which showed no signs of having been canceled, endorsed, or deposited.  Sometime before April 25, 1995, Baarlaer told Fulmer about the check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I.

The government argues that the proper standard is whether an \"ordinary, reasonable recipient who is familiar with the context of the [statement] would interpret it as a threat of injury.\"  United States v. Maisonet, 484 F.2d 1356, 1358 (4th Cir.1973).  This circuit has not yet ruled on the appropriate standard regarding the nature of a \"true threat.\"   Although our sister circuits that have reviewed the standard under this and other<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> federal threat statutes agree that an objective standard is required, they disagree regarding the appropriate vantage point--what a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen or what a reasonable person receiving the statement would believe.  Compare United States v. Malik, 16 F.3d 45, 48 (2d Cir.1994) (\"The test is an objective one--namely, whether 'an ordinary, reasonable recipient who is familiar with the context of the letter would interpret it as a threat of injury.' \"  (quoting Maisonet, 484 F.2d at 1358)), and United States v. Schneider, 910 F.2d 1569, 1570 (7th Cir.1990) (\"The test for whether a statement is a threat is an objective one;  it is not what the defendant intended but whether the recipient could reasonably have regarded the defendant's statement as a threat.\") with Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d at 1265 (\"Whether a particular statement may properly be considered to be a threat is governed by an objective standard--whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault.\") and United States v. Welch, 745 F.2d 614, 619 (10th Cir.1984) (maintaining that the test is \"whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by persons hearing it as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily harm upon or to take the life of the President of the United States.\"  (internal quotations omitted)).  See also United States v. DeAndino, 958 F.2d 146, 148 (6th Cir.1992) (\"[T]he standard ... is an objective standard, i.e., would a reasonable person consider the statement to be a threat.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the appropriate standard under which a defendant may be convicted for making a threat is whether he should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.  This standard not only takes into account the factual context in which the statement was made, but also better avoids the perils that inhere in the \"reasonable-recipient standard,\" namely that the jury will consider the unique sensitivity of the recipient.  We find it particularly untenable that, were we to apply a standard guided from the perspective of the recipient, a defendant may be convicted for making an ambiguous statement that the recipient may find threatening because of events not within the knowledge of the defendant.  Therefore, we follow the approach of several circuits by holding that the appropriate focus is on what the defendant reasonably should have foreseen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer contends that the statement was at most ambiguous and could not have been a \"true threat.\"   Fulmer cites United States v.

This is so because ... where an equal or nearly equal theory of guilt and a theory of innocence is supported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.1995) (citation, internal quotation marks, and emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Fulmer properly recites the law, we find that Andjar 's wisdom does not apply here.  A reasonable jury could have found the following.  A bankruptcy trustee referred Fulmer's complaint to Egan in May 1994.  In August or September, Egan met with Fulmer, and found his demeanor regarding his family \"intense.\"   Fulmer expressed his belief that Boschetti and David Fulmer had engaged in illegal activities and further claimed that they were \"vicious\" people who had used the courts to keep Fulmer away from his family.  Thereafter, Egan had conversations with Boschetti and David Fulmer who reiterated the ill feelings Fulmer bore toward them.  Fulmer contacted Egan frequently, by letter and by telephone, leaving voicemail messages when Egan was not available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a thorough investigation, Egan and an Assistant United States Attorney determined that the evidence was insufficient to support a prosecution.  Fulmer protested, but when Egan told him there was nothing further to discuss, he said \"goodbye\" and hung up.  Egan's next interaction with Fulmer occurred three months later, when Fulmer left the voicemail message at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have also found that, although the usage of the term \"silver bullets\" varies, the phrase may be used as a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing all of these facts, and drawing all inferences in favor of the verdict, we cannot say that no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Fulmer's statement was a threat.  \"Whether a given [statement] constitutes a threat is an issue of fact for the trial jury.\"  Malik, 16 F.3d at 49.   The use of ambiguous language does not preclude a statement from being a threat.  See id.;  Schneider, 910 F.2d at 1570 (\"The threat in this case was ambiguous, but the task of interpretation was for the jury.\");  Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d at 1265 (\"The fact that a threat is subtle does not make it less of a threat.\"  (citation and quotation marks omitted));  Maisonet, 484 F.2d at 1358 (finding determination of whether statement constitutes a threat a jury question);  see also United States v. Barcley, 452 F.2d 930, 934 (8th Cir.1971) (Aldrich, J., sitting by designation, dissenting) (contending that the interpretation of an ambiguous statement is a factual question to be resolved by a jury).  While the statement on its face may be susceptible to more than one interpretation, some factors not discernable from the record, such as the tone of the defendant's voice or the credibility of the government's and Fulmer's witnesses, may legitimately lead a rational jury to find that this statement was a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer further suggests that we must strictly apply the \"true threat\" standard in order to avoid trampling on his First Amendment rights, citing Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969).  Watts involved a statement made against the president in the context of a political rally against a war.  The Court was concerned with punishing Watts' constitutionally protected political speech.  See id. at 706-08, 89 S.Ct. at 1401 (\"The language of the political arena, like the language used in labor disputes, ... is often vituperative, abusive and inexact....  Taken in context, and regarding the expressly conditional nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners, we do not see how it could be interpreted otherwise.\").  In this case, Fulmer does not argue his message was one criticizing either Egan or any other government figure.  Moreover, a true threat is unprotected by the First Amendment.  Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d at 1265.   Thus, a conviction under this statute, based on a finding that the statement was a true threat, would not violate Fulmer's constitutionally protected right to speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Intent to impede, intimidate, interfere with, or retaliate</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was entitled to infer Fulmer's intent from the circumstances surrounding the statement.  See United States v. DiMarzo, 80 F.3d 656, 661 (1st Cir.)  (\"The jury was entitled to rely upon circumstantial evidence ... to infer essential elements of the crime ....\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 259, 136 L.Ed.2d 185 (1996);  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that a showing of criminal intent \"may be made wholly on the basis of circumstantial evidence\").  Drawing all inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the government's case, we find that a rational jury could have found that Fulmer knowingly made the statement alleged to be a threat, and that he did so with the intent to \"impede, intimidate, or interfere with\" Egan in the performance of his duties, or to \"retaliate\" against him, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we find that the evidence was not insufficient as a matter of law, we come to this conclusion by viewing the properly admitted evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and by drawing all credibility determinations in favor of the verdict.  As we discuss in section III, we believe that the improperly admitted evidence was so inflammatory that it may have prompted the jury at the outset to weigh the properly admitted evidence in the government's favor.  This sort of taint we cannot condone, and justifies a reversal even where Fulmer's argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Intent to Threaten Egan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer argues that the district court erred when it failed to instruct the jury that the statute requires both the statutory intent and an intent \"to put Mr. Egan in fear of being assaulted or murdered.\"   He also claims that the district court erred when it declined to instruct the jury that \"intimidate\" means \"to say or do something that would cause a person of ordinary sensibilities to be fearful of harm to himself or another.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court set forth the jury instruction regarding the elements of the statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the defendant committed this crime, the Government must prove that the defendant knowingly threatened the officer.  The term \"knowingly,\" as used in these instructions, means that the defendant was conscious and aware of his actions, realized what he was doing, and did not act out of ignorance, mistake, or accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, what is a threat for purposes of this statute?   A threat is a statement that expresses an intent to inflict bodily harm on someone.  To be a threat, a statement must be of such a nature as can reasonably induce fear.  You must determine whether a statement was a true threat when judged in this context--in its context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among other things, you should consider whether on its face and in the circumstances in which the statement is made, a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would convey to the recipient a seriousness of purpose and the apparent prospect of execution.  Whether a particular statement is a threat is governed by an objective standard whether a reasonable person in the circumstances would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by the person to whom it is made as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This means that you should consider the statement in light of its entire factual context, including the surrounding events, reaction of the listeners, and the manner and tone in which it is made--was made.  Sometimes the tone or the way something is expressed can make a difference between a threat and something that is not a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keep in mind that the Government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  So if there is something ambiguous about the way the statement is made and you think that the statement can be reasonably interpreted under the circumstances, either as threatening or nonthreatening, the case has not been proven.  However, the fact that a threat is subtle or lacks explicitly threatening language does not make it less of a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, a threat can be made in person, in a phone call, or in a letter.  To be a threat, it's not necessary that the statement be made face to face.  The Government does not have to prove that the defendant actually intended to carry out the threat or that he was able to.  That is not a part of the definition of threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Government proves that a threat was made by the defendant, then you must decide whether the person threatened was a federal law enforcement officer and whether at the time the threat was made, the officer was engaged in the performance of his official duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find that a threat to assault or murder a federal law enforcement officer was made, then you must consider the next element of the offense.  The indictment says that the threat was made with intent to impede, intimidate, and interfere with Agent Egan while engaged in the performance of his official duties and to retaliate against him on account of the performance of those duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the indictment uses the word \"and,\" you must determine whether the defendant made the threat with the intent to impede or intimidate or interfere with the federal law enforcement officer's performance of his other official duties or whether the defendant made the threat with the intent to retaliate against the law enforcement officer because of his performance of his official duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government may satisfy this element of the offense by proving any of these intentions.  It is not necessary that the Government prove that the defendant intended all of these things.  If you find that the Government has proven any of these intentions beyond a reasonable doubt and you agree unanimously as to which one it is, then the Government would have proven the element of intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we talk about a defendant's--about the defendant's intent, we are talking about what he meant to do and what was in his mind.  This is difficult to prove directly, because there is no way directly to scrutinize the works of someone else's mind or his state of mind.  But you may infer ... the defendant's intent from the surrounding circumstances, that is to say, you may rely on circumstantial evidence in determining the defendant's intent.  You may consider any statement made, act done, or omitted by the defendant and all other facts and circumstances in evidence which indicate his intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript, vol. 4, at 84-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review allegedly erroneous jury instructions de novo to determine [whether] the instructions, taken as a whole, show a tendency to confuse or mislead the jury with respect to the applicable principles of law.\"  Tatro v.

The district court's instruction accurately reflects this standard and, thus, there was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding Fulmer's contention that the district court erred in failing to adopt Fulmer's definition of \"intimidate,\" we note that his trial counsel failed to state an objection to the definition of \"intimidate.\"   Therefore, we review only for plain error.

We believe that the meaning of the word \"intimidate\" is not outside of the juror's understanding such that the district court's failure to define the word could constitute an error that threatens to \"undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial.\"  United States v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1197 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)).

Although a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a defense theory that is \"sufficiently supported by both the evidence and the law,\" United States v. Olmstead, 832 F.2d 642, 647 (1st Cir.1987), there is no evidence in the record to support a theory that Fulmer intended any statement in this message to register his displeasure with the manner in which Egan was conducting his official duties.  No such argument was presented to the jury in Fulmer's closing arguments.  Furthermore, the statutory requirement of an intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with, or to retaliate against a federal law enforcement officer \"serves to insulate the statute from unconstitutional application to protect speech.\"  United States v. Gilbert, 813 F.2d 1523, 1529 (9th Cir.1987).  We find that there is a risk that including such language would serve to confuse the jury in its review of the facts in the case and its exclusion was not error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer next argues that the district court's instruction that a threat could mean an intent to harm creates a risk that the jury would convict Fulmer for making a \"threat of nonphysical harm, such as harm to the agent's reputation or career.\"   Appellant's Brief at 46.  Fulmer's argument obfuscates the actual instruction, which creates no such risk.  The court instructed that \"[a] threat is a statement that expresses an intent to inflict bodily harm on someone.\"   The district court's limitation of the jury's attention to only bodily harm protects Fulmer from the situation against which he protests.  There was no error in the district court's use of the word \"harm\" to define \"threat.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer fails to present any further argument, let alone developed argument, regarding the term \"reasonably induce fear,\" and thus the argument is waived.  See United States v. Tracy, 989 F.2d 1279, 1286 (1st Cir.1993) (\"It is well settled that issues are deemed waived when 'adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation.' \")  (quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer's next two contentions, that the court's \"emphasis\" on tone diminished the standard of proof, and that the court's instruction that the absence of explicitly threatening language or the use of subtle language does not rule out a finding of a true threat misstates the law, are without support.  Where a statement may be ambiguous, the entire context, including the tone used, may assist the jury in determining whether that ambiguous statement was a threat.  See Malik, 16 F.3d at 50 (\"[R]igid adherence to the literal meaning of a communication without regard to its reasonable connotations derived from its ambience would render the statute powerless against the ingenuity of threateners who can instill in the victim's mind as clear an apprehension of impending injury by an implied menace as by a literal threat.\");   see also United States v. Sciolino, 505 F.2d 586, 588 (2d Cir.1974) (\"Since the question of whether subtle conduct can amount to a threat of force depends greatly upon all of the surrounding circumstances, including not only the words used but the facial expressions and gestures of the accused, it is peculiarly one for resolution by the jury.\").  There was nothing improper with so instructing the jury, and, given the district court's repeated admonitions that the jury must find all of the elements beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict Fulmer, to do so did not diminish the standard the jury was required to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1001 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 909, 133 L.Ed.2d 841 (1996).  \"[T]he giving, or withholding, of a supplemental instruction, or the contents of it if given, are matters committed to the trial court's sound discretion.\"  United States v.

Even when we consider the supplemental instruction in the light of the instructions in their entirety, see United States v. Femia, 57 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.1995), we believe that the instructions conflicted with the court's earlier instruction that a threat expressed an intent to inflict bodily harm.  Compare Trial Transcript, vol. 4, at 84 (\"A threat is a statement that expresses an intent to inflict bodily harm on someone.\"), with id. at 114 (\"An assault may be committed by a defendant without actually touching, striking, or doing bodily harm to another.\").  The instructions in their entirety may have had a tendency to confuse the jury regarding the definition of \"assault\" in the context of a threat to assault and the court's provision of such conflicting instructions was error.  Because we are remanding on other grounds, we need not venture into the weighing necessary to determine whether any error in the instructions was harmless.  It is sufficient that we note the potentially confusing nature of the instructions and the need to tailor them so as to avoid any such confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1339 (1st Cir.1994).  The district court admitted the evidence as \"relevant to the agent's state of mind at the time he received the communication and to why he might have considered it threatening.\"   Order on Motions in Limine, October 24, 1995, at 2. Fulmer challenges this assessment, arguing that, \"[w]hile the context of a statement may well cast light on its meaning, that fact does not permit, without limitation, any and all facts to be bootstrapped into the trial.\"   Appellant's Brief at 28.  The government, on the other hand, argues that the testimony was properly admissible as evidence of the context in which Fulmer's statement was made.  The government suggests that there was no risk of prejudice to Fulmer because \"there was no suggestion of, and no serious risk that the jury would infer, any link between Fulmer and the Oklahoma City bombing.\"   Appellee's Brief at 29.  We agree with Fulmer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probative value of this evidence was, at best, slight.  Fulmer's \"silver bullets\" statement did not make reference to Oklahoma City, bomb threats, or the use of bombs or any other type of explosive.  The statement could not be read as related to the events that took place in Oklahoma City, nor to the bomb threats in Boston.  True, such evidence may have shed light on what the person making the statement reasonably should have foreseen.  The danger of unfair prejudice, however, is tremendous.  Undue focus on evidence of the Oklahoma City bombing and resulting deaths, as well as subsequent bomb threats and evacuations, serves only to evoke an improper emotional response from the jury, distracting the jury from careful consideration of the relevant issues before it and thereby prejudicing Fulmer.  While some reference to the bombing may have been permissible, the scope of the evidence admitted constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to consider whether the error was harmless.  \"In determining whether or not error was harmless, a reviewing court must assess the record as a whole to determine the probable impact of the improper evidence upon the jury.\"  United States v. Melvin, 27 F.3d 703, 708 (1st Cir.1994) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \"An error will be treated as harmless only if it is 'highly probable' that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"  Id. Considering all of the evidence submitted in this trial, including other improperly admitted evidence, see infra sections III.B. &amp; III.C, and the fact that Fulmer's statement is certainly not without ambiguity, we cannot find that reference to the Oklahoma City bombing to be harmless.  See Melvin, 27 F.3d at 708;  see also United States v. Seplveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1182 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[A] harmlessness determination demands a panoramic, case-specific inquiry considering, among other things, the centrality of the tainted material, its uniqueness, its prejudicial impact, the uses to which it was put during the trial, the relative strengths of the parties' cases, and any telltales that furnish clues to the likelihood that error affected the factfinder's resolution of a material issue.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of actual bullets</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a pre-trial conference, the government sought permission to introduce bullets obtained from Egan to rebut Fulmer's suggestion that a silver bullet is a solution to a problem.  The district court allowed the introduction of four .38 caliber bullet taken from Egan's desk and two 9-millimeter bullets taken from his handgun, instructing the jury that the ammunition was admitted</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>to demonstrate what it is Mr. Egan had in his desk drawer.  So far there is no evidence in this case that the defendant knew anything about this exhibit at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 104 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Fulmer contends that the district court's admission of this ammunition was \"grossly improper.\"   He argues that the introduction of these bullets could not have assisted the jury in understanding the phrase \"silver bullets,\" that the court's suggestion that they were offered \"to demonstrate what ... Mr. Egan had in his desk\" bears no relevance to any issue in the case, and that the presence of live ammunition in the jury room only served to inflame the jury and provoke an improper response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government supports the admission of the bullets as a means of showing that a reasonable person would interpret the term \"silver bullets\" to mean actual bullets that are silvery in color.  The government suggests that there was no danger of prejudice here because the bullets were clearly identified in the limiting instruction as belonging to Egan rather than Fulmer.  We find this distinction unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probative value of actual bullets in this case is minimal.  If the jury were in need of the suggestion that actual bullets may be silvery in color, a proposition that we find dubious, the government could have presented testimonial evidence to that effect.  The introduction of ammunition was certainly unnecessary.  We also find that the risk of prejudice or confusion to the jury substantially outweighed any minimal probative value this evidence may have had.  Notwithstanding the district court's admonition that the ammunition was intended to show what was in Egan's desk, the jury may have been confused as to the significance and role of the ammunition in this threats case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Furthermore, more central to the issue of the relevancy of this evidence and, consequentially, to its potential to unduly influence the jury improperly, we fail to see what possession by the victim of these bullets has to do with whether the defendant's statement constituted a threat, particularly since he was unaware of their existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the entire case and the significance of actual bullets in evidence, we cannot find that this error was harmless.  See supra Section III.A;  see also Melvin, 27 F.3d at 708 (\"An error will only be treated as harmless if it is 'highly probable' that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Admission of evidence regarding Agent Egan's reactions to the telephone message</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer contends that the district court made various errors in allowing Egan to testify about his reaction to Fulmer's voicemail message.  During this testimony, Egan stated that he believed that Fulmer's initial pleasantries were \"dripping with sarcasm.\"   He also indicated that he believed Fulmer's reference to \"misprision of a felony\" meant that Fulmer believed Egan had committed the crime of misprision by failing to pursue the case against Fulmer's family.  Egan stated that he interpreted Fulmer's use of the term \"silver bullets\" as a death threat.  Egan testified that he found the message \"chilling\" and \"scary,\" and that he was \"shocked, couldn't believe he would do it.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 97.  In response to the question, \"Did you do anything different in going home that night than you ordinarily did,\" Egan responded that he \"[t]ook some comfort out of the fact that I could hear an extra magazine.  There was an extra magazine in my car, and I took some comfort out of the fact that it was in there.\"   Fulmer's trial counsel objected that the statement was both nonresponsive and should have been excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  The district court overruled the objection, and Egan continued to testify:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>Q. Special Agent Egan, what do you mean there was an extra magazine in your car?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>A.

A magazine is something that holds an extra 18 rounds of ammunition--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p>A.  Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>Q. --that was in your car that night after you heard the message?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p>A. I could hear it rattling.  It was in the glove box.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Fulmer raises three arguments regarding this testimony.  First, he claims that such reaction evidence is not relevant to determining whether, under an objective standard, Fulmer made a threat.  Second, Fulmer objects to portions of Egan's testimony in which he interpreted each portion of the message.  Third, Fulmer claims that even if it were relevant, the reaction evidence was unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those circuits that have considered the issue have found evidence of the recipient's reactions to the alleged threat relevant to the determination of whether the statement is a \"true threat.\"   See Malik, 16 F.3d at 49 (\"In making this determination, proof of the effect of the alleged threat upon the addressee is highly relevant.\");  United States v. Roberts, 915 F.2d 889, 890-91 (4th Cir.1990) (noting that evidence of recipient's state of mind and actions taken in response are relevant to determination of true threat);  Schneider, 910 F.2d at 1571 (\"The fact that the victim acts as if he believed the threat is evidence that he did believe it, and the fact that he believed it is evidence that it could be believed and therefore that it is a threat.  By this chain of inference, the relevance of the [recipient's] testimony is established.\");  Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d at 1265 (\"Alleged threats should be considered in light of their entire factual context, including the surrounding events and reaction of the listeners.\");  United States v. Davis, 876 F.2d 71, 72 (9th Cir.1989) (\"A recipient's state of mind, as well as his actions taken in response to the letter, are highly relevant in establishing ... whether the letter could reasonably be read as containing a threat of injury.\");  Maisonet, 484 F.2d at 1358 (\"Whether a letter that is susceptible of more than one meaning--one of which is a threat of physical injury--constitutes a threat must be determined in the light of the context in which it was written.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in the context of an attempted extortion case, we have held the recipient's reactions to a threat to be relevant and admissible.  United States v. Goodoak, 836 F.2d 708, 712 (1st Cir.1988).  We determined that the \"state-of-mind evidence will be most relevant to th[e] question [of whether there was an attempt to frighten] where the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that his actions would produce such a state of mind in the victim.\"  Id. Thus, even when, in the extortion context, we have employed the legal standard advocated by Fulmer--determining a \"true threat\" from the perspective of the person who makes the statement--we have found that evidence of the effect of the threat upon its listener is relevant to what a reasonable person in the position of the speaker should have foreseen.  Therefore, although the proper standard is what a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen, we find that evidence of the recipient's reactions is relevant to that inquiry.  Because Egan's interpretation of the message provided the basis for his reactions thereto, it is also relevant under the same analysis as his reaction and was properly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer further contends that, even if Egan's reaction is relevant, its relevance was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact and it should have been excluded.  It is well established that \"[i]f the evidence brings unwanted baggage, say, unfair prejudice or a cognizable risk of confusing the jury, and if the baggage's weight substantially overbalances any probative value, then the evidence must be excluded.\"  United States v. Rodrguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 155 (1st Cir.1989).  We recognize that all evidence mustered by the government is meant to prejudice the defendant.  Rule 403 is meant only to exclude that evidence that poses a danger of unfair prejudice.  United States v. Wood, 982 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual recipient's reaction to the statement shows that the recipient did perceive the message as a threat.  This reaction is probative of whether one who makes such a statement might reasonably foresee that such a statement would be taken as a threat.  On the other side of the equation, any prejudice, let alone unfair prejudice, did not substantially outweigh the probative value of much of the proffered evidence.  Egan's reaction to and interpretation of the message did not infect the proceedings with unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weighing of Egan's testimony regarding the extra magazine of ammunition \"rattling\" around in his glove compartment, however, is a closer call.  Although this evidence may have been probative of Egan's reaction to receiving Fulmer's message, and may have indicated the extent of Egan's fear, there is a risk that it may also have aroused an emotional or biased response in the jury that may have confused the issues in the case.  This risk was increased by the government's mischaracterization of Egan's testimony in its closing, when it erroneously stated that Egan made sure to take home an extra eighteen rounds of ammunition the night he received the message.  Finally, the prejudicial effect of this testimony is compounded when we view it in light of the contested evidence discussed in sections III.A and III.B. We find that its use could have evoked an emotional response in the jury, and that this likely prejudicial effect substantially outweighed any probative value.  We find the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence as to the ammunition carried by Egan on the night he received the threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Admission of discussion between Egan and his supervisor</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer next contests the introduction of testimony from both Egan and his supervisor, Schlabach, regarding a conversation that took place between them the morning after Egan received the message.  Egan testified that he played the tape for Schlabach, and told Schlabach that he thought the message was a threat and intended to bring it to the attention of the United States Attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Schlabach testified that Egan said that he considered the message a threat, particularly the statement \"[t]he silver bullets are coming for you.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Schlabach stated that Egan was \"clearly upset, concerned, agitated.  His motions were somewhat exaggerated.  Typical reaction you would see under those circumstances.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 130.  Schlabach indicated that Egan intended to discuss the message with the United States Attorney's office and with a squad in the FBI unit responsible for investigating threatening matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pre-trial conference, the district court ruled that these statements were admissible as either statements of present sense impression or of then-existing state of mind.  See Fed.R.Evid. 803(1), 803(3).  Fulmer argues that the district court misinterpreted and/or misapplied these two hearsay exceptions.  He further argues that the introduction of this testimony was grossly prejudicial because it emphasized Egan's conclusion on the ultimate issue, that the statement was a threat, and should have been excluded on those grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already noted that a victim's reactions and actions taken in response to an alleged threat are relevant to the determination of whether a statement is a \"true threat.\"   See supra section III.C. The statements made by Egan in the context of this conversation are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, that the statements were a threat and that Egan would bring the message to the attention of the United States Attorney's office.  Rather, Egan's statements relate to the nature and extent of the impact of Fulmer's statement upon Egan.  They, thus, are not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding Schlabach's testimony, we find that his testimony as to Egan's statements is cumulative and that his comments regarding Egan's demeanor during the course of this conversation were not hearsay at all.  The district court did not err in admitting this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Admission of bad character evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egan testified at trial that, at their first meeting, Fulmer indicated that Boschetti and David Fulmer \"had used the courts against him, ... to keep him away from the family.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 59-60.  Egan also testified that Fulmer told Egan that he had been restrained from seeing his family by the court.  Id. at 108-09.   Egan further testified that Boschetti informed him that Fulmer's allegations were \"vengeance\" on Fulmer's part.  Id. at 77.   Egan stated that David Fulmer told Egan that \"this is the last episode in a continuing series of hard feelings between Kevan Fulmer and his family.\"  Id. at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer first contends that these statements were hearsay.  We agree with the district court's assessment that these statements were not hearsay, but were offered to show the context in which Fulmer's statement was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer also contends that introduction of both his own statements and those of others violates Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> because the acts mentioned had a tendency to show a propensity toward bad acts, and Rule 403, because the prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially outweighed its probative value.  Rule 404(b) is intended to \"forbid judging a person on the basis of innuendo arising from conduct [that] is irrelevant to the charges for which he or she is presently standing trial, i.e., against finding present guilt based on a 'bad character profile.' \"  United States v. Cortijo-Daz, 875 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir.1989).  We employ a two-pronged test to determine whether evidence of a defendant's \"other acts\" is admissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p>First the evidence must overcome the \"absolute bar\" of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) by being specially probative of an issue in the case--such as intent or knowledge--without including bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.  Probative value \"must be considered in light of the remoteness in time of the other act and the degree of resemblance to the crime charged.\"   If the proffered evidence has \"special relevance,\" it is nonetheless inadmissible if its probative value is \"substantially outweighed by the danger of,\" inter alia, \"unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648-49 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find first that the evidence did have \"special relevance\" to an issue in this case, namely, whether a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen that his statement, viewed in light of the factual context in which it was made, was a \"true threat.\"   Whether Fulmer's family relationship was strained, whether he had been restrained from seeing his family, whether he harbored ill feelings toward his former fatherin-law and brother--all of these things are especially relevant to understanding Fulmer's motivation in his pursuit of sanctions against his former family and perhaps the extent of his potential disappointment at the government's failure to prosecute Boschetti and David Fulmer.  We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this evidence fell outside the prohibitions of Rule 404(b) because the evidence could go both to Fulmer's possible motive and to his intent to threaten Egan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 403, the district court is to exclude evidence that creates unfair prejudice or a risk of confusing or misleading the jury that substantially outweighs any probative value.  Id. at 649.   Certainly evidence that Fulmer had engaged in other acts that might show that he has a tendency to be violent or vengeful are prejudicial.  The question is whether this prejudice is unfair.  In a threats prosecution, the general factual context in which the statement was made bears significantly on whether an ambiguous statement could reasonably be read as a threat.  Given that the interaction between Fulmer and Egan is related directly to Fulmer's relationship with his family, indeed that their interaction arose from that relationship, admitting evidence regarding the family relationship was not likely to unfairly prejudice Fulmer and any prejudice certainly did not substantially outweigh any probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was careful to exclude other evidence of Fulmer's prior acts as overly prejudicial.  Given the district court's careful weighing of the \"other acts\" evidence, we find no abuse of discretion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One nuance of Fulmer's argument remains.  While Fulmer concedes that the context of a statement is relevant to the inquiry under the objective standard of a \"true threat,\" he contends that the evidence should focus exclusively on the context of the statement itself and on the interaction between the parties to the statement, here Fulmer and Egan.  He maintains that any evidence from sources other than Fulmer are not relevant to the inquiry under the objective standard.  We find that the evidence of Fulmer's other acts from sources other than Fulmer so closely mirrors statements from Fulmer to Egan that it is cumulative of Fulmer's statements.

She further testified that, in several of the articles, \"silver bullets\" referred to a solution to a problem.  On cross-examination, the government asked Liem whether she had found several articles, in which the phrase \"silver bullets\" appeared, that depicted murders and shootings.  She testified that she had not found these articles, all of which were from newspapers outside the Northeast and all but one of which were published before 1995.  The prosecutor then read a sentence from one of the articles and asked Liem about other facts discussed in the article.  Each of the articles was admitted into evidence.

We find that, because Fulmer opened the door to introducing evidence from newspapers reports of the different usages of the term \"silver bullets,\" the court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the government to provide evidence from similar sources to rebut Fulmer's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents a variety of claims of error, most of which concern difficult decisions made by the district court that we are wary to reverse.  We find, however, that three evidentiary rulings by the district court were errors that cannot be deemed harmless because of the unacceptable risk of unfair prejudice they created.  Specifically, we find that the district court erred in admitting into evidence:  actual bullets;  testimony regarding ammunition in Egan's car on the night he received the alleged threat;  and testimony regarding the Oklahoma City bombing.  Therefore, Fulmer's conviction is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with the discussion in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 871 provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Threats against President and successors to the Presidency</p>\n        <p>(a) Whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, the President-elect, the Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President of the United States, or the Vice President-elect, or knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President, President-elect, Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President, or Vice President-elect, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 875 provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Interstate communications</p>\n        <p>(c) Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 876 provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Mailing threatening communication</p>\n        <p>Whoever knowingly so deposits or causes to be delivered as aforesaid, any communication with or without a name or designating mark subscribed thereto, addressed to any other person and containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B) states:</p>\n        <p>(a)(1) Whoever--</p>\n        <p>(B) threatens to assault, kidnap, or murder, a United States official, judge, a Federal law enforcement officer, or an official whose killing would be a crime under such section,</p>\n        <p>with intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with such official, judge, or law enforcement officer while engaged in the performance of official duties, or with intent to retaliate against such person on account of the performance of official duties during the term of service of such person, shall be punished....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Federal Rule of Evidence 403 states:</p>\n        <p>Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note as well that the limiting instruction carried the risk of confusing the jury by suggesting that evidence that Fulmer knew of the bullets in Egan's drawer would be forthcoming</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The actual statement in the message was \"[t]he silver bullets are coming.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides:</p>\n        <p>Other crimes, wrongs, or acts.

Following a jury trial, Fulmer was convicted on November 3, 1995, of threatening Richard Egan (\"Egan\"), a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\").  Fulmer was sentenced to a term of five months imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release.  On appeal, Fulmer challenges his conviction, a number of evidentiary rulings, and the jury instructions.  We find that several improper evidentiary rulings were not harmless error, and, accordingly, we vacate Fulmer's conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the facts presented at trial, providing further details as they become relevant to the discussion.  In May 1994, the Office of the United States Trustee referred to Egan a complaint in which Fulmer alleged that his former father-in-law, Antonio Boschetti (\"Boschetti\"), and his brother, David Fulmer, had failed to disclose assets in bankruptcy and had committed pension fraud and income tax fraud.  Egan arranged to meet Fulmer in August or September of 1994.  At the meeting, Fulmer explained to Egan that he and his brother had married Boschetti's daughters, and that Fulmer had since been divorced.  Fulmer indicated that Boschetti and David Fulmer had engaged in illegal business activities.  Fulmer explained that these were \"vicious\" people and that they had \"used the courts to keep him away from his family.\"   Egan described Fulmer's demeanor as \"polite, articulate\" and \"tense.\"   Egan noted that, although he tried repeatedly to steer the conversation toward the alleged concealment of assets, Fulmer would return to his strained relationship with his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next three months, Fulmer contacted Egan \"every week or ten days.\"   Fulmer delivered documents to Egan's office and stopped by to inquire about the investigation.  Fulmer also sent letters and faxes to Egan and called Egan on the telephone, leaving messages when he did not reach Egan.  Throughout this interaction, Fulmer continued to comment on his poor relationship with his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egan interviewed Boschetti and David Fulmer, and obtained and reviewed documents related to the bankruptcy.  After Egan investigated Fulmer's allegations, Egan consulted with an Assistant United States Attorney.  In January 1995, the United States Attorney's office advised Egan that it would not prosecute the case.  Egan in turn informed Fulmer that the records did not support prosecution.  Fulmer protested the decision, but said \"good-bye\" and hung up after Egan told him there was nothing further to discuss.  Fulmer may have asked Egan whether he could provide further information to make a stronger case against Boschetti and David Fulmer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no further interactions between Egan and Fulmer until April 25, 1995, when Egan received the following voicemail message from Fulmer at approximately 5:40 p.m.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Hi Dick, Kevan Fulmer.  Hope things are well, hope you had an enjoyable Easter and all the other holidays since I've spoken with you last.  I want you to look something up.  It's known as misprision.  Just think of it in terms of misprision of a felony.  Hope all is well.  The silver bullets are coming.  I'll talk to you.  Enjoy the intriguing unraveling of what I said to you.  Talk to you, Dick.

Take care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Fulmer's trial, Egan testified that he was \"shocked\" by the message, which he found \"chilling\" and \"scary.\"   He testified that he had never heard the term \"silver bullets\" before and believed that the term indicated a threat.  He stated that he intended to report the message to the United States Attorney's office.  Egan's supervisor, Robert Schlabach, testified that Egan played the message for him the next morning and told Schlabach that he believed the message was a threat and intended to take it to the United States Attorney's office.  Schlabach also testified that Egan appeared \"clearly upset, concerned, [and] agitated.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer presented two witnesses who testified to the meaning Fulmer associated with the term \"silver bullets.\"   The first, John Noonan, a lawyer and former federal investigator, testified that he had heard Fulmer use the phrase \"silver bullets\" to describe \"a clear-cut simple violation of law.\"   Noonan stated that Fulmer used the phrase to describe specific evidence, including an $8,200 check from a bankruptcy estate that never reached its intended recipient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second witness, David Tremblay, testified that he had known Fulmer for more than twenty years and that Fulmer had used the phrase \"silver bullets\" to mean \"information that he was going to provide to banks proving the illegality of some of David Fulmer's transactions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Baarlaer, a portfolio analyst for GE Capital, testified that in April 1995 Fulmer prompted Baarlaer to investigate whether GE Capital had received a check for approximately $8,300 from the Boschettis.  Baarlaer found that the check had not been received.  In April, David Fulmer sent Baarlaer a copy of the check, which showed no signs of having been canceled, endorsed, or deposited.  Sometime before April 25, 1995, Baarlaer told Fulmer about the check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I.

This circuit has not yet ruled on the appropriate standard regarding the nature of a \"true threat.\"   Although our sister circuits that have reviewed the standard under this and other<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> federal threat statutes agree that an objective standard is required, they disagree regarding the appropriate vantage point--what a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen or what a reasonable person receiving the statement would believe.

This standard not only takes into account the factual context in which the statement was made, but also better avoids the perils that inhere in the \"reasonable-recipient standard,\" namely that the jury will consider the unique sensitivity of the recipient.  We find it particularly untenable that, were we to apply a standard guided from the perspective of the recipient, a defendant may be convicted for making an ambiguous statement that the recipient may find threatening because of events not within the knowledge of the defendant.  Therefore, we follow the approach of several circuits by holding that the appropriate focus is on what the defendant reasonably should have foreseen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer contends that the statement was at most ambiguous and could not have been a \"true threat.\"   Fulmer cites United States v.

A reasonable jury could have found the following.  A bankruptcy trustee referred Fulmer's complaint to Egan in May 1994.  In August or September, Egan met with Fulmer, and found his demeanor regarding his family \"intense.\"   Fulmer expressed his belief that Boschetti and David Fulmer had engaged in illegal activities and further claimed that they were \"vicious\" people who had used the courts to keep Fulmer away from his family.  Thereafter, Egan had conversations with Boschetti and David Fulmer who reiterated the ill feelings Fulmer bore toward them.  Fulmer contacted Egan frequently, by letter and by telephone, leaving voicemail messages when Egan was not available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a thorough investigation, Egan and an Assistant United States Attorney determined that the evidence was insufficient to support a prosecution.  Fulmer protested, but when Egan told him there was nothing further to discuss, he said \"goodbye\" and hung up.  Egan's next interaction with Fulmer occurred three months later, when Fulmer left the voicemail message at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have also found that, although the usage of the term \"silver bullets\" varies, the phrase may be used as a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing all of these facts, and drawing all inferences in favor of the verdict, we cannot say that no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Fulmer's statement was a threat.  \"Whether a given [statement] constitutes a threat is an issue of fact for the trial jury.\"  Malik, 16 F.3d at 49.   The use of ambiguous language does not preclude a statement from being a threat.  See id.;  Schneider, 910 F.2d at 1570 (\"The threat in this case was ambiguous, but the task of interpretation was for the jury.\");  Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d at 1265 (\"The fact that a threat is subtle does not make it less of a threat.\"  (citation and quotation marks omitted));  Maisonet, 484 F.2d at 1358 (finding determination of whether statement constitutes a threat a jury question);  see also United States v.

While the statement on its face may be susceptible to more than one interpretation, some factors not discernable from the record, such as the tone of the defendant's voice or the credibility of the government's and Fulmer's witnesses, may legitimately lead a rational jury to find that this statement was a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer further suggests that we must strictly apply the \"true threat\" standard in order to avoid trampling on his First Amendment rights, citing Watts v.

In this case, Fulmer does not argue his message was one criticizing either Egan or any other government figure.  Moreover, a true threat is unprotected by the First Amendment.  Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d at 1265.

Drawing all inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the government's case, we find that a rational jury could have found that Fulmer knowingly made the statement alleged to be a threat, and that he did so with the intent to \"impede, intimidate, or interfere with\" Egan in the performance of his duties, or to \"retaliate\" against him, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we find that the evidence was not insufficient as a matter of law, we come to this conclusion by viewing the properly admitted evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and by drawing all credibility determinations in favor of the verdict.  As we discuss in section III, we believe that the improperly admitted evidence was so inflammatory that it may have prompted the jury at the outset to weigh the properly admitted evidence in the government's favor.  This sort of taint we cannot condone, and justifies a reversal even where Fulmer's argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Intent to Threaten Egan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer argues that the district court erred when it failed to instruct the jury that the statute requires both the statutory intent and an intent \"to put Mr. Egan in fear of being assaulted or murdered.\"   He also claims that the district court erred when it declined to instruct the jury that \"intimidate\" means \"to say or do something that would cause a person of ordinary sensibilities to be fearful of harm to himself or another.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court set forth the jury instruction regarding the elements of the statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the defendant committed this crime, the Government must prove that the defendant knowingly threatened the officer.  The term \"knowingly,\" as used in these instructions, means that the defendant was conscious and aware of his actions, realized what he was doing, and did not act out of ignorance, mistake, or accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, what is a threat for purposes of this statute?   A threat is a statement that expresses an intent to inflict bodily harm on someone.  To be a threat, a statement must be of such a nature as can reasonably induce fear.  You must determine whether a statement was a true threat when judged in this context--in its context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among other things, you should consider whether on its face and in the circumstances in which the statement is made, a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would convey to the recipient a seriousness of purpose and the apparent prospect of execution.  Whether a particular statement is a threat is governed by an objective standard whether a reasonable person in the circumstances would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by the person to whom it is made as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This means that you should consider the statement in light of its entire factual context, including the surrounding events, reaction of the listeners, and the manner and tone in which it is made--was made.  Sometimes the tone or the way something is expressed can make a difference between a threat and something that is not a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keep in mind that the Government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  So if there is something ambiguous about the way the statement is made and you think that the statement can be reasonably interpreted under the circumstances, either as threatening or nonthreatening, the case has not been proven.  However, the fact that a threat is subtle or lacks explicitly threatening language does not make it less of a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, a threat can be made in person, in a phone call, or in a letter.  To be a threat, it's not necessary that the statement be made face to face.  The Government does not have to prove that the defendant actually intended to carry out the threat or that he was able to.  That is not a part of the definition of threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Government proves that a threat was made by the defendant, then you must decide whether the person threatened was a federal law enforcement officer and whether at the time the threat was made, the officer was engaged in the performance of his official duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find that a threat to assault or murder a federal law enforcement officer was made, then you must consider the next element of the offense.  The indictment says that the threat was made with intent to impede, intimidate, and interfere with Agent Egan while engaged in the performance of his official duties and to retaliate against him on account of the performance of those duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the indictment uses the word \"and,\" you must determine whether the defendant made the threat with the intent to impede or intimidate or interfere with the federal law enforcement officer's performance of his other official duties or whether the defendant made the threat with the intent to retaliate against the law enforcement officer because of his performance of his official duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government may satisfy this element of the offense by proving any of these intentions.  It is not necessary that the Government prove that the defendant intended all of these things.  If you find that the Government has proven any of these intentions beyond a reasonable doubt and you agree unanimously as to which one it is, then the Government would have proven the element of intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we talk about a defendant's--about the defendant's intent, we are talking about what he meant to do and what was in his mind.  This is difficult to prove directly, because there is no way directly to scrutinize the works of someone else's mind or his state of mind.  But you may infer ... the defendant's intent from the surrounding circumstances, that is to say, you may rely on circumstantial evidence in determining the defendant's intent.  You may consider any statement made, act done, or omitted by the defendant and all other facts and circumstances in evidence which indicate his intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript, vol. 4, at 84-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review allegedly erroneous jury instructions de novo to determine [whether] the instructions, taken as a whole, show a tendency to confuse or mislead the jury with respect to the applicable principles of law.\"  Tatro v.

No such argument was presented to the jury in Fulmer's closing arguments.  Furthermore, the statutory requirement of an intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with, or to retaliate against a federal law enforcement officer \"serves to insulate the statute from unconstitutional application to protect speech.\"  United States v.

Fulmer's argument obfuscates the actual instruction, which creates no such risk.  The court instructed that \"[a] threat is a statement that expresses an intent to inflict bodily harm on someone.\"   The district court's limitation of the jury's attention to only bodily harm protects Fulmer from the situation against which he protests.  There was no error in the district court's use of the word \"harm\" to define \"threat.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer fails to present any further argument, let alone developed argument, regarding the term \"reasonably induce fear,\" and thus the argument is waived.

Where a statement may be ambiguous, the entire context, including the tone used, may assist the jury in determining whether that ambiguous statement was a threat.  See Malik, 16 F.3d at 50 (\"[R]igid adherence to the literal meaning of a communication without regard to its reasonable connotations derived from its ambience would render the statute powerless against the ingenuity of threateners who can instill in the victim's mind as clear an apprehension of impending injury by an implied menace as by a literal threat.\");   see also United States v.

Compare Trial Transcript, vol. 4, at 84 (\"A threat is a statement that expresses an intent to inflict bodily harm on someone.\"), with id. at 114 (\"An assault may be committed by a defendant without actually touching, striking, or doing bodily harm to another.\").  The instructions in their entirety may have had a tendency to confuse the jury regarding the definition of \"assault\" in the context of a threat to assault and the court's provision of such conflicting instructions was error.  Because we are remanding on other grounds, we need not venture into the weighing necessary to determine whether any error in the instructions was harmless.  It is sufficient that we note the potentially confusing nature of the instructions and the need to tailor them so as to avoid any such confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

The district court admitted the evidence as \"relevant to the agent's state of mind at the time he received the communication and to why he might have considered it threatening.\"   Order on Motions in Limine, October 24, 1995, at 2. Fulmer challenges this assessment, arguing that, \"[w]hile the context of a statement may well cast light on its meaning, that fact does not permit, without limitation, any and all facts to be bootstrapped into the trial.\"   Appellant's Brief at 28.  The government, on the other hand, argues that the testimony was properly admissible as evidence of the context in which Fulmer's statement was made.  The government suggests that there was no risk of prejudice to Fulmer because \"there was no suggestion of, and no serious risk that the jury would infer, any link between Fulmer and the Oklahoma City bombing.\"   Appellee's Brief at 29.  We agree with Fulmer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probative value of this evidence was, at best, slight.  Fulmer's \"silver bullets\" statement did not make reference to Oklahoma City, bomb threats, or the use of bombs or any other type of explosive.  The statement could not be read as related to the events that took place in Oklahoma City, nor to the bomb threats in Boston.  True, such evidence may have shed light on what the person making the statement reasonably should have foreseen.  The danger of unfair prejudice, however, is tremendous.  Undue focus on evidence of the Oklahoma City bombing and resulting deaths, as well as subsequent bomb threats and evacuations, serves only to evoke an improper emotional response from the jury, distracting the jury from careful consideration of the relevant issues before it and thereby prejudicing Fulmer.  While some reference to the bombing may have been permissible, the scope of the evidence admitted constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to consider whether the error was harmless.  \"In determining whether or not error was harmless, a reviewing court must assess the record as a whole to determine the probable impact of the improper evidence upon the jury.\"  United States v.

Considering all of the evidence submitted in this trial, including other improperly admitted evidence, see infra sections III.B. &amp; III.C, and the fact that Fulmer's statement is certainly not without ambiguity, we cannot find that reference to the Oklahoma City bombing to be harmless.  See Melvin, 27 F.3d at 708;  see also United States v.

Admission of actual bullets</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a pre-trial conference, the government sought permission to introduce bullets obtained from Egan to rebut Fulmer's suggestion that a silver bullet is a solution to a problem.  The district court allowed the introduction of four .38 caliber bullet taken from Egan's desk and two 9-millimeter bullets taken from his handgun, instructing the jury that the ammunition was admitted</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>to demonstrate what it is Mr. Egan had in his desk drawer.  So far there is no evidence in this case that the defendant knew anything about this exhibit at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 104 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Fulmer contends that the district court's admission of this ammunition was \"grossly improper.\"   He argues that the introduction of these bullets could not have assisted the jury in understanding the phrase \"silver bullets,\" that the court's suggestion that they were offered \"to demonstrate what ... Mr. Egan had in his desk\" bears no relevance to any issue in the case, and that the presence of live ammunition in the jury room only served to inflame the jury and provoke an improper response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government supports the admission of the bullets as a means of showing that a reasonable person would interpret the term \"silver bullets\" to mean actual bullets that are silvery in color.  The government suggests that there was no danger of prejudice here because the bullets were clearly identified in the limiting instruction as belonging to Egan rather than Fulmer.  We find this distinction unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probative value of actual bullets in this case is minimal.  If the jury were in need of the suggestion that actual bullets may be silvery in color, a proposition that we find dubious, the government could have presented testimonial evidence to that effect.  The introduction of ammunition was certainly unnecessary.  We also find that the risk of prejudice or confusion to the jury substantially outweighed any minimal probative value this evidence may have had.  Notwithstanding the district court's admonition that the ammunition was intended to show what was in Egan's desk, the jury may have been confused as to the significance and role of the ammunition in this threats case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Furthermore, more central to the issue of the relevancy of this evidence and, consequentially, to its potential to unduly influence the jury improperly, we fail to see what possession by the victim of these bullets has to do with whether the defendant's statement constituted a threat, particularly since he was unaware of their existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the entire case and the significance of actual bullets in evidence, we cannot find that this error was harmless.  See supra Section III.A;  see also Melvin, 27 F.3d at 708 (\"An error will only be treated as harmless if it is 'highly probable' that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Admission of evidence regarding Agent Egan's reactions to the telephone message</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer contends that the district court made various errors in allowing Egan to testify about his reaction to Fulmer's voicemail message.  During this testimony, Egan stated that he believed that Fulmer's initial pleasantries were \"dripping with sarcasm.\"   He also indicated that he believed Fulmer's reference to \"misprision of a felony\" meant that Fulmer believed Egan had committed the crime of misprision by failing to pursue the case against Fulmer's family.  Egan stated that he interpreted Fulmer's use of the term \"silver bullets\" as a death threat.  Egan testified that he found the message \"chilling\" and \"scary,\" and that he was \"shocked, couldn't believe he would do it.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 97.  In response to the question, \"Did you do anything different in going home that night than you ordinarily did,\" Egan responded that he \"[t]ook some comfort out of the fact that I could hear an extra magazine.  There was an extra magazine in my car, and I took some comfort out of the fact that it was in there.\"   Fulmer's trial counsel objected that the statement was both nonresponsive and should have been excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  The district court overruled the objection, and Egan continued to testify:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>Q.

First, he claims that such reaction evidence is not relevant to determining whether, under an objective standard, Fulmer made a threat.  Second, Fulmer objects to portions of Egan's testimony in which he interpreted each portion of the message.  Third, Fulmer claims that even if it were relevant, the reaction evidence was unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those circuits that have considered the issue have found evidence of the recipient's reactions to the alleged threat relevant to the determination of whether the statement is a \"true threat.\"   See Malik, 16 F.3d at 49 (\"In making this determination, proof of the effect of the alleged threat upon the addressee is highly relevant.\");  United States v. Roberts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548945\"><a href=\"/opinion/548945/united-states-v-thomas-lindley-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span>, 890-91 (4th Cir.1990) (noting that evidence of recipient's state of mind and actions taken in response are relevant to determination of true threat);  Schneider, 910 F.2d at 1571 (\"The fact that the victim acts as if he believed the threat is evidence that he did believe it, and the fact that he believed it is evidence that it could be believed and therefore that it is a threat.  By this chain of inference, the relevance of the [recipient's] testimony is established.\");  Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d at 1265 (\"Alleged threats should be considered in light of their entire factual context, including the surrounding events and reaction of the listeners.\");  United States v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524154\"><a href=\"/opinion/524154/united-states-v-lutrell-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 72 (9th Cir.1989) (\"A recipient's state of mind, as well as his actions taken in response to the letter, are highly relevant in establishing ... whether the letter could reasonably be read as containing a threat of injury.\");  Maisonet, 484 F.2d at 1358 (\"Whether a letter that is susceptible of more than one meaning--one of which is a threat of physical injury--constitutes a threat must be determined in the light of the context in which it was written.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in the context of an attempted extortion case, we have held the recipient's reactions to a threat to be relevant and admissible.  United States v. Goodoak, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499730\"><a href=\"/opinion/499730/united-states-v-robert-d-goodoak/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 712 (1st Cir.1988).  We determined that the \"state-of-mind evidence will be most relevant to th[e] question [of whether there was an attempt to frighten] where the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that his actions would produce such a state of mind in the victim.\"  Id. Thus, even when, in the extortion context, we have employed the legal standard advocated by Fulmer--determining a \"true threat\" from the perspective of the person who makes the statement--we have found that evidence of the effect of the threat upon its listener is relevant to what a reasonable person in the position of the speaker should have foreseen.  Therefore, although the proper standard is what a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen, we find that evidence of the recipient's reactions is relevant to that inquiry.  Because Egan's interpretation of the message provided the basis for his reactions thereto, it is also relevant under the same analysis as his reaction and was properly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer further contends that, even if Egan's reaction is relevant, its relevance was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact and it should have been excluded.  It is well established that \"[i]f the evidence brings unwanted baggage, say, unfair prejudice or a cognizable risk of confusing the jury, and if the baggage's weight substantially overbalances any probative value, then the evidence must be excluded.\"  United States v. Rodrguez-Estrada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.1989).  We recognize that all evidence mustered by the government is meant to prejudice the defendant.  Rule 403 is meant only to exclude that evidence that poses a danger of unfair prejudice.  United States v. Wood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597130\"><a href=\"/opinion/597130/united-states-v-george-f-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual recipient's reaction to the statement shows that the recipient did perceive the message as a threat.  This reaction is probative of whether one who makes such a statement might reasonably foresee that such a statement would be taken as a threat.  On the other side of the equation, any prejudice, let alone unfair prejudice, did not substantially outweigh the probative value of much of the proffered evidence.  Egan's reaction to and interpretation of the message did not infect the proceedings with unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weighing of Egan's testimony regarding the extra magazine of ammunition \"rattling\" around in his glove compartment, however, is a closer call.  Although this evidence may have been probative of Egan's reaction to receiving Fulmer's message, and may have indicated the extent of Egan's fear, there is a risk that it may also have aroused an emotional or biased response in the jury that may have confused the issues in the case.  This risk was increased by the government's mischaracterization of Egan's testimony in its closing, when it erroneously stated that Egan made sure to take home an extra eighteen rounds of ammunition the night he received the message.  Finally, the prejudicial effect of this testimony is compounded when we view it in light of the contested evidence discussed in sections III.A and III.B. We find that its use could have evoked an emotional response in the jury, and that this likely prejudicial effect substantially outweighed any probative value.  We find the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence as to the ammunition carried by Egan on the night he received the threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

Egan testified that he played the tape for Schlabach, and told Schlabach that he thought the message was a threat and intended to bring it to the attention of the United States Attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Schlabach testified that Egan said that he considered the message a threat, particularly the statement \"[t]he silver bullets are coming for you.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Schlabach stated that Egan was \"clearly upset, concerned, agitated.  His motions were somewhat exaggerated.  Typical reaction you would see under those circumstances.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 130.  Schlabach indicated that Egan intended to discuss the message with the United States Attorney's office and with a squad in the FBI unit responsible for investigating threatening matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pre-trial conference, the district court ruled that these statements were admissible as either statements of present sense impression or of then-existing state of mind.  See Fed.R.Evid. 803(1), 803(3).  Fulmer argues that the district court misinterpreted and/or misapplied these two hearsay exceptions.  He further argues that the introduction of this testimony was grossly prejudicial because it emphasized Egan's conclusion on the ultimate issue, that the statement was a threat, and should have been excluded on those grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already noted that a victim's reactions and actions taken in response to an alleged threat are relevant to the determination of whether a statement is a \"true threat.\"   See supra section III.C. The statements made by Egan in the context of this conversation are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, that the statements were a threat and that Egan would bring the message to the attention of the United States Attorney's office.  Rather, Egan's statements relate to the nature and extent of the impact of Fulmer's statement upon Egan.  They, thus, are not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding Schlabach's testimony, we find that his testimony as to Egan's statements is cumulative and that his comments regarding Egan's demeanor during the course of this conversation were not hearsay at all.

Admission of bad character evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Egan testified at trial that, at their first meeting, Fulmer indicated that Boschetti and David Fulmer \"had used the courts against him, ... to keep him away from the family.\"   Trial Transcript, vol. 2, at 59-60.  Egan also testified that Fulmer told Egan that he had been restrained from seeing his family by the court.  Id. at 108-09.   Egan further testified that Boschetti informed him that Fulmer's allegations were \"vengeance\" on Fulmer's part.  Id. at 77.

Probative value \"must be considered in light of the remoteness in time of the other act and the degree of resemblance to the crime charged.\"   If the proffered evidence has \"special relevance,\" it is nonetheless inadmissible if its probative value is \"substantially outweighed by the danger of,\" inter alia, \"unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Frankhauser, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196693\"><a href=\"/opinion/196693/united-states-v-frankhauser/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 648-49 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find first that the evidence did have \"special relevance\" to an issue in this case, namely, whether a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen that his statement, viewed in light of the factual context in which it was made, was a \"true threat.\"   Whether Fulmer's family relationship was strained, whether he had been restrained from seeing his family, whether he harbored ill feelings toward his former fatherin-law and brother--all of these things are especially relevant to understanding Fulmer's motivation in his pursuit of sanctions against his former family and perhaps the extent of his potential disappointment at the government's failure to prosecute Boschetti and David Fulmer.  We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this evidence fell outside the prohibitions of Rule 404(b) because the evidence could go both to Fulmer's possible motive and to his intent to threaten Egan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 403, the district court is to exclude evidence that creates unfair prejudice or a risk of confusing or misleading the jury that substantially outweighs any probative value.  Id. at 649.   Certainly evidence that Fulmer had engaged in other acts that might show that he has a tendency to be violent or vengeful are prejudicial.  The question is whether this prejudice is unfair.  In a threats prosecution, the general factual context in which the statement was made bears significantly on whether an ambiguous statement could reasonably be read as a threat.  Given that the interaction between Fulmer and Egan is related directly to Fulmer's relationship with his family, indeed that their interaction arose from that relationship, admitting evidence regarding the family relationship was not likely to unfairly prejudice Fulmer and any prejudice certainly did not substantially outweigh any probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was careful to exclude other evidence of Fulmer's prior acts as overly prejudicial.  Given the district court's careful weighing of the \"other acts\" evidence, we find no abuse of discretion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One nuance of Fulmer's argument remains.  While Fulmer concedes that the context of a statement is relevant to the inquiry under the objective standard of a \"true threat,\" he contends that the evidence should focus exclusively on the context of the statement itself and on the interaction between the parties to the statement, here Fulmer and Egan.  He maintains that any evidence from sources other than Fulmer are not relevant to the inquiry under the objective standard.  We find that the evidence of Fulmer's other acts from sources other than Fulmer so closely mirrors statements from Fulmer to Egan that it is cumulative of Fulmer's statements.  We find that, if their admission was error, that error could not have been anything other than harmless.  United States v. Cudlitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196509\"><a href=\"/opinion/196509/united-states-v-cudlitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Under the harmless error doctrine ... we are instructed to ask whether it is 'highly probable' that the error did not 'contribute to the verdict.' \"  (citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F. Government's admission of newspapers that depicted murders, shootings, and threats</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct examination, Erika Liem, a paralegal in defense counsel's office, testified that she had found only one article in a search of both the Boston Globe and the New York Times for 1995 in which the term \"silver bullets\" referred to actual ammunition.  She further testified that, in several of the articles, \"silver bullets\" referred to a solution to a problem.  On cross-examination, the government asked Liem whether she had found several articles, in which the phrase \"silver bullets\" appeared, that depicted murders and shootings.  She testified that she had not found these articles, all of which were from newspapers outside the Northeast and all but one of which were published before 1995.  The prosecutor then read a sentence from one of the articles and asked Liem about other facts discussed in the article.  Each of the articles was admitted into evidence.  On redirect-examination, defense counsel introduced into evidence the articles found in Liem's search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Fulmer contends that the government's use of these articles was outside the scope of the use of the phrase \"silver bullets.\"   The government responds that the evidence was proper rebuttal to Fulmer's implication that the term typically is used in a benign manner.  We find that, because Fulmer opened the door to introducing evidence from newspapers reports of the different usages of the term \"silver bullets,\" the court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the government to provide evidence from similar sources to rebut Fulmer's evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents a variety of claims of error, most of which concern difficult decisions made by the district court that we are wary to reverse.  We find, however, that three evidentiary rulings by the district court were errors that cannot be deemed harmless because of the unacceptable risk of unfair prejudice they created.  Specifically, we find that the district court erred in admitting into evidence:  actual bullets;  testimony regarding ammunition in Egan's car on the night he received the alleged threat;  and testimony regarding the Oklahoma City bombing.  Therefore, Fulmer's conviction is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with the discussion in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 871 provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Threats against President and successors to the Presidency</p>\n        <p>(a) Whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, the President-elect, the Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President of the United States, or the Vice President-elect, or knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President, President-elect, Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President, or Vice President-elect, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 875 provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Interstate communications</p>\n        <p>(c) Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 876 provides, in part:</p>\n        <p>Mailing threatening communication</p>\n        <p>Whoever knowingly so deposits or causes to be delivered as aforesaid, any communication with or without a name or designating mark subscribed thereto, addressed to any other person and containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B) states:</p>\n        <p>(a)(1) Whoever--</p>\n        <p>(B) threatens to assault, kidnap, or murder, a United States official, judge, a Federal law enforcement officer, or an official whose killing would be a crime under such section,</p>\n        <p>with intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with such official, judge, or law enforcement officer while engaged in the performance of official duties, or with intent to retaliate against such person on account of the performance of official duties during the term of service of such person, shall be punished....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Federal Rule of Evidence 403 states:</p>\n        <p>Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note as well that the limiting instruction carried the risk of confusing the jury by suggesting that evidence that Fulmer knew of the bullets in Egan's drawer would be forthcoming</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The actual statement in the message was \"[t]he silver bullets are coming.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides:</p>\n        <p>Other crimes, wrongs, or acts.
