On November 2, 1994, defendant-appellee\n\nGeneral Dynamics Defense Systems, Inc. (GDDS) advised plaintiff-\n\nappellant George P. Grotlisch that he would not be permitted to\n\nreturn to work unless and until he underwent a psychological\n\nevaluation.1 GDDS reiterated this requirement to Grotlisch on\n\nseveral   subsequent    occasions.     A     stalemate    ensued:     the\n\nappellant refused to undergo the examination and GDDS refused to\n\nallow him to return to work.\n\n          Several years later, the appellant filed this suit in\n\nthe   United   States    District    Court    for   the    District    of\n\nMassachusetts.   In his complaint, he alleged that the imposition\n\nof the psychological examination requirement offended his rights\n\nunder (1) the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n12101-12113; (2) the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§\n\n2601-2654; and (3) the handicap discrimination provisions of\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(16) (Chapter 151B).           Following a\n\nround of pretrial discovery, the district court ruled that the\n\nappellant's claims were time-barred and granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of GDDS.       Grotlisch v. GDDS, No. 99-30248 (D. Mass.\n\nJune 6, 2001) (unpublished memorandum of decision).          This appeal\n\n\n\n      1\n     Two of GDDS's predecessors in interest are codefendants in\nthis action.   Because the inclusion of these entities has no\nbearing on the dispositive issue, we opt for simplicity and\ntreat the case as if GDDS were the sole defendant.\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffollowed.      In it, the appellant presses only his Chapter 151B\n\nclaim.\n\n              The statute of limitations applicable to claims under\n\nChapter 151B has two components:                a plaintiff must complain to\n\nthe    Massachusetts         Commission     Against     Discrimination       (MCAD)\n\nwithin six months of the alleged act of discrimination, and must\n\nalso sue within three years of the alleged act.                   See Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 151B, §§ 5, 9.                  Here, it is undisputed that the\n\nappellant      knew     in    November     of   1994    about   the    employer's\n\nrequirement that he undergo a psychological evaluation as a\n\ncondition precedent to returning to work, yet neglected to file\n\nhis charge of discrimination with the MCAD until March 25, 1997\n\n(more than two years later).             By like token, he did not file the\n\ninstant action until November 1, 1999 (nearly five years after\n\nthe initial perpetration of the allegedly discriminatory act).\n\nWe    agree   with     the   district     court   that    these   lapses     —   the\n\nuntimely administrative filing and the tardy commencement of\n\nsuit — bar the maintenance of this civil action.\n\n              The appellant's arguments to the contrary are uniformly\n\nunavailing.           Most    are   so    far-fetched     as    not    to   require\n\ndiscussion.         A few comments suffice to dispose of the remainder.\n\n              The    asseveration        that   the    record   here    evinces    a\n\nsystemic violation — that is, that GDDS was engaged in enforcing\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fan ongoing policy of discrimination that extended into the\n\nlimitation period, Appellant's Br. at 28-32 — is insupportable.\n\nFor this purpose, a \"policy\" requires a showing of a general\n\npractice aimed at members of a protected class of employees.\n\nCuddyer v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 434 Mass. 521, 531 n.12,\n\n750   N.E.2d    928,      936   n.12   (2001).       The     appellant    does   not\n\nidentify any general practice aimed at a class of employees as\n\nthe   predicate      for    his   discrimination         claims,   but,    rather,\n\ndescribes discrimination arising solely from the employer's\n\ntreatment      of   him    alone.2      This    is     not   enough:      discrete\n\ndiscriminatory acts against an individual employee, even if\n\nrepeated, do not constitute a general practice (and, therefore,\n\ndo not constitute a systemic violation).                     Megwinoff v. Banco\n\nBilbao Vizcaya, 233 F.3d 73, 76 (1st Cir. 2000); Provencher v.\n\nCVS Pharmacy, 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            The appellant also maintains that certain letters sent\n\nto him by GDDS within the limitation period gave rise to new,\n\ndistinct causes of action.             See Appellant's Br. at 32-35. This\n\nargument    was     not    raised      before    the    lower    court    and    is,\n\ntherefore, forfeit.         McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13,\n\n\n      2\n     To be sure, the appellant boldly asserts at one point that\n\"there was evidence that the policy was applied to others . . .\n.\" Appellant's Br. at 40-41. This is sheer persiflage. Our\nexamination of the record reveals no such evidence, and the\nappellant identifies none.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f22 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"It is hornbook law that theories not raised\n\nsquarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\").         In all events, the letters to which the\n\nappellant adverts merely restate what he had been told earlier:\n\nthat he could not return to work at GDDS without submitting to\n\na   psychological   evaluation.           Those    reaffirmations     of    the\n\nemployer's previously stated requirement do not give rise to a\n\nnew cause of action.        See Dugan v. Ball State Univ., 815 F.2d\n\n1132, 1135 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\n          Finally, the appellant insists that his action is\n\ntimeous under the continuing violation doctrine.                 Appellant's\n\nBr. at 35-45.     This thesis does not withstand scrutiny.3\n\n          Because    there    is    no    cognizable   showing    here     of   a\n\nsystemic violation, see supra, the appellant's argument reduces\n\nto a claim of a serial violation.               But the facts of record do\n\nnot support such a claim:          the appellant's complaint addresses\n\na   discrete    decision    by     GDDS    to    require   a   psychological\n\nevaluation as a condition of returning to work.                The employer's\n\nsubsequent adherence to that decision does not constitute a\n\n\n     3\n     The appellant is in error when he suggests that the\ncontinuing violation doctrine under Massachusetts law is \"far\nmore liberal\" than under federal law. Appellant's Br. at 37.\nSee, e.g., Carter v. Comm'r of Correction, 43 Mass. App. Ct.\n212, 221-22, 681 N.E.2d 1255, 1261-62 (1997) (citing federal\ncase law and applying an identical standard to a continuing\nviolation issue).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fseries    of    separate    acts       of   discrimination.          That   ends   the\n\nmatter:     to constitute a serial violation, \"[t]he series must\n\ncontain a specific beachhead violation occurring within the\n\nlimitations period,\" Pilgrim v. Trustees of Tufts College, 118\n\nF.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir. 1997), and the instant record fails to\n\nshow an actionable \"beachhead violation\" occurring within that\n\ntime frame.\n\n               We   need   go    no    further.        To    the   extent   that   the\n\nappellant makes other arguments, they are subsumed by the above,\n\npatently       meritless,       or    both.       In   the   final   analysis,     the\n\nappellant blurs the line \"between discriminatory acts and the\n\nongoing injuries which are the natural, if bitter, fruit of such\n\nacts.\"     Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 523 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nWhen that line is clearly drawn, it becomes readily apparent\n\nthat the district court did not err in entering summary judgment\n\nin GDDS's favor on timeliness grounds.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.       See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\f",
