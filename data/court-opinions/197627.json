Warren Brown appeals  from the\r                                       \r\n\ndismissal of  his civil  rights claims  for damages  under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983.  The claims trace back  to an affidavit, filed\r\n\nby  a  caseworker  in  connection  with  a  child  protection\r\n\nproceeding, that labeled  Brown an \"untreated  sex offender.\"\r\n\nAs  usual, where  a motion  to dismiss  has been  granted, we\r\n\nassume the  truth  of the  allegations in  the complaint  and\r\n\nconstrue it  in the light  most favorable to the  opponent of\r\n\nthe motion, here Warren Brown.  See Harper v. Cserr, 544 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1121, 1122 (1st Cir. 1976).\r\n\n     Warren  Brown is the  paternal grandfather of  two minor\r\n\nchildren, Thomas and Me'chelle Brown, born in 1986 and  1988,\r\n\nrespectively.   From 1989 to  1993, Brown often  looked after\r\n\nthe  children, sometimes  overnight, at  the  request of  the\r\n\nchildren's  mother, Kathi Duncan.   In November  1989, Thomas\r\n\nBrown  allegedly  told  his  mother  that  Warren  Brown  had\r\n\nsexually abused him.\r\n\n     Kathi Duncan reported the charge to the Maine Department\r\n\nof   Human  Services  (\"the  Department\").    Apparently  the\r\n\nDepartment investigated  the charge,  but no official  action\r\n\nwas  taken, and  Warren Brown continued  to baby-sit  for the\r\n\nchildren regularly  at Kathi  Duncan's request.   But  in May\r\n\n1993, Duncan reported to the Department that Warren Brown had\r\n\nendangered  Me'chelle  Brown,   through  faulty  supervision,\r\n\nallegedly because  he was  drunk.   A Department  caseworker,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nDonna  Niemi, later  interviewed  Thomas  Brown who  referred\r\n\nagain to the alleged 1989 sexual abuse.\r\n\n     At  a hearing  on June  10,  1993, in  the state  court,\r\n\nDuncan consented to a child protection order requiring her to\r\n\nkeep the  children away from  Warren Brown  and granting  the\r\n\nDepartment access to the children.   See 22 M.R.S.A.    4031,\r                                                    \r\n\n4036.  In support of  the order Niemi filed an  affidavit, in\r\n\nwhich  she   described  Warren   Brown's  alleged   negligent\r\n\nsupervision  of  Me'chelle  Brown.   Niemi's  affidavit  also\r\n\ndescribed briefly Thomas Brown's November 1989  allegation of\r\n\nsexual abuse and  said that the child had  confirmed to Niemi\r\n\nthat  the incident  had occurred.    The affidavit  described\r\n\nWarren Brown as \"an untreated sex offender.\"  \r\n\n     Niemi, and  perhaps  other  Department  officials,  then\r\n\narranged  for Warren Brown to be professionally evaluated for\r\n\nhis alleged  behavior  and also  for alcohol  abuse.   Warren\r\n\nBrown cooperated  in the hope  of regaining contact  with his\r\n\ngrandchildren.  Thereafter, according to Warren Brown, he was\r\n\ntold  by Department officials that he had missed appointments\r\n\nand  no further  treatment or  evaluation  would be  offered.\r\n\nWarren Brown claims that he did not miss any appointments.  \r\n\n     In  July 1993,  the Department  obtained  a court  order\r\n\nunder  the  same  child  protection  provisions  granting  it\r\n\ntemporary custody of the children based on charges that Kathi\r\n\nDuncan had  abused  them.   The Department  then sought  full\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\ncustody of the  children.  Warren Brown sought  to intervene,\r\n\nwas  rejected and  then renewed  his motion,  invoking a  new\r\n\nstate  statute  that  allowed  judges  to grant  grandparents\r\n\nintervenor status in child protection proceedings where  this\r\n\nwould serve  the interests of  the child and the  purposes of\r\n\nthe  statute.  22 M.R.S.A.    4005-B.  The renewed motion was\r\n\ndenied after a  hearing, and a later appeal  by Brown through\r\n\nthe state appellate courts was fruitless.\r\n\n     In February 1995,  the state court granted  full custody\r\n\nof the children to the Department, with visitation rights for\r\n\nthe  parents.  The  order provided that  family reunification\r\n\nefforts would continue.   But in  October 1995, Kathi  Duncan\r\n\nconsented to an order terminating her parental rights under a\r\n\nseparate  subchapter of  the Maine  statute,  and in  January\r\n\n1996,  the state court terminated  the parental rights of the\r\n\nchild's  father--Warren Brown's son--who did not appeal.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n22 M.R.S.A.    4050-4058.\r\n\n     In  the meantime, in November 1995, Warren Brown brought\r\n\nthe present section 1983 action in the federal district court\r\n\nin Maine.   The  now pertinent  portion of  Brown's complaint\r\n\ncharged that  Niemi, and  several other  Department employees\r\n\nconnected  to the  case,  had  violated  Warren  Brown's  due\r\n\nprocess rights  under the 14th  Amendment by libeling  him in\r\n\nthe Niemi affidavit, interfering with his access to the child\r\n\nprotection  proceedings,  and  ultimately  depriving  him  of\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ncontact with his grandchildren.  Brown sought damages of $1.2\r\n\nmillion  and asked  the court  to enjoin  the proceedings  to\r\n\nterminate his son's parental rights.\r\n\n     In July 1996, the district court granted the defendants'\r\n\nmotion to dismiss.   On the claim for  injunctive relief, the\r\n\ndistrict  court held that the  state proceedings sought to be\r\n\nenjoined  had concluded and  that the request  for relief was\r\n\nnow  moot.     The  court  also  eliminated  certain  of  the\r\n\ndefendants--primarily higher-level  officials--on the  ground\r\n\nthat  no sufficient connection between them and the events in\r\n\ndispute was adequately alleged.\r\n\n     As for the  claims against Niemi and  other Departmental\r\n\nemployees associated with the case, the dismissals were based\r\n\non qualified immunity.  The district court held  that neither\r\n\nthe reputational nor associational  rights asserted by Warren\r\n\nBrown  were \"clearly  established\" to  the  extent needed  to\r\n\novercome qualified  immunity, and  the court  also held  that\r\n\nthere  was  no  clearly  established  law to  show  that  the\r\n\nDepartment's  actions violated  his  substantive due  process\r\n\nrights under a \"shock the conscience\" test.\r\n\n     Brown  now  appeals  from the  dismissal  of  his damage\r\n\nclaims.  Our review is plenary.  Providence School Department\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Ana  C., 108 F.3d  1, 2 (1st  Cir. 1997). Because  we find\r                      \r\n\nthat Niemi was herself protected by qualified immunity, there\r\n\nis no reason to discussthose who were less directly involved.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     1.   \"[G]overnment  officials  performing  discretionary\r\n\nfunctions,  generally are  shielded  [by qualified  immunity]\r\n\nfrom liability  for civil  damages insofar  as their  conduct\r\n\ndoes   not   violate   clearly   established   statutory   or\r                                                        \r\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\r\n\nknown.\"    Harlow v.  Fitzgerald,  457 U.S.  800,  818 (1982)\r                                            \r\n\n(emphasis added).  The test is objective; claims of malice do\r\n\nnot overcome  qualified immunity. See Anderson  v. Creighton,\r                                                                        \r\n\n483 U.S. 635,  641 (1987).  Nor  is it enough that  the right\r\n\nclaimed to  have  been violated  has  been recognized  at  an\r\n\nabstract level:   existing case law has to  give the official\r\n\nreason to know that the specific conduct was prohibited.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nid. at 640.\r               \r\n\n     A thumbnail  version of Brown's constitutional  claim is\r\n\nas  follows.    Niemi's  charge  that  Warren  Brown  was  an\r\n\nuntreated   sex   offender  was   made  without   a  thorough\r\n\ninvestigation; it  foreseeably    frustrated  Warren  Brown's\r\n\nefforts  to  maintain  contact  with  his  grandchildren; and\r\n\nbecause  the charge somehow  became public it  injured Warren\r\n\nBrown's public reputation.  Thus, Brown says, Niemi's actions\r\n\nviolated  his  due  process rights  of  family  integrity and\r\n\nfreedom from  governmental falsehood,  and her  conduct as  a\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nwhole  \"shocks the conscience\"   under Rochin  v. California,\r                                                                        \r\n\n342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952).1\r\n\n     Starting with family integrity, a few cases suggest that\r\n\ngrandparents   may,   in   some  circumstances,   have   some\r\n\nconstitutionally  protected  rights  in  relation  to   their\r\n\nassociation  with  their  grandchildren.   We  spoke  of this\r\n\npossibility in Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 8 n.6 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993), limiting our remarks to grandparents who were residing\r\n\nwith  the grandchildren.   See  also  Moore v.  City of  East\r                                                                         \r\n\nCleveland,  431 U.S. 494  (1977).  Protection  of nonresident\r                     \r\n\ngrandparents--like Warren Brown--has an even slimmer pedigree\r\n\nin the  case law.   Compare Drollinger v.

See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437 (1971).  But in\r                                      \r\n\nPaul v.

Gilley, 500 U.S. 226,  233-34 (1991).  Here Warren Brown's\r                     \r\n\nlegal status was not changed  by Niemi's charge:  he remained\r\n\na grandparent entitled to whatever rights a grandparent might\r\n\nhave under Maine law.\r\n\n     But  even if Warren Brown had constitutionally protected\r\n\ninterests in  visitation with  non-resident grandchildren  or\r\n\nagainst reputational harm, he has  no precedent to show  that\r\n\nthe  circumstances of  his  case  come even  close  to a  due\r\n\nprocess violation.   The state  has a  very strong  interest,\r\n\nrepeatedly recognized,  in  the protection  of children  from\r\n\nabuse, whether by  their parents or anyone else.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nGinsberg v. New York,  390 U.S. 629,  640 (1968).  A  special\r                                \r\n\nresponsibility  rests on agencies like the Department, and on\r\n\ncaseworkers like Niemi, to investigate colorable charges that\r\n\ncome to their attention and institute appropriate proceedings\r\n\nwhere  warranted.  Often,  the only  witness, other  than the\r\n\ncharged offender, is the child itself.\r\n\n     Here,  Thomas Brown  had  apparently twice  repeated the\r\n\ncharge that  his grandfather  had engaged  in abusive  sexual\r\n\nconduct; Warren  Brown does not  dispute that the  charge was\r\n\nmade by his grandson.  The child's mother also reported that,\r\n\ndue to  drunkenness, Warren  Brown had  endangered Me'chelle.\r\n\nBecause  the children's mother  had continued to  entrust the\r\n\nchildren  to Warren Brown, Niemi could certainly have thought\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthat an initial  protection order was important and  ought to\r\n\nbe sought immediately.\r\n\n     Niemi herself had no authority to bar Warren Brown  from\r\n\ncontact with his grandchildren while they were still in their\r\n\nmother's  care.    Niemi's  remedy  was  to  begin   a  court\r\n\nproceeding and to tell the court what she had  learned.  Then\r\n\nit  became the court's  responsibility to  decide what  to do\r\n\nnext.  Of course, Niemi  might first have conducted a further\r\n\ninvestigation  into  the  alleged  sexual  abuse  claim,  now\r\n\nseveral years in the past,  but the precedents impose no such\r\n\nconstitutional obligation.   On the  contrary, agencies  like\r\n\nthe Department have  wide latitude to  pursue investigations,\r\n\nand begin  proceedings based  on colorable  charges of  child\r\n\nabuse.   See Frazier  v. Bailey, 957 F.2d  920, 931 n.12 (1st\r                                           \r\n\nCir. 1992).\r\n\n     For the same reasons, there is no  prospect that Niemi's\r\n\nconduct can be described as  so outrageous as to constitute a\r\n\ndue process  violation under Rochin's  \"shock the conscience\"\r                                               \r\n\ntest.  That standard does  have vitality in this circuit, but\r\n\nit  is  confined   to  situations  of  brutal   or  otherwise\r\n\noutrageous behavior.  See Souza  v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 424-27\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1995).    In the  present  case,  a  caseworker's\r\n\naccusation  incident   to  a   judicial  proceeding--possibly\r\n\nmistaken  but made with colorable basis--is not even wrongful\r\n\nconduct, let alone outrageously so.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     2.  There is lurking in this case a due process claim of\r\n\na somewhat  different character.   What  is mainly  troubling\r\n\nhere is not  the caseworker's charge or the  supposed lack of\r\n\nadequate prior investigation,  but something quite different:\r\n\nit  is Warren Brown's apparent inability  thus far to contest\r\n\nin court the allegations that (quite apart from any damage to\r\n\nhis public reputation)  may effectively have led  to judicial\r\n\nrelief that cut him off from contact with his grandchildren.\r\n\n     This outcome cannot be attributed to  Niemi or any other\r\n\nof  the named Departmental defendants.  They were entitled to\r\n\nbegin the proceedings, and they did not issue the orders that\r\n\ndenied  Warren Brown's  intervention requests or  limited his\r\n\naccess  to his  grandchildren.   Rather,  the outcome  raises\r\n\nquestions about  the procedural fairness of  judicial actions\r\n\ndenying  intervention and--to the  extent that they  did so--\r\n\ncutting off Warren Brown's access to his grandchildren.\r\n\n     Maine's judges are absolutely immune from  damage claims\r\n\nbased on their  judicial decisions.  See Pierson  v. Ray, 386\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 547, 553-54 (1967).  Nor  can we review decisions of the\r\n\nMaine  courts even for constitutional error; only the Supreme\r\n\nCourt can  do that.   See Rooker  v. Fidelity Trust  Co., 263\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 413,  416 (1923).   This leaves open the  possibility of\r\n\ninjunctive relief against ongoing state proceedings, although\r\n\nit too might face  obstacles short of the merits.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nTrainor  v. Hernandez, 431  U.S. 434, 444  (1977) (abstention\r                                 \r\n\ndoctrine).\r\n\n     Warren Brown did seek such an injunction in the district\r\n\ncourt  but has  not appealed  that court's  dismissal of  the\r\n\nclaim as moot.  And the merits are far from clear:  the state\r\n\nobviously has an  interest in the conduct of child protection\r\n\nproceedings and in narrowing the issues to the welfare of the\r\n\nchildren  and   the  interests  of  those   most  immediately\r\n\nconcerned with their welfare, usually the parents.  The Maine\r\n\nstatute  has struck a  compromise, permitting the grandfather\r\n\nto seek  intervention but  only with  the court's  permission\r\n\nbased on the best interests of the child.\r\n\n     The  possibility remains  of unfair  application  of the\r\n\nstatute  in an  individual case,  but  whether an  individual\r\n\nerror would give rise to a federal  remedy is another matter.\r\n\nSo long as  state law provides an avenue  of relief--here, an\r\n\nappeal to  higher  courts--even a  deprivation  of  protected\r\n\nrights  does  not automatically  give rise  to a  due process\r\n\nclaim.   See Parratt v.  Taylor, 451  U.S.  527,  544 (1981).\r                                           \r\n\nBut this  subject is  fraught with difficulty  and we  do not\r\n\npursue it here.  \r\n\n     As it  happens, state law  may still offer  Warren Brown\r\n\nsome  opportunity  for  relief if  the  grandchildren  are in\r\n\nfoster care  or are  otherwise not  yet placed for  adoption.\r\n\nThe initial  protection order  did effectively  bar him  from\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ncontact; but it  was only an interim order,  entered with the\r\n\nconsent of  the children's mother  who during her  custody of\r\n\nthe children  could  herself have  restricted Warren  Brown's\r\n\ncontact.    Subsequent  orders  transferred  custody  to  the\r\n\nDepartment and  then terminated,  successively, the  parental\r\n\nrights of the children's mother and father, but none of those\r\n\norders was directed at Warren Brown.  \r\n\n     The state's  counsel told us at oral argument that there\r\n\nis  no  currently  effective  order barring  contact  between\r\n\nWarren Brown and his grandchildren,  and we can find no trace\r\n\nof such an order in the record.  So long as the children have\r\n\nnot been  placed for adoption  or formally adopted, it  is at\r\n\nleast possible under Maine law  that Warren Brown could still\r\n\napply  for standing and  intervenor status in  the protection\r\n\nproceeding that  transferred custody of his  grandchildren to\r\n\nthe  Department.   22  M.R.S.A.     4005-B(2).   If  it  were\r\n\ngranted,  he  could  also \"request  the  court  to  grant the\r\n\ngrandparent reasonable rights  of visitation or access.\"   22\r\n\nM.R.S.A.   4005-B(6).2\r\n\n     Family issues,  including abuse  and custody, are  among\r\n\nthe most difficult for the law to resolve.  Standards tend to\r\n\nbe vague, situations may be wrenching, and the legal tools at\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Under Maine law,  adoption (or in some  cases placement\r\nfor  adoption) does cut off such statutory grandparent rights\r\nbut  does not prohibit prospective or actual adoptive parents\r\nfrom permitting contact between a  child and grandparent.  22\r\nM.R.S.A.   4005-B(6).\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nhand are  often clumsy.   But, especially  in the  family-law\r\n\nrealm, federal damage actions under section 1983 have usually\r\n\nproved to be an ineffective means of adjusting disputes  with\r\n\nthe authorities.   See generally Ellis v.  Hamilton, 669 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 515-16.

The claims trace back to an affidavit, filed by a caseworker in connection with a child protection proceeding, that labeled Brown an \"untreated sex offender.\"   As usual, where a motion to dismiss has been granted, we assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint and construe it in the light most favorable to the opponent of the motion, here Warren Brown.  See Harper v. Cserr, 544 F.2d 1121, 1122 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Warren Brown is the paternal grandfather of two minor children, Thomas and Me'chelle Brown, born in 1986 and 1988, respectively.  From 1989 to 1993, Brown often looked after the children, sometimes overnight, at the request of the children's mother, Kathi Duncan.  In November 1989, Thomas Brown allegedly told his mother that Warren Brown had sexually abused him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kathi Duncan reported the charge to the Maine Department of Human Services (\"the Department\").  Apparently the Department investigated the charge, but no official action was taken, and Warren Brown continued to baby-sit for the children regularly at Kathi Duncan's request.  But in May 1993, Duncan reported to the Department that Warren Brown had endangered Me'chelle Brown, through faulty supervision, allegedly because he was drunk.  A Department caseworker, Donna Niemi, later interviewed Thomas Brown who referred again to the alleged 1989 sexual abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on June 10, 1993, in the state court, Duncan consented to a child protection order requiring her to keep the children away from Warren Brown and granting the Department access to the children.  See 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 4031, 4036.  In support of the order Niemi filed an affidavit, in which she described Warren Brown's alleged negligent supervision of Me'chelle Brown.  Niemi's affidavit also described briefly Thomas Brown's November 1989 allegation of sexual abuse and said that the child had confirmed to Niemi that the incident had occurred.  The affidavit described Warren Brown as \"an untreated sex offender.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Niemi, and perhaps other Department officials, then arranged for Warren Brown to be professionally evaluated for his alleged behavior and also for alcohol abuse.  Warren Brown cooperated in the hope of regaining contact with his grandchildren.  Thereafter, according to Warren Brown, he was told by Department officials that he had missed appointments and no further treatment or evaluation would be offered.  Warren Brown claims that he did not miss any appointments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, the Department obtained a court order under the same child protection provisions granting it temporary custody of the children based on charges that Kathi Duncan had abused them.  The Department then sought full custody of the children.  Warren Brown sought to intervene, was rejected and then renewed his motion, invoking a new state statute that allowed judges to grant grandparents intervenor status in child protection proceedings where this would serve the interests of the child and the purposes of the statute.  22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4005-B.  The renewed motion was denied after a hearing, and a later appeal by Brown through the state appellate courts was fruitless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1995, the state court granted full custody of the children to the Department, with visitation rights for the parents.  The order provided that family reunification efforts would continue.  But in October 1995, Kathi Duncan consented to an order terminating her parental rights under a separate subchapter of the Maine statute, and in January 1996, the state court terminated the parental rights of the child's father--Warren Brown's son--who did not appeal.  See 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 4050-4058.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, in November 1995, Warren Brown brought the present section 1983 action in the federal district court in Maine.  The now pertinent portion of Brown's complaint charged that Niemi, and several other Department employees connected to the case, had violated Warren Brown's due process rights under the 14th Amendment by libeling him in the Niemi affidavit, interfering with his access to the child protection proceedings, and ultimately depriving him of contact with his grandchildren.  Brown sought damages of $1.2 million and asked the court to enjoin the proceedings to terminate his son's parental rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.  On the claim for injunctive relief, the district court held that the state proceedings sought to be enjoined had concluded and that the request for relief was now moot.  The court also eliminated certain of the defendants--primarily higher-level officials--on the ground that no sufficient connection between them and the events in dispute was adequately alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the claims against Niemi and other Departmental employees associated with the case, the dismissals were based on qualified immunity.  The district court held that neither the reputational nor associational rights asserted by Warren Brown were \"clearly established\" to the extent needed to overcome qualified immunity, and the court also held that there was no clearly established law to show that the Department's actions violated his substantive due process rights under a \"shock the conscience\" test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown now appeals from the dismissal of his damage claims.  Our review is plenary.  Providence School Department v. Ana C., 108 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1997).  Because we find that Niemi was herself protected by qualified immunity, there is no reason to discuss those who were less directly involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. \"[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded [by qualified immunity] from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (emphasis added).  The test is objective;  claims of malice do not overcome qualified immunity.  See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039-40, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).  Nor is it enough that the right claimed to have been violated has been recognized at an abstract level:  existing case law has to give the official reason to know that the specific conduct was prohibited.  See id. at 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A thumbnail version of Brown's constitutional claim is as follows.  Niemi's charge that Warren Brown was an untreated sex offender was made without a thorough investigation;  it foreseeably frustrated Warren Brown's efforts to maintain contact with his grandchildren;  and because the charge somehow became public it injured Warren Brown's public reputation.  Thus, Brown says, Niemi's actions violated his due process rights of family integrity and freedom from governmental falsehood, and her conduct as a whole \"shocks the conscience\" under Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 209, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with family integrity, a few cases suggest that grandparents may, in some circumstances, have some constitutionally protected rights in relation to their association with their grandchildren.  We spoke of this possibility in Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 8 n. 6 (1st Cir.1993), limiting our remarks to grandparents who were residing with the grandchildren.  See also Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977).  Protection of nonresident grandparents--like Warren Brown--has an even slimmer pedigree in the case law.  Compare Drollinger v. Milligan, 552 F.2d 1220, 1227 n. 6 (7th Cir.1977), with Ellis v. Hamilton, 669 F.2d 510, 513 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1069, 103 S.Ct. 488, 74 L.Ed.2d 631 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in one case the Supreme Court recognized a protected due process right against a false government designation made with no opportunity for challenge.  See Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437, 91 S.Ct. 507, 510, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971).  But in Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 711-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1165-66, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that the designation itself had to change the victim's legal status and that mere damage to reputational interests did not rise to a constitutional violation.  See also Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 233-34, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1793-94, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991).  Here Warren Brown's legal status was not changed by Niemi's charge:  he remained a grandparent entitled to whatever rights a grandparent might have under Maine law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if Warren Brown had constitutionally protected interests in visitation with non-resident grandchildren or against reputational harm, he has no precedent to show that the circumstances of his case come even close to a due process violation.  The state has a very strong interest, repeatedly recognized, in the protection of children from abuse, whether by their parents or anyone else.  See, e.g., Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 640, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 1281, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968).  A special responsibility rests on agencies like the Department, and on caseworkers like Niemi, to investigate colorable charges that come to their attention and institute appropriate proceedings where warranted.  Often, the only witness, other than the charged offender, is the child itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Thomas Brown had apparently twice repeated the charge that his grandfather had engaged in abusive sexual conduct;  Warren Brown does not dispute that the charge was made by his grandson.  The child's mother also reported that, due to drunkenness, Warren Brown had endangered Me'chelle.  Because the children's mother had continued to entrust the children to Warren Brown, Niemi could certainly have thought that an initial protection order was important and ought to be sought immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Niemi herself had no authority to bar Warren Brown from contact with his grandchildren while they were still in their mother's care.  Niemi's remedy was to begin a court proceeding and to tell the court what she had learned.  Then it became the court's responsibility to decide what to do next.  Of course, Niemi might first have conducted a further investigation into the alleged sexual abuse claim, now several years in the past, but the precedents impose no such constitutional obligation.  On the contrary, agencies like the Department have wide latitude to pursue investigations, and begin proceedings based on colorable charges of child abuse.  See Frazier v. Bailey, 957 F.2d 920, 931 n. 12 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons, there is no prospect that Niemi's conduct can be described as so outrageous as to constitute a due process violation under Rochin 's \"shock the conscience\" test.  That standard does have vitality in this circuit, but it is confined to situations of brutal or otherwise outrageous behavior.  See Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 424-27 (1st Cir.1995).  In the present case, a caseworker's accusation incident to a judicial proceeding--possibly mistaken but made with colorable basis--is not even wrongful conduct, let alone outrageously so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. There is lurking in this case a due process claim of a somewhat different character.  What is mainly troubling here is not the caseworker's charge or the supposed lack of adequate prior investigation, but something quite different:  it is Warren Brown's apparent inability thus far to contest in court the allegations that (quite apart from any damage to his public reputation) may effectively have led to judicial relief that cut him off from contact with his grandchildren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This outcome cannot be attributed to Niemi or any other of the named Departmental defendants.  They were entitled to begin the proceedings, and they did not issue the orders that denied Warren Brown's intervention requests or limited his access to his grandchildren.  Rather, the outcome raises questions about the procedural fairness of judicial actions denying intervention and--to the extent that they did so--cutting off Warren Brown's access to his grandchildren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's judges are absolutely immune from damage claims based on their judicial decisions.  See Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 553-54, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1217, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967).  Nor can we review decisions of the Maine courts even for constitutional error;  only the Supreme Court can do that.  See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).  This leaves open the possibility of injunctive relief against ongoing state proceedings, although it too might face obstacles short of the merits.  See, e.g., Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 444, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 1918, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (1977) (abstention doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Warren Brown did seek such an injunction in the district court but has not appealed that court's dismissal of the claim as moot.  And the merits are far from clear:  the state obviously has an interest in the conduct of child protection proceedings and in narrowing the issues to the welfare of the children and the interests of those most immediately concerned with their welfare, usually the parents.  The Maine statute has struck a compromise, permitting the grandfather to seek intervention but only with the court's permission based on the best interests of the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possibility remains of unfair application of the statute in an individual case, but whether an individual error would give rise to a federal remedy is another matter.  So long as state law provides an avenue of relief--here, an appeal to higher courts--even a deprivation of protected rights does not automatically give rise to a due process claim.  See Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 544, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1917, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981).  But this subject is fraught with difficulty and we do not pursue it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, state law may still offer Warren Brown some opportunity for relief if the grandchildren are in foster care or are otherwise not yet placed for adoption.  The initial protection order did effectively bar him from contact;  but it was only an interim order, entered with the consent of the children's mother who during her custody of the children could herself have restricted Warren Brown's contact.  Subsequent orders transferred custody to the Department and then terminated, successively, the parental rights of the children's mother and father, but none of those orders was directed at Warren Brown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state's counsel told us at oral argument that there is no currently effective order barring contact between Warren Brown and his grandchildren, and we can find no trace of such an order in the record.  So long as the children have not been placed for adoption or formally adopted, it is at least possible under Maine law that Warren Brown could still apply for standing and intervenor status in the protection proceeding that transferred custody of his grandchildren to the Department.  22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4005-B(2).  If it were granted, he could also \"request the court to grant the grandparent reasonable rights of visitation or access.\"  22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4005-B(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Family issues, including abuse and custody, are among the most difficult for the law to resolve.  Standards tend to be vague, situations may be wrenching, and the legal tools at hand are often clumsy.  But, especially in the family-law realm, federal damage actions under section 1983 have usually proved to be an ineffective means of adjusting disputes with the authorities.  See generally Ellis v. Hamilton, 669 F.2d at 515-16.

The claims trace back to an affidavit, filed by a caseworker in connection with a child protection proceeding, that labeled Brown an \"untreated sex offender.\"   As usual, where a motion to dismiss has been granted, we assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint and construe it in the light most favorable to the opponent of the motion, here Warren Brown.  See Harper v. Cserr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340533\"><a href=\"/opinion/340533/thomas-harper-etc-v-robert-cserr-md-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span>, 1122 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Warren Brown is the paternal grandfather of two minor children, Thomas and Me'chelle Brown, born in 1986 and 1988, respectively.  From 1989 to 1993, Brown often looked after the children, sometimes overnight, at the request of the children's mother, Kathi Duncan.  In November 1989, Thomas Brown allegedly told his mother that Warren Brown had sexually abused him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kathi Duncan reported the charge to the Maine Department of Human Services (\"the Department\").  Apparently the Department investigated the charge, but no official action was taken, and Warren Brown continued to baby-sit for the children regularly at Kathi Duncan's request.  But in May 1993, Duncan reported to the Department that Warren Brown had endangered Me'chelle Brown, through faulty supervision, allegedly because he was drunk.  A Department caseworker, Donna Niemi, later interviewed Thomas Brown who referred again to the alleged 1989 sexual abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on June 10, 1993, in the state court, Duncan consented to a child protection order requiring her to keep the children away from Warren Brown and granting the Department access to the children.  See 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 4031, 4036.  In support of the order Niemi filed an affidavit, in which she described Warren Brown's alleged negligent supervision of Me'chelle Brown.  Niemi's affidavit also described briefly Thomas Brown's November 1989 allegation of sexual abuse and said that the child had confirmed to Niemi that the incident had occurred.  The affidavit described Warren Brown as \"an untreated sex offender.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Niemi, and perhaps other Department officials, then arranged for Warren Brown to be professionally evaluated for his alleged behavior and also for alcohol abuse.  Warren Brown cooperated in the hope of regaining contact with his grandchildren.  Thereafter, according to Warren Brown, he was told by Department officials that he had missed appointments and no further treatment or evaluation would be offered.  Warren Brown claims that he did not miss any appointments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, the Department obtained a court order under the same child protection provisions granting it temporary custody of the children based on charges that Kathi Duncan had abused them.  The Department then sought full custody of the children.  Warren Brown sought to intervene, was rejected and then renewed his motion, invoking a new state statute that allowed judges to grant grandparents intervenor status in child protection proceedings where this would serve the interests of the child and the purposes of the statute.  22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4005-B.  The renewed motion was denied after a hearing, and a later appeal by Brown through the state appellate courts was fruitless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1995, the state court granted full custody of the children to the Department, with visitation rights for the parents.  The order provided that family reunification efforts would continue.  But in October 1995, Kathi Duncan consented to an order terminating her parental rights under a separate subchapter of the Maine statute, and in January 1996, the state court terminated the parental rights of the child's father--Warren Brown's son--who did not appeal.  See 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 4050-4058.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, in November 1995, Warren Brown brought the present section 1983 action in the federal district court in Maine.  The now pertinent portion of Brown's complaint charged that Niemi, and several other Department employees connected to the case, had violated Warren Brown's due process rights under the 14th Amendment by libeling him in the Niemi affidavit, interfering with his access to the child protection proceedings, and ultimately depriving him of contact with his grandchildren.  Brown sought damages of $1.2 million and asked the court to enjoin the proceedings to terminate his son's parental rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.  On the claim for injunctive relief, the district court held that the state proceedings sought to be enjoined had concluded and that the request for relief was now moot.  The court also eliminated certain of the defendants--primarily higher-level officials--on the ground that no sufficient connection between them and the events in dispute was adequately alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the claims against Niemi and other Departmental employees associated with the case, the dismissals were based on qualified immunity.  The district court held that neither the reputational nor associational rights asserted by Warren Brown were \"clearly established\" to the extent needed to overcome qualified immunity, and the court also held that there was no clearly established law to show that the Department's actions violated his substantive due process rights under a \"shock the conscience\" test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown now appeals from the dismissal of his damage claims.

Nor is it enough that the right claimed to have been violated has been recognized at an abstract level:  existing case law has to give the official reason to know that the specific conduct was prohibited.

Niemi's charge that Warren Brown was an untreated sex offender was made without a thorough investigation;  it foreseeably frustrated Warren Brown's efforts to maintain contact with his grandchildren;  and because the charge somehow became public it injured Warren Brown's public reputation.  Thus, Brown says, Niemi's actions violated his due process rights of family integrity and freedom from governmental falsehood, and her conduct as a whole \"shocks the conscience\" under Rochin v.

The state has a very strong interest, repeatedly recognized, in the protection of children from abuse, whether by their parents or anyone else.  See, e.g., Ginsberg v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107663\"><a href=\"/opinion/107663/ginsberg-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span>, 640, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107663\"><a href=\"/opinion/107663/ginsberg-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A special responsibility rests on agencies like the Department, and on caseworkers like Niemi, to investigate colorable charges that come to their attention and institute appropriate proceedings where warranted.  Often, the only witness, other than the charged offender, is the child itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Thomas Brown had apparently twice repeated the charge that his grandfather had engaged in abusive sexual conduct;  Warren Brown does not dispute that the charge was made by his grandson.  The child's mother also reported that, due to drunkenness, Warren Brown had endangered Me'chelle.  Because the children's mother had continued to entrust the children to Warren Brown, Niemi could certainly have thought that an initial protection order was important and ought to be sought immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Niemi herself had no authority to bar Warren Brown from contact with his grandchildren while they were still in their mother's care.  Niemi's remedy was to begin a court proceeding and to tell the court what she had learned.  Then it became the court's responsibility to decide what to do next.  Of course, Niemi might first have conducted a further investigation into the alleged sexual abuse claim, now several years in the past, but the precedents impose no such constitutional obligation.  On the contrary, agencies like the Department have wide latitude to pursue investigations, and begin proceedings based on colorable charges of child abuse.  See Frazier v. Bailey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578605\"><a href=\"/opinion/578605/kevin-frazier-v-edward-n-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 931 n. 12 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons, there is no prospect that Niemi's conduct can be described as so outrageous as to constitute a due process violation under Rochin 's \"shock the conscience\" test.  That standard does have vitality in this circuit, but it is confined to situations of brutal or otherwise outrageous behavior.  See Souza v. Pina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196042\"><a href=\"/opinion/196042/souza-v-pina/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, 424-27 (1st Cir.1995).  In the present case, a caseworker's accusation incident to a judicial proceeding--possibly mistaken but made with colorable basis--is not even wrongful conduct, let alone outrageously so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. There is lurking in this case a due process claim of a somewhat different character.  What is mainly troubling here is not the caseworker's charge or the supposed lack of adequate prior investigation, but something quite different:  it is Warren Brown's apparent inability thus far to contest in court the allegations that (quite apart from any damage to his public reputation) may effectively have led to judicial relief that cut him off from contact with his grandchildren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This outcome cannot be attributed to Niemi or any other of the named Departmental defendants.  They were entitled to begin the proceedings, and they did not issue the orders that denied Warren Brown's intervention requests or limited his access to his grandchildren.  Rather, the outcome raises questions about the procedural fairness of judicial actions denying intervention and--to the extent that they did so--cutting off Warren Brown's access to his grandchildren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's judges are absolutely immune from damage claims based on their judicial decisions.  See Pierson v. Ray, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107411\"><a href=\"/opinion/107411/pierson-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 553-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107411\"><a href=\"/opinion/107411/pierson-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span>, 1217, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107411\"><a href=\"/opinion/107411/pierson-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span> (1967).  Nor can we review decisions of the Maine courts even for constitutional error;  only the Supreme Court can do that.  See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span>, 416, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></span> (1923).  This leaves open the possibility of injunctive relief against ongoing state proceedings, although it too might face obstacles short of the merits.  See, e.g., Trainor v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109668\"><a href=\"/opinion/109668/trainor-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 444, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109668\"><a href=\"/opinion/109668/trainor-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1911</span></a></span>, 1918, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109668\"><a href=\"/opinion/109668/trainor-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span> (1977) (abstention doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Warren Brown did seek such an injunction in the district court but has not appealed that court's dismissal of the claim as moot.  And the merits are far from clear:  the state obviously has an interest in the conduct of child protection proceedings and in narrowing the issues to the welfare of the children and the interests of those most immediately concerned with their welfare, usually the parents.  The Maine statute has struck a compromise, permitting the grandfather to seek intervention but only with the court's permission based on the best interests of the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possibility remains of unfair application of the statute in an individual case, but whether an individual error would give rise to a federal remedy is another matter.  So long as state law provides an avenue of relief--here, an appeal to higher courts--even a deprivation of protected rights does not automatically give rise to a due process claim.  See Parratt v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110478\"><a href=\"/opinion/110478/parratt-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 544, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110478\"><a href=\"/opinion/110478/parratt-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1908</span></a></span>, 1917, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110478\"><a href=\"/opinion/110478/parratt-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span> (1981).  But this subject is fraught with difficulty and we do not pursue it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, state law may still offer Warren Brown some opportunity for relief if the grandchildren are in foster care or are otherwise not yet placed for adoption.  The initial protection order did effectively bar him from contact;  but it was only an interim order, entered with the consent of the children's mother who during her custody of the children could herself have restricted Warren Brown's contact.  Subsequent orders transferred custody to the Department and then terminated, successively, the parental rights of the children's mother and father, but none of those orders was directed at Warren Brown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state's counsel told us at oral argument that there is no currently effective order barring contact between Warren Brown and his grandchildren, and we can find no trace of such an order in the record.  So long as the children have not been placed for adoption or formally adopted, it is at least possible under Maine law that Warren Brown could still apply for standing and intervenor status in the protection proceeding that transferred custody of his grandchildren to the Department.  22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4005-B(2).  If it were granted, he could also \"request the court to grant the grandparent reasonable rights of visitation or access.\"  22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4005-B(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Family issues, including abuse and custody, are among the most difficult for the law to resolve.  Standards tend to be vague, situations may be wrenching, and the legal tools at hand are often clumsy.  But, especially in the family-law realm, federal damage actions under section 1983 have usually proved to be an ineffective means of adjusting disputes with the authorities.  See generally Ellis v. Hamilton, 669 F.2d at 515-16.   There may be exceptions, but this case is not among them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.
