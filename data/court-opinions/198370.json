Hctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n                                                          Before\r\n\nBoudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nReavley, Senior Circuit Judge,and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nDavid W. Romn for appellant.\r\nJos A. Quiles-Espinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Camille Vlez-Riv, Assistant United States Attorney, were on the brief, for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 11, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Jos Arizaga was convicted by a\r\njury, after a joint trial with three co-defendants, of conspiracy\r\nto possess multiple kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute,\r\nand of two specific instances of cocaine possession with intent to\r\ndistribute, both occurring in the course of the conspiracy. On\r\nappeal, Arizaga claims that the court erred in failing to grant a\r\nnew trial in light of allegedly newly discovered exculpatory\r\nevidence. He also argues that he was deprived of effective\r\nassistance of counsel at trial, and that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to sustain his convictions. We affirm.\r\n                          I.\r\nThe indictment alleged that Arizaga and sixteen other\r\nnamed conspirators were involved in a series of cocaine\r\ntransactions dating from November 1993 through July 1996 in which\r\ncocaine was purchased in Puerto Rico and transported to the\r\nmainland using a variety of methods. The government's case relied\r\nprimarily on the testimony of Luis Chvere, a central figure in\r\nevery drug transaction executed in the course of the conspiracy.\r\nAfter being arrested in May 1995 in connection with an attempted\r\npurchase of ten kilograms of cocaine, Chvere subsequently\r\ntestified as a government witness. A comprehensive description of\r\nall the transactions in furtherance of the conspiracy may be found\r\nin our opinion in United States v. Portela, Nos. 97-2353, 97-2354,\r\n97-2355, slip op. 3-11 (1st Cir. Feb. 9, 1999). For the purposes of\r\nresolving Arizaga's appeal, we describe only the transactions in\r\nwhich he participated directly. \"We recite the facts in the light\r\nmost favorable to the verdicts being appealed.\" United States v.\r\nShifman, 124 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct.\r\n1053 (1998).\r\nIn April 1995, Chvere traveled to Puerto Rico from his\r\nhome in Rochester, New York, in order to purchase a kilogram of\r\ncocaine as a replacement for several kilograms of cocaine which he\r\nhad previously purchased but which had been interdicted by law\r\nenforcement. Chvere's usual suppliers were unable to provide him\r\nwith any cocaine and indicated that the supply of cocaine was\r\nscarce at that time. After several days, Chvere was approached by\r\nArizaga, who offered to procure a kilogram of cocaine. At some\r\npoint afterwards Chvere purchased a kilogram of cocaine from\r\nArizaga for $14,000. Unhappy with the quality of this cocaine,\r\nChvere resold it in Puerto Rico instead of transporting it back to\r\nthe mainland and reselling it there, which had been his usual\r\npractice. The evidence of this transaction produced at trial\r\nconsisted solely of the testimony of Chvere.\r\nOn May 11, 1995, Victor Roldn-Flores informed Chvere of\r\nan opportunity to purchase ten kilograms of cocaine. Since Chvere\r\ndid not have enough cash to complete the transaction, he attempted\r\nto recruit several others to provide capital and share in the\r\npurchase. He first spoke to Arizaga, who agreed to try to recruit\r\nothers to the venture. By the morning of May 12th, Arizaga had\r\nraised enough money to buy one kilogram of the cocaine, and Arizaga\r\nand Chvere together sought out Samuel Rivera-Maldonado, who agreed\r\nto buy two of the ten kilograms. The three of them then met Roldn-\r\nFlores, who was with William Santiago-Coln, and all five men went\r\nto a Burger King in Isla Verde. Arizaga went in Rivera-Maldonado's\r\ntruck, in which the pooled money of all five buyers had been\r\nstowed. Arizaga had contributed $13,000 to the pool. Roldn-Flores\r\nrecognized his supplier driving into the parking lot of the plaza\r\nwhere the Burger King was located; Roldn-Flores went out into the\r\nparking lot to speak to the supplier. Roldn-Flores then returned \r\nto the restaurant and asked Chvere and Rivera-Maldonado to go out\r\ninto the lot and get the money from the truck. The supplier was in\r\nfact an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and all\r\nfive buyers were arrested. Arizaga was in the lavatory of the\r\nBurger King when he was arrested. The evidence of this transaction\r\nadduced at trial was the testimony of Chvere and of the two law\r\nenforcement officers who had conducted surveillance inside the\r\nBurger King during the sting operation.\r\nAfter Chvere was released on bail, he decided to\r\ncooperate with the government. Arizaga had been released later in\r\nthe day after his arrest on May 12, 1995, but he was rearrested in\r\nJuly 1996 in light of inculpatory information provided to law\r\nenforcement by Chvere. Arizaga was charged in three counts of the\r\nindictment. Count One charged conspiracy to possess with intent to\r\ndistribute cocaine. Count Twelve charged him with possession with\r\nintent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine in connection with the\r\nApril 1995 sale to Chvere. Count Fourteen charged him with\r\nattempting to possess with intent to distribute ten kilograms of\r\ncocaine in connection with the Burger King events in May 1995.\r\nArizaga was convicted of all three counts in a jury trial. Shortly\r\nafter conviction, Arizaga filed a pro se motion to dismiss his\r\ntrial counsel; his counsel then requested that he be allowed to\r\nwithdraw and the court granted this motion. Sentencing proceeded\r\nwith new counsel (David W. Romn), and Arizaga was sentenced to\r\nconcurrent terms of 60 and 121 months in prison followed by two\r\nconcurrent five year terms of supervised release, and a special\r\nmonetary assessment. This appeal followed.\r\n                         II.\r\nOn July 21, 1997, after trial but before sentencing,\r\nArizaga (represented by current counsel David W. Romn) filed a\r\nmotion for a new trial, based on trial counsel's alleged\r\nineffective assistance. This motion was denied by the court. On\r\nAugust 20, 1997, Arizaga filed a renewed motion for a new trial\r\naccompanied by a statement from Samuel Rivera-Maldonado, a co-\r\ndefendant who had pled guilty. Rivera-Maldonado's statement\r\nindicates that\r\nMr. Arizaga . . . is completely innocent of\r\nany wrongdoing in this case and had nothing to\r\ndo with the criminal acts charged against him.\r\nTo my knowledge, Mr. Arizaga . . . is\r\ncompletely innocent of the charges against him\r\nbecause he had nothing to do with criminal\r\nacts described in the indictment in this case.\r\n\nThis motion was also denied by the court. Rivera-Maldonado's typed\r\nstatement is dated April 2, 1997, but the word \"June\" is typed on\r\nthe document, crossed out in ink, and the word \"April\" written by\r\nhand in its place.\r\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 authorizes a new\r\ntrial \"if required in the interest of justice.\" A Rule 33 motion\r\nfor a new trial based on newly discovered evidence will not be\r\nallowed unless \"the movant establishes that the evidence was: (i)\r\nunknown or unavailable at the time of trial, (ii) despite due\r\ndiligence, (iii) material, and (iv) likely to result in an\r\nacquittal upon retrial.\" United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 971\r\n(1st Cir. 1995). If any of these four factors are missing, \"then a\r\nRule 33 motion must be denied.\" United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d\r\n302, 313 (1st Cir. 1991). We review the denial of a motion for a\r\nnew trial for \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" Tibolt, 72 F.3d at\r\n972.\r\nEven assuming arguendo the unavailability of Rivera-\r\nMaldonado's statement and testimony at Arizaga's trial, the due\r\ndiligence of trial counsel, and the materiality of the new\r\nevidence, we must ask whether this evidence was likely to result in\r\nacquittal on retrial. There was no such likelihood. Attempts by one\r\ndefendant to take full responsibility for a crime after his guilt\r\nhas been established, or to exonerate a co-defendant, are common\r\nand are properly viewed with skepticism. See United States v.\r\nBenavente Gomez, 921 F.2d 378, 383 (1st Cir. 1990). Rivera-\r\nMaldonado's statement is conclusory in nature and contains nothing\r\nthat might account for or seriously cast doubt upon the directly\r\ncontradictory testimony of Chvere or that of the police officers\r\npresent at the Burger King. Under such circumstances, we conclude\r\nthat the introduction of Rivera-Maldonado's testimony would not\r\nhave been likely to result in Arizaga's acquittal upon retrial. The\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new\r\ntrial.\r\n                         III.\r\nArizaga contends that he was deprived of the effective\r\nassistance of counsel because his trial counsel allegedly failed to\r\ncall Rivera-Maldonado as a witness, interview the manager of the\r\nBurger King restaurant where the arrests were made (who allegedly\r\nwould have testified that Arizaga arrived separately from the other\r\ndefendants), present the government's videotape of the events\r\ntaking place in the parking lot of the Burger King (so as to\r\nestablish that Arizaga was not present in the parking lot), and\r\ndiscover and present medical evidence of Arizaga's chronic\r\ngastrointestinal illness (presumably so as to establish that\r\nArizaga was not necessarily simply hiding from the police in the\r\nlavatory). Arizaga also alleges that counsel frustrated his right\r\nto take the stand.\r\nIneffective assistance of counsel claims require the\r\ndefendant to show that counsel's performance was constitutionally\r\ndeficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the\r\ndefense. Because both findings typically require the resolution of\r\nfactual issues by a trial judge, we have generally declined to\r\nresolve such claims on direct appeal unless the record is\r\nsufficiently developed to permit review of the claim. See United\r\nStates v. Berrios, 132 F.3d 834, 840 (1st Cir. 1998). The court\r\nissued no findings as to trial counsel's performance in rejecting\r\nArizaga's two Rule 33 motions. We have no indication of what\r\ntactical considerations may have motivated counsel's decisions not\r\nto call Rivera-Maldonado or present the videotape, nor do we have\r\nevidence of the extent of counsel's discovery efforts. The\r\naffidavit of counsel in the record indicates only that counsel\r\ninformed Arizaga of his right to testify. Therefore, the record\r\nbefore us is inadequate to resolve the ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel claim raised by Arizaga, and we decline to address it.\r\n                         IV.\r\nArizaga moved for a judgment of acquittal, pursuant to\r\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, at the close of the\r\ngovernment's case and again at the close of all the evidence. Rule\r\n29 allows for entry of a judgment of acquittal \"if the evidence is\r\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Arizaga argues that the\r\nevidence against him was insufficient because he \"was convicted\r\nsolely on the uncorroborated accomplice testimony of Luis\r\n[Chvere], given more than a year after the events charged in the\r\nindictment.\" Arizaga claims the delay and the alleged lack of\r\ncorroboration make Chvere's testimony \"facially incredible\" and\r\n\"unbelievable as a matter of law.\" In assessing a sufficiency\r\nchallenge, \"we review the record to determine whether the evidence\r\nand reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the\r\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational\r\njury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was\r\nguilty as charged.\" United States v. Alicea-Cardoza, 132 F.3d 1, 5\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\"[A] conviction based solely upon the uncorroborated\r\ntestimony of an accomplice can be upheld, as long as the jury is\r\nproperly instructed and the testimony is not incredible as a matter\r\nof law.\" United States v. Hernndez, 109 F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir.\r\n1997). In this case, \"[t]he judge gave complete and correct\r\ninstructions detailing the special care the jury should take in\r\nassessing the testimony,\" United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996\r\nF.2d 436, 438-39 (1st Cir. 1993), and Chvere's testimony was not\r\n\"incredible or insubstantial on its face,\" United States v. Aponte-\r\nSuarez, 905 F.2d 483, 488 (1st Cir. 1990). Chvere's testimony as\r\nto the May transaction was in fact substantially corroborated by\r\nthe testimony of the two police officers who provided surveillance\r\nat the Burger King and participated in the arrests. Moreover,\r\nnothing about the delay between the time of Chvere's arrest and\r\nthe time at which he implicated Arizaga while cooperating with the\r\ngovernment (at most, fourteen months) made his testimony incredible\r\nas a matter of law. A rational juror could have relied upon it to\r\nfind Arizaga guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Arizaga also alleges that counsel frustrated his right\r\nto take the stand.\r\nIneffective assistance of counsel claims require the\r\ndefendant to show that counsel's performance was constitutionally\r\ndeficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the\r\ndefense. Because both findings typically require the resolution of\r\nfactual issues by a trial judge, we have generally declined to\r\nresolve such claims on direct appeal unless the record is\r\nsufficiently developed to permit review of the claim. See United\r\nStates v. Berrios, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749864\"><a href=\"/opinion/749864/united-states-v-george-berrios-aka-antonio-candelario-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 840 (1st Cir. 1998). The court\r\nissued no findings as to trial counsel's performance in rejecting\r\nArizaga's two Rule 33 motions. We have no indication of what\r\ntactical considerations may have motivated counsel's decisions not\r\nto call Rivera-Maldonado or present the videotape, nor do we have\r\nevidence of the extent of counsel's discovery efforts. The\r\naffidavit of counsel in the record indicates only that counsel\r\ninformed Arizaga of his right to testify. Therefore, the record\r\nbefore us is inadequate to resolve the ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel claim raised by Arizaga, and we decline to address it.\r\n                         IV.\r\nArizaga moved for a judgment of acquittal, pursuant to\r\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, at the close of the\r\ngovernment's case and again at the close of all the evidence. Rule\r\n29 allows for entry of a judgment of acquittal \"if the evidence is\r\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Arizaga argues that the\r\nevidence against him was insufficient because he \"was convicted\r\nsolely on the uncorroborated accomplice testimony of Luis\r\n[Chvere], given more than a year after the events charged in the\r\nindictment.\" Arizaga claims the delay and the alleged lack of\r\ncorroboration make Chvere's testimony \"facially incredible\" and\r\n\"unbelievable as a matter of law.\" In assessing a sufficiency\r\nchallenge, \"we review the record to determine whether the evidence\r\nand reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the\r\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational\r\njury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was\r\nguilty as charged.\" United States v. Alicea-Cardoza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749441\"><a href=\"/opinion/749441/united-states-v-luis-a-alicea-cardoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\"[A] conviction based solely upon the uncorroborated\r\ntestimony of an accomplice can be upheld, as long as the jury is\r\nproperly instructed and the testimony is not incredible as a matter\r\nof law.\" United States v. Hernndez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197246\"><a href=\"/opinion/197246/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir.\r\n1997). In this case, \"[t]he judge gave complete and correct\r\ninstructions detailing the special care the jury should take in\r\nassessing the testimony,\" United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609732\"><a href=\"/opinion/609732/united-states-v-luis-e-ortiz-arrigoitia-aka-colibri-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438-39 (1st Cir. 1993), and Chvere's testimony was not\r\n\"incredible or insubstantial on its face,\" United States v. Aponte-\r\nSuarez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543061\"><a href=\"/opinion/543061/united-states-v-emigdio-aponte-suarez-united-states-of-america-v-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488 (1st Cir. 1990). Chvere's testimony as\r\nto the May transaction was in fact substantially corroborated by\r\nthe testimony of the two police officers who provided surveillance\r\nat the Burger King and participated in the arrests. Moreover,\r\nnothing about the delay between the time of Chvere's arrest and\r\nthe time at which he implicated Arizaga while cooperating with the\r\ngovernment (at most, fourteen months) made his testimony incredible\r\nas a matter of law. A rational juror could have relied upon it to\r\nfind Arizaga guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
