Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nDavid James Wyatt on brief pro se.\r\nMalcolm S. Medley, Special Assistant Corporation Counsel, Boston\r\nPublic Schools, on brief for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                         May 1, 1998\r\n\n       Per Curiam.  Appellant David James Wyatt appeals the\r\ndismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim under\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and for failure to plead fraud with\r\nthe particularity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  After\r\nreviewing the record and the parties' briefs, we affirm the\r\njudgment of the district court for essentially the reasons\r\nstated in its Memorandum and Order, dated August 22, 1997, and\r\nother dispositive reasons on the merits.  We add only the\r\nfollowing comments.\r\n         1.  Even assuming appellant alleged fraud with the\r\nrequisite specificity, a careful reading of the complaint and\r\nappellant's brief demonstrates a complete failure, on the\r\nmerits, to state a common law claim of fraud.  Central to such\r\na claim is the making of a false statement by a defendant.  SeeTurner v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, 809 F.2d 90, 95 (1st Cir. 1986);\r\nMacoviak v. Chase Home Mortgage Corp., 40 Mass. App. Ct. 755,\r\n760, 667 N.E.2d 900, 904 (1996).  We find no relevant false\r\nstatements here.\r\n         First, because the definitions of \"good cause\" and\r\n\"just cause\" in the two versions of M.G.L.c. 71,  42 are\r\nvirtually identical in all pertinent aspects -- both versions\r\ninclude incompetency as cause for dismissal -- the\r\nrepresentation that there was \"just cause\" to dismiss appellant\r\nwas not false.  Second, since the Education Reform Act of 1993\r\nwas an emergency law, it became effective on the date it was\r\napproved -- June 18, 1993.  See Connolly v. Division of Pub.\r\nEmployee Retirement Admin., 415 Mass. 800, 803 n.3, 616 N.E.2d\r\n59, 61 n.3 (1993).  This means that defendants' statements to\r\nWyatt that review of the termination decision had to proceed\r\nunder the terms of the new Act were, in fact, true.  In this\r\ncontext, we reject appellant's argument that Superintendent's\r\nCircular No. 2 was part of the collective bargaining agreement\r\nand thus, under  77 of the Reform Act, trumped the application\r\nof new  42.  As a result, there was no breach of state law,\r\nand, consequently, no fraud.  Based on the foregoing, appellant\r\nhas no claim of fraud, and thus no further lawsuits, against\r\nany of the defendants, including Lois Harrison-Jones and Paul\r\nParks.\r\n         2.  As for appellant's motion for a default judgment\r\nagainst defendants, we conclude that the district court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in denying the motion.  See Coyante v.\r\nPuerto Rico Ports Auth., 105 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nSince appellant does not dispute the district court's\r\nobservation that he has filed many cases and appeals involving\r\nthe same defendants, the court's conclusion that the May 10,\r\n1996 order may have been misfiled due to the confusion created\r\nby these cases and appeals can hardly be called an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  It therefore is plain that the case at hand did\r\nnot represent an \"extreme situation\" requiring the \"drastic\r\nsanction\" of a default judgment.  See id.\r\n         The judgment of the district court is affirmed; all\r\npending motions are denied as moot.\r\n",
