Eugene W. Beaulieu, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n                      September 15, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam.    Plaintiff/appellant Upham appeals the\n\ngrant of summary judgment to defendant/appellee Gallant.\n\nUpham alleges that, while he was a pretrial detainee in the\n\nPenobscot County Jail, his civil rights were violated by\n\nGallant, the jail administrator, because she failed to take\n\nreasonable steps to ensure his safety from the violent\n\nbehavior of another inmate.          We affirm, albeit on grounds\n\ndifferent from those relied upon by the court below.\n\n            Under the Eighth Amendment, \"prison officials . .\n\n. must 'take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of\n\nthe inmates.'\"      Giroux v. Somerset County, 178 F.3d 38, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n\n832 (1994) (internal quotations omitted)).                While the\n\nprovisions of the Eighth Amendment do not extend to pretrial\n\ndetainees,    the    Due   Process    Clause   of   the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment provides them with \"rights [which] are at least as\n\ngreat as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a\n\nconvicted    prisoner.\"      Revere    v.   Massachusetts    General\n\nHospital, 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983); see also Henderson v.\n\nSheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 844 n.2 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"Although\n\nthe Eight Amendment does not extend to pretrial detainees .\n\n. . the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fprotects pretrial detainees under the same standard as the\n\nEighth Amendment.\"); Hare v. City of Corinth, 74 F.3d 633,\n\n643   (5th   Cir.    1996)   (same).     Consequently,     a   pretrial\n\ndetainee is entitled to have reasonable measures taken to\n\ninsure his safety.       See, e.g., Lopez v. LeMaster, 172 F.3d\n\n756, 759 (10th Cir. 1999) (prison officials are responsible\n\nfor taking reasonable measures to insure safety of pretrial\n\ndetainees).\n\n             Still, not every injury suffered by a prisoner or\n\npretrial detainee at the hands of a fellow inmate gives rise\n\nto a constitutional violation, but only one which,                inter\n\nalia, results from the \"deliberate indifference\" of prison\n\nofficials to the inmate's safety.           Giroux, 178 F.3d at 32.\n\nViewed in the light most favorable to Upham, the facts in\n\nthis case are insufficient to support a finding that Gallant\n\nacted with deliberate indifference.\n\n             Upham   alleges   that     Gallant   caused   his   injury\n\nbecause she failed to institute a policy which would have\n\nprevented Upham's being assigned to a cell in which he was\n\nexposed to danger.       However, for a supervisor to be liable\n\nunder § 1983 for failure to control her subordinates, it\n\nmust be shown that her failure to act caused the violation\n\n\"in the sense that it could be characterized as supervisory\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fencouragement,        condonation,          or      acquiescence       or     gross\n\nnegligence amounting to deliberate indifference.\"                           Lipsett\n\nv. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 902 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (quotations omitted).                 Gallant's policy of leaving\n\ncell   assignment       to    the     discretion         of   lower   level    jail\n\npersonnel, subject to administrative review, cannot be so\n\ncharacterized.        Moreover, \"[a]n important factor in making\n\nthe determination of liability is whether the official was\n\nput on some kind of notice of the alleged violations; for\n\none cannot make a 'deliberate' or 'conscious' choice to act\n\nor not to act unless confronted with a problem that requires\n\nthe taking of affirmative steps.\"                       Id. (quoting Pembaur v.\n\nCity of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 483 (1986)); see also Jane\n\nDoe \"A\" v. Special School District, 901 F.2d 642, 645 (8th\n\nCir. 1990) (for supervisor to be subject to liability,\n\nplaintiff      must     show,       inter   alia,         that   supervisor    had\n\n\"received      notice    of     a   pattern        of    unconstitutional     acts\n\ncommitted by subordinates\").                   In the instant case, the\n\nrecord fails to allege even a single prior incident which\n\nmight have put Gallant on notice that present procedures\n\nwere inadequate or that her failure to institute further\n\npolicies had resulted in, or in the future would likely\n\nresult   in,    the     violation      of     an    inmate's     constitutional\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\frights.
