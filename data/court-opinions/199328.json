The General Counsel of the\n\nNational Labor Relations Board brought an unfair labor practice charge\n\nagainst Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates, Inc. for having unilaterally\n\ndiscontinued certain group insurance policies it had obtained for its\n\nemployees. Posadas now petitions this Court for review of a decision\n\nand order in which the Board concluded that Posadas had committed an\n\nunfair labor practice.    The General Counsel has, in turn, cross-\n\npetitioned to enforce the order. The Board found that Posadas engaged\n\nin an unfair labor practice in violation of sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of\n\nthe National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(a)(1) and (5), when\n\nit unilaterally discontinued a group cancer and life insurance policy\n\nthat had been in effect for 20 years without first bargaining to\n\nimpasse with the Union. Because the Board’s order is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence on the record as a whole, we deny Posadas’s\n\npetition for review, and grant the Board’s cross-petition to enforce\n\nits order.\n\n                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n          Posadas operates the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino, a hotel\n\nin San Juan, Puerto Rico. Some of the casino employees are represented\n\nby the Asociación de Empleados de Casino (the “Union”). In April 1978,\n\nPosadas took out a cancer and life insurance policy with Maccabees\n\nMutual Life Insurance Company to enable its employees to obtain life\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fand cancer insurance at group rates.1 For almost 20 years, Posadas made\n\npayroll deductions from its unit employees’ paychecks to cover premium\n\npayments, and remitted the total amount to Maccabees and to the other\n\ninsurance companies.\n\n          On April 14, 1998, Posadas notified the insurance companies\n\nthat it would no longer make payroll deductions for the life and cancer\n\npolicy premiums as of May 1, 1998, and asked the companies to “make the\n\nnecessary arrangements to invoice the employees directly.” The next\n\nday, April 15, 1998, Posadas notified its employees of the decision.\n\nShortly thereafter, Union president Victor Villalba contacted Eddie\n\nOrtiz, Posadas’s personnel director, to discuss the matter and explore\n\nplausible alternatives. Ortiz replied that the matter was out of his\n\nhands, and told Villalba that the decision to discontinue the group\n\npolicies had been made “higher up.”\n\n          On April 22, 1998, a week after Posadas notified its\n\nemployees about the decision, Kenneth S. Krans of Adolfo Krans\n\nAssociates, Inc., a general insurance agency representing several of\n\nthe insurance companies that extended group coverage to Posadas, wrote\n\na letter replying to Posadas’s April 14, 1998 letter. Krans stated\n\n\n\n     1     In addition to its policy with Maccabees, Posadas made\nsimilar arrangements with various other insurance companies to provide\nits employees additional options for obtaining life and cancer\ninsurance at group rates. As with the Maccabees policy, Posadas would\ndeduct the premium amounts from its covered employees’ paychecks and\nremit the total amount to the insurance companies.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthat the then-existing group coverage was provided through a\n\n“‘bonafide’ group contract,” and added that such a contract “was\n\napplied for and issued under the representation that it was an\n\nemployer-paid benefit.” Krans further stated that his company had no\n\nknowledge about any internal agreement between Posadas and its\n\nemployees regarding payment of the policy premiums.\n\n          Krans told Posadas that his company could arrange for\n\nindividual coverage as of May 1, 1998, but warned that such a change\n\nwould not be as simple as Posadas might have believed, given that the\n\nemployees previously covered under the group policy would now be\n\nsubject to “individual insurability and rates.” Krans suggested that\n\nPosadas extend the policy cancellation date to allow covered employees\n\nsufficient time to secure individual coverage. Posadas declined to\n\nfollow Krans’s suggestion, however, and discontinued its withholding\n\npractice -– and thereby cancelled all group cancer and life insurance\n\npolicies –- effective May 1, 1998.\n\n          The Union filed an unfair labor practice charge, and the\n\nBoard’s General Counsel filed a complaint against Posadas shortly\n\nthereafter. On May 5, 1999, the Administrative Law Judge found that\n\nPosadas’s actions constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of\n\nsections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act, and ordered Posadas to resume,\n\nupon written request from the Union, its past practice of making\n\npayroll deductions for the group cancer and life insurance policies, to\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fuse best efforts to restore those policies, and to make Union employees\n\nwhole for any losses incurred as a result of the unilateral change.\n\nBoth the General Counsel and Posadas filed exceptions to the ALJ’s\n\nfindings and conclusions.\n\n          On February 25, 2000, the Board upheld the ALJ’s findings and\n\nconclusion that Posadas had violated sections 8(a)(1) and (5) by\n\nunilaterally terminating the payroll deductions for the insurance\n\npremiums for the group life and cancer insurance policies without\n\nbargaining with the Union over the change. The Board modified the\n\nremedies decreed by the ALJ and ordered Posadas to restore the status\n\nquo ante by resuming its past practice of making payroll deductions for\n\nthe group cancer and life insurance policies, restoring the policies\n\nfor previously covered unit employees, and making the employees whole\n\nfor any losses they may have suffered as a result of the unilateral\n\nchange. Additionally, the Board ordered Posadas to bargain with the\n\nUnion in the future over any changes in the group cancer and life\n\ninsurance policies that affect unit employees.\n\n                       II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          We review the Board’s conclusion of law de novo, NLRB v.\n\nBeverly Enterprise-Massachusetts, Inc., 174 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), and take the Board’s findings of fact to be “conclusive if\n\nsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.”\n\nId.; see also 29 U.S.C. § 160(e).      Substantial evidence is “such\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\frelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\n\nsupport a conclusion.” Beverly Entreprise-Massachusetts, 174 F.3d at\n\n21. Moreover, “the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions\n\nfrom the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency’s finding\n\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.” Id. “In particular,\n\nthe credibility determinations of the Administrative Law Judge [ ] who\n\nheard and saw the witnesses are entitled to great weight.” NLRB v.\n\nHospital San Pablo, Inc., 207 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n                          III. DISCUSSION\n\n          An employer commits an unfair labor practice “if, without\n\nbargaining to impasse, it effects a unilateral change in an existing\n\nterm or condition of employment.” Visiting Nurse Servs. v. NLRB, 177\n\nF.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 787 (2000); Litton\n\nFinancial Printing Div. v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190, 198 (1991). The Board\n\nhas “the primary responsibility of marking out the scope of the\n\nstatutory language and of the statutory duty to bargain.” Ford Motor\n\nCo. v. NLRB, 441 U.S. 488, 496 (1979). Particularly with respect to\n\ndeterminations that fall within the Board’s “special expertise,” such\n\nas whether an issue is a mandatory subject of bargaining, the Board is\n\nentitled to “considerable deference,” and its determination must be\n\nupheld if reasonable and consistent with the policies of the Act. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fat 497; see also Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, 174 F.3d at 26, 29.\n\n\n\n          We have long held that an insurance benefit is a mandatory\n\nsubject of bargaining and that unilateral actions regarding such\n\nsubjects are proscribed by the Act. Allied Chem. & Alkali Workers of\n\nAm. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 404 U.S. 157, 159 (1971) (citing\n\nW.W. Cross & Co. v. NLRB, 174 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir. 1949)).\n\nInsurance benefits have been typically regarded as mandatory subjects\n\nof bargaining because they provide “direct and immediate economic\n\nbenefits from the employment relationship,” and because they “provide\n\na financial cushion in the event of illness or injury ... at less cost\n\nthan such a cushion could be obtained through contracts or insurance\n\nnegotiated individually.”     W.W. Cross & Co., 174 F.2d at 878.\n\n          Posadas’s principal argument is that the withholding practice\n\nwas neither a benefit nor a term or condition of employment, but rather\n\na mere internal mechanism that it was free to eliminate unilaterally\n\nwhen it so chose. Posadas contends that it was not required to bargain\n\nto impasse before making the unilateral change because it did not\n\ncontribute to the premium payments, but merely collected the premiums\n\nand remitted them to the insurance companies. Posadas concedes, as it\n\nmust, that an insurance benefit is “vital” to employees and is a\n\nmandatory subject of bargaining, but argues that the impact of its\n\ndecision on the group insurance policies was merely incidental.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Posadas’s attempt to frame its actions as having to do only\n\nwith an internal company mechanism is disingenuous. The record plainly\n\nshows that the withholding practice and the group insurance policy were\n\ninextricably intertwined. The April 1998 exchange of letters between\n\nPosadas and Krans reveals that the unilateral decision that Posadas was\n\ncontemplating would have had the effect of eliminating the group\n\ninsurance policy altogether. A corollary of that decision, therefore,\n\nwould be that previously covered employees would be forced to secure\n\nindividual coverage at individual policy rates. Thus, by eliminating\n\nthe withholding practice, Posadas did much more than eliminate an\n\n“internal mechanism”; it unilaterally removed a group insurance policy\n\nthat Posadas’s unit employees had been able to avail themselves of for\n\nalmost twenty years.    Given that the decision had the effect of\n\nunilaterally changing a long term benefit, Posadas was required to\n\nbargain with the Union to impasse. We doubt that Posadas could hide\n\nbehind an ignorance defense, but, even if it could, such a defense is\n\nnot supported by the record.\n\n          Moreover, the Board found, based on the uncontested testimony\n\noffered by Elsie Santana, a Krans employee, that group policies were\n\nconsiderably less expensive than individual policies. Accordingly,\n\nPosadas’s longstanding practice of withholding and remitting premiums\n\nallowed covered employees to obtain group coverage at rates\n\nsignificantly below what they could have obtained individually. Such\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fa benefit existed regardless of whether Posadas itself contributed to\n\nthe premium payments.\n\n          Posadas’s reliance on Seattle First National Bank v. NLRB,\n\n444 F.2d 30 (9th Cir. 1971), McCall Corp. v. NLRB, 432 F.2d 187 (4th\n\nCir. 1970), and Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. NLRB, 387 F.2d 542 (4th\n\nCir. 1967) for the proposition that its unilateral action did not\n\nimpinge on an issue traditionally considered “vital” to employees is\n\nunavailing.   None of these cases even remotely suggests that an\n\nemployer can unilaterally eliminate a benefit (insurance-related or\n\notherwise) without bargaining with the Union, by claiming that it\n\nactually intended to undertake an unrelated, internal administrative\n\naction that happened to cause an adverse effect on the benefit at\n\nissue. In Seattle First National Bank, for example, the Ninth Circuit\n\nspecifically noted (pointing to our opinion in W.W. Cross Co., supra)\n\nthat group insurance plans involve issues traditionally considered\n\n“vital” to employees, as opposed to bank services, the putative benefit\n\nat issue in that case. Seattle First National Bank, 444 F.2d at 35\n\nn.8.\n\n          Similarly, McCall and Westinghouse involved minor food price\n\nincreases -- issues quite different from those presented here. In both\n\ncases, the employees had alternative places to eat, or they could bring\n\ntheir own lunches; in neither instance were the cafeteria plants so\n\nisolated that employees were dependent on the food that caused the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fcontroversies. Although the Fourth Circuit held that such issues were\n\nnot required subjects for bargaining, none of the actions complained of\n\nin either case impinged (directly or indirectly) on a traditionally\n\n“vital” issue, such as insurance benefits. Westinghouse, 387 F.2d at\n\n550; McCall, 432 F.2d at 188.\n\n          Posadas further contends (again focusing solely on the\n\nwithholding practice) that its unilateral action was not one\n\ntraditionally considered “vital” because unit employees “could have\n\nmaintained the life and cancer insurance policies by simply making the\n\npremium payments themselves . . . .” Posadas Brief at 11. The record\n\nprovides no support for that proposition. To the contrary, Krans’s\n\nApril 22, 1998 letter, stating that the cancellation of the policy\n\nwould subject covered employees to “individual insurability and rates”\n\n(emphasis supplied), suggests precisely the opposite. Indeed, the\n\nrecord shows that the employees could not have maintained the same\n\ncoverage at the same cost – even assuming they were individually\n\ninsurable – by making the premium payments themselves.\n\n          None of Posadas’s remaining arguments calls for a contrary\n\nconclusion. Posadas contends, for example, that its employees could\n\nhave maintained their coverage by making premium payments directly to\n\nthe insurance companies. The record shows, however, that Posadas’s\n\nemployees could not have maintained the same level of coverage by\n\npaying the premiums themselves; any coverage after May 1, 1998, would\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fhave been subject to individual rates, and would therefore have been\n\nmore expensive.2 Posadas also contends that its withholding practice\n\nwas not a term and condition of employment because it was not embodied\n\nin the collective bargaining agreement with the Union. The argument is\n\nmeritless. An item that is not addressed in a collective bargaining\n\nagreement can become a term and condition of employment, and hence a\n\nmandatory subject of bargaining, if it has been “satisfactorily\n\nestablished” by past practice or custom. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co.,\n\n291 NLRB 489, 493 (1988). Here, we have a practice that was carried\n\nout for almost twenty years, resulting in substantial reliance by\n\nPosadas’s unit employees. As the Board noted, it is that longstanding\n\nhistory -- coupled with the nature of the benefit at issue -- that\n\ntransformed this practice into a term or condition of employment. As\n\nsuch, Posadas was required to bargain to impasse.\n\n          We need go no further. The record amply supports the Board’s\n\nconclusion that Posadas provided its unit employees with an insurance\n\nbenefit, and that, as a result, it was not free to eliminate that\n\nbenefit unilaterally without offering the Union the opportunity to\n\nbargain concerning that change.         Posadas’s unilateral actions\n\n\n\n     2There is a dispute regarding whether unit employees could have\ncontinued to receive group rates had they transferred over within a\nspecific grace period provided by the insurance companies. Even\nassuming arguendo that this alternative solution was available,\nPosadas’s argument ignores the fact that its own actions created the\nproblem of which it now complains.\n\n                                 -11-\n\feffectively eliminated the group policy and left previously-covered\n\nemployees without a critically important benefit. Posadas’s past\n\npractice of withholding premium payments was a term and condition of\n\nemployment that triggered the duty to bargain. Its failure to do so\n\nconstituted an unfair labor practice.\n\n          Lastly, Posadas argues that the remedy imposed by the Board\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion. It is well-settled that the Board\n\nhas “the primary responsibility and broad discretion to devise remedies\n\nthat effectuate the policies of the Act,” and that discretion is\n\n“subject only to limited judicial review.” Pegasus Broadcasting of San\n\nJuan v. NLRB, 82 F.3d 511, 513 (1st Cir. 1996).       Pursuant to its\n\nauthority under 29 U.S.C. § 160(c), the Board ordered a remedy\n\ndirecting Posadas to, inter alia, (1) resume its practice of making\n\npayroll deductions for group cancer and life insurance policies, (2)\n\nrestore the policies for previously covered unit employees, and (3)\n\nmake the employees whole for any losses they may have suffered as a\n\nresult of the unilateral change. We have consistently maintained that\n\na Board-ordered remedy “should stand unless it can be shown that [it]\n\nis a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly\n\nbe said to effectuate the policies of the Act.” Id. (quoting Virginia\n\nElec. & Power Co. v. NLRB, 319 U.S. 533, 540 (1943)).\n\n          The Board acted within its sound discretion in ordering the\n\nrestoration of the status quo.       Had it not been for Posadas’s\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\funilateral alteration of the terms and condition of employment, the\n\ncovered employees would have continued to enjoy the benefit of life and\n\ncancer insurance at group rates. Posadas’s proposed remedy –- to\n\nbargain over the resumption of payroll deductions, which Posadas had no\n\nright to eliminate unilaterally -– would effectively place the unit\n\nemployees “behind the line of scrimmage.” Id. at 514. There is no\n\nreason to disturb the remedy ordered by the Board.\n\n                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny Posadas’s petition for\n\nreview and grant the Board’s cross-petition to enforce its order.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f",

Krans stated that the then-existing group coverage was provided through a \"'bonafide' group contract,\" and added that such a contract \"was applied for and issued under the representation that it was an employer-paid benefit.\" Krans further stated that his company had no knowledge about any internal agreement between Posadas and its employees regarding payment of the policy premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Krans told Posadas that his company could arrange for individual coverage as of May 1, 1998, but warned that such a change would not be as simple as Posadas might have believed, given that the employees previously covered under the group policy would now be subject to \"individual insurability and rates.\" Krans suggested that Posadas extend the policy cancellation date to allow covered employees sufficient time to secure individual coverage.

The Board modified the remedies decreed by the ALJ and ordered Posadas to restore the status quo ante by resuming its past practice of making payroll deductions for the group cancer and life insurance policies, restoring the policies for previously covered unit employees, and making the employees whole for any losses they may have suffered as a result of the unilateral change.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employer commits an unfair labor practice \"if, without bargaining to impasse, it effects a unilateral change in an existing term or condition of employment.\" Visiting Nurse Servs. v.

The Board has \"the primary responsibility of marking out the scope of the statutory language and of the statutory duty to bargain.\" Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, 441 U.S. 488, 496 (1979). Particularly with respect to determinations that fall within the Board's \"special expertise,\" such as whether an issue is a mandatory subject of bargaining, the Board is entitled to \"considerable deference,\" and its determination must be upheld if reasonable and consistent with the policies of the Act. Id. at 497; see also Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, 174 F.3d at 26, 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have long held that an insurance benefit is a mandatory subject of bargaining and that unilateral actions regarding such subjects are proscribed by the Act. Allied Chem. &amp; Alkali Workers of Am. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 404 U.S. 157, 159 (1971) (citing W.W. Cross &amp; Co. v. NLRB, 174 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir. 1949)). Insurance benefits have been typically regarded as mandatory subjects of bargaining because they provide \"direct and immediate economic benefits from the employment relationship,\" and because they \"provide a financial cushion in the event of illness or injury ... at less cost than such a cushion could be obtained through contracts or insurance negotiated individually.\" W.W. Cross &amp; Co., 174 F.2d at 878.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas's principal argument is that the withholding practice was neither a benefit nor a term or condition of employment, but rather a mere internal mechanism that it was free to eliminate unilaterally when it so chose. Posadas contends that it was not required to bargain to impasse before making the unilateral change because it did not contribute to the premium payments, but merely collected the premiums and remitted them to the insurance companies. Posadas concedes, as it must, that an insurance benefit is \"vital\" to employees and is a mandatory subject of bargaining, but argues that the impact of its decision on the group insurance policies was merely incidental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas's attempt to frame its actions as having to do only with an internal company mechanism is disingenuous. The record plainly shows that the withholding practice and the group insurance policy were inextricably intertwined. The April 1998 exchange of letters between Posadas and Krans reveals that the unilateral decision that Posadas was contemplating would have had the effect of eliminating the group insurance policy altogether. A corollary of that decision, therefore, would be that previously covered employees would be forced to secure individual coverage at individual policy rates. Thus, by eliminating the withholding practice, Posadas did much more than eliminate an \"internal mechanism\"; it unilaterally removed a group insurance policy that Posadas's unit employees had been able to avail themselves of for almost twenty years. Given that the decision had the effect of unilaterally changing a long term benefit, Posadas was required to bargain with the Union to impasse. We doubt that Posadas could hide behind an ignorance defense, but, even if it could, such a defense is not supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Board found, based on the uncontested testimony offered by Elsie Santana, a Krans employee, that group policies were considerably less expensive than individual policies. Accordingly, Posadas's longstanding practice of withholding and remitting premiums allowed covered employees to obtain group coverage at rates significantly below what they could have obtained individually. Such a benefit existed regardless of whether Posadas itself contributed to the premium payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas's reliance on Seattle First National Bank v. NLRB, 444 F.2d 30 (9th Cir. 1971), McCall Corp. v. NLRB, 432 F.2d 187 (4th Cir. 1970), and Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. NLRB, 387 F.2d 542 (4th Cir. 1967) for the proposition that its unilateral action did not impinge on an issue traditionally considered \"vital\" to employees is unavailing. None of these cases even remotely suggests that an employer can unilaterally eliminate a benefit (insurance-related or otherwise) without bargaining with the Union, by claiming that it actually intended to undertake an unrelated, internal administrative action that happened to cause an adverse effect on the benefit at issue. In Seattle First National Bank, for example, the Ninth Circuit specifically noted (pointing to our opinion in W.W. Cross Co., supra) that group insurance plans involve issues traditionally considered \"vital\" to employees, as opposed to bank services, the putative benefit at issue in that case. Seattle First National Bank, 444 F.2d at 35 n.8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, McCall and Westinghouse involved minor food price increases -- issues quite different from those presented here. In both cases, the employees had alternative places to eat, or they could bring their own lunches; in neither instance were the cafeteria plants so isolated that employees were dependent on the food that caused the controversies. Although the Fourth Circuit held that such issues were not required subjects for bargaining, none of the actions complained of in either case impinged (directly or indirectly) on a traditionally \"vital\" issue, such as insurance benefits. Westinghouse, 387 F.2d at 550; McCall, 432 F.2d at 188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas further contends (again focusing solely on the withholding practice) that its unilateral action was not one traditionally considered \"vital\" because unit employees \"could have maintained the life and cancer insurance policies by simply making the premium payments themselves . . . .\" Posadas Brief at 11. The record provides no support for that proposition. To the contrary, Krans's April 22, 1998 letter, stating that the cancellation of the policy would subject covered employees to \"individual insurability and rates\" (emphasis supplied), suggests precisely the opposite. Indeed, the record shows that the employees could not have maintained the same coverage at the same cost - even assuming they were individually insurable - by making the premium payments themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of Posadas's remaining arguments calls for a contrary conclusion. Posadas contends, for example, that its employees could have maintained their coverage by making premium payments directly to the insurance companies. The record shows, however, that Posadas's employees could not have maintained the same level of coverage by paying the premiums themselves; any coverage after May 1, 1998, would have been subject to individual rates, and would therefore have been more expensive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Posadas also contends that its withholding practice was not a term and condition of employment because it was not embodied in the collective bargaining agreement with the Union. The argument is meritless. An item that is not addressed in a collective bargaining agreement can become a term and condition of employment, and hence a mandatory subject of bargaining, if it has been \"satisfactorily established\" by past practice or custom. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co., 291 NLRB 489, 493 (1988). Here, we have a practice that was carried out for almost twenty years, resulting in substantial reliance by Posadas's unit employees. As the Board noted, it is that longstanding history -- coupled with the nature of the benefit at issue -- that transformed this practice into a term or condition of employment. As such, Posadas was required to bargain to impasse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The record amply supports the Board's conclusion that Posadas provided its unit employees with an insurance benefit, and that, as a result, it was not free to eliminate that benefit unilaterally without offering the Union the opportunity to bargain concerning that change. Posadas's unilateral actions effectively eliminated the group policy and left previously-covered employees without a critically important benefit. Posadas's past practice of withholding premium payments was a term and condition of employment that triggered the duty to bargain. Its failure to do so constituted an unfair labor practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Posadas argues that the remedy imposed by the Board constituted an abuse of discretion. It is well-settled that the Board has \"the primary responsibility and broad discretion to devise remedies that effectuate the policies of the Act,\" and that discretion is \"subject only to limited judicial review.\" Pegasus Broadcasting of San Juan v. NLRB, 82 F.3d 511, 513 (1st Cir. 1996). Pursuant to its authority under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(c), the Board ordered a remedy directing Posadas to, inter alia, (1) resume its practice of making payroll deductions for group cancer and life insurance policies, (2) restore the policies for previously covered unit employees, and (3) make the employees whole for any losses they may have suffered as a result of the unilateral change. We have consistently maintained that a Board-ordered remedy \"should stand unless it can be shown that [it] is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\" Id. (quoting Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, 319 U.S. 533, 540 (1943)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board acted within its sound discretion in ordering the restoration of the status quo. Had it not been for Posadas's unilateral alteration of the terms and condition of employment, the covered employees would have continued to enjoy the benefit of life and cancer insurance at group rates. Posadas's proposed remedy -- to bargain over the resumption of payroll deductions, which Posadas had no right to eliminate unilaterally -- would effectively place the unit employees \"behind the line of scrimmage.\" Id. at 514. There is no reason to disturb the remedy ordered by the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Posadas's petition for review and grant the Board's cross-petition to enforce its order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to its policy with Maccabees, Posadas made similar arrangements with various other insurance companies to provide its employees additional options for obtaining life and cancer insurance at group rates. As with the Maccabees policy, Posadas would deduct the premium amounts from its covered employees' paychecks and remit the total amount to the insurance companies.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is a dispute regarding whether unit employees could have continued to receive group rates had they transferred over within a specific grace period provided by the insurance companies. Even assuming arguendo that this alternative solution was available, Posadas's argument ignores the fact that its own actions created the problem of which it now complains.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Posadas now petitions this Court for review of a decision and order in which the Board concluded that Posadas had committed an unfair labor practice. The General Counsel has, in turn, cross-petitioned to enforce the order. The Board found that Posadas engaged in an unfair labor practice in violation of sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 158(a)(1) and (5), when it unilaterally discontinued a group cancer and life insurance policy that had been in effect for 20 years without first bargaining to impasse with the Union.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas operates the Condado Plaza Hotel and Casino, a hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Some of the casino employees are represented by the Asociacion de Empleados de Casino (the \"Union\"). In April 1978, Posadas took out a cancer and life insurance policy with Maccabees Mutual Life Insurance Company to enable its employees to obtain life and cancer insurance at group rates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For almost 20 years, Posadas made payroll deductions from its unit employees' paychecks to cover premium payments, and remitted the total amount to Maccabees and to the other insurance companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 1998, Posadas notified the insurance companies that it would no longer make payroll deductions for the life and cancer policy premiums as of May 1, 1998, and asked the companies to \"make the necessary arrangements to invoice the employees directly.\" The next day, April 15, 1998, Posadas notified its employees of the decision. Shortly thereafter, Union president Victor Villalba contacted Eddie Ortiz, Posadas's personnel director, to discuss the matter and explore plausible alternatives. Ortiz replied that the matter was out of his hands, and told Villalba that the decision to discontinue the group policies had been made \"higher up.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, 1998, a week after Posadas notified its employees about the decision, Kenneth S.

Insurance benefits have been typically regarded as mandatory subjects of bargaining because they provide \"direct and immediate economic benefits from the employment relationship,\" and because they \"provide a financial cushion in the event of illness or injury ... at less cost than such a cushion could be obtained through contracts or insurance negotiated individually.\" W.W. Cross &amp; Co., 174 F.2d at 878.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas's principal argument is that the withholding practice was neither a benefit nor a term or condition of employment, but rather a mere internal mechanism that it was free to eliminate unilaterally when it so chose. Posadas contends that it was not required to bargain to impasse before making the unilateral change because it did not contribute to the premium payments, but merely collected the premiums and remitted them to the insurance companies. Posadas concedes, as it must, that an insurance benefit is \"vital\" to employees and is a mandatory subject of bargaining, but argues that the impact of its decision on the group insurance policies was merely incidental.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas's attempt to frame its actions as having to do only with an internal company mechanism is disingenuous. The record plainly shows that the withholding practice and the group insurance policy were inextricably intertwined. The April 1998 exchange of letters between Posadas and Krans reveals that the unilateral decision that Posadas was contemplating would have had the effect of eliminating the group insurance policy altogether. A corollary of that decision, therefore, would be that previously covered employees would be forced to secure individual coverage at individual policy rates. Thus, by eliminating the withholding practice, Posadas did much more than eliminate an \"internal mechanism\"; it unilaterally removed a group insurance policy that Posadas's unit employees had been able to avail themselves of for almost twenty years. Given that the decision had the effect of unilaterally changing a long term benefit, Posadas was required to bargain with the Union to impasse. We doubt that Posadas could hide behind an ignorance defense, but, even if it could, such a defense is not supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Board found, based on the uncontested testimony offered by Elsie Santana, a Krans employee, that group policies were considerably less expensive than individual policies. Accordingly, Posadas's longstanding practice of withholding and remitting premiums allowed covered employees to obtain group coverage at rates significantly below what they could have obtained individually. Such a benefit existed regardless of whether Posadas itself contributed to the premium payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas's reliance on Seattle First National Bank v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></span> (9th Cir. 1971), McCall Corp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"292368\"><a href=\"/opinion/292368/mccall-corporation-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span> (4th Cir. 1970), and Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"278312\"><a href=\"/opinion/278312/westinghouse-electric-corporation-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span> (4th Cir. 1967) for the proposition that its unilateral action did not impinge on an issue traditionally considered \"vital\" to employees is unavailing. None of these cases even remotely suggests that an employer can unilaterally eliminate a benefit (insurance-related or otherwise) without bargaining with the Union, by claiming that it actually intended to undertake an unrelated, internal administrative action that happened to cause an adverse effect on the benefit at issue. In Seattle First National Bank, for example, the Ninth Circuit specifically noted (pointing to our opinion in W.W. Cross Co., supra) that group insurance plans involve issues traditionally considered \"vital\" to employees, as opposed to bank services, the putative benefit at issue in that case. Seattle First National Bank, 444 F.2d at 35 n.8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, McCall and Westinghouse involved minor food price increases -- issues quite different from those presented here. In both cases, the employees had alternative places to eat, or they could bring their own lunches; in neither instance were the cafeteria plants so isolated that employees were dependent on the food that caused the controversies. Although the Fourth Circuit held that such issues were not required subjects for bargaining, none of the actions complained of in either case impinged (directly or indirectly) on a traditionally \"vital\" issue, such as insurance benefits. Westinghouse, 387 F.2d at 550; McCall, 432 F.2d at 188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Posadas further contends (again focusing solely on the withholding practice) that its unilateral action was not one traditionally considered \"vital\" because unit employees \"could have maintained the life and cancer insurance policies by simply making the premium payments themselves . . . .\" Posadas Brief at 11. The record provides no support for that proposition. To the contrary, Krans's April 22, 1998 letter, stating that the cancellation of the policy would subject covered employees to \"individual insurability and rates\" (emphasis supplied), suggests precisely the opposite. Indeed, the record shows that the employees could not have maintained the same coverage at the same cost - even assuming they were individually insurable - by making the premium payments themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of Posadas's remaining arguments calls for a contrary conclusion. Posadas contends, for example, that its employees could have maintained their coverage by making premium payments directly to the insurance companies. The record shows, however, that Posadas's employees could not have maintained the same level of coverage by paying the premiums themselves; any coverage after May 1, 1998, would have been subject to individual rates, and would therefore have been more expensive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Posadas also contends that its withholding practice was not a term and condition of employment because it was not embodied in the collective bargaining agreement with the Union. The argument is meritless. An item that is not addressed in a collective bargaining agreement can become a term and condition of employment, and hence a mandatory subject of bargaining, if it has been \"satisfactorily established\" by past practice or custom. See, e.g., Exxon Shipping Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span>, 493 (1988). Here, we have a practice that was carried out for almost twenty years, resulting in substantial reliance by Posadas's unit employees. As the Board noted, it is that longstanding history -- coupled with the nature of the benefit at issue -- that transformed this practice into a term or condition of employment. As such, Posadas was required to bargain to impasse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The record amply supports the Board's conclusion that Posadas provided its unit employees with an insurance benefit, and that, as a result, it was not free to eliminate that benefit unilaterally without offering the Union the opportunity to bargain concerning that change. Posadas's unilateral actions effectively eliminated the group policy and left previously-covered employees without a critically important benefit. Posadas's past practice of withholding premium payments was a term and condition of employment that triggered the duty to bargain. Its failure to do so constituted an unfair labor practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Posadas argues that the remedy imposed by the Board constituted an abuse of discretion. It is well-settled that the Board has \"the primary responsibility and broad discretion to devise remedies that effectuate the policies of the Act,\" and that discretion is \"subject only to limited judicial review.\" Pegasus Broadcasting of San Juan v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717467\"><a href=\"/opinion/717467/pegasus-broadcasting-of-san-juan-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 513 (1st Cir. 1996). Pursuant to its authority under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(c), the Board ordered a remedy directing Posadas to, inter alia, (1) resume its practice of making payroll deductions for group cancer and life insurance policies, (2) restore the policies for previously covered unit employees, and (3) make the employees whole for any losses they may have suffered as a result of the unilateral change. We have consistently maintained that a Board-ordered remedy \"should stand unless it can be shown that [it] is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\" Id. (quoting Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103862\"><a href=\"/opinion/103862/virginia-electric-power-co-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span>, 540 (1943)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board acted within its sound discretion in ordering the restoration of the status quo. Had it not been for Posadas's unilateral alteration of the terms and condition of employment, the covered employees would have continued to enjoy the benefit of life and cancer insurance at group rates. Posadas's proposed remedy -- to bargain over the resumption of payroll deductions, which Posadas had no right to eliminate unilaterally -- would effectively place the unit employees \"behind the line of scrimmage.\" Id. at 514. There is no reason to disturb the remedy ordered by the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Posadas's petition for review and grant the Board's cross-petition to enforce its order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to its policy with Maccabees, Posadas made similar arrangements with various other insurance companies to provide its employees additional options for obtaining life and cancer insurance at group rates. As with the Maccabees policy, Posadas would deduct the premium amounts from its covered employees' paychecks and remit the total amount to the insurance companies.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is a dispute regarding whether unit employees could have continued to receive group rates had they transferred over within a specific grace period provided by the insurance companies. Even assuming arguendo that this alternative solution was available, Posadas's argument ignores the fact that its own actions created the problem of which it now complains.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
