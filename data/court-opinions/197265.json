On November 2, 1992, Daniels amended her complaint to add\r\n\nDr. S nchez'   insurer,  Sindicato   de   Aseguradores  Para   la\r\n\nSuscripci n  Conjunta de  Seguros de  Responsibilidad Profesional\r\n\nM dico  Hospitalaria  (\"SIMED\"),  and  AHDM's  insurer,  Evanston\r\n\nInsurance Company  (\"Evanston\"), as  defendants.  On  January 17,\r\n\n1995, AHDM and  Evanston filed a motion for summary judgment.  On\r\n\nMarch 30,  1995, the district  court granted AHDM  and Evanston's\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\r\n\n          In  the meantime, on February  3, 1995, Daniels filed a\r\n\nmotion  in  limine  seeking   determination  of  coverage   under\r\n\nDr. S nchez' insurance  policy with SIMED.  On February 28, 1996,\r\n\nthe district court determined that Daniels'  claim was covered by\r\n\nDr.  S nchez' policy, which had a  stated limit of $500,000.  The\r\n\ncase  was scheduled  for trial.   On March 15,  1996, following a\r\n\nsettlement  conference, Daniels,  Dr.  S nchez and  SIMED entered\r\n\ninto  a  Stipulation  Agreement  whereby  they  agreed  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court would  enter  final judgment  for Daniels  in the\r\n\namount  of $500,000  in order  for SIMED  to appeal  the district\r\n\ncourt's determination of policy coverage.\r\n\n          We  have  before  us  SIMED's  appeal  from  the  final\r\n\njudgment,  based  on  the  district  court's allegedly  erroneous\r\n\ndetermination  regarding policy  coverage,  as well  as  Daniels'\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nappeal  from the  district court's entry  of summary  judgment in\r\n\nfavor of AHDM and Evanston.

United States  Dep't  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nAgriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1283-84 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                     \r\n\n          In May  1989, after being admitted  to AHDM's emergency\r\n\nroom,  Daniels was referred by AHDM staff to Dr. Regis-Bonilla, a\r\n\npneumologist at Cl nica Las Am ricas.  Daniels received treatment\r\n\nfrom Dr.  Regis-Bonilla for approximately nine  months, before he\r\n\nmoved his practice to another city.  After Dr. Regis-Bonilla left\r\n\nhis  San Juan practice,  Dr. S nchez joined  Cl nica Las Am ricas\r\n\nand began treating Daniels.  In early 1990, Dr. S nchez diagnosed\r\n\nDaniels' condition as \"silent asthma.\"\r\n\n          On  August 31, 1990, Daniels was again admitted to AHDM\r\n\non  an emergency basis.  She was hospitalized until September 17,\r\n\n1990.    During  this  hospitalization,  Dr.  S nchez  prescribed\r\n\nMedrol, an adrenocortical steroid, for  the first time.  Extended\r\n\nuse of this medication  can cause a number of  adverse reactions,\r\n\nincluding  hypertension,  muscle   weakness,  steroid   myopathy,\r\n\nosteoporosis, spinal compression fractures, abdominal distention,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndevelopment of a Cushingoid  state,1 and manifestations of latent\r\n\ndiabetes mellitus.\r\n\n          Daniels  was again  admitted  to AHDM  on an  emergency\r\n\nbasis on October 5, 1990.  After a consultation, Dr. S nchez took\r\n\nover as  Daniels' primary attending physician.   Hospital records\r\n\nshowed  that Daniels had been  taking Medrol since  her August 31\r\n\nadmission  and that she had steroid myopathy as a complication of\r\n\nthe steroid  treatment.   Daniels was discharged  on November  1,\r\n\n1990.\r\n\n          On December 17, 1990, Daniels yet again was admitted to\r\n\nAHDM.     Daniels  had   been  taking   Medrol  since   her  last\r\n\nhospitalization and  continued to  take it throughout  this stay.\r\n\nSteroid  complications,  specifically  steroid-induced  diabetes,\r\n\nwere  noted in her records.   Daniels was  discharged on December\r\n\n31,  1990, with records showing that her \"asthma\" continued to be\r\n\nactive and that she was taking Medrol upon her discharge.\r\n\n          On May 30,  1991, Daniels  was admitted to  AHDM for  a\r\n\nfifth  time.   She was  still taking  Medrol at  the time  of her\r\n\nadmission and  was continued on the medication  during the course\r\n\nof her hospitalization.   Several steroid  related complications,\r\n\nincluding  Cushing's  syndrome, osteoporosis,  spinal compression\r\n\nfractures, hypertension, and  a decrease in height, were noted at\r\n\nthe time of her admission.  She was discharged on June 28, 1991.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Cushing's Syndrome is characterized  by mood phases, excessive\r\nhair growth,  increased bruisability, peripheral  muscle atrophy,\r\nthe  formation of  a pot  belly and the  formation of  a \"buffalo\r\nhump\" on the afflicted person's back.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          During  each hospitalization,  a series  of respiratory\r\n\nfunction  tests were  run  on  Daniels.    None  of  these  tests\r\n\nindicated that she was having respiratory difficulty.\r\n\n          Upon her last  discharge, on June 28, 1991, Daniels was\r\n\nreferred  by  Dr.  S nchez  to  the  National Jewish  Center  for\r\n\nImmunology and Respiratory Medicine (\"National Jewish Center\") in\r\n\nDenver, Colorado.   Dr.  S nchez' referral letter  indicates that\r\n\nDaniels had been prescribed Medrol for the previous twelve months\r\n\nand that she was suffering from complications related to extended\r\n\ncorticosteroid  usage.  On August 26, 1991, Daniels had her first\r\n\nappointment at National Jewish Center.  At the time of this first\r\n\nvisit,  the  staff  at  National Jewish  Center  questioned  both\r\n\nDr. S nchez' diagnosis of \"silent  asthma\" and his treatment with\r\n\nMedrol for  at least a year.  The staff at National Jewish Center\r\n\ntapered  Daniels'  Medrol dosage  and gave  her  a final  dose on\r\n\nSeptember  3, 1991, the day  she was admitted  to National Jewish\r\n\nCenter.    Doctors there  discovered  that  her osteoporosis  had\r\n\ndeveloped  to such an extent that her bone mass was approximately\r\n\n70%  of the  normal  level.   The  National Jewish  Center  staff\r\n\ndiagnosed  Daniels  as  suffering  from   breathing  difficulties\r\n\nsecondary to  an anxiety disorder.   Daniels was  discharged from\r\n\nNational Jewish Center on September 21, 1991.\r\n\n          Daniels'  experts  indicated  that  the   diagnosis  of\r\n\n\"silent asthma\"  was, at least ultimately, incorrect based on the\r\n\nobjective respiratory test results.   They further stated  that a\r\n\ncourse  of  Medrol treatment  extending  beyond  two weeks  would\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncertainly  result  in  the severe  complications  experienced  by\r\n\nDaniels.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          In  this   diversity   case,  we   apply  Puerto   Rico\r\n\nsubstantive law.   See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 92\r                                                          \r\n\n(1938);  Carota v. Johns Manville  Corp., 893 F.2d  448, 450 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1990).\r\n\nI.  Policy Coverage\r          I.  Policy Coverage\r\n\n          SIMED  issued to  Dr. S nchez  a \"claims  made\" medical\r\n\nmalpractice  insurance policy  effective  from July  7, 1991,  to\r\n\nJuly 7,  1992.   This policy  limited liability  to $500,000  per\r\n\n\"medical incident\"  that occurred during the  period of coverage,\r\n\nup to  an  aggregate  of  $1,000,000.   The  policy  also  had  a\r\n\nretroactive  component, which  provided coverage  to  Dr. S nchez\r\n\nfrom July  2, 1986 to July  7, 1991.  The  retroactive portion of\r\n\nthe policy  provided coverage of $100,000  per \"medical incident\"\r\n\nthat occurred during the retroactive period of coverage, up to an\r\n\naggregate  of $300,000.    The question  presented  below and  on\r\n\nappeal is when Daniels'  \"medical incident\" occurred, which would\r\n\ndetermine which policy, and coverage limit, applied.\r\n\n          SIMED claims  the district  court erred by  determining\r\n\nthat Daniels'  \"medical incident\" spanned the  coverage period of\r\n\nboth policies2 and, thus,  that Daniels' claim is covered  by the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The policy language states:\r\n\n     The  Syndicate will pay on behalf  of the Insured, with\r\n     respect only to his practice within the Commonwealth of\r\n     Puerto Rico:\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nsubsequent policy, whose liability limit is $500,000.  We find no\r\n\nerror in the district court's determination.\r\n\n          The  policy  language, including  the  language  of the\r\n\namendment,  as set out in the margin, ties policy coverage to the\r\n\ntiming of medical incidents.3  The district court properly framed\r\n\nthe issue as follows:\r\n\n          if the incident transcended the period of the\r\n          lower  policy  coverage,   that  is,  if  Dr.\r\n          S NCHEZ MONSERRAT'S rendering of,  or failure\r\n          to  render   professional  services  extended\r\n          beyond the July 7, 1991 date, then the higher\r\n          coverage  would apply because all his acts or\r\n          omissions, when taken together,  comprise one\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     All  sums  which  the   Insured  shall  become  legally\r\n     obligated to pay as damages because of injury  to which\r\n     this policy applies caused by medical incident . . . .\r\n\nMedical incident is defined as:\r\n\n     [A]ny  act or  omission  . .  .  in the  furnishing  of\r\n     professional  medical .  . .  services by  the Insured.\r\n     Any  such act  or omission,  together with  all related\r\n     acts or omissions in the furnishing of such services to\r\n     any  one  person   shall  be  considered   one  medical\r\n     incident.\r\n\nThe Retroactive  Date Amendment Endorsement II,  which deals with\r\nretroactive  insurance coverage  in  the amount  of $100,000  per\r\nmedical incident, states:\r\n\n     Irrespectively of the  retroactive date and  the limits\r\n     of  liability shown  in  the Declarations  Page of  the\r\n     above numbered  policy, in consideration of the payment\r\n     of  the above stated  premium, claims arising  out of a\r\n     medical incident which occurred  between 7-02-86 and 7-\r\n     07-91 will be covered by this policy subject to a limit\r\n     of liability  of $100,000  per medical incident  and an\r\n     aggregate of $300,000.\r\n\n3  Because the  \"event\" triggering policy coverage is  the timing\r\nof the medical incident, SIMED's repeated references in its brief\r\nto  state and federal cases  that reviewed policies  in which the\r\ntriggering event  was the  manifestation of the  injury miss  the\r\nmark.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          medical  incident  pursuant  to   the  policy\r\n          definitions.\r\n\nAmended Order  Granting Plaintiff's Motion in  Limine and Setting\r\n\nTrial and Pretrial Settlement Conference, Feb. 28, 1996, at 2-3.\r\n\n          Title 26, section  1114, of the Puerto  Rico Civil Code\r\n\ngoverns the  contents of insurance policies.   In accordance with\r\n\nthis  provision,  language  in  an  insurance  policy  is  to  be\r\n\nconstrued according to the  \"most common and usual meaning, . . .\r\n\npaying  . . .  attention .  . .  to the  general use  and popular\r\n\nmeaning of the idioms.\"  Morales Garay v.

Insurance Company Progressive Report\r\n\n            In the Progressive Report submitted  to the\r\n          Caribbean  American  Life Assurance  Company,\r\n          Dr. S NCHEZ   MONSERRAT    marked   the   box\r\n          indicating \"YES\" to the question posed on the\r\n          report  which asked  \"Is patient  still under\r\n          your care for  this condition?\".  He  further\r\n          informed that she had received a consultation\r\n          from his  office on  August 4, 1991  and that\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Page cites are to the Official Translation.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          she  was   at  the   time  in   Colorado  for\r\n          \"treatment.\"    Significantly, the  report is\r\n          dated September 3, 1991, and is filled out in\r\n          the doctor's own handwriting.\r\n\n                   2.  Pulmonary Questionnaire\r\n\n            SIMED argues that the doctor's treatment of\r\n          Ms. DANIELS ended on  June 28, 1991, the date\r\n          of her  last hospitalization.   It  bases its\r\n          belief   on   the   Pulmonary   Questionnaire\r\n          prepared  by  Dr.   S NCHEZ  MONSERRAT,   for\r\n          submission to the Social  Security Disability\r\n          Determination Program.   This form was filled\r\n          out  by   the  doctor  on  April   20,  1992,\r\n          approximately   seven    months   after   the\r\n          aforementioned    insurance     report    was\r\n          completed.  Although  on this  questionnaire,\r\n          the doctor indicates that  \"[Ms. Daniels was]\r\n          not  seen since  June 28,  1991\",  it appears\r\n          that  the  doctor's  statements therein  were\r\n          made in  reference to  his last visit  to the\r\n          plaintiff   at  the   hospital.     A  closer\r\n          examination  of page 3  of the questionnaire,\r\n          requesting  a listing of the office visits by\r\n          the patient, reveals that the  last entry for\r\n          Ms. DANIELS  was for  May 30, 1991,  the date\r\n          that the doctor ordered  her hospitalization,\r\n          which hospitalization concluded  on June  28,\r\n          1991.     Thus,  noticeably   absent  is  the\r\n          August 4,  1991,  consultation  which he  had\r\n          disclosed in the form filled out seven months\r\n          earlier    for    the   insurance    company.\r\n          Furthermore, in  the aforementioned pulmonary\r\n          questionnaire,  the   doctor  indicated  that\r\n          Ms. DANIELS was \"sent to the Jewish Institute\r\n          of Allergy &amp;  Immunology--Aug. 26,  1991....\"\r\n          Since  he  was  the  doctor  originating  the\r\n          referral to the  Institute, this  affirmation\r\n          could be construed as  another acknowledgment\r\n          that Ms. DANIELS was still under his care and\r\n          treatment  at that time;  clearly beyond July\r\n          7, 1991, the higher coverage date.\r\n\n                3.  Admitted Facts-Pretrial Order\r\n\n            Finally, though not  less significant,  the\r\n          parties  conceded in Part  II, Admitted Facts\r\n          of the Proposed Joint Pretrial Order filed on\r\n          February  2,   1995  (docket  No.   49)  that\r\n          Ms. DANIELS  was  a  patient  of  Dr.  RAFAEL\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          S NCHEZ  MONSERRAT  from May  21,  1990 until\r\n          September 3, 1991.\r\n\nId. at 3-5.  We agree that these facts indicate  that Dr. S nchez\r             \r\n\ncontinued  to perform acts or omissions related to the furnishing\r\n\nof professional medical  services to Daniels after  July 7, 1991,\r\n\nthus triggering the subsequent policy, which provides coverage of\r\n\n$500,000 per medical incident.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nII.  Summary Judgment\r          II.  Summary Judgment\r\n\n          We  review  the  district   court's  grant  of  summary\r\n\njudgment  de novo,  and  will uphold  that determination  \"if the\r                           \r\n\nrecord,  viewed  in the  light  most favorable  to  the nonmoving\r\n\nparty, shows that  'there is no genuine issue as  to any material\r\n\nfact and  that the moving  party is entitled  to a judgment  as a\r\n\nmatter of law.'\"   Continental  Ins.

Obvious malpractice\r                    A.  Obvious malpractice\r\n\n          Dr. S nchez'  AHDM personnel  records indicate  that he\r\n\nmaintained hospital privileges during the course of his treatment\r\n\nof Daniels.   Under  Puerto Rico  law, a  hospital's relationship\r\n\nwith doctors  to whom  it  grants hospital  privileges must  meet\r\n\nseveral requirements.  The  obligation that Daniels suggests AHDM\r\n\nfailed  to meet  here,  such  that  AHDM  would  be  jointly  and\r\n\nseverally liable for Dr. S nchez' malpractice, requires hospitals\r\n\nto monitor the work of  physicians with hospital privileges,  and\r\n\nto  intervene when  possible in  the face  of an  obvious  act of\r\n\nmedical malpractice.   See M rquez Vega  v. Mart nez Rosado,  116\r                                                                     \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nP.R.R.  489,  500 (1985);  see  also Carlos  J.  Irizarry Yunqu ,\r                                              \r\n\nResponsabilidad Civil Extracontractual 253 (1996).\r                                                \r\n\n          Beyond her conclusory  allegations to  the effect  that\r\n\nDr. S nchez' malpractice  was so  obvious that AHDM  staff should\r\n\nhave  intervened, Daniels  fails to  present sufficient  facts to\r\n\nshow that there is a \"genuine issue for trial.\"  LeBlanc v. Great\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmerican Ins.  Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841-42 (1st Cir. 1993).  Although\r                            \r\n\nDaniels  directs our attention to the deposition testimony of her\r\n\nexperts,  all of  whom agreed  that the  diagnosis of  asthma was\r\n\nincorrect,  none of  this deposition  testimony raises  a genuine\r\n\nissue as  to whether any act of malpractice by Dr. S nchez was so\r\n\nobvious  that AHDM should have  intervened.  The  only mention of\r\n\n\"obviousness\" in  the deposition testimony comes  from Dr. Harold\r\n\nNelson,  one  of  Daniels'  experts.    He states  that  Daniels'\r\n\nosteoporosis and  her Cushingoid  state were obvious  symptoms of\r\n\nexcessive  corticosteroid   use.    That  the   symptoms  Daniels\r\n\nexhibited after corticosteroid treatment were  the obvious result\r\n\nof excessive use of  the steroid does not sufficiently  raise the\r\n\nissue of whether those symptoms were the obvious result of an act\r\n\nof  malpractice.   Daniels  did not  meet  her burden  of  coming\r\n\nforward with concrete  facts that  would give rise  to a  genuine\r\n\nissue of material fact regarding AHDM's liability.\r\n\n          B.   Negligence of AHDM Staff Doctors and Nurses\r                    B.   Negligence of AHDM Staff Doctors and Nurses\r\n\n          Daniels next  argues that  the district court  erred in\r\n\nfinding  that  AHDM's  doctors  did not  engage  in  malpractice.\r\n\nDaniels  failed  to press  this  contention  before the  district\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncourt.   Because  Daniels' Opposition  to Defendants'  Motion for\r\n\nSummary  Judgment  fails  to  squarely raise  any  contention  of\r\n\nspecific  malpractice on  the  part of  AHDM's medical  staff, we\r\n\ngenerally  will not  consider such  an argument  on appeal.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGrenier v.  Cyanamid Plastics, Inc.,  70 F.3d 667,  678 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1995) (recognizing that, by failing to present an argument in his\r\n\nopposition  to   summary  judgment  below,  appellant  failed  to\r\n\npreserve the argument for appeal).\r\n\n          Moreover, her argument is  without merit.  She premises\r\n\nAHDM's  liability on the opinion of her expert, Dr. Alvarez, that\r\n\nAHDM  staff members  should have  questioned Dr.  S nchez' faulty\r\n\ndiagnosis and that, had they done so, her result would have  been\r\n\ndifferent.     Daniels   misconstrues  Dr.   Alvarez'  deposition\r\n\ntestimony.   Although  Dr. Alvarez  noted that  nurses frequently\r\n\nquestion  doctors' practices  and  that it  did  not appear  that\r\n\nAHDM's nurses had questioned  Dr. S nchez, immediately thereafter\r\n\nDr. Alvarez  stated  that he  had no  opinion  as to  whether the\r\n\nnurses  or hospital  staff were  negligent.   This is  hardly the\r\n\nforceful  evidence of negligence that Daniels makes it out to be,\r\n\nand certainly does not raise a genuine issue as to whether AHDM's\r\n\nstaff was negligent.\r\n\n          C.   Whether Dr. S nchez was an independent contractor\r                    C.   Whether Dr. S nchez was an independent contractor\r\n\n          Daniels contends that the district court misinterpreted\r\n\nour  opinion in  Su rez Matos  v. Ashford  Presbyterian Community\r                                                                           \r\n\nHosp., 4 F.3d 47 (1st Cir. 1993), when it found that AHDM was not\r               \r\n\nliable because Dr. S nchez  was merely an independent contractor.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nDaniels argues that under Su rez Matos, a hospital is liable when\r                                                \r\n\na negligent  doctor is more  than a mere  \"independent contractor\r\n\nhaving  no other  relationship with  the hospital.\"   Id.  at 52.\r                                                                   \r\n\nDaniels  takes this quotation out of context.  The relevant quote\r\n\nreads:\r\n\n          While   strictly,   perhaps,  that   decision\r\n          [M rquez Vega v. Mart nez Rosado,  116 D.P.R.\r                                                    \r\n          489,  500  (1985)] contained  dictum  that we\r\n          might distinguish, and  certainly we need not\r\n          adopt plaintiff[']s contention that  it would\r\n          impose   liability  in   the   case   of   an\r\n          independent   contractor   having  no   other\r\n          relationship  with the hospital,  it is clear\r\n          here that granting  staff privileges  coupled\r\n          with  a joint  sharing in  profits,  left the\r\n          hospital fully responsible.\r\n\nId.  The  Su rez Matos  opinion, which applies  to situations  in\r                                \r\n\nwhich the hospital has granted staff privileges to and engages in\r\n\na profit-sharing relationship with  a negligent physician to whom\r\n\nit  refers  a  patient, did  not  discuss  the  situation Daniels\r\n\npresents here.\r\n\n          Furthermore, the situation  dealt with in Su rez  Matos\r                                                                           \r\n\nwas  markedly  different from  the case  before  us.   There, the\r\n\npatient   sought the assistance  of the hospital  on an emergency\r\n\nbasis.    Id.  at 48.   The following  day, a  uterine tumor  was\r                       \r\n\nremoved  and was examined by a pathologist on the hospital staff.\r\n\nId.   The pathologist misdiagnosed the tumor  as benign.  Id.  By\r                                                                       \r\n\nreferring the tumor  to the  staff doctor, the  hospital was,  in\r\n\neffect,  certifying the  competence  of that  doctor.   The  same\r\n\ncannot  be said of  AHDM, which  did not  advise Daniels  to seek\r\n\ntreatment from Dr. S nchez.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          Daniels further  argues that Dr. S nchez  was more than\r\n\nan  independent contractor of AHDM and, thus, that AHDM is liable\r\n\nfor  his malpractice.   Daniels  misconstrues the  application of\r\n\nPuerto  Rico's independent contractor law.   In M rquez Vega, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court visited this very issue:\r\n\n          Under  the  second  alternative  --  where  a\r\n          person goes directly to a physician's private\r\n          office, agrees with him  as to the  treatment\r\n          he  or she is going to receive, and goes to a\r\n          given    hospital    on    the    physician's\r\n          recommendation     merely     because    said\r\n          institution  is  one  of  several  which  the\r\n          physician has the  privilege of using  -- the\r\n          situation  is somewhat different.  Under this\r\n          factual  framework,   the  main  relationship\r\n          established is between the \"patient\"  and the\r\n          physician, while the relationship established\r\n          between the patient and  the hospital is of a\r\n          supplementary and incidental nature.  In this\r\n          case, as  a rule, the hospital  should not be\r                                    \r\n          held liable  for the exclusive  negligence of\r\n          an  unsalaried physician,  who was  first and\r\n          foremost entrusted with the patient's health.\r\n\n116  D.P.R. at  499 (emphasis  in original);  see also  Carlos J.\r                                                                \r\n\nIrizarry  Yunqu ,  Responsabilidad Civil  Extracontractual 252-53\r                                                                    \r\n\n(1996).\r\n\n          Daniels admitted  in her deposition testimony  that she\r\n\nrelied primarily on Dr.  S nchez for her diagnosis and  treatment\r\n\nand \"primarily entrusted [to him] the  diagnosis and treatment of\r\n\nher  respiratory condition.\"   Deposition of Linda Daniels-Recio,\r\n\nJuly 26, 1993, at 113.  She  also indicated that she did not rely\r\n\non AHDM's doctors  or staff  for diagnosis and  treatment of  her\r\n\nrespiratory  problems.    Id.   at  113-14.    Finally,  Daniels'\r                                       \r\n\nadmissions  to AHDM were at  the instruction of  Dr. S nchez, who\r\n\nwas not a  salaried employee of AHDM.

On February 28, 1996, the district court determined that Daniels' claim was covered by Dr. Sanchez' policy, which had a stated limit of $500,000.  The case was scheduled for trial.  On March 15, 1996, following a settlement conference, Daniels, Dr. Sanchez and SIMED entered into a Stipulation Agreement whereby they agreed that the district court would enter final judgment for Daniels in the amount of $500,000 in order for SIMED to appeal the district court's determination of policy coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have before us SIMED's appeal from the final judgment, based on the district court's allegedly erroneous determination regarding policy coverage, as well as Daniels' appeal from the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of AHDM and Evanston.

Dubois v. United States Dep't of Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1283-84 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1989, after being admitted to AHDM's emergency room, Daniels was referred by AHDM staff to Dr. Regis-Bonilla, a pneumologist at Clnica Las Americas.  Daniels received treatment from Dr. Regis-Bonilla for approximately nine months, before he moved his practice to another city.  After Dr. Regis-Bonilla left his San Juan practice, Dr. Sanchez joined Clnica Las Americas and began treating Daniels.  In early 1990, Dr. Sanchez diagnosed Daniels' condition as \"silent asthma.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 31, 1990, Daniels was again admitted to AHDM on an emergency basis.  She was hospitalized until September 17, 1990.  During this hospitalization, Dr. Sanchez prescribed Medrol, an adrenocortical steroid, for the first time.  Extended use of this medication can cause a number of adverse reactions, including hypertension, muscle weakness, steroid myopathy, osteoporosis, spinal compression fractures, abdominal distention, development of a Cushingoid state,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels was again admitted to AHDM on an emergency basis on October 5, 1990.  After a consultation, Dr. Sanchez took over as Daniels' primary attending physician.  Hospital records showed that Daniels had been taking Medrol since her August 31 admission and that she had steroid myopathy as a complication of the steroid treatment.  Daniels was discharged on November 1, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1990, Daniels yet again was admitted to AHDM.  Daniels had been taking Medrol since her last hospitalization and continued to take it throughout this stay.  Steroid complications, specifically steroid-induced diabetes, were noted in her records.  Daniels was discharged on December 31, 1990, with records showing that her \"asthma\" continued to be active and that she was taking Medrol upon her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 1991, Daniels was admitted to AHDM for a fifth time.  She was still taking Medrol at the time of her admission and was continued on the medication during the course of her hospitalization.  Several steroid related complications, including Cushing's syndrome, osteoporosis, spinal compression fractures, hypertension, and a decrease in height, were noted at the time of her admission.  She was discharged on June 28, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During each hospitalization, a series of respiratory function tests were run on Daniels.  None of these tests indicated that she was having respiratory difficulty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon her last discharge, on June 28, 1991, Daniels was referred by Dr. Sanchez to the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine (\"National Jewish Center\") in Denver, Colorado.  Dr. Sanchez' referral letter indicates that Daniels had been prescribed Medrol for the previous twelve months and that she was suffering from complications related to extended corticosteroid usage.  On August 26, 1991, Daniels had her first appointment at National Jewish Center.  At the time of this first visit, the staff at National Jewish Center questioned both Dr. Sanchez' diagnosis of \"silent asthma\" and his treatment with Medrol for at least a year.  The staff at National Jewish Center tapered Daniels' Medrol dosage and gave her a final dose on September 3, 1991, the day she was admitted to National Jewish Center.  Doctors there discovered that her osteoporosis had developed to such an extent that her bone mass was approximately 70% of the normal level.  The National Jewish Center staff diagnosed Daniels as suffering from breathing difficulties secondary to an anxiety disorder.  Daniels was discharged from National Jewish Center on September 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels' experts indicated that the diagnosis of \"silent asthma\" was, at least ultimately, incorrect based on the objective respiratory test results.  They further stated that a course of Medrol treatment extending beyond two weeks would certainly result in the severe complications experienced by Daniels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this diversity case, we apply Puerto Rico substantive law.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 92, 58 S.Ct. 817, 828, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938);  Carota v. Johns Manville Corp., 893 F.2d 448, 450 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Policy Coverage</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIMED issued to Dr. Sanchez a \"claims made\" medical malpractice insurance policy effective from July 7, 1991, to July 7, 1992.  This policy limited liability to $500,000 per \"medical incident\" that occurred during the period of coverage, up to an aggregate of $1,000,000.  The policy also had a retroactive component, which provided coverage to Dr. Sanchez from July 2, 1986 to July 7, 1991.  The retroactive portion of the policy provided coverage of $100,000 per \"medical incident\" that occurred during the retroactive period of coverage, up to an aggregate of $300,000.  The question presented below and on appeal is when Daniels' \"medical incident\" occurred, which would determine which policy, and coverage limit, applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIMED claims the district court erred by determining that Daniels' \"medical incident\" spanned the coverage period of both policies<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and, thus, that Daniels' claim is covered by the subsequent policy, whose liability limit is $500,000.

Roldan Coss, 110 P.R.R. 909, 916 (1981).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Moreover, \"insurance contracts, being contracts of adhesion, are to be liberally construed in favor of the insured.\"   Rivera v.

Insurance Company Progressive Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Progressive Report submitted to the Caribbean American Life Assurance Company, Dr. SNCHEZ MONSERRAT marked the box indicating \"YES\" to the question posed on the report which asked \"Is patient still under your care for this condition?\".  He further informed that she had received a consultation from his office on August 4, 1991 and that she was at the time in Colorado for \"treatment.\"   Significantly, the report is dated September 3, 1991, and is filled out in the doctor's own handwriting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Pulmonary Questionnaire</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIMED argues that the doctor's treatment of Ms. DANIELS ended on June 28, 1991, the date of her last hospitalization.  It bases its belief on the Pulmonary Questionnaire prepared by Dr. SNCHEZ MONSERRAT, for submission to the Social Security Disability Determination Program.  This form was filled out by the doctor on April 20, 1992, approximately seven months after the aforementioned insurance report was completed.  Although on this questionnaire, the doctor indicates that \"[Ms. Daniels was] not seen since June 28, 1991\", it appears that the doctor's statements therein were made in reference to his last visit to the plaintiff at the hospital.  A closer examination of page 3 of the questionnaire, requesting a listing of the office visits by the patient, reveals that the last entry for Ms. DANIELS was for May 30, 1991, the date that the doctor ordered her hospitalization, which hospitalization concluded on June 28, 1991.  Thus, noticeably absent is the August 4, 1991, consultation which he had disclosed in the form filled out seven months earlier for the insurance company.  Furthermore, in the aforementioned pulmonary questionnaire, the doctor indicated that Ms. DANIELS was \"sent to the Jewish Institute of Allergy &amp; Immunology--Aug. 26, 1991....\"  Since he was the doctor originating the referral to the Institute, this affirmation could be construed as another acknowledgment that Ms. DANIELS was still under his care and treatment at that time;  clearly beyond July 7, 1991, the higher coverage date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Admitted Facts-Pretrial Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, though not less significant, the parties conceded in Part II, Admitted Facts of the Proposed Joint Pretrial Order filed on February 2, 1995 (docket No. 49) that Ms. DANIELS was a patient of Dr. RAFAEL SNCHEZ MONSERRAT from May 21, 1990 until September 3, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 3-5.   We agree that these facts indicate that Dr. Sanchez continued to perform acts or omissions related to the furnishing of professional medical services to Daniels after July 7, 1991, thus triggering the subsequent policy, which provides coverage of $500,000 per medical incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, and will uphold that determination \"if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, shows that 'there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' \"  Continental Ins. Co. v. Arkwright Mut. Ins. Co., 102 F.3d 30, 33 n. 4 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).  Faced with a properly documented motion, the nonmovant must establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact in order to avoid the entry of an adverse judgment.  Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels attacks the district court's grant of summary judgment on various grounds, which we will consider in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Obvious malpractice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Sanchez' AHDM personnel records indicate that he maintained hospital privileges during the course of his treatment of Daniels.  Under Puerto Rico law, a hospital's relationship with doctors to whom it grants hospital privileges must meet several requirements.  The obligation that Daniels suggests AHDM failed to meet here, such that AHDM would be jointly and severally liable for Dr. Sanchez' malpractice, requires hospitals to monitor the work of physicians with hospital privileges, and to intervene when possible in the face of an obvious act of medical malpractice.  See Marquez Vega v. Martnez Rosado, 116 P.R.R. 489, 500 (1985);  see also Carlos J. Irizarry Yunque, Responsabilidad Civil Extracontractual 253 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond her conclusory allegations to the effect that Dr. Sanchez' malpractice was so obvious that AHDM staff should have intervened, Daniels fails to present sufficient facts to show that there is a \"genuine issue for trial.\"  LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841-42 (1st Cir.1993).  Although Daniels directs our attention to the deposition testimony of her experts, all of whom agreed that the diagnosis of asthma was incorrect, none of this deposition testimony raises a genuine issue as to whether any act of malpractice by Dr. Sanchez was so obvious that AHDM should have intervened.  The only mention of \"obviousness\" in the deposition testimony comes from Dr. Harold Nelson, one of Daniels' experts.  He states that Daniels' osteoporosis and her Cushingoid state were obvious symptoms of excessive corticosteroid use.  That the symptoms Daniels exhibited after corticosteroid treatment were the obvious result of excessive use of the steroid does not sufficiently raise the issue of whether those symptoms were the obvious result of an act of malpractice.  Daniels did not meet her burden of coming forward with concrete facts that would give rise to a genuine issue of material fact regarding AHDM's liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Negligence of AHDM Staff Doctors and Nurses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels next argues that the district court erred in finding that AHDM's doctors did not engage in malpractice.  Daniels failed to press this contention before the district court.  Because Daniels' Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment fails to squarely raise any contention of specific malpractice on the part of AHDM's medical staff, we generally will not consider such an argument on appeal.  See Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc., 70 F.3d 667, 678 (1st Cir.1995) (recognizing that, by failing to present an argument in his opposition to summary judgment below, appellant failed to preserve the argument for appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, her argument is without merit.  She premises AHDM's liability on the opinion of her expert, Dr. Alvarez, that AHDM staff members should have questioned Dr. Sanchez' faulty diagnosis and that, had they done so, her result would have been different.  Daniels misconstrues Dr. Alvarez' deposition testimony.  Although Dr. Alvarez noted that nurses frequently question doctors' practices and that it did not appear that AHDM's nurses had questioned Dr. Sanchez, immediately thereafter Dr. Alvarez stated that he had no opinion as to whether the nurses or hospital staff were negligent.  This is hardly the forceful evidence of negligence that Daniels makes it out to be, and certainly does not raise a genuine issue as to whether AHDM's staff was negligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Whether Dr. Sanchez was an independent contractor</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels contends that the district court misinterpreted our opinion in Suarez Matos v. Ashford Presbyterian Community Hosp., 4 F.3d 47 (1st Cir.1993), when it found that AHDM was not liable because Dr. Sanchez was merely an independent contractor.  Daniels argues that under Suarez Matos, a hospital is liable when a negligent doctor is more than a mere \"independent contractor having no other relationship with the hospital.\"  Id. at 52.   Daniels takes this quotation out of context.  The relevant quote reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>While strictly, perhaps, that decision [Marquez Vega v. Martnez Rosado, 116 D.P.R. 489, 500 (1985) ] contained dictum that we might distinguish, and certainly we need not adopt plaintiff[']s contention that it would impose liability in the case of an independent contractor having no other relationship with the hospital, it is clear here that granting staff privileges coupled with a joint sharing in profits, left the hospital fully responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. The Suarez Matos opinion, which applies to situations in which the hospital has granted staff privileges to and engages in a profit-sharing relationship with a negligent physician to whom it refers a patient, did not discuss the situation Daniels presents here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the situation dealt with in Suarez Matos was markedly different from the case before us.  There, the patient sought the assistance of the hospital on an emergency basis.  Id. at 48.   The following day, a uterine tumor was removed and was examined by a pathologist on the hospital staff.  Id. The pathologist misdiagnosed the tumor as benign.  Id. By referring the tumor to the staff doctor, the hospital was, in effect, certifying the competence of that doctor.  The same cannot be said of AHDM, which did not advise Daniels to seek treatment from Dr. Sanchez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels further argues that Dr. Sanchez was more than an independent contractor of AHDM and, thus, that AHDM is liable for his malpractice.  Daniels misconstrues the application of Puerto Rico's independent contractor law.  In Marquez Vega, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court visited this very issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>Under the second alternative--where a person goes directly to a physician's private office, agrees with him as to the treatment he or she is going to receive, and goes to a given hospital on the physician's recommendation merely because said institution is one of several which the physician has the privilege of using--the situation is somewhat different.  Under this factual framework, the main relationship established is between the \"patient\" and the physician, while the relationship established between the patient and the hospital is of a supplementary and incidental nature.  In this case, as a rule, the hospital should not be held liable for the exclusive negligence of an unsalaried physician, who was first and foremost entrusted with the patient's health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">116 D.P.R. at 499 (emphasis in original);  see also Carlos J. Irizarry Yunque, Responsabilidad Civil Extracontractual 252-53 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels admitted in her deposition testimony that she relied primarily on Dr. Sanchez for her diagnosis and treatment and \"primarily entrusted [to him] the diagnosis and treatment of her respiratory condition.\"   Deposition of Linda Daniels-Recio, July 26, 1993, at 113.  She also indicated that she did not rely on AHDM's doctors or staff for diagnosis and treatment of her respiratory problems.  Id. at 113-14.   Finally, Daniels' admissions to AHDM were at the instruction of Dr. Sanchez, who was not a salaried employee of AHDM.  These facts certainly fall within the scope of the discussion in Marquez Vega, and AHDM cannot be held liable on a theory of independent contractor liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having addressed and found lacking all of Daniels' claims regarding the district court's direction of summary judgment in AHDM's favor, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's determination of policy coverage and its grant of summary judgment in favor of AHDM and Evanston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Cushing's Syndrome is characterized by mood phases, excessive hair growth, increased bruisability, peripheral muscle atrophy, the formation of a pot belly and the formation of a \"buffalo hump\" on the afflicted person's back</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The policy language states:</p>\n        <p>The Syndicate will pay on behalf of the Insured, with respect only to his practice within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico:</p>\n        <p>All sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to which this policy applies caused by medical incident....</p>\n        <p>Medical incident is defined as:</p>\n        <p>[A]ny act or omission ... in the furnishing of professional medical ... services by the Insured.

On November 2, 1992, Daniels amended her complaint to add Dr. Sanchez' insurer, Sindicato de Aseguradores Para la Suscripcin Conjunta de Seguros de Responsibilidad Profesional Medico Hospitalaria (\"SIMED\"), and AHDM's insurer, Evanston Insurance Company (\"Evanston\"), as defendants.  On January 17, 1995, AHDM and Evanston filed a motion for summary judgment.

On March 15, 1996, following a settlement conference, Daniels, Dr. Sanchez and SIMED entered into a Stipulation Agreement whereby they agreed that the district court would enter final judgment for Daniels in the amount of $500,000 in order for SIMED to appeal the district court's determination of policy coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have before us SIMED's appeal from the final judgment, based on the district court's allegedly erroneous determination regarding policy coverage, as well as Daniels' appeal from the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of AHDM and Evanston.

Daniels received treatment from Dr. Regis-Bonilla for approximately nine months, before he moved his practice to another city.  After Dr. Regis-Bonilla left his San Juan practice, Dr. Sanchez joined Clnica Las Americas and began treating Daniels.  In early 1990, Dr. Sanchez diagnosed Daniels' condition as \"silent asthma.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 31, 1990, Daniels was again admitted to AHDM on an emergency basis.  She was hospitalized until September 17, 1990.  During this hospitalization, Dr. Sanchez prescribed Medrol, an adrenocortical steroid, for the first time.  Extended use of this medication can cause a number of adverse reactions, including hypertension, muscle weakness, steroid myopathy, osteoporosis, spinal compression fractures, abdominal distention, development of a Cushingoid state,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels was again admitted to AHDM on an emergency basis on October 5, 1990.  After a consultation, Dr. Sanchez took over as Daniels' primary attending physician.  Hospital records showed that Daniels had been taking Medrol since her August 31 admission and that she had steroid myopathy as a complication of the steroid treatment.  Daniels was discharged on November 1, 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 1990, Daniels yet again was admitted to AHDM.  Daniels had been taking Medrol since her last hospitalization and continued to take it throughout this stay.  Steroid complications, specifically steroid-induced diabetes, were noted in her records.  Daniels was discharged on December 31, 1990, with records showing that her \"asthma\" continued to be active and that she was taking Medrol upon her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 1991, Daniels was admitted to AHDM for a fifth time.  She was still taking Medrol at the time of her admission and was continued on the medication during the course of her hospitalization.  Several steroid related complications, including Cushing's syndrome, osteoporosis, spinal compression fractures, hypertension, and a decrease in height, were noted at the time of her admission.  She was discharged on June 28, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During each hospitalization, a series of respiratory function tests were run on Daniels.  None of these tests indicated that she was having respiratory difficulty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon her last discharge, on June 28, 1991, Daniels was referred by Dr. Sanchez to the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine (\"National Jewish Center\") in Denver, Colorado.  Dr. Sanchez' referral letter indicates that Daniels had been prescribed Medrol for the previous twelve months and that she was suffering from complications related to extended corticosteroid usage.  On August 26, 1991, Daniels had her first appointment at National Jewish Center.  At the time of this first visit, the staff at National Jewish Center questioned both Dr. Sanchez' diagnosis of \"silent asthma\" and his treatment with Medrol for at least a year.  The staff at National Jewish Center tapered Daniels' Medrol dosage and gave her a final dose on September 3, 1991, the day she was admitted to National Jewish Center.  Doctors there discovered that her osteoporosis had developed to such an extent that her bone mass was approximately 70% of the normal level.  The National Jewish Center staff diagnosed Daniels as suffering from breathing difficulties secondary to an anxiety disorder.  Daniels was discharged from National Jewish Center on September 21, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels' experts indicated that the diagnosis of \"silent asthma\" was, at least ultimately, incorrect based on the objective respiratory test results.  They further stated that a course of Medrol treatment extending beyond two weeks would certainly result in the severe complications experienced by Daniels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this diversity case, we apply Puerto Rico substantive law.

Policy Coverage</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIMED issued to Dr. Sanchez a \"claims made\" medical malpractice insurance policy effective from July 7, 1991, to July 7, 1992.  This policy limited liability to $500,000 per \"medical incident\" that occurred during the period of coverage, up to an aggregate of $1,000,000.  The policy also had a retroactive component, which provided coverage to Dr. Sanchez from July 2, 1986 to July 7, 1991.  The retroactive portion of the policy provided coverage of $100,000 per \"medical incident\" that occurred during the retroactive period of coverage, up to an aggregate of $300,000.  The question presented below and on appeal is when Daniels' \"medical incident\" occurred, which would determine which policy, and coverage limit, applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIMED claims the district court erred by determining that Daniels' \"medical incident\" spanned the coverage period of both policies<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and, thus, that Daniels' claim is covered by the subsequent policy, whose liability limit is $500,000.

Insurance Company Progressive Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Progressive Report submitted to the Caribbean American Life Assurance Company, Dr. SNCHEZ MONSERRAT marked the box indicating \"YES\" to the question posed on the report which asked \"Is patient still under your care for this condition?\".  He further informed that she had received a consultation from his office on August 4, 1991 and that she was at the time in Colorado for \"treatment.\"   Significantly, the report is dated September 3, 1991, and is filled out in the doctor's own handwriting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Pulmonary Questionnaire</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SIMED argues that the doctor's treatment of Ms. DANIELS ended on June 28, 1991, the date of her last hospitalization.  It bases its belief on the Pulmonary Questionnaire prepared by Dr. SNCHEZ MONSERRAT, for submission to the Social Security Disability Determination Program.  This form was filled out by the doctor on April 20, 1992, approximately seven months after the aforementioned insurance report was completed.  Although on this questionnaire, the doctor indicates that \"[Ms. Daniels was] not seen since June 28, 1991\", it appears that the doctor's statements therein were made in reference to his last visit to the plaintiff at the hospital.  A closer examination of page 3 of the questionnaire, requesting a listing of the office visits by the patient, reveals that the last entry for Ms. DANIELS was for May 30, 1991, the date that the doctor ordered her hospitalization, which hospitalization concluded on June 28, 1991.  Thus, noticeably absent is the August 4, 1991, consultation which he had disclosed in the form filled out seven months earlier for the insurance company.  Furthermore, in the aforementioned pulmonary questionnaire, the doctor indicated that Ms. DANIELS was \"sent to the Jewish Institute of Allergy &amp; Immunology--Aug. 26, 1991....\"  Since he was the doctor originating the referral to the Institute, this affirmation could be construed as another acknowledgment that Ms. DANIELS was still under his care and treatment at that time;  clearly beyond July 7, 1991, the higher coverage date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Admitted Facts-Pretrial Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, though not less significant, the parties conceded in Part II, Admitted Facts of the Proposed Joint Pretrial Order filed on February 2, 1995 (docket No. 49) that Ms. DANIELS was a patient of Dr. RAFAEL SNCHEZ MONSERRAT from May 21, 1990 until September 3, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 3-5.   We agree that these facts indicate that Dr. Sanchez continued to perform acts or omissions related to the furnishing of professional medical services to Daniels after July 7, 1991, thus triggering the subsequent policy, which provides coverage of $500,000 per medical incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Obvious malpractice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Sanchez' AHDM personnel records indicate that he maintained hospital privileges during the course of his treatment of Daniels.  Under Puerto Rico law, a hospital's relationship with doctors to whom it grants hospital privileges must meet several requirements.  The obligation that Daniels suggests AHDM failed to meet here, such that AHDM would be jointly and severally liable for Dr. Sanchez' malpractice, requires hospitals to monitor the work of physicians with hospital privileges, and to intervene when possible in the face of an obvious act of medical malpractice.  See Marquez Vega v. Martnez Rosado, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span>, 500 (1985);  see also Carlos J. Irizarry Yunque, Responsabilidad Civil Extracontractual 253 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond her conclusory allegations to the effect that Dr. Sanchez' malpractice was so obvious that AHDM staff should have intervened, Daniels fails to present sufficient facts to show that there is a \"genuine issue for trial.\"  LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 841-42 (1st Cir.1993).  Although Daniels directs our attention to the deposition testimony of her experts, all of whom agreed that the diagnosis of asthma was incorrect, none of this deposition testimony raises a genuine issue as to whether any act of malpractice by Dr. Sanchez was so obvious that AHDM should have intervened.  The only mention of \"obviousness\" in the deposition testimony comes from Dr. Harold Nelson, one of Daniels' experts.  He states that Daniels' osteoporosis and her Cushingoid state were obvious symptoms of excessive corticosteroid use.  That the symptoms Daniels exhibited after corticosteroid treatment were the obvious result of excessive use of the steroid does not sufficiently raise the issue of whether those symptoms were the obvious result of an act of malpractice.  Daniels did not meet her burden of coming forward with concrete facts that would give rise to a genuine issue of material fact regarding AHDM's liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Negligence of AHDM Staff Doctors and Nurses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels next argues that the district court erred in finding that AHDM's doctors did not engage in malpractice.  Daniels failed to press this contention before the district court.  Because Daniels' Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment fails to squarely raise any contention of specific malpractice on the part of AHDM's medical staff, we generally will not consider such an argument on appeal.  See Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708160\"><a href=\"/opinion/708160/andre-grenier-v-cyanamid-plastics-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 678 (1st Cir.1995) (recognizing that, by failing to present an argument in his opposition to summary judgment below, appellant failed to preserve the argument for appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, her argument is without merit.  She premises AHDM's liability on the opinion of her expert, Dr. Alvarez, that AHDM staff members should have questioned Dr. Sanchez' faulty diagnosis and that, had they done so, her result would have been different.  Daniels misconstrues Dr. Alvarez' deposition testimony.  Although Dr. Alvarez noted that nurses frequently question doctors' practices and that it did not appear that AHDM's nurses had questioned Dr. Sanchez, immediately thereafter Dr. Alvarez stated that he had no opinion as to whether the nurses or hospital staff were negligent.  This is hardly the forceful evidence of negligence that Daniels makes it out to be, and certainly does not raise a genuine issue as to whether AHDM's staff was negligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Whether Dr. Sanchez was an independent contractor</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels contends that the district court misinterpreted our opinion in Suarez Matos v. Ashford Presbyterian Community Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194917\"><a href=\"/opinion/194917/suarez-matos-v-ashford-presbyterian/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993), when it found that AHDM was not liable because Dr. Sanchez was merely an independent contractor.  Daniels argues that under Suarez Matos, a hospital is liable when a negligent doctor is more than a mere \"independent contractor having no other relationship with the hospital.\"  Id. at 52.   Daniels takes this quotation out of context.  The relevant quote reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>While strictly, perhaps, that decision [Marquez Vega v. Martnez Rosado, 116 D.P.R. 489, 500 (1985) ] contained dictum that we might distinguish, and certainly we need not adopt plaintiff[']s contention that it would impose liability in the case of an independent contractor having no other relationship with the hospital, it is clear here that granting staff privileges coupled with a joint sharing in profits, left the hospital fully responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. The Suarez Matos opinion, which applies to situations in which the hospital has granted staff privileges to and engages in a profit-sharing relationship with a negligent physician to whom it refers a patient, did not discuss the situation Daniels presents here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the situation dealt with in Suarez Matos was markedly different from the case before us.  There, the patient sought the assistance of the hospital on an emergency basis.  Id. at 48.   The following day, a uterine tumor was removed and was examined by a pathologist on the hospital staff.  Id. The pathologist misdiagnosed the tumor as benign.  Id. By referring the tumor to the staff doctor, the hospital was, in effect, certifying the competence of that doctor.  The same cannot be said of AHDM, which did not advise Daniels to seek treatment from Dr. Sanchez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniels further argues that Dr. Sanchez was more than an independent contractor of AHDM and, thus, that AHDM is liable for his malpractice.  Daniels misconstrues the application of Puerto Rico's independent contractor law.  In Marquez Vega, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court visited this very issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>Under the second alternative--where a person goes directly to a physician's private office, agrees with him as to the treatment he or she is going to receive, and goes to a given hospital on the physician's recommendation merely because said institution is one of several which the physician has the privilege of using--the situation is somewhat different.  Under this factual framework, the main relationship established is between the \"patient\" and the physician, while the relationship established between the patient and the hospital is of a supplementary and incidental nature.  In this case, as a rule, the hospital should not be held liable for the exclusive negligence of an unsalaried physician, who was first and foremost entrusted with the patient's health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">116 D.P.R. at 499 (emphasis in original);  see also Carlos J.
