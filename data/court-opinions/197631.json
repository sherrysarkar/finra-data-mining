Samuel Jones  appeals  from the  district\r                            \r\n\ncourt's dismissal of  his action asserting federal  and state\r\n\nclaims against the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority\r\n\n(the \"MBTA\") and  Christopher Blach, an employee  of the City\r\n\nof Boston.  We affirm.\r\n\n     First, given  Jones's settlement agreement with the MBTA\r\n\nwhich  resolved  all  of  his claims  against  the  MBTA, the\r\n\ndistrict  court properly  dismissed  the  action against  the\r\n\nMBTA.   See  C. Wright, A.  Miller &amp;  E. Cooper,  13A Federal\r                                                                         \r\n\nPractice and  Procedure     3533.2,  at  233  (2d  ed.  1984)\r                                   \r\n\n(settlement moots  a case).1   Second,  the grant  of summary\r                                       1\r\n\njudgment against Jones on his federal claim against Blach was\r\n\nalso  proper.   Counsel  for  Jones  expressly  informed  the\r\n\ndistrict  court that  he  did not  intend  to oppose  summary\r\n\njudgment on that  claim, and Blach's summary  judgment motion\r\n\ncorrectly  explained  why the  allegations  in  the complaint\r\n\nfailed to state a claim for relief.  On appeal, Jones has not\r\n\nexplained why,  under those  circumstances, it  was error  to\r\n\ngrant  summary judgment for Blach.  Third, the district court\r\n\ndid  not  abuse  its  discretion  by  declining  to  exercise\r\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state claims against Blach\r\n\nonce the court had dismissed the federal claims.  Counsel for\r\n\nJones  essentially asked the court to  dismiss the claims and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1In view  of our  finding, there is  no need  to determine\r               1\r\nwhether the MBTA was a party on appeal.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmade no argument  in support of exercising  jurisdiction over\r\n\nthose claims.  Under state  law, Jones could have refiled the\r\n\nstate claims in state court.  See M.G.L. c. 260,   32 (claims\r                                             \r\n\ndismissed for  \"any matter of  form\" may be refiled  in state\r\n\ncourt  for one year after their  dismissal); Duca v.

Finally,\r\n\nJones has not  explained why his malicious  prosecution claim\r\n\ncould properly have been brought under   1983.   See Roche et\r                                                                         \r\n\nux. Roche  v. John Hancock Mut.  Life Ins.
