JAMISON,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n       [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Aldrich, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Shadur, Senior U.S. District Judge.\r\n\n Lisa S. Mouradian for appellant.\r\n Margaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jonathan R. Chapman, Assistant United States Attorney, and Jay\r\nP. McCloskey, United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                       \r\n\n                     MARCH 26, 1999\r\n                                             Per Curiam.  On May 19, 1994, Aaron Jamison was\r\nconvicted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine\r\nof conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to\r\ndistribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.  846 and\r\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation\r\nof 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1).  After significant post-trial\r\nactivity, this case comes before us on appeal of the original\r\nconviction and sentence.  We affirm.\r\n  On the evening of January 25, 1994, Maine Drug\r\nEnforcement Agency (MDEA) narcotics agents arrested a Roxanne\r\nSullivan in Berwick, Maine for selling 1.9 grams of crack\r\ncocaine to an undercover agent.  She agreed to arrange a\r\npurchase from her source so that they might arrest him as\r\nwell.  Her source was to meet her at the same parking lot\r\nwhere she had been arrested, and later that evening a van\r\ndriven by co-defendant Eugene Martin and carrying defendant\r\nJamison entered the lot.  Sullivan entered the van wearing a\r\nbody wire, over which the agents listened in on the drug\r\ntransaction.  Upon a prearranged signal from Sullivan, the\r\nagents approached the van and arrested Martin and Jamison. \r\nThey found, among other things, a false-bottomed Pledge\r\nfurniture polish can between the two front seats.  Inside the\r\ncan were ten grams of powder cocaine and several plastic bags\r\ncontaining a total of 17.4 grams of crack cocaine.  Sullivan\r\nalso turned over two aluminum foil packets, received during\r\nthe transaction, that contained a total of two grams of crack\r\ncocaine.\r\n  Martin and Jamison were tried jointly before a jury on\r\nMay 18, 1994, and the jury found them guilty as charged on May\r\n19.  Jamison was sentenced to 236 months in prison on each\r\ncount, to be served concurrently, plus four years of\r\nsupervised release and ordered to pay a $100 assessment.\r\n  The post-conviction legal maneuvering began with a\r\ndirect appeal by both defendants, but Jamison's appeal was\r\ndismissed for want of prosecution and an opinion issued with\r\nrespect to Martin only.  Later, Jamison filed a pro se Motion\r\nto Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.  2255 based on ineffective assistance of counsel.  He\r\nclaimed, first, that his trial counsel was ineffective\r\nbecause, among other things, he had failed to cross-examine\r\nSullivan adequately.  Jamison also claimed that his appellate\r\ncounsel was ineffective in allowing his appeal to be defaulted\r\nand asked that his appellate rights be restored.\r\n  Jamison's form motion, which was signed under penalty\r\nof perjury, evinced only the allegations that his trial and\r\nappellate counsel had provided ineffective assistance.  The\r\nmemorandum to which it referred for supporting facts was not\r\nsigned under penalty of perjury.  Thus, aside from a precious\r\nfew submitted in affidavits, the facts supporting Jamison's\r\nallegations of ineffective assistance were unsworn.  It was\r\nfor this reason that the magistrate judge, on August 20, 1997,\r\nrecommended denying the motion as to both claims.  He did\r\naddress the merits of the claims, however, noting that if\r\nJamison had sworn to the supporting facts, his claim as to\r\ntrial counsel certainly would have failed but his claim as to\r\nappellate counsel would have succeeded.  The district court\r\naffirmed the recommended decision on October 3, 1997, and\r\njudgment denying the motion was entered on October 6.\r\n  Jamison filed a notice of appeal on October 23 and\r\nrequested a certificate of appealability from the district\r\ncourt.  Upon its denial, Jamison filed the same request in\r\nthis court.  In an order dated March 4, 1998, this court\r\ngranted the request, but only as to his claim that his\r\nappellate counsel had caused the defaulted appeal.  The case\r\nwas remanded for expansion of the record and a determination\r\nof whether the failure to perfect the appeal was indeed\r\nattributable to Jamison's appellate counsel or, instead, to\r\nJamison himself.  The government ultimately assented to the\r\nreinstatement of Jamison's appellate rights before that\r\ndetermination was made, and the district court reinstated the\r\nappeal period by order dated June 23, 1998.   Jamison filed a\r\nnew notice of appeal on July 9, and that appeal is before us\r\nnow.\r\n  It is clear from the foregoing review of the\r\nprocedural history that Jamison's second claim on appeal, that\r\nhis  2255 motion was improperly denied, is not properly\r\nbefore this court.  Before us is the direct appeal on which\r\nJamison defaulted but was allowed to refile since his\r\nappellate counsel had caused the default.  Jamison has already\r\nsought review of the denial of his  2255 motion.  The\r\ndistrict court declined to grant a certificate of\r\nappealability as to both grounds, and this court granted one\r\nonly as to the second ground.  Jamison's claim of ineffective\r\ntrial counsel died when this court denied the requisite\r\ncertificate of appealability, and Jamison cannot resurrect it\r\non direct appeal of his conviction and sentence.\r\n  We also reject Jamison's other two contentions on\r\nappeal.  They are each based in some manner upon the trial\r\njudge's failure to require, in its jury instructions and a\r\nverdict form question, that the jury determine whether, as the\r\nindictment charged, the offenses involved more than five grams\r\nof cocaine base.\r\n  First, Jamison challenges his conviction, arguing that\r\nthe jury should have been instructed to find that each offense\r\ninvolved more than five grams of crack cocaine before\r\nconvicting him.    But this argument suffers from the\r\nfundamental misconception that drug amount is an element of\r\nthe offense that the government must prove to the jury beyond\r\na reasonable doubt.  This is not so:\r\n   Drug quantity, however, is not an element of\r\n   the offense of conviction, 21 U.S.C.  846\r\n   and 841(a)(1), but is typically relevant only\r\n   for determining the penalty.  As such, drug\r\n   quantity for purposes of  841(b) is\r\n   determined by the sentencing court under a\r\n   preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\r\n\nUnited States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160-61 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n(citations omitted).  The fact that the indictment charged\r\npossession in excess of five grams does not change matters. \r\nThe trial judge committed no error in reserving to himself the\r\ntask of determining the quantity of crack cocaine involved,\r\nand the convictions for conspiracy and possession with intent\r\nto distribute were entirely proper.\r\n   Second, Jamison challenges his sentence, arguing that,\r\nin the absence of a jury finding as to drug quantity, the\r\ntrial judge committed plain error by determining for\r\nGuidelines sentencing purposes the amount of crack cocaine\r\ninvolved in his offenses.  But, again, drug quantity is not an\r\nelement of the offense and is to be determined by the judge at\r\nsentencing under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. \r\nSee id.  The rule is the same whether the judge is determining\r\nthe mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to statute or\r\ncalculating a defendant's base offense level under the\r\nSentencing Guidelines.  See United States v. Edwards, 118 S.\r\nCt. 1475, 1477 (1998) (\"The Sentencing Guidelines instruct the\r\njudge in a case like this one to determine both the amount and\r\nthe kind of 'controlled substances' for which a defendant\r\nshould be held accountable--and then to impose a sentence that\r\nvaries depending upon amount and kind.\") (emphasis added). \r\nThus, just as Jamison's conviction was proper, so too was his\r\nsentence.  \r\n   Affirmed.\n",
