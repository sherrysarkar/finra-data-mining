Plaintiffs  are  61 former  employees  of the\r                          \r\n\nPuerto  Rico Housing  and  Urban Renewal  Corporation (CRUV)  who\r\n\nprimarily claim  that they were dismissed  from public employment\r\n\nbased on their political affiliation, in violation of their First\r\n\nAmendment rights.1   The district court  granted summary judgment\r\n\nfor  the defendants,  concluding that  the plaintiffs  had relied\r\n\n\"solely  on conclusory arguments and unsubstantiated allegations\"\r\n\nand thus had failed to establish  a prima facie case of political\r\n\ndischarge.    We  agree  that the  plaintiffs  have  not  offered\r\n\ncompetent evidence to rebut defendants'  motion, and consequently\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n     We see  no need  to revisit  the facts ably  set out  by the\r\n\ndistrict  court.  Guzman v. Garcia, 901 F.Supp. 45 (D.P.R. 1995).\r                                            \r\n\nFor the sake of context, we note only that the claims concern the\r\n\nrelocation of employees who had been working for CRUV at the time\r\n\nthe Legislature decided to  dissolve the agency.   CRUV employees\r\n\nwere ensured  priority in hiring elsewhere  in the Commonwealth,2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1 The complaint asserts  a host of other unlawful  bases for\r\ndefendants' actions, including age discrimination and retaliation\r\nfor  participation in  labor protests.   Plaintiffs also  claim a\r\ndeprivation  of due  process  in the  termination procedures  and\r\nallege a conspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C.   1985.\r\n     The age  discrimination, due  process and conspiracy  claims\r\nare mentioned in the  brief without discussion, and there  is not\r\neven  a reference to any other basis  for recovery.  We have long\r\nheld that  issues addressed  in a  perfunctory manner  are deemed\r\nwaived, see, e.g., United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17  (1st\r                                                     \r\nCir.  1990), and that principle  operates in all  its force here.\r\nWe  therefore  have  considered  only the  claim  of  politically\r\nmotivated discharge.\r\n\n     2 Contrary  to  plaintiffs,  we  do not  read  the  relevant\r\nauthorities -- Law 55 and Executive Order 1991-63 -- to guarantee\r\nemployment,  but rather  to guarantee  relocation assistance  and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nand  this  case  centers  on  plaintiffs'  allegations  that  the\r\n\nrelocation   procedures  were   administered  in   a  politically\r\n\ndiscriminatory manner.\r\n\n     Nor is it necessary  to engage in a lengthy  dissertation on\r\n\nthe inadequacies of plaintiffs' showing.  Indeed, their appellate\r\n\nargument  comprises  less than  six  pages,  and its  centerpiece\r\n\nconsists of two types  of evidence: first, hiring  statistics for\r\n\nthe  Commonwealth government overall in 1991 and 1992 and for the\r\n\nHousing   Department  in   particular,   and,  second,   reported\r\n\nstatements from several non-defendants  expressing discriminatory\r\n\nanimus  toward  members of  the  New  Progressive Party  (\"NPP\").\r\n\nNeither  the  statistics nor  the  quoted  comments --  seemingly\r\n\nhearsay  and thus  inadmissible at  trial --  provide evidentiary\r\n\nsupport for plaintiffs' assertion  that they were not transferred\r\n\nbecause of their political beliefs.3\r\n\n     We have looked  carefully at  the statements  filed by  each\r\n\nplaintiff as part of an Appendix to their Motion in Opposition to\r\n\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss.  These statements contain a jumble\r\n\nof allegations, many  of which have nothing to do  with the claim\r\n\nof  discriminatory implementation  of the  relocation procedures.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\npriority in hiring during the year after CRUV's closing. \r\n\n     3 Although plaintiffs emphasize the defendants' antipathy to\r\nthe New Progressive Party, only 40 of them are NPP  members.  Six\r\nare  members  of  the Puerto  Rico  Independence  Party,  six are\r\nmembers  of  the Popular  Democratic  Party  (\"PDP\") who  do  not\r\nsupport the incumbent PDP governor, and nine do not identify with\r\nany  party.   Plaintiffs  therefore  necessarily  claim that  the\r\ndiscrimination is  not against  any particular party  but against\r\nall those who do not share the defendants' political perspective.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nSeveral of the statements directly belie such a claim,  asserting\r\n\nthat  job  offers   were  made  but  withdrawn   because  of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' participation in this  litigation.  Regardless of the\r\n\nlawfulness  of such retaliatory conduct,  it is not  the basis of\r\n\nthe claim raised to us.4\r\n\n     Some plaintiffs similarly  attribute discrimination  against\r\n\nthem  to their  participation in  labor protests.   Some  make no\r\n\nspecific reference  to the process following  CRUV's dissolution,\r\n\nand instead  refer to continuous employment  discrimination since\r\n\nthe  Popular  Democratic Party  (PDP) took  power  in 1985.   One\r\n\nplaintiff who  identifies  himself as  non-political,  stated  \"I\r\n\ndon't know\" in  completing a  portion of the  standard form  that\r\n\nbegan \"I was discriminated because . . . .\"  Another acknowledges\r\n\nthat she was offered a job, but complains  that the procedure was\r\n\nrushed  and irregular.  Yet another states that he was reinstated\r\n\nin  the  same   position  and  salary   after  eight  months   of\r\n\nunemployment, which appears to  be within the one-year relocation\r\n\nperiod  prescribed by Law 55,  the statute dissolving  CRUV.  And\r\n\nanother  states that he was offered relocation but did not accept\r\n\nthe  new  position  because  \"I consider  it  a  degradation  and\r\n\ndemotion.\" \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4  In their  Opposition  to Defendants'  Motion for  Summary\r\nJudgment, plaintiffs did  not dispute defendants'  statement that\r\nmany  known NPP  followers had  been hired during  the relocation\r\nprocess,  responding instead:  \"The Trustee  Office discriminated\r\nagainst former CRUV's employees for their exercising of the right\r\nto  file  this  case,  which  is  violation  of plaintiffs  First\r\nAmendment  protected rights.\"  As  noted earlier,  however,  this\r\nclaim is not raised on appeal.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n     In  addition,  plaintiffs  fail  to  respond  to  statistics\r\n\noffered  by the defendants to  show that many  NPPs -- presumably\r\n\nincluding  some of the plaintiffs  -- were relocated.   Of CRUV's\r                                                    \r\n\n421 regular employees, plaintiffs claim that 65 percent -- 275 --\r\n\nwere NPPs.   Of the 87  employees who initially lost  their jobs,\r\n\nabout  40 were  NPPs.   Fifty-two of  those left  unemployed were\r\n\nrelocated  within  one  year,   including  all  but  20   of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs.5  In other words, only  20 of the 61 plaintiffs (plus\r\n\n15  non-plaintiffs) were not placed  in new jobs  within the one-\r\n\nyear relocation period.  These numbers, showing that only a small\r\n\npercentage of CRUV's NPP employees were not relocated, do not add\r\n\nup to proof of discrimination based on political affiliation.\r\n\n     In concluding  that plaintiffs  have  failed to  demonstrate\r\n\nthat  the district court  erred in granting  summary judgment for\r\n\ndefendants,  we do not discount the possibility that some of them\r\n\nsuffered from  politically based employment discrimination.   The\r\n\nhistory of  politics in  Puerto Rico makes  plausible plaintiffs'\r\n\nallegations that PDP members  expressed antipathy for NPP members\r\n\nand  over  the  years  gave  favorable  treatment  to  their  own\r\n\npartisans.   On  the  narrow question  before  us at  this  time,\r\n\nhowever --  whether a material factual  dispute exists concerning\r\n\nthe constitutionality  of defendants' implementation of  the CRUV\r\n\nrelocation  procedure  --  plaintiffs have  not  demonstrated  an\r\n\nentitlement to trial.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5  We are not told  the political affiliation  of the 20 who\r\nremained unemployed.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     The judgment  of the  district court is  therefore affirmed.\r\n\nDouble costs to appellee.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n",

Puerto Rico</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, and COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, and CYR, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs are 61 former employees of the Puerto Rico Housing and Urban Renewal Corporation (CRUV) who primarily claim that they were dismissed from public employment based on their political affiliation, in violation of their First Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, concluding that the plaintiffs had relied \"solely on conclusory arguments and unsubstantiated allegations\" and thus had failed to establish a prima facie case of political discharge.   We agree that the plaintiffs have not offered competent evidence to rebut defendants' motion, and consequently affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need to revisit the facts ably set out by the district court.  Guzman v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span> (D.P.R.1995).   For the sake of context, we note only that the claims concern the relocation of employees who had been working for CRUV at the time the Legislature decided to dissolve the agency.   CRUV employees were ensured priority in hiring elsewhere in the Commonwealth,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and this case centers on plaintiffs' allegations that the relocation procedures were administered in a politically discriminatory manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it necessary to engage in a lengthy dissertation on the inadequacies of plaintiffs' showing.   Indeed, their appellate argument comprises less than six pages, and its centerpiece consists of two types of evidence:  first, hiring statistics for the Commonwealth government overall in 1991 and 1992 and for the Housing Department in particular, and, second, reported statements from several non-defendants expressing discriminatory animus toward members of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\").   Neither the statistics nor the quoted comments--seemingly hearsay and thus inadmissible at trial--provide evidentiary support for plaintiffs' assertion that they were not transferred because of their political beliefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have looked carefully at the statements filed by each plaintiff as part of an Appendix to their Motion in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.   These statements contain a jumble of allegations, many of which have nothing to do with the claim of discriminatory implementation of the relocation procedures.   Several of the statements directly belie such a claim, asserting that job offers were made but withdrawn because of the plaintiffs' participation in this litigation.   Regardless of the lawfulness of such retaliatory conduct, it is not the basis of the claim raised to us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some plaintiffs similarly attribute discrimination against them to their participation in labor protests.   Some make no specific reference to the process following CRUV's dissolution, and instead refer to continuous employment discrimination since the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) took power in 1985.   One plaintiff who identifies himself as non-political, stated \"I don't know\" in completing a portion of the standard form that began \"I was discriminated because....\"  Another acknowledges that she was offered a job, but complains that the procedure was rushed and irregular.   Yet another states that he was reinstated in the same position and salary after eight months of unemployment, which appears to be within the one-year relocation period prescribed by Law 55, the statute dissolving CRUV.  And another states that he was offered relocation but did not accept the new position because \"I consider it a degradation and demotion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, plaintiffs fail to respond to statistics offered by the defendants to show that many NPPs--presumably including some of the plaintiffs--were relocated.   Of CRUV's 421 regular employees, plaintiffs claim that 65 percent--275--were NPPs. Of the 87 employees who initially lost their jobs, about 40 were NPPs. Fifty-two of those left unemployed were relocated within one year, including all but 20 of the plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In other words, only 20 of the 61 plaintiffs (plus 15 non-plaintiffs) were not placed in new jobs within the one-year relocation period.   These numbers, showing that only a small percentage of CRUV's NPP employees were not relocated, do not add up to proof of discrimination based on political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for defendants, we do not discount the possibility that some of them suffered from politically based employment discrimination.   The history of politics in Puerto Rico makes plausible plaintiffs' allegations that PDP members expressed antipathy for NPP members and over the years gave favorable treatment to their own partisans.   On the narrow question before us at this time, however--whether a material factual dispute exists concerning the constitutionality of defendants' implementation of the CRUV relocation procedure--plaintiffs have not demonstrated an entitlement to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.   Double costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint asserts a host of other unlawful bases for defendants' actions, including age discrimination and retaliation for participation in labor protests.   Plaintiffs also claim a deprivation of due process in the termination procedures and allege a conspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1985</p>\n        <p>The age discrimination, due process and conspiracy claims are mentioned in the brief without discussion, and there is not even a reference to any other basis for recovery.   We have long held that issues addressed in a perfunctory manner are deemed waived, see, e.g., United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990), and that principle operates in all its force here.   We therefore have considered only the claim of politically motivated discharge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Contrary to plaintiffs, we do not read the relevant authorities--Law 55 and Executive Order 1991-63--to guarantee employment, but rather to guarantee relocation assistance and priority in hiring during the year after CRUV's closing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although plaintiffs emphasize the defendants' antipathy to the New Progressive Party, only 40 of them are NPP members.   Six are members of the Puerto Rico Independence Party, six are members of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") who do not support the incumbent PDP governor, and nine do not identify with any party.   Plaintiffs therefore necessarily claim that the discrimination is not against any particular party but against all those who do not share the defendants' political perspective</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In their Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, plaintiffs did not dispute defendants' statement that many known NPP followers had been hired during the relocation process, responding instead:  \"The Trustee Office discriminated against former CRUV's employees for their exercising of the right to file this case, which is violation of plaintiffs First Amendment protected rights.\"   As noted earlier, however, this claim is not raised on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We are not told the political affiliation of the 20 who remained unemployed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
