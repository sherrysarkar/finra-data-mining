  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\n    For the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 98-1319\r\n\n   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\n           Appellee,\r\n\n               v.\r\n\n           JOHN DOE,\r\n\n      Defendant Appellant.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n[Hon. Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n[Hon. Daniel R. Dominguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n             Before\r\n\n    Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\nBownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.      \r\n\nFrank D. Inserni, by appointment of the court, on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Nelson Perez-Sosa,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa,\r\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on brief for the United States.\r\n\nOctober 14, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  In the district court, the defendant\r\nchallenged the government's refusal to move for a downward\r\ndeparture under U.S.S.G.  5K1.1.  The defendant made no colorable\r\nclaim that the refusal to depart was based on an unconstitutional\r\nmotive; instead, he asserted only that he had supplied sufficient\r\nassistance to the government to require a departure motion.  This\r\ndoes not avail in the face of a plea agreement that explicitly\r\npreserved to the government \"the sole discretion\" to decide whether\r\nto file a motion for departure based on substantial assistance. \r\nSee Loc. R. 27.1.\r\nAffirmed. \n",
