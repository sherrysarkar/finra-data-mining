Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                     Before\r\n\n            Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n     Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                      Rafael Escalera-Rodrguez, with whom Thomas J. Code, Reichard\r\n&amp; Escalera, Stuart H. Singer, Carlos M. Sires, Richard J. Brener\r\nand Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart LLP were on brief, for Commonwealth Land\r\nTitle Insurance Company.\r\nFernando L. Gallardo, with whom Woods &amp; Woods, were on brief\r\nfor Sheils Title Company, Inc.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                 July 15, 1999\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  The underlying dispute in this\r\ncase arises out of an April 1, 1993 agency agreement entered into\r\nbetween Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company (\"Commonwealth\")\r\nand Sheils Title Company, Inc. (\"Sheils\").  Under the agreement,\r\nSheils was appointed a non-exclusive agent of Commonwealth, and was\r\nauthorized to solicit and issue Commonwealth title insurance\r\npolicies in Puerto Rico.  By letter dated January 13, 1995,\r\nCommonwealth informed Sheils that the agency agreement would be\r\nterminated, effective ninety days from the date of the letter.  On\r\nJanuary 25, 1995, Sheils initiated this action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging that\r\nCommonwealth's termination of the agreement violated P.R. Laws Ann.\r\ntit. 10,  278a (\"Law 75\").  Commonwealth counterclaimed for\r\nrecovery of payments it made as a result of Sheils's alleged\r\nnegligence in the issuance of certain title insurance policies.\r\nOn August 23, 1997, a jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\nSheils on both Sheils's Law 75 claim and Commonwealth's\r\ncounterclaim.  The district court entered judgment on September 5,\r\n1997.  On September 11, Commonwealth renewed its motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law, and, in the alternative, only with\r\nrespect to its counterclaim, for a new trial.  Sheils also moved\r\nfor a new trial solely on the issue of Law 75 damages.  On\r\nMarch 13, 1998, the district court issued an Opinion and Order\r\ndenying all of these post-verdict motions.  Commonwealth and Sheils\r\nboth appeal.                            BACKGROUND\r\nCommonwealth insures title to, and other interests in,\r\nreal property in all fifty states and in Puerto Rico.  On April 1,\r\n1993, Commonwealth and Sheils entered into an agency agreement\r\nunder which Sheils became a non-exclusive agent of Commmonwealth. \r\nThe agreement authorized Sheils to solicit and issue Commonwealth\r\ntitle insurance policies in Puerto Rico.  The majority of the\r\npolicies issued by Commonwealth on the island were mortgagee\r\npolicies, insuring the mortgage interest of the lender and its\r\nsuccessors in interest.  The purchasers of these mortgagee policies\r\nwere institutional lenders.\r\nUnder the terms of the agency agreement, Sheils was\r\nauthorized to issue policies under $1,000,000 without obtaining\r\nprior consent from Commonwealth.  Sheils was also authorized to\r\ncollect the premiums belonging to Commonwealth on its behalf. \r\nAlthough the policies were issued by Sheils as Commonwealth's\r\nagent, Commonwealth bore all the risk of liability under the\r\npolicies.\r\nBecause Commonwealth bore all the risk of liability, the\r\nagency agreement contained several provisions restricting Sheils's\r\ndiscretion in issuing Commonwealth policies.  One of these\r\nprovisions prohibited Sheils from engaging in conflict of interest\r\ntransactions without first obtaining written consent from\r\nCommonwealth.  Another provision permitted Commonwealth to\r\nterminate the agency agreement upon ninety days notice in the event\r\nthat losses resulting from policies \"produced by\" Sheils exceeded\r\n25% of annual net premium dollars received from Sheils in a given\r\nyear.\r\nPrior to termination of the agency agreement, Sheils\r\nconducted business with a number of Puerto Rico financial\r\ninstitutions, including Bankers Finance Mortgage Corporation\r\n(\"Bankers Finance\").  Sheils issued numerous Commonwealth mortgagee\r\ntitle insurance policies to Bankers Finance.  At the time those\r\npolicies were issued, Michael Sheils, the president and owner of\r\nSheils Title, owned up to 9% of the stock of Bankers Finance. \r\nMichael Sheils never obtained written consent from Commonwealth to\r\nissue Commonwealth title insurance policies to Bankers Finance.\r\nAs an institutional lender, Bankers Finance routinely\r\nissued residential mortgage loans and purchased corresponding\r\nmortgagee title insurance policies.  Each title insurance policy\r\ninsured that the mortgage acquired by Bankers Finance as security\r\nfor the loan was the first and primary lien on the property. \r\nBecause the vast majority of Bankers Finance residential mortgage\r\nloans were made in the context of a refinancing of an existing\r\nmortgage loan, it was often necessary for the existing mortgage\r\nloan to be discharged in order for the Bankers Finance loan to\r\nattain first priority.  The typical practice in the industry was to\r\nuse the Bankers Finance loan proceeds to discharge the existing\r\nmortgage in order to attain first priority for the Bankers Finance\r\nmortgage interest.\r\nUnfortunately, Bankers Finance did not follow the typical\r\npractice.  Instead, Jos Alegra, the President of Bankers Finance,\r\nengaged in a fraudulent scheme whereby he falsely represented to\r\nSheils that the Bankers Finance loan proceeds were being used to\r\ndischarge the existing loans.  In reliance on this representation,\r\nSheils issued title insurance policies insuring that the Bankers\r\nFinance mortgage interest was the first and primary lien on various\r\nproperties.\r\nOnce Bankers Finance acquired title insurance from\r\nSheils, its mortgage interests became marketable.  Bankers Finance\r\nsold several of its mortgage notes to Citibank.  Upon acquisition,\r\nCitibank became the insured under the Sheils-issued title insurance\r\npolicy.  Eventually, Citibank discovered that the mortgage notes it\r\nhad purchased from Bankers Finance did not have first priority\r\nstatus because the prior liens had not been discharged.  Citibank\r\npromptly submitted claims to Sheils under the corresponding\r\nCommonwealth title insurance policies.  All of the claims submitted \r\nby Citibank resulted from title insurance policies issued by\r\nSheils.\r\nIn 1994, the losses suffered by Commonwealth as a result\r\nof claims made under Sheils-issued title insurance policies\r\nexceeded 250% of the net premium dollars received from Sheils --\r\nten times the percentage required to trigger Commonwealth's right\r\nto terminate the agency agreement under Paragraph 16(c)1, the\r\nexcessive claims provision.  Accordingly, by letter dated\r\nJanuary 13, 1995, Commonwealth informed Sheils that the agency\r\nagreement would be terminated, effective ninety days after the date\r\nof the letter.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\n1.  The Applicability of Law 75\r\nAt the close of evidence, Commonwealth moved for judgment\r\nas a matter of law on Sheils's Law 75 claim.  In its motion,\r\nCommonwealth argued that it was entitled to judgment on the ground\r\nthat Sheils failed to produce any evidence that the\r\nCommonwealth/Sheils relationship was protected by Law 75.\r\nLaw 75 was enacted to prevent suppliers from arbitrarily\r\nterminating dealers in Puerto Rico once these dealers had invested\r\nin the business to create and build a profitable market for the\r\nsuppliers' products.  See Newell Puerto Rico, Ltd. v. Rubbermaid\r\nInc., 20 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 1994).  The effect of Law 75 is not\r\nonly to protect local distributors from arbitrary termination, but\r\nalso to bind the supplier to the dealership agreement unless it can\r\nprove \"just cause\" for termination.  See 10 L.P.R.A.  278a.  If\r\na supplier cannot prove \"just cause\" for termination of a\r\ndealership agreement, the statute authorizes the court to\r\ncompensate the dealer \"for the hard-earned clientele unjustly\r\nappropriated by the supplier.\"  Nike Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales,\r\nInc., 689 F. Supp. 1235, 1238 (D.P.R. 1988).\r\nNot all commercial relationships are protected by Law 75. \r\nRather, before invoking the remedies provided by the statute, a\r\ncourt must first determine whether the commercial relationship at\r\nissue constitutes a \"dealer's contract\" within the meaning of\r\n278(b).  In San Juan Mercantile Corp. v. Canadian Transp. Co.,\r\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court defined a Law 75 \"dealer\" as\r\n         one characterized by his endeavors to create a\r\nfavorable market and to draw customers to a\r\nproduct or service by promoting and closing\r\nsales contracts . . . . Publicity, market\r\ncoordination, merchandise deliveries,\r\ncollections, the keeping of an inventory, and\r\nmainly the promotion and closing of sales\r\ncontracts are, in general terms, the\r\nobligations of the dealer.\r\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. No. O-78-97, slip op. at 220-21, 108 D.P.R. 211,\r\n215 (Dec. 28, 1978).\r\nTen years later, in Roberco, Inc. v. Oxford Indus., Inc.,\r\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court further clarified the definition of\r\n\"dealer\" by providing a non-exhaustive list of factors to be taken\r\ninto consideration in determining whether an entity or person has\r\nachieved protected status under Law 75:\r\n         In order to determine if a 'dealership' is\r\ninvolved, several factors must be taken into\r\nconsideration, among them, if the 'dealer'\r\nactively promotes the product and/or concludes\r\ncontracts; if he keeps an inventory; if he has\r\na say on price fixing; if he has discretion to\r\nfix the sale terms; if he has delivery and\r\nbilling responsibilities and authority to\r\nextend credit; if he independently or jointly\r\nembarks on advertising campaigns; if he has\r\nassumed the risks and responsibilities for the\r\nactivities undertaken; if he buys the product;\r\nand if he has facilities and offers product-\r\nrelated services to his clients.  More could\r\nbe added inasmuch as a complete list is not\r\nintended. \r\n\n122 D.P.R. 115, at 131-32, P.R. Offic. Trans. No. RE-85-300, slip\r\nop. at 13 (June 30, 1988).  The Roberco court also explained that\r\n\"no single factor is conclusive by itself and none has more weight\r\nor importance than the others.\"  Id.\r\nDespite its acknowledgment of the Roberco factors,\r\nCommonwealth argues that the subsequent Puerto Rico Supreme Court\r\ndecision in Oliveras v. Universal Ins. Co., 96 J.T.S. 45, P.R.\r\nOffic. Trans. RE-89-435/RE-89-439, slip. op. (Nov. 7, 1996),\r\ncompels a finding that the relationship between Commonwealth and\r\nSheils Title falls outside the scope of protection of Law 75.  In\r\nmaking this argument, Commonwealth asserts that the Oliveras court\r\napplied the Roberco factors to the relationship at issue in that\r\ncase and held that the relationship was not protected by Law 75. \r\nBecause of the \"striking similarities\" between the\r\nOliveras/Universal relationship and the Commonwealth/Sheils\r\nrelationship, Commonwealth contends that the Oliveras decision\r\nentitles it to judgment as a matter of law on Sheils's Law 75\r\nclaim.\r\nWe disagree with Commonwealth's statement of the holding\r\nof Oliveras.  In that case, Oliveras, Inc. (\"Oliveras\") entered\r\ninto a non-exclusive agency agreement with the Universal Insurance\r\nCompany (\"Universal\").  See id. at 290, slip op. at 8.  When\r\nUniversal decided to cancel the agreement, Oliveras filed a\r\ncomplaint alleging arbitrary termination under Law 75, and breach\r\nof contract.  See id. at 291, slip op. at 10.  Ultimately, the\r\ntrial court entered judgment in favor of Oliveras on the breach of\r\ncontract cause of action in the amount of $1,093,106, and both\r\nparties appealed.  See id. at 291, slip op. at 10-11.  Before the\r\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court, Oliveras claimed that the court of first\r\ninstance erred by not awarding it Law 75 damages.  See id. at 291,\r\nslip op. at 11.\r\nIn Oliveras, the court did not hold that the\r\nOliveras/Univeral relationship was not protected by Law 75. \r\nRather, the court concluded that it did not need to make the\r\ndetermination whether Oliveras was entitled to Law 75 damages\r\nbecause\r\n         [e]ven assuming, for argumentative purposes,\r\nthat the contractual relationship that existed\r\nbetween Universal and Oliveras was protected\r\nby the aforecited Law 75, it is our criteria\r\nthat the concession of damages to Oliveras is\r\nnot pertinent: this because we understand that\r\nUniversal had \"just cause\" to cancel the\r\nexisting agreement.\r\n\nOliveras, 96 J.T.S. at 294-95, slip op. at 15.  Because the\r\nOliveras Court did not reach the question of the applicability of\r\nLaw 75, its decision clearly does not compel a finding that the\r\nCommonwealth/Sheils relationship falls outside the scope of\r\nprotection of Law 75.\r\nHaving said this, and mindful of the care that the\r\nOliveras court took in assuming only argumentatively the\r\napplicability of Law 75, we find ourselves in the same position. \r\nAs we shall explain, even assuming, without deciding, that the\r\nrelationship of Sheils to Commonwealth is that of a \"dealership,\"\r\nwe conclude that Commonwealth had \"just cause\" to terminate the\r\nagency agreement.\r\n2.  \"Just Cause\"\r\nCommonwealth next challenges the district court's denial \r\nof judgment as a matter of law with respect to Commonwealth's claim\r\nthat \"just cause\" existed for its termination of the agency\r\nagreement.  At the outset, it is important to note that Law 75 was\r\nnot intended to prevent termination of unworkable relationships,\r\nbut only to prevent arbitrary terminations.  See R.W. Int'l Corp.\r\nv. Welch Food, Inc., 13 F.3d 478, 485 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nCommonwealth asserts two grounds for its termination of the agency\r\nagreement, and argues that both grounds constitute \"just cause\" as\r\na matter of law.  See supra note 8.\r\nCommonwealth first points to Sheils's performance during\r\ncalendar years 1993 and 1994, which triggered the exercise of\r\nCommonwealth's rights under Paragraph 16(c)1 of the agency\r\nagreement.  Under Paragraph 16(c)1, Commonwealth reserved the right\r\nto terminate the agreement, with ninety days written notice, if\r\n\"[d]uring any calendar year . . . claims expense produced by the\r\nAGENT exceeds 25% of annual net premium remittance.\"  At trial,\r\nCommonwealth presented evidence that the claims submitted to\r\nCommonwealth under policies issued by Sheils during calendar years\r\n1993 and 1994 exceeded the amount of annual net premiums by 250% --\r\nmore than ten times the percentage required to trigger Paragraph\r\n16(c)1.  Commonwealth argues that the issuance by Sheils of title\r\ninsurance policies resulting in over $1.8 million in losses,\r\nconstituted \"just cause\" for termination of Sheils as a\r\nCommonwealth agent.\r\nAlthough \"just cause\" is typically a question of fact for\r\nthe jury, see R.W. Int'l Corp. v. Welch Foods, Inc., 88 F.3d 49, 51\r\n(1st Cir. 1996), Sheils does not dispute the historical facts upon\r\nwhich Commonwealth bases its right to exercise the excessive claims\r\nprovision.  Nor does Sheils make the argument that Paragraph 16(c)1\r\nwas not an \"essential obligation\" of the dealer's contract.  See\r\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278(d).  Rather, Sheils contends that\r\nParagraph 16(c)1 should not apply because its language does not\r\naccurately reflect the way that the title insurance business is\r\nconducted in Puerto Rico.  Specifically, Sheils argues that the\r\n\"produced by\" language of the excessive claims provision renders\r\nthat provision inapplicable to Puerto Rico title insurance agents\r\nbecause in Puerto Rico title insurance agents do not \"produce\"\r\nclaims.  With respect to the $1.8 million of claims submitted by\r\nCitibank to Commonwealth, Sheils makes the novel argument that\r\nthose claims were \"produced by\" Bankers Finance, and, more\r\nspecifically, by the misdeeds of its president, Jos Alegra -- not\r\nby Sheils.\r\nSheils's argument, although imaginative, cannot prevail. \r\nRegardless of the way in which the title insurance business is\r\nconducted in Puerto Rico, see supra, note 11, we conclude that\r\nCommonwealth reasonably intended and understood the term \"produced\"\r\nto include within its scope all claims expenses resulting from\r\npolicies issued by Sheils.  We reach this conclusion after\r\ncarefully considering the nature of the title insurance industry\r\nand the evidence presented at trial.\r\nFirst, the reality of title insurance is that it insures\r\nfailures to discover existing flaws or defects in title.  As such,\r\ntitle insurance differs significantly from other types of\r\ninsurance.  Weigel explained this difference at trial:\r\n         A:  Our business is a little bit different. \r\nMore -- most other kinds of insurance, the\r\nwhole idea is they assume the risk.  In our\r\nbusiness we try to eliminate the risk or to\r\navoid the risk.\r\n\n         Q:  How is that possible?  \r\n\n         A:  It is possible when you take a look at the\r\nhistorical record of a title and search the\r\ntitle properly and make sure that the liens on\r\nthe property are discharged and do all of the\r\nresearch necessary and file all of the proper\r\ndocuments, you eliminate the risk involved in\r\na title insurance policy.\r\n\n         Q: How is that different [from] a life\r\ninsurance company when it examines someone to\r\nissue a life insurance policy?\r\n\n         A:  People make comparisons with a doctor's\r\nexamination.  If you think about examining the\r\ntitle as you do about examining the person,\r\nthe difference is if you examine the title and\r\nyou do the job you are eliminating the\r\npossibility of anything bad happening.  You\r\nare eliminating the possibility of a claim.\r\n\n(Tr. 8/19/97 Afternoon Sess. at 31-32.)  As Weigel explained, title\r\ninsurance is unique in that it looks backwards, not forwards, and\r\ninsures the validity and accuracy of an existing, historical\r\ndocument.  This historical focus is a double-edged sword from the\r\nperspective of a title insurance agent.  On the one hand, it\r\nrenders agents entirely capable of eliminating risk of liability\r\nunder the terms of a title insurance policy.  On the other hand, it\r\nmeans that any claims expenses that result will, in most cases, be\r\ncaused directly or indirectly by the agent.  Commonwealth presented\r\nevidence at trial to this effect:\r\n         Q:  Let me ask you a little bit about the\r\ndifference or the elements that make our kind\r\nof insurance different.  How would you compare\r\nour business in terms of the assumption of\r\nrisk with other insurance business?\r\n\n         A:  We're all insurance companies.  We assume\r\nthe risk in exchange for a premium, for an\r\namount of money that we're paid to assume\r\nthat.  The agent in all cases is the person\r\nthat can -- is there to protect the company\r\nfrom, prevent losses.  The example that I\r\nwould say is that in an auto insurance\r\ncompany, for example, you're going to run a --\r\ncheck the driving record of the driver.  If\r\nyou find out that the driver has been arrested\r\nfive times for drunk driving and crashed\r\nseveral times, you're not going to insure him\r\n. . . And it's the same way with title\r\ninsurance.\r\n\n         Q:  Yes, but in other types of insurance you\r\ncan have the best driver in the world and you\r\ncan -- and he can have an accident and you can\r\nhave the healthiest guy die.  Is that our\r\nbusiness, sir?  \r\n\n         A:  Yes.  We have a risk, but again it's back\r\nto the agent.  The agent is in the position\r\nand in title insurance the primary thing that\r\nthe agent must do is make sure that [the]\r\nprior mortgage has been canceled, it's been\r\npaid before they issue that new policy.\r\n\n(Tr. 8/13/97 Morning Sess. at 28-29.)  The undisputed testimony of\r\nboth Smith and Weigel establishes that, because of the unique\r\nnature of the title insurance industry, title agents directly or\r\nindirectly cause most claims expenses.  In light of this\r\nuncontested evidence, the intended meaning of the \"produced by\"\r\nterm in Paragraph 16(c)1 is clear.  We conclude that Commonwealth\r\nreasonably intended and expected the term \"produced by\" to include\r\nwithin the scope of Paragraph 16(c)1 all claims expenses resulting\r\nfrom policies issued by Sheils.\r\nSheils's second argument fares no better.  Sheils argues\r\nthat, assuming arguendo that the excessive claims provision is\r\napplicable to it as a Puerto Rico title insurance agent,\r\nCommonwealth failed to carry its burden under  278a-1(c) to prove\r\nthat the 25% provision was reasonable given the realities of the\r\nPuerto Rican market.  Section 278a-1(c) states:\r\n         The violation or nonperformance by the dealer\r\nof any provision included in the dealer's\r\ncontract fixing rules of conduct or\r\ndistribution quotas or goals because it does\r\nnot adjust to the realities of the Puerto\r\nRican market at the time of the violation or\r\nnonperformance by the dealer shall not be\r\ndeemed just cause.  The burden of proof to\r\nshow the reasonableness of the rule of conduct\r\nor of the quota or goal fixed shall rest on\r\nthe principal or grantor.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278a-1(c).  In making this argument,\r\nhowever, Sheils ignores the evidence in the record that\r\nCommonwealth's other agents in Puerto Rico were able to maintain\r\ntheir claims expense at under 11% of their annual net remittances. \r\nAt trial, Donald C. Weigel, President of northern operations for\r\nCommonwealth, specifically testified as to the reasonableness of\r\nthe 25% excessive claims provision in the Commonwealth/Sheils\r\nagreement:\r\n             Q.  Tell us, according to the company numbers\r\n    for the same period of time, what was the\r\n    situation in Puerto Rico if you consider\r\n    all of your agents except Sheils Title?\r\n\n             A:  Without Sheils Title you will see that our\r\n    claims experience there is 10.9%, which is\r\n    below the national average, which means\r\n    for the company it [Puerto Rico] is an\r\n    attractive place to do business.  \r\n\n(Tr. 8/19/97 Afternoon Session at 29.)  The testimony of Mr. Weigel\r\nto the effect that Commonwealth's other agents in Puerto Rico were\r\nable to maintain their claims expenses well under 25% is sufficient\r\nevidence of the reasonableness of the excessive claims provision to\r\nsatisfy Commonwealth's burden under  278a-1(c).  Moreover, Sheils\r\nfailed to come forward with any contradictory evidence on this\r\npoint.\r\nAgain, the language of Paragraph 16(c)1 is clear and\r\nunambiguous: Commonwealth is entitled to terminate Sheils as its\r\nagent when, during any calendar year, the claims expense on\r\npolicies issued by Sheils exceeds 25% of annual net premiums.  The\r\nfacts are not in dispute.  The claims submitted to Commonwealth\r\nunder Sheils-issued policies exceeded at least 250% of the net\r\npremiums in calendar years 1993 and 1994.  After careful\r\nconsideration of the record, we conclude that Commonwealth had\r\n\"just cause\", as a matter of law, to terminate Sheils as its agent.\r\nBecause we find that the excessive claims provision\r\nconstituted \"just cause\" for termination of the Commonwealth/Sheils\r\nagency agreement, we need not reach Commonwealth's second ground\r\nfor termination: the conflict of interest provision.\r\nOur conclusion also renders moot Sheils's appeal from the\r\ndistrict court's denial of its motion for a new trial on the issue\r\nof Law 75 damages.  Sheils is no longer entitled to Law 75 damages,\r\nlet alone a new trial.\r\n3.  Commonwealth's Counterclaim for Negligence\r\nIn response to Sheils's complaint alleging arbitrary\r\ntermination in violation of Law 75, Commonwealth asserted a\r\ncounterclaim against Sheils for recovery of the approximately $1.8\r\nmillion it paid in claims as a result of Sheils's alleged\r\nnegligence.  Commonwealth's based its counterclaim on Paragraph\r\n13(a) of the agency agreement, which provides that Sheils shall be\r\nliable to Commonwealth for \"any loss, cost or expense . . .\r\nsustained or incurred by [Commonwealth] and arising from the fraud,\r\nnegligence or misconduct of [Sheils].\"  Commonwealth argued that\r\nSheils was negligent in failing to assure that existing mortgages\r\nwere in fact being discharged prior to insuring the priority of new\r\nmortgages.\r\nTo recover damages based on Sheils's negligence under\r\nParagraph 13(a), Commonwealth was required to prove that: (1)\r\nSheils owed a duty to Commonwealth to conform its conduct to a\r\nreasonable standard of care; (2) Sheils breached that duty; and (3)\r\nSheils's breach caused Commonwealth harm.  See Tokio Marine &amp; Fire\r\nIns. Co., Ltd. v. Grove Mfg. Co., 958 F.2d 1169, 1171 (1st Cir.\r\n1992).  At trial, Sheils did not dispute the first element of this\r\ncause of action; it acknowledged that as Commonwealth's title\r\ninsurance agent it owed a duty to Commonwealth to ensure that prior\r\nliens were timely paid and canceled.  Rather, Sheils disputed the\r\nsecond element: namely, that the steps it took and the procedures\r\nit implemented to fulfill this duty fell below a reasonable\r\nstandard of care.\r\nAt the close of evidence, the jury returned a verdict\r\nagainst Commonwealth on its negligence counterclaim.  After\r\njudgment was entered, Commonwealth moved for judgment as a matter\r\nof law, or, in the alternative for a new trial on its counterclaim. \r\nThe district court denied both motions, and Commonwealth now\r\nappeals.\r\nOur review of a denial of judgment as a matter of law is\r\nseverely circumscribed.  See Conway v. Electro Switch Corp., 825\r\nF.2d 593, 598 (1st Cir. 1987).  We must sustain the district\r\ncourt's denial of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion, \"unless the\r\nevidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the\r\nverdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion,\r\nnamely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\"  Birch v.\r\nPH Group, 985 F.2d 649, 653 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nOn the other hand, we review denial of a motion for a new\r\ntrial for abuse of discretion.  See id.  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59,\r\na trial judge has ample power to set aside the verdict and grant a\r\nnew trial if he or she is of the opinion that the verdict is\r\nagainst the clear weight of the evidence.  See Coffran v. Hitchcock\r\nClinic, Inc., 683 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1982).  In denying a motion\r\nfor a new trial, there is no abuse of discretion unless \"the\r\nverdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to\r\namount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  PH Group, 985 F.2d\r\nat 653 (citations and quotations omitted).  With these standards in\r\nmind, we examine the evidence presented at trial to determine\r\nwhether Commonwealth's allegations of error are correct.\r\nAt trial, Sheils presented evidence that to fulfill its\r\nduty of care to Commonwealth it employed in-house attorneys and\r\nother personnel to perform spot checks of the payment and\r\ncancellation of prior liens.  Michael Sheils explained the\r\nprocedure utilized by the company:\r\n         say we would close 100 cases in one month. \r\nMaybe we would check 20 of them and not check\r\nthem all.  It was impossible to check them\r\nall.  We would send several investigators to\r\nthe registry . . . . to make sure that the\r\ncancellation of Bank No. 2 canceling Bank No.\r\n1's mortgage, we wanted to make sure that was\r\ncanceled.\r\n\n(Tr. 7/17/97 Morning Session at 75-76.)  One of the attorneys\r\nemployed to perform these spot checks, Robert Segarra, further\r\ntestified that spot checking was the typical business practice of\r\ntitle insurance agents in Puerto Rico, and that his current\r\nemployer, San Juan Abstract Company, utilized the same procedure.\r\nWith respect to the policies issued to Bankers Finance,\r\nSheils also presented evidence of its efforts to obtain additional\r\nverification -- beyond the spot checks -- of the cancellation of\r\nprior mortgages.  Specifically, Segarra testified that, pursuant to\r\ninstructions from Michael Sheils, he wrote a letter dated June 30,\r\n1993 to Jos Gmez Alegra, the attorney for Bankers Finance,\r\nrequesting confirmation that Bankers Finance was performing timely\r\ncancellations.  The Bankers Finance attorney responded, in writing,\r\nthat cancellations were being performed diligently.  In the letter,\r\nGmez Alegra explained the procedure utilized by Bankers Finance\r\nto ensure timely cancellations: namely, that a messenger of Bankers\r\nFinance would hand-deliver a check in the amount of the outstanding\r\nlien to the prior lienholder.  Gmez Alegra even extended a\r\npersonal invitation to Segarra to visit the Bankers Finance offices\r\nto observe its procedures and to obtain further verification of the\r\ntimely payment of prior liens.\r\nMost significantly, several employees of Bankers Finance\r\ntestified that the nonpayment of prior mortgages was top secret at\r\nBankers Finance, and that only a small group of employees knew that\r\nLourdes Ramos was concealing the cut checks in a Federal Express\r\nbox in the top drawer of her desk pursuant to Jos Alegra's\r\norders.  There is no evidence in the record that Sheils was aware\r\nthat these checks were not being forwarded to prior lienholders.\r\nAfter hearing all of the evidence, the jury concluded\r\nthat Sheils's spot-check procedures and its additional follow-up\r\nwith Gmez Alegra satisfied its duty of care to Commonwealth to\r\nensure that prior mortgages were timely discharged.  We cannot\r\nagree that this conclusion was unreasonable.  We do not consider\r\nthe jury's verdict \"so clearly against the weight of the evidence\r\nas to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  PH Group, 985\r\nF.2d at 653 (citations and quotations omitted).  We, therefore,\r\naffirm the district court's denial of Commonwealth's motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law and for a new trial with respect to its\r\nnegligence counterclaim.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the district\r\ncourt's denial of judgment as a matter of law with respect to the\r\nexistence of \"just cause\" for Commonwealth's termination of the\r\nagency agreement.  However, we affirm the district court's denial\r\nof judgment as a matter of law with respect to Commonwealth's\r\ncounterclaim for negligence.\r\n",

The underlying dispute in this\r\ncase arises out of an April 1, 1993 agency agreement entered into\r\nbetween Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company (\"Commonwealth\")\r\nand Sheils Title Company, Inc. (\"Sheils\").  Under the agreement,\r\nSheils was appointed a non-exclusive agent of Commonwealth, and was\r\nauthorized to solicit and issue Commonwealth title insurance\r\npolicies in Puerto Rico.  By letter dated January 13, 1995,\r\nCommonwealth informed Sheils that the agency agreement would be\r\nterminated, effective ninety days from the date of the letter.  On\r\nJanuary 25, 1995, Sheils initiated this action in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging that\r\nCommonwealth's termination of the agreement violated P.R. Laws Ann.\r\ntit. 10,  278a (\"Law 75\").  Commonwealth counterclaimed for\r\nrecovery of payments it made as a result of Sheils's alleged\r\nnegligence in the issuance of certain title insurance policies.\r\nOn August 23, 1997, a jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\nSheils on both Sheils's Law 75 claim and Commonwealth's\r\ncounterclaim.  The district court entered judgment on September 5,\r\n1997.  On September 11, Commonwealth renewed its motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law, and, in the alternative, only with\r\nrespect to its counterclaim, for a new trial.  Sheils also moved\r\nfor a new trial solely on the issue of Law 75 damages.  On\r\nMarch 13, 1998, the district court issued an Opinion and Order\r\ndenying all of these post-verdict motions.  Commonwealth and Sheils\r\nboth appeal.                            BACKGROUND\r\nCommonwealth insures title to, and other interests in,\r\nreal property in all fifty states and in Puerto Rico.  On April 1,\r\n1993, Commonwealth and Sheils entered into an agency agreement\r\nunder which Sheils became a non-exclusive agent of Commmonwealth. \r\nThe agreement authorized Sheils to solicit and issue Commonwealth\r\ntitle insurance policies in Puerto Rico.  The majority of the\r\npolicies issued by Commonwealth on the island were mortgagee\r\npolicies, insuring the mortgage interest of the lender and its\r\nsuccessors in interest.  The purchasers of these mortgagee policies\r\nwere institutional lenders.\r\nUnder the terms of the agency agreement, Sheils was\r\nauthorized to issue policies under $1,000,000 without obtaining\r\nprior consent from Commonwealth.  Sheils was also authorized to\r\ncollect the premiums belonging to Commonwealth on its behalf. \r\nAlthough the policies were issued by Sheils as Commonwealth's\r\nagent, Commonwealth bore all the risk of liability under the\r\npolicies.\r\nBecause Commonwealth bore all the risk of liability, the\r\nagency agreement contained several provisions restricting Sheils's\r\ndiscretion in issuing Commonwealth policies.  One of these\r\nprovisions prohibited Sheils from engaging in conflict of interest\r\ntransactions without first obtaining written consent from\r\nCommonwealth.  Another provision permitted Commonwealth to\r\nterminate the agency agreement upon ninety days notice in the event\r\nthat losses resulting from policies \"produced by\" Sheils exceeded\r\n25% of annual net premium dollars received from Sheils in a given\r\nyear.\r\nPrior to termination of the agency agreement, Sheils\r\nconducted business with a number of Puerto Rico financial\r\ninstitutions, including Bankers Finance Mortgage Corporation\r\n(\"Bankers Finance\").  Sheils issued numerous Commonwealth mortgagee\r\ntitle insurance policies to Bankers Finance.  At the time those\r\npolicies were issued, Michael Sheils, the president and owner of\r\nSheils Title, owned up to 9% of the stock of Bankers Finance. \r\nMichael Sheils never obtained written consent from Commonwealth to\r\nissue Commonwealth title insurance policies to Bankers Finance.\r\nAs an institutional lender, Bankers Finance routinely\r\nissued residential mortgage loans and purchased corresponding\r\nmortgagee title insurance policies.  Each title insurance policy\r\ninsured that the mortgage acquired by Bankers Finance as security\r\nfor the loan was the first and primary lien on the property. \r\nBecause the vast majority of Bankers Finance residential mortgage\r\nloans were made in the context of a refinancing of an existing\r\nmortgage loan, it was often necessary for the existing mortgage\r\nloan to be discharged in order for the Bankers Finance loan to\r\nattain first priority.  The typical practice in the industry was to\r\nuse the Bankers Finance loan proceeds to discharge the existing\r\nmortgage in order to attain first priority for the Bankers Finance\r\nmortgage interest.\r\nUnfortunately, Bankers Finance did not follow the typical\r\npractice.  Instead, Jos Alegra, the President of Bankers Finance,\r\nengaged in a fraudulent scheme whereby he falsely represented to\r\nSheils that the Bankers Finance loan proceeds were being used to\r\ndischarge the existing loans.  In reliance on this representation,\r\nSheils issued title insurance policies insuring that the Bankers\r\nFinance mortgage interest was the first and primary lien on various\r\nproperties.\r\nOnce Bankers Finance acquired title insurance from\r\nSheils, its mortgage interests became marketable.  Bankers Finance\r\nsold several of its mortgage notes to Citibank.  Upon acquisition,\r\nCitibank became the insured under the Sheils-issued title insurance\r\npolicy.  Eventually, Citibank discovered that the mortgage notes it\r\nhad purchased from Bankers Finance did not have first priority\r\nstatus because the prior liens had not been discharged.  Citibank\r\npromptly submitted claims to Sheils under the corresponding\r\nCommonwealth title insurance policies.  All of the claims submitted \r\nby Citibank resulted from title insurance policies issued by\r\nSheils.\r\nIn 1994, the losses suffered by Commonwealth as a result\r\nof claims made under Sheils-issued title insurance policies\r\nexceeded 250% of the net premium dollars received from Sheils --\r\nten times the percentage required to trigger Commonwealth's right\r\nto terminate the agency agreement under Paragraph 16(c)1, the\r\nexcessive claims provision.  Accordingly, by letter dated\r\nJanuary 13, 1995, Commonwealth informed Sheils that the agency\r\nagreement would be terminated, effective ninety days after the date\r\nof the letter.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\n1.  The Applicability of Law 75\r\nAt the close of evidence, Commonwealth moved for judgment\r\nas a matter of law on Sheils's Law 75 claim.  In its motion,\r\nCommonwealth argued that it was entitled to judgment on the ground\r\nthat Sheils failed to produce any evidence that the\r\nCommonwealth/Sheils relationship was protected by Law 75.\r\nLaw 75 was enacted to prevent suppliers from arbitrarily\r\nterminating dealers in Puerto Rico once these dealers had invested\r\nin the business to create and build a profitable market for the\r\nsuppliers' products.  See Newell Puerto Rico, Ltd. v. Rubbermaid\r\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666565\"><a href=\"/opinion/666565/newell-puerto-rico-ltd-v-rubbermaid-incorporated-newell-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 1994).  The effect of Law 75 is not\r\nonly to protect local distributors from arbitrary termination, but\r\nalso to bind the supplier to the dealership agreement unless it can\r\nprove \"just cause\" for termination.  See 10 L.P.R.A.  278a.  If\r\na supplier cannot prove \"just cause\" for termination of a\r\ndealership agreement, the statute authorizes the court to\r\ncompensate the dealer \"for the hard-earned clientele unjustly\r\nappropriated by the supplier.\"  Nike Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales,\r\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890395\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890395/nike-intern-ltd-v-athletic-sales-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1238 (D.P.R. 1988).\r\nNot all commercial relationships are protected by Law 75. \r\nRather, before invoking the remedies provided by the statute, a\r\ncourt must first determine whether the commercial relationship at\r\nissue constitutes a \"dealer's contract\" within the meaning of\r\n278(b).  In San Juan Mercantile Corp. v. Canadian Transp. Co.,\r\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court defined a Law 75 \"dealer\" as\r\n         one characterized by his endeavors to create a\r\nfavorable market and to draw customers to a\r\nproduct or service by promoting and closing\r\nsales contracts . . . . Publicity, market\r\ncoordination, merchandise deliveries,\r\ncollections, the keeping of an inventory, and\r\nmainly the promotion and closing of sales\r\ncontracts are, in general terms, the\r\nobligations of the dealer.\r\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. No. O-78-97, slip op. at 220-21, 108 D.P.R. 211,\r\n215 (Dec. 28, 1978).\r\nTen years later, in Roberco, Inc. v. Oxford Indus., Inc.,\r\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court further clarified the definition of\r\n\"dealer\" by providing a non-exhaustive list of factors to be taken\r\ninto consideration in determining whether an entity or person has\r\nachieved protected status under Law 75:\r\n         In order to determine if a 'dealership' is\r\ninvolved, several factors must be taken into\r\nconsideration, among them, if the 'dealer'\r\nactively promotes the product and/or concludes\r\ncontracts; if he keeps an inventory; if he has\r\na say on price fixing; if he has discretion to\r\nfix the sale terms; if he has delivery and\r\nbilling responsibilities and authority to\r\nextend credit; if he independently or jointly\r\nembarks on advertising campaigns; if he has\r\nassumed the risks and responsibilities for the\r\nactivities undertaken; if he buys the product;\r\nand if he has facilities and offers product-\r\nrelated services to his clients.  More could\r\nbe added inasmuch as a complete list is not\r\nintended. \r\n\n122 D.P.R. 115, at 131-32, P.R. Offic. Trans. No. RE-85-300, slip\r\nop. at 13 (June 30, 1988).  The Roberco court also explained that\r\n\"no single factor is conclusive by itself and none has more weight\r\nor importance than the others.\"  Id.\r\nDespite its acknowledgment of the Roberco factors,\r\nCommonwealth argues that the subsequent Puerto Rico Supreme Court\r\ndecision in Oliveras v. Universal Ins. Co., 96 J.T.S. 45, P.R.\r\nOffic. Trans. RE-89-435/RE-89-439, slip. op. (Nov. 7, 1996),\r\ncompels a finding that the relationship between Commonwealth and\r\nSheils Title falls outside the scope of protection of Law 75.  In\r\nmaking this argument, Commonwealth asserts that the Oliveras court\r\napplied the Roberco factors to the relationship at issue in that\r\ncase and held that the relationship was not protected by Law 75. \r\nBecause of the \"striking similarities\" between the\r\nOliveras/Universal relationship and the Commonwealth/Sheils\r\nrelationship, Commonwealth contends that the Oliveras decision\r\nentitles it to judgment as a matter of law on Sheils's Law 75\r\nclaim.\r\nWe disagree with Commonwealth's statement of the holding\r\nof Oliveras.  In that case, Oliveras, Inc. (\"Oliveras\") entered\r\ninto a non-exclusive agency agreement with the Universal Insurance\r\nCompany (\"Universal\").  See id. at 290, slip op. at 8.  When\r\nUniversal decided to cancel the agreement, Oliveras filed a\r\ncomplaint alleging arbitrary termination under Law 75, and breach\r\nof contract.  See id. at 291, slip op. at 10.  Ultimately, the\r\ntrial court entered judgment in favor of Oliveras on the breach of\r\ncontract cause of action in the amount of $1,093,106, and both\r\nparties appealed.  See id. at 291, slip op. at 10-11.  Before the\r\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court, Oliveras claimed that the court of first\r\ninstance erred by not awarding it Law 75 damages.  See id. at 291,\r\nslip op. at 11.\r\nIn Oliveras, the court did not hold that the\r\nOliveras/Univeral relationship was not protected by Law 75. \r\nRather, the court concluded that it did not need to make the\r\ndetermination whether Oliveras was entitled to Law 75 damages\r\nbecause\r\n         [e]ven assuming, for argumentative purposes,\r\nthat the contractual relationship that existed\r\nbetween Universal and Oliveras was protected\r\nby the aforecited Law 75, it is our criteria\r\nthat the concession of damages to Oliveras is\r\nnot pertinent: this because we understand that\r\nUniversal had \"just cause\" to cancel the\r\nexisting agreement.\r\n\nOliveras, 96 J.T.S. at 294-95, slip op. at 15.  Because the\r\nOliveras Court did not reach the question of the applicability of\r\nLaw 75, its decision clearly does not compel a finding that the\r\nCommonwealth/Sheils relationship falls outside the scope of\r\nprotection of Law 75.\r\nHaving said this, and mindful of the care that the\r\nOliveras court took in assuming only argumentatively the\r\napplicability of Law 75, we find ourselves in the same position. \r\nAs we shall explain, even assuming, without deciding, that the\r\nrelationship of Sheils to Commonwealth is that of a \"dealership,\"\r\nwe conclude that Commonwealth had \"just cause\" to terminate the\r\nagency agreement.\r\n2.  \"Just Cause\"\r\nCommonwealth next challenges the district court's denial \r\nof judgment as a matter of law with respect to Commonwealth's claim\r\nthat \"just cause\" existed for its termination of the agency\r\nagreement.  At the outset, it is important to note that Law 75 was\r\nnot intended to prevent termination of unworkable relationships,\r\nbut only to prevent arbitrary terminations.  See R.W. Int'l Corp.\r\nv. Welch Food, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195156\"><a href=\"/opinion/195156/rw-international-v-welch-food/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nCommonwealth asserts two grounds for its termination of the agency\r\nagreement, and argues that both grounds constitute \"just cause\" as\r\na matter of law.  See supra note 8.\r\nCommonwealth first points to Sheils's performance during\r\ncalendar years 1993 and 1994, which triggered the exercise of\r\nCommonwealth's rights under Paragraph 16(c)1 of the agency\r\nagreement.  Under Paragraph 16(c)1, Commonwealth reserved the right\r\nto terminate the agreement, with ninety days written notice, if\r\n\"[d]uring any calendar year . . . claims expense produced by the\r\nAGENT exceeds 25% of annual net premium remittance.\"  At trial,\r\nCommonwealth presented evidence that the claims submitted to\r\nCommonwealth under policies issued by Sheils during calendar years\r\n1993 and 1994 exceeded the amount of annual net premiums by 250% --\r\nmore than ten times the percentage required to trigger Paragraph\r\n16(c)1.  Commonwealth argues that the issuance by Sheils of title\r\ninsurance policies resulting in over $1.8 million in losses,\r\nconstituted \"just cause\" for termination of Sheils as a\r\nCommonwealth agent.\r\nAlthough \"just cause\" is typically a question of fact for\r\nthe jury, see R.W. Int'l Corp. v. Welch Foods, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196859\"><a href=\"/opinion/196859/rw-international-v-welch-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51\r\n(1st Cir. 1996), Sheils does not dispute the historical facts upon\r\nwhich Commonwealth bases its right to exercise the excessive claims\r\nprovision.  Nor does Sheils make the argument that Paragraph 16(c)1\r\nwas not an \"essential obligation\" of the dealer's contract.  See\r\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278(d).  Rather, Sheils contends that\r\nParagraph 16(c)1 should not apply because its language does not\r\naccurately reflect the way that the title insurance business is\r\nconducted in Puerto Rico.  Specifically, Sheils argues that the\r\n\"produced by\" language of the excessive claims provision renders\r\nthat provision inapplicable to Puerto Rico title insurance agents\r\nbecause in Puerto Rico title insurance agents do not \"produce\"\r\nclaims.  With respect to the $1.8 million of claims submitted by\r\nCitibank to Commonwealth, Sheils makes the novel argument that\r\nthose claims were \"produced by\" Bankers Finance, and, more\r\nspecifically, by the misdeeds of its president, Jos Alegra -- not\r\nby Sheils.\r\nSheils's argument, although imaginative, cannot prevail. \r\nRegardless of the way in which the title insurance business is\r\nconducted in Puerto Rico, see supra, note 11, we conclude that\r\nCommonwealth reasonably intended and understood the term \"produced\"\r\nto include within its scope all claims expenses resulting from\r\npolicies issued by Sheils.  We reach this conclusion after\r\ncarefully considering the nature of the title insurance industry\r\nand the evidence presented at trial.\r\nFirst, the reality of title insurance is that it insures\r\nfailures to discover existing flaws or defects in title.  As such,\r\ntitle insurance differs significantly from other types of\r\ninsurance.  Weigel explained this difference at trial:\r\n         A:  Our business is a little bit different. \r\nMore -- most other kinds of insurance, the\r\nwhole idea is they assume the risk.  In our\r\nbusiness we try to eliminate the risk or to\r\navoid the risk.\r\n\n         Q:  How is that possible?  \r\n\n         A:  It is possible when you take a look at the\r\nhistorical record of a title and search the\r\ntitle properly and make sure that the liens on\r\nthe property are discharged and do all of the\r\nresearch necessary and file all of the proper\r\ndocuments, you eliminate the risk involved in\r\na title insurance policy.\r\n\n         Q: How is that different [from] a life\r\ninsurance company when it examines someone to\r\nissue a life insurance policy?\r\n\n         A:  People make comparisons with a doctor's\r\nexamination.  If you think about examining the\r\ntitle as you do about examining the person,\r\nthe difference is if you examine the title and\r\nyou do the job you are eliminating the\r\npossibility of anything bad happening.  You\r\nare eliminating the possibility of a claim.\r\n\n(Tr. 8/19/97 Afternoon Sess. at 31-32.)  As Weigel explained, title\r\ninsurance is unique in that it looks backwards, not forwards, and\r\ninsures the validity and accuracy of an existing, historical\r\ndocument.  This historical focus is a double-edged sword from the\r\nperspective of a title insurance agent.  On the one hand, it\r\nrenders agents entirely capable of eliminating risk of liability\r\nunder the terms of a title insurance policy.  On the other hand, it\r\nmeans that any claims expenses that result will, in most cases, be\r\ncaused directly or indirectly by the agent.  Commonwealth presented\r\nevidence at trial to this effect:\r\n         Q:  Let me ask you a little bit about the\r\ndifference or the elements that make our kind\r\nof insurance different.  How would you compare\r\nour business in terms of the assumption of\r\nrisk with other insurance business?\r\n\n         A:  We're all insurance companies.  We assume\r\nthe risk in exchange for a premium, for an\r\namount of money that we're paid to assume\r\nthat.  The agent in all cases is the person\r\nthat can -- is there to protect the company\r\nfrom, prevent losses.  The example that I\r\nwould say is that in an auto insurance\r\ncompany, for example, you're going to run a --\r\ncheck the driving record of the driver.  If\r\nyou find out that the driver has been arrested\r\nfive times for drunk driving and crashed\r\nseveral times, you're not going to insure him\r\n. . . And it's the same way with title\r\ninsurance.\r\n\n         Q:  Yes, but in other types of insurance you\r\ncan have the best driver in the world and you\r\ncan -- and he can have an accident and you can\r\nhave the healthiest guy die.  Is that our\r\nbusiness, sir?  \r\n\n         A:  Yes.  We have a risk, but again it's back\r\nto the agent.  The agent is in the position\r\nand in title insurance the primary thing that\r\nthe agent must do is make sure that [the]\r\nprior mortgage has been canceled, it's been\r\npaid before they issue that new policy.\r\n\n(Tr. 8/13/97 Morning Sess. at 28-29.)  The undisputed testimony of\r\nboth Smith and Weigel establishes that, because of the unique\r\nnature of the title insurance industry, title agents directly or\r\nindirectly cause most claims expenses.  In light of this\r\nuncontested evidence, the intended meaning of the \"produced by\"\r\nterm in Paragraph 16(c)1 is clear.  We conclude that Commonwealth\r\nreasonably intended and expected the term \"produced by\" to include\r\nwithin the scope of Paragraph 16(c)1 all claims expenses resulting\r\nfrom policies issued by Sheils.\r\nSheils's second argument fares no better.  Sheils argues\r\nthat, assuming arguendo that the excessive claims provision is\r\napplicable to it as a Puerto Rico title insurance agent,\r\nCommonwealth failed to carry its burden under  278a-1(c) to prove\r\nthat the 25% provision was reasonable given the realities of the\r\nPuerto Rican market.  Section 278a-1(c) states:\r\n         The violation or nonperformance by the dealer\r\nof any provision included in the dealer's\r\ncontract fixing rules of conduct or\r\ndistribution quotas or goals because it does\r\nnot adjust to the realities of the Puerto\r\nRican market at the time of the violation or\r\nnonperformance by the dealer shall not be\r\ndeemed just cause.  The burden of proof to\r\nshow the reasonableness of the rule of conduct\r\nor of the quota or goal fixed shall rest on\r\nthe principal or grantor.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278a-1(c).  In making this argument,\r\nhowever, Sheils ignores the evidence in the record that\r\nCommonwealth's other agents in Puerto Rico were able to maintain\r\ntheir claims expense at under 11% of their annual net remittances. \r\nAt trial, Donald C. Weigel, President of northern operations for\r\nCommonwealth, specifically testified as to the reasonableness of\r\nthe 25% excessive claims provision in the Commonwealth/Sheils\r\nagreement:\r\n             Q.  Tell us, according to the company numbers\r\n    for the same period of time, what was the\r\n    situation in Puerto Rico if you consider\r\n    all of your agents except Sheils Title?\r\n\n             A:  Without Sheils Title you will see that our\r\n    claims experience there is 10.9%, which is\r\n    below the national average, which means\r\n    for the company it [Puerto Rico] is an\r\n    attractive place to do business.  \r\n\n(Tr. 8/19/97 Afternoon Session at 29.)  The testimony of Mr. Weigel\r\nto the effect that Commonwealth's other agents in Puerto Rico were\r\nable to maintain their claims expenses well under 25% is sufficient\r\nevidence of the reasonableness of the excessive claims provision to\r\nsatisfy Commonwealth's burden under  278a-1(c).  Moreover, Sheils\r\nfailed to come forward with any contradictory evidence on this\r\npoint.\r\nAgain, the language of Paragraph 16(c)1 is clear and\r\nunambiguous: Commonwealth is entitled to terminate Sheils as its\r\nagent when, during any calendar year, the claims expense on\r\npolicies issued by Sheils exceeds 25% of annual net premiums.  The\r\nfacts are not in dispute.  The claims submitted to Commonwealth\r\nunder Sheils-issued policies exceeded at least 250% of the net\r\npremiums in calendar years 1993 and 1994.  After careful\r\nconsideration of the record, we conclude that Commonwealth had\r\n\"just cause\", as a matter of law, to terminate Sheils as its agent.\r\nBecause we find that the excessive claims provision\r\nconstituted \"just cause\" for termination of the Commonwealth/Sheils\r\nagency agreement, we need not reach Commonwealth's second ground\r\nfor termination: the conflict of interest provision.\r\nOur conclusion also renders moot Sheils's appeal from the\r\ndistrict court's denial of its motion for a new trial on the issue\r\nof Law 75 damages.  Sheils is no longer entitled to Law 75 damages,\r\nlet alone a new trial.\r\n3.  Commonwealth's Counterclaim for Negligence\r\nIn response to Sheils's complaint alleging arbitrary\r\ntermination in violation of Law 75, Commonwealth asserted a\r\ncounterclaim against Sheils for recovery of the approximately $1.8\r\nmillion it paid in claims as a result of Sheils's alleged\r\nnegligence.  Commonwealth's based its counterclaim on Paragraph\r\n13(a) of the agency agreement, which provides that Sheils shall be\r\nliable to Commonwealth for \"any loss, cost or expense . . .\r\nsustained or incurred by [Commonwealth] and arising from the fraud,\r\nnegligence or misconduct of [Sheils].\"  Commonwealth argued that\r\nSheils was negligent in failing to assure that existing mortgages\r\nwere in fact being discharged prior to insuring the priority of new\r\nmortgages.\r\nTo recover damages based on Sheils's negligence under\r\nParagraph 13(a), Commonwealth was required to prove that: (1)\r\nSheils owed a duty to Commonwealth to conform its conduct to a\r\nreasonable standard of care; (2) Sheils breached that duty; and (3)\r\nSheils's breach caused Commonwealth harm.  See Tokio Marine &amp; Fire\r\nIns. Co., Ltd. v. Grove Mfg. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579443\"><a href=\"/opinion/579443/tokio-marine-fire-insurance-company-ltd-v-the-grove-manufacturing/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1171 (1st Cir.\r\n1992).  At trial, Sheils did not dispute the first element of this\r\ncause of action; it acknowledged that as Commonwealth's title\r\ninsurance agent it owed a duty to Commonwealth to ensure that prior\r\nliens were timely paid and canceled.  Rather, Sheils disputed the\r\nsecond element: namely, that the steps it took and the procedures\r\nit implemented to fulfill this duty fell below a reasonable\r\nstandard of care.\r\nAt the close of evidence, the jury returned a verdict\r\nagainst Commonwealth on its negligence counterclaim.  After\r\njudgment was entered, Commonwealth moved for judgment as a matter\r\nof law, or, in the alternative for a new trial on its counterclaim. \r\nThe district court denied both motions, and Commonwealth now\r\nappeals.\r\nOur review of a denial of judgment as a matter of law is\r\nseverely circumscribed.  See Conway v. Electro Switch Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492354\"><a href=\"/opinion/492354/sandra-conway-v-electro-switch-corp-sandra-conway-v-electro-switch/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 598 (1st Cir. 1987).  We must sustain the district\r\ncourt's denial of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion, \"unless the\r\nevidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the\r\nverdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion,\r\nnamely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\"  Birch v.\r\nPH Group, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600263\"><a href=\"/opinion/600263/the-ph-group-ltd-fka-cognetics-europe-ltd-v-david-l-birch-the-ph/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nOn the other hand, we review denial of a motion for a new\r\ntrial for abuse of discretion.  See id.  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59,\r\na trial judge has ample power to set aside the verdict and grant a\r\nnew trial if he or she is of the opinion that the verdict is\r\nagainst the clear weight of the evidence.  See Coffran v. Hitchcock\r\nClinic, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406206\"><a href=\"/opinion/406206/marion-v-coffran-v-hitchcock-clinic-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 1982).  In denying a motion\r\nfor a new trial, there is no abuse of discretion unless \"the\r\nverdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to\r\namount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  PH Group, 985 F.2d\r\nat 653 (citations and quotations omitted).  With these standards in\r\nmind, we examine the evidence presented at trial to determine\r\nwhether Commonwealth's allegations of error are correct.\r\nAt trial, Sheils presented evidence that to fulfill its\r\nduty of care to Commonwealth it employed in-house attorneys and\r\nother personnel to perform spot checks of the payment and\r\ncancellation of prior liens.  Michael Sheils explained the\r\nprocedure utilized by the company:\r\n         say we would close 100 cases in one month. \r\nMaybe we would check 20 of them and not check\r\nthem all.  It was impossible to check them\r\nall.  We would send several investigators to\r\nthe registry . . . . to make sure that the\r\ncancellation of Bank No. 2 canceling Bank No.\r\n1's mortgage, we wanted to make sure that was\r\ncanceled.\r\n\n(Tr. 7/17/97 Morning Session at 75-76.)  One of the attorneys\r\nemployed to perform these spot checks, Robert Segarra, further\r\ntestified that spot checking was the typical business practice of\r\ntitle insurance agents in Puerto Rico, and that his current\r\nemployer, San Juan Abstract Company, utilized the same procedure.\r\nWith respect to the policies issued to Bankers Finance,\r\nSheils also presented evidence of its efforts to obtain additional\r\nverification -- beyond the spot checks -- of the cancellation of\r\nprior mortgages.  Specifically, Segarra testified that, pursuant to\r\ninstructions from Michael Sheils, he wrote a letter dated June 30,\r\n1993 to Jos Gmez Alegra, the attorney for Bankers Finance,\r\nrequesting confirmation that Bankers Finance was performing timely\r\ncancellations.  The Bankers Finance attorney responded, in writing,\r\nthat cancellations were being performed diligently.  In the letter,\r\nGmez Alegra explained the procedure utilized by Bankers Finance\r\nto ensure timely cancellations: namely, that a messenger of Bankers\r\nFinance would hand-deliver a check in the amount of the outstanding\r\nlien to the prior lienholder.  Gmez Alegra even extended a\r\npersonal invitation to Segarra to visit the Bankers Finance offices\r\nto observe its procedures and to obtain further verification of the\r\ntimely payment of prior liens.\r\nMost significantly, several employees of Bankers Finance\r\ntestified that the nonpayment of prior mortgages was top secret at\r\nBankers Finance, and that only a small group of employees knew that\r\nLourdes Ramos was concealing the cut checks in a Federal Express\r\nbox in the top drawer of her desk pursuant to Jos Alegra's\r\norders.  There is no evidence in the record that Sheils was aware\r\nthat these checks were not being forwarded to prior lienholders.\r\nAfter hearing all of the evidence, the jury concluded\r\nthat Sheils's spot-check procedures and its additional follow-up\r\nwith Gmez Alegra satisfied its duty of care to Commonwealth to\r\nensure that prior mortgages were timely discharged.  We cannot\r\nagree that this conclusion was unreasonable.  We do not consider\r\nthe jury's verdict \"so clearly against the weight of the evidence\r\nas to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  PH Group, 985\r\nF.2d at 653 (citations and quotations omitted).  We, therefore,\r\naffirm the district court's denial of Commonwealth's motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law and for a new trial with respect to its\r\nnegligence counterclaim.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the district\r\ncourt's denial of judgment as a matter of law with respect to the\r\nexistence of \"just cause\" for Commonwealth's termination of the\r\nagency agreement.  However, we affirm the district court's denial\r\nof judgment as a matter of law with respect to Commonwealth's\r\ncounterclaim for negligence.\r\n</pre>",
