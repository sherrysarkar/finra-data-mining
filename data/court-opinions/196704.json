This is a sentencing\r                      BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\r                                                  \r\n\ncase.   Defendant-appellant Angel  Sanchez was indicted under\r\n\n21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1)  on  five  counts of  possessing  and\r\n\ndistributing cocaine base -\"crack  cocaine.\"  He entered into\r\n\na plea agreement  with the government which  provided that he\r\n\nwould plead guilty to counts one through four; count five was\r\n\ndismissed.   Prior to  signing the plea  agreement, defendant\r\n\nreserved   his   right  to   challenge   at   sentencing  the\r\n\ncocaine/cocaine  base sentencing  disparity.   Defendant  was\r\n\nsentenced to 108 months' incarceration with a  recommendation\r\n\nthat  he be  placed in  a 1,000  hour drug  treatment program\r\n\nwhile in prison.  Part of the sentence was supervised release\r\n\nfor  five years  after  release from  prison.   He  was  also\r\n\nassessed $200.00.\r\n\nDefendant raises three issues on appeal:\r\n\n(1)  The  district  court  erred  in\r\n     refusing    to   consider    at\r\n     sentencing   expert   testimony\r\n     proffered   by   defendant   in\r\n     support of his \"rule of lenity\"\r\n     challenge   to   the   enhanced\r\n     statutory   penalties   in   21\r\n     U.S.C.    841(B)(1)(b)(III) for\r\n     \"cocaine base\".\r\n\n(2)  The  district  court  erred  in\r\n     failing to  consider a downward\r\n     departure under U.S.S.G. 5K2.0.\r\n\n(3)  The defendant was entitled to a\r\n     two  level   reduction  of  the\r\n     applicable  offense  level,  in\r\n     order    to    implement    the\r\n     statutory  intent  of  the  so-\r\n     called      \"safety      valve\"\r\n\n                   -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n     provisions of the Violent Crime\r\n     Control and Law Enforcement Act\r\n     of    1994,    18   U.S.C.     \r\n     3553(f)(1)-(5).\r\n\n   The Rule of Lenity Challenge to the \r                         The Rule of Lenity Challenge to the \r                                                             \r\n          Enhanced Penalties in \r                                Enhanced Penalties in \r                                                      \r\n21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(b)(III) For Cocaine Base.\r                   21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(b)(III) For Cocaine Base.\r                                                                  \r\n\nThis issue,  the centerpiece of  defendant's brief,\r\n\nis  foreclosed by our decision in United States v. Camilo, 71\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  984 (1st Cir.  1995), which was  decided after briefing\r\n\nand  oral argument in this  case.  An  identical challenge to\r\n\nthe  enhanced  penalties  for  crack cocaine  was  raised  in\r\n\nCamilo.  Id. at 989-90.  We rejected it for two reasons:\r                        \r\n\nFirst, the rule  of lenity argument fails\r\nfor essentially the same reason that this\r\ncircuit previously  rejected the argument\r\nthat scientific equivalence requires that\r\ncrack   offenders   be  given   the  same\r\nsentences as those who traffic in cocaine\r\npowder.  United States v. Singleterry, 29\r                                                           \r\nF.3d 733, 740 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n. . . .\r\n\n   Second, in light of recent legislative\r\ndevelopments   we   conclude   that   the\r\nSentencing Commission cannot  be said  to\r\nhave  failed in  its  statutory  duty  to\r\ninvestigate the distinction between crack\r\nand cocaine  powder.  In response  to the\r\nSentencing  Commission's  April 13,  1995\r\nvote, the House of Representatives joined\r\nthe  Senate on October 18, 1995 in voting\r\nto retain the current  mandatory sentence\r\nfor   possession    of   crack   cocaine,\r\nmaintaining disparate sentences for crack\r\nand  powder  cocaine  possession.     See\r                                                               \r\nPub.L. No.  104-38,   1,  109 Stat.  334,\r\n334 (1995).  And on October 30, 1995, the\r\nPresident  signed  this  bill  into  law.\r\nThese  actions   preempt  the  Sentencing\r\n\n                   -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nCommission's April 13,  1995 decision  to\r\neliminate  the distinction  between crack\r\nand cocaine powder from taking  effect on\r\nNovember  1,  1995.    See  28  U.S.C.   \r                                                \r\n994(p).\r\n\nId. at 990.\r               \r\n\n  Failure of the District Court to Grant\r                        Failure of the District Court to Grant\r                                                              \r\na Downward Departure Under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.\r                     a Downward Departure Under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.\r                                                                 \r\n\nThe law  in this Circuit on  downward departures is\r\n\nclear.  We  lack jurisdiction  to review an  appeal which  is\r\n\nbased on the discretionary  judgment of the sentencing judge.\r\n\nWe do,  however, have jurisdiction  to consider a  refusal to\r\n\ndepart  downward where  the sentencing  judge's decision  was\r\n\nbased  on the mistaken belief  that he was  prohibited by law\r\n\nfrom doing so.  See United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994), and cases cited therein.\r\n\nThis case,  however, does not hinge  on whether the\r\n\nsentencing judge made a  discretionary decision not to depart\r\n\ndownward or one based  on his perception that he  was legally\r\n\nconstrained from doing so.\r\n\nSection   5K2.0  of  the   Guidelines  provides  in\r\n\npertinent part:\r\n\nGrounds for Departure (Policy Statement)\r                                           \r\nUnder 18 U.S.C.    3553(b) the sentencing\r\ncourt  may impose a  sentence outside the\r\nrange   established  by   the  applicable\r\nguideline, if the court finds \"that there\r\nexists   an  aggravating   or  mitigating\r\ncircumstance of  a kind, or to  a degree,\r\nnot  adequately taken  into consideration\r\nby    the   Sentencing    Commission   in\r\nformulating  the  guidelines that  should\r\nresult  in  the  sentence different  from\r\n\n                   -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthat described.\" . .  .  The  controlling\r\ndecision as to whether and to what extent\r\ndeparture  is warranted can  only be made\r\nby the courts.\r\n\nDefendant's  argument at  sentencing and  before us\r\n\nwas  that a  downward departure  was warranted under    5K2.0\r\n\nbecause   of  a  circumstance   not  adequately   taken  into\r\n\nconsideration by  the  Sentencing Commission  in  formulating\r\n\nGuideline   2D1.1(c),  (the   Drug  Quantity  Table).     The\r\n\ncircumstance relied  on was \"the findings and recommendations\r\n\nof  the Commission's  congressionally mandated  study of  the\r\n\ndisparity between  powder and 'crack' cocaine.\"   Defendant's\r\n\nBrief at 14.\r\n\nIn  rejecting  defendant's  motion  for  a downward\r\n\ndeparture the district judge stated:\r\n\n   THE  COURT:  The Court appreciates the\r\nfact that the  Sentencing Commission,  at\r\nthe  request of Congress,  has been asked\r\nto review the  100-to-1 ratio.   However,\r\nall we have at this  point in time is the\r\nSentencing  Commission's recommendations.\r\nAnd in the opinion of the Court the Court\r\nmust  live within the current law and the\r\ncurrent Guidelines as  written now;  that\r\nit would be  inappropriate for the  Court\r\nessentially  to  adopt   as  new   policy\r\nmatters     which     only     constitute\r\nrecommendations and have  not been  acted\r\nupon by  the United States Congress.   We\r\ndo not  know what  Congress  may do  with\r\nthose recommendations;  whether they will\r\nbe rejected in toto, whether they will be\r\nadopted  in toto, or  whether they may be\r\nadopted  with changes.   So  it would  be\r\npure speculation for  the Court really to\r\noperate  on  the  assumption  that  these\r\nchanges  are going  to become  policy and\r\nlaw.\r\n\n                   -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nDefendant argues that this statement shows that the\r\n\nsentencing judge believed that  he lacked the legal authority\r\n\nto depart from the  guideline range and thus his  decision is\r\n\nappealable as a mistake of law.  The government contends that\r\n\nthe  judge   exercised  his   discretion  in  not   departing\r\n\ndownwards,   focusing   on   the   phrase,   \"it   would   be\r\n\ninappropriate.\"\r\n\nWe need  not settle this argument  because it makes\r\n\nno  difference.  We rule  that the circumstance  relied on by\r\n\ndefendant,  for  a  downward  departure,  the  findings   and\r\n\nrecommendations  of  the  Sentencing  Commission  relative to\r\n\nchanging  the sentence  disparity between  cocaine  and crack\r\n\ncocaine, is  not a  ground for  departure under    5K2.0.   A\r\n\nSentencing Commission's recommendation to the Congress is not\r\n\nthe  kind  of  \"circumstance\"  that   the  provision  covers.\r\n\nMoreover,  we  cannot blind  our eyes  to  the fact  that the\r\n\nCongress shot down the Commission's recommendation.  In other\r\n\nwords,  we affirm the ruling of the district judge whether it\r\n\nwas discretionary or not.\r\n\nWhether Defendant was Entitled to a Two-Level\r                    Whether Defendant was Entitled to a Two-Level\r                                                                 \r\nReduction Because of the \"Safety Valve\" Provisions\r                  Reduction Because of the \"Safety Valve\" Provisions\r                                                                    \r\nof the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994.\r                      of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994.\r                                                               \r\n\nWe   start  with   the  so-called   \"safety  valve\"\r\n\nprovisions of  the Violent Crime Control  and Law Enforcement\r\n\nAct of 1994.  18 U.S.C.   3553(f) provides:\r\n\n   (f)    Limitation on  applicability of\r                         (f)    Limitation on  applicability of\r\nstatutory  minimums  in certain  cases.--\r                      statutory  minimums  in certain  cases.\r\n\n                   -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nNotwithstanding  any  other provision  of\r\nlaw,  in  the  case of  an  offense under\r\nsection  401,   404,   or  406   of   the\r\nControlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841,\r\n844, 846) or section  1010 or 1013 of the\r\nControlled  Substances Import  and Export\r\nAct (21 U.S.C. 961, 963), the court shall\r\nimpose a sentence pursuant  to guidelines\r\npromulgated   by    the   United   States\r\nSentencing  Commission under  section 994\r\nof  title   28  without  regard   to  any\r\nstatutory minimum sentence, if  the court\r\nfinds at sentencing, after the Government\r\nhas been afforded the opportunity to make\r\na recommendation, that--\r\n\n       (1)  the  defendant does  not\r\n     have   more  than   1  criminal\r\n     history  point,  as  determined\r\n     under       the      sentencing\r\n     guidelines;\r\n\n        (2)  the  defendant did  not\r\n     use   violence    or   credible\r\n     threats of  violence or possess\r\n     a  firearm  or other  dangerous\r\n     weapon   (or   induce   another\r\n     participant   to   do  so)   in\r\n     connection with the offense;\r\n\n       (3)    the  offense  did  not\r\n     result  in   death  or  serious\r\n     bodily injury to any person;\r\n\n        (4) the defendant was not an\r\n     organizer, leader,  manager, or\r\n     supervisor  of  others  in  the\r\n     offense,  as  determined  under\r\n     the  sentencing guidelines  and\r\n     was not engaged in a continuing\r\n     criminal enterprise, as defined\r\n     in 21 U.S.C. 848; and\r\n\n        (5)  not later than the time\r\n     of the  sentencing hearing, the\r\n     defendant     has    truthfully\r\n     provided to  the Government all\r\n     information  and  evidence  the\r\n     defendant  has  concerning  the\r\n     offense  or offenses  that were\r\n\n                   -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n     part  of  the  same  course  of\r\n     conduct or of  a common  scheme\r\n     or plan, but the fact  that the\r\n     defendant  has  no relevant  or\r\n     useful  other   information  to\r\n     provide or  that the Government\r\n     is   already   aware   of   the\r\n     information shall  not preclude\r\n     a  determination  by the  court\r\n     that the defendant has complied\r\n     with this requirement.\r\n\nIn  arriving  at  the  incarceration  time  of  108\r\n\nmonths, the judge found that  defendant met all the  criteria\r\n\nof the safety valve  provisions.  Defendant was sentenced  on\r\n\nJuly  11,  1995.    The  Sentencing  Commission  proposed  an\r\n\namendment to   2D1.1(b)  (specific offenses  characteristics)\r\n\non May 10, 1995, to become effective November 1, 1995, unless\r\n\nmodified  or  rejected  by  the Congress,  neither  of  which\r\n\noccurred.  The proposed amendment, therefore, became law.  It\r\n\nis part (4) of   2D1.1(b).  It provides:\r\n\n(4)  If  the   defendant  meets  the\r\n     criteria    set     forth    in\r\n     subdivisions (1)-(5)  of  5C1.2\r\n     (Limitations  on  Applicability\r\n     of Statutory  Minimum Sentences\r\n     in   Certain  Cases)   and  the\r\n     offense level determined  above\r\n     is   level   26   or   greater,\r                                        26\r\n     decrease by 2 levels.1\r                                       2\r\n\nAt sentencing  the judge  refused to apply  the then-proposed\r\n\nguideline because it had not yet been enacted.\r\n\n          \r                                \r\n\n1.  Subdivisions (1)-(5) of   5C1.2 state verbatim the safety\r\nvalve provisions of 18 U.S.C.   3553(f).\r\n\n                   -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nThe  question before  us  is not  what the  parties\r\n\nagrued and  briefed:   whether the proposed  amendment should\r\n\nhave  been applied.   The  issue now  is whether  the enacted\r\n\nguideline should be applied retroactively.  Unfortunately for\r\n\ndefendant, the answer is \"no.\"\r\n\nThere  is a  solid  line of  cases in  this Circuit\r\n\nholding that Guideline  amendments are applied  retroactively\r\n\nif they clarify a  Guideline but are not  so applied if  they\r\n\nsubstantively  change  a Guideline.    See  United States  v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nLaCroix,  28 F.3d 223, 227 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994); United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Prezioso,  989 F.2d  52, 53  (1st  Cir. 1993);  Isabel v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States, 980 F.2d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 1992); United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Havener, 905 F.2d 3, 4-8 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                      \r\n\nThe  Guideline  amendment  appears,   without  much\r\n\ndoubt,  to be substantive.  It added an additional and wholly\r\n\nnew part to  Guideline   2D1.1(b).   It does not  clarify the\r\n\nprovisions of   5C1.2;  it mandates a decrease of  two levels\r\n\nif these provisions are  met and the  offense level is 26  or\r\n\ngreater.\r\n\nIn addition to  our own analysis, we note  that the\r\n\nSentencing Commission  did not consider this  amendment to be\r\n\nretroactive.  Section 1B1.0 is a policy statement relative to\r\n\nthe retroactivity  of  amendments.   Section 1B1.10(c)  lists\r\n\nthose substantive Amendments intended to be retroactive.  The\r\n\n                   -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ntwo-level reduction  was added to the  Guideline by Amendment\r\n\n515.  This Amendment is not listed in Section 1B1.1(c).\r\n\nMoreover, the Amendment does not state that it is a\r\n\nclarifying Amendment.  Amendment 515 states:  \"this amendment\r\n\nadds  a  new  subsection  to   2D1.1  to  implement  [Section\r\n\n80001(b) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act\r\n\nof  1994 which  directs the  Commission to  implement Section\r\n\n80001(a) (the safety valve statute)] by providing a two-level\r\n\ndecrease in  offense level for cases meeting the criteria set\r\n\nforth  in    5C1.2(1)-(5).     The  effective  date  of  this\r\n\namendment is November 1, 1995.\"\r\n\nWe can think of no reason for holding the Amendment\r\n\nto be retroactive.\r\n\nThe judgment  of the district court  is affirmed in\r                      The judgment  of the district court  is affirmed in\r                                                                         \r\n\nall respects.\r            all respects\r                        \r\n\n                   -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n",

Prior to  signing the plea  agreement, defendant\r\n\nreserved   his   right  to   challenge   at   sentencing  the\r\n\ncocaine/cocaine  base sentencing  disparity.

In response  to the\r\nSentencing  Commission's  April 13,  1995\r\nvote, the House of Representatives joined\r\nthe  Senate on October 18, 1995 in voting\r\nto retain the current  mandatory sentence\r\nfor   possession    of   crack   cocaine,\r\nmaintaining disparate sentences for crack\r\nand  powder  cocaine  possession.

The  controlling\r\ndecision as to whether and to what extent\r\ndeparture  is warranted can  only be made\r\nby the courts.\r\n\nDefendant's  argument at  sentencing and  before us\r\n\nwas  that a  downward departure  was warranted under    5K2.0\r\n\nbecause   of  a  circumstance   not  adequately   taken  into\r\n\nconsideration by  the  Sentencing Commission  in  formulating\r\n\nGuideline   2D1.1(c),  (the   Drug  Quantity  Table).     The\r\n\ncircumstance relied  on was \"the findings and recommendations\r\n\nof  the Commission's  congressionally mandated  study of  the\r\n\ndisparity between  powder and 'crack' cocaine.\"   Defendant's\r\n\nBrief at 14.\r\n\nIn  rejecting  defendant's  motion  for  a downward\r\n\ndeparture the district judge stated:\r\n\n   THE  COURT:  The Court appreciates the\r\nfact that the  Sentencing Commission,  at\r\nthe  request of Congress,  has been asked\r\nto review the  100-to-1 ratio.   However,\r\nall we have at this  point in time is the\r\nSentencing  Commission's recommendations.\r\nAnd in the opinion of the Court the Court\r\nmust  live within the current law and the\r\ncurrent Guidelines as  written now;  that\r\nit would be  inappropriate for the  Court\r\nessentially  to  adopt   as  new   policy\r\nmatters     which     only     constitute\r\nrecommendations and have  not been  acted\r\nupon by  the United States Congress.   We\r\ndo not  know what  Congress  may do  with\r\nthose recommendations;  whether they will\r\nbe rejected in toto, whether they will be\r\nadopted  in toto, or  whether they may be\r\nadopted  with changes.   So  it would  be\r\npure speculation for  the Court really to\r\noperate  on  the  assumption  that  these\r\nchanges  are going  to become  policy and\r\nlaw.\r\n\n                   -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nDefendant argues that this statement shows that the\r\n\nsentencing judge believed that  he lacked the legal authority\r\n\nto depart from the  guideline range and thus his  decision is\r\n\nappealable as a mistake of law.  The government contends that\r\n\nthe  judge   exercised  his   discretion  in  not   departing\r\n\ndownwards,   focusing   on   the   phrase,   \"it   would   be\r\n\ninappropriate.\"\r\n\nWe need  not settle this argument  because it makes\r\n\nno  difference.  We rule  that the circumstance  relied on by\r\n\ndefendant,  for  a  downward  departure,  the  findings   and\r\n\nrecommendations  of  the  Sentencing  Commission  relative to\r\n\nchanging  the sentence  disparity between  cocaine  and crack\r\n\ncocaine, is  not a  ground for  departure under    5K2.0.   A\r\n\nSentencing Commission's recommendation to the Congress is not\r\n\nthe  kind  of  \"circumstance\"  that   the  provision  covers.\r\n\nMoreover,  we  cannot blind  our eyes  to  the fact  that the\r\n\nCongress shot down the Commission's recommendation.  In other\r\n\nwords,  we affirm the ruling of the district judge whether it\r\n\nwas discretionary or not.\r\n\nWhether Defendant was Entitled to a Two-Level\r                    Whether Defendant was Entitled to a Two-Level\r                                                                 \r\nReduction Because of the \"Safety Valve\" Provisions\r                  Reduction Because of the \"Safety Valve\" Provisions\r                                                                    \r\nof the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994.\r                      of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994.\r                                                               \r\n\nWe   start  with   the  so-called   \"safety  valve\"\r\n\nprovisions of  the Violent Crime Control  and Law Enforcement\r\n\nAct of 1994.  18 U.S.C.   3553(f) provides:\r\n\n   (f)    Limitation on  applicability of\r                         (f)    Limitation on  applicability of\r\nstatutory  minimums  in certain  cases.--\r                      statutory  minimums  in certain  cases.\r\n\n                   -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nNotwithstanding  any  other provision  of\r\nlaw,  in  the  case of  an  offense under\r\nsection  401,   404,   or  406   of   the\r\nControlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841,\r\n844, 846) or section  1010 or 1013 of the\r\nControlled  Substances Import  and Export\r\nAct (21 U.S.C. 961, 963), the court shall\r\nimpose a sentence pursuant  to guidelines\r\npromulgated   by    the   United   States\r\nSentencing  Commission under  section 994\r\nof  title   28  without  regard   to  any\r\nstatutory minimum sentence, if  the court\r\nfinds at sentencing, after the Government\r\nhas been afforded the opportunity to make\r\na recommendation, that--\r\n\n       (1)  the  defendant does  not\r\n     have   more  than   1  criminal\r\n     history  point,  as  determined\r\n     under       the      sentencing\r\n     guidelines;\r\n\n        (2)  the  defendant did  not\r\n     use   violence    or   credible\r\n     threats of  violence or possess\r\n     a  firearm  or other  dangerous\r\n     weapon   (or   induce   another\r\n     participant   to   do  so)   in\r\n     connection with the offense;\r\n\n       (3)    the  offense  did  not\r\n     result  in   death  or  serious\r\n     bodily injury to any person;\r\n\n        (4) the defendant was not an\r\n     organizer, leader,  manager, or\r\n     supervisor  of  others  in  the\r\n     offense,  as  determined  under\r\n     the  sentencing guidelines  and\r\n     was not engaged in a continuing\r\n     criminal enterprise, as defined\r\n     in 21 U.S.C. 848; and\r\n\n        (5)  not later than the time\r\n     of the  sentencing hearing, the\r\n     defendant     has    truthfully\r\n     provided to  the Government all\r\n     information  and  evidence  the\r\n     defendant  has  concerning  the\r\n     offense  or offenses  that were\r\n\n                   -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n     part  of  the  same  course  of\r\n     conduct or of  a common  scheme\r\n     or plan, but the fact  that the\r\n     defendant  has  no relevant  or\r\n     useful  other   information  to\r\n     provide or  that the Government\r\n     is   already   aware   of   the\r\n     information shall  not preclude\r\n     a  determination  by the  court\r\n     that the defendant has complied\r\n     with this requirement.\r\n\nIn  arriving  at  the  incarceration  time  of  108\r\n\nmonths, the judge found that  defendant met all the  criteria\r\n\nof the safety valve  provisions.  Defendant was sentenced  on\r\n\nJuly  11,  1995.    The  Sentencing  Commission  proposed  an\r\n\namendment to   2D1.1(b)  (specific offenses  characteristics)\r\n\non May 10, 1995, to become effective November 1, 1995, unless\r\n\nmodified  or  rejected  by  the Congress,  neither  of  which\r\n\noccurred.  The proposed amendment, therefore, became law.  It\r\n\nis part (4) of   2D1.1(b).  It provides:\r\n\n(4)  If  the   defendant  meets  the\r\n     criteria    set     forth    in\r\n     subdivisions (1)-(5)  of  5C1.2\r\n     (Limitations  on  Applicability\r\n     of Statutory  Minimum Sentences\r\n     in   Certain  Cases)   and  the\r\n     offense level determined  above\r\n     is   level   26   or   greater,\r                                        26\r\n     decrease by 2 levels.1\r                                       2\r\n\nAt sentencing  the judge  refused to apply  the then-proposed\r\n\nguideline because it had not yet been enacted.\r\n\n          \r                                \r\n\n1.

It added an additional and wholly\r\n\nnew part to  Guideline   2D1.1(b).   It does not  clarify the\r\n\nprovisions of   5C1.2;  it mandates a decrease of  two levels\r\n\nif these provisions are  met and the  offense level is 26  or\r\n\ngreater.\r\n\nIn addition to  our own analysis, we note  that the\r\n\nSentencing Commission  did not consider this  amendment to be\r\n\nretroactive.  Section 1B1.0 is a policy statement relative to\r\n\nthe retroactivity  of  amendments.   Section 1B1.10(c)  lists\r\n\nthose substantive Amendments intended to be retroactive.

This Amendment is not listed in Section 1B1.1(c).\r\n\nMoreover, the Amendment does not state that it is a\r\n\nclarifying Amendment.  Amendment 515 states:  \"this amendment\r\n\nadds  a  new  subsection  to   2D1.1  to  implement  [Section\r\n\n80001(b) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act\r\n\nof  1994 which  directs the  Commission to  implement Section\r\n\n80001(a) (the safety valve statute)] by providing a two-level\r\n\ndecrease in  offense level for cases meeting the criteria set\r\n\nforth  in    5C1.2(1)-(5).
