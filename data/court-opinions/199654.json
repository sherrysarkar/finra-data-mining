BRACKETT,\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n         [Hon. George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n              and Doumar,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Walter Hanstein, III, with whom Joyce, David & Hanstein,\nP.A. was on brief, for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula\nD. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 24, 2001\n\f______________\n*Of the Eastern District of Virginia, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.    This appeal was argued on September 14,\n\n2001, in conjunction with several other appeals raising the same\n\nprincipal question:       does an undifferentiated conviction under\n\nMaine's general-purpose assault statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 17-A, § 207, constitute a conviction for a misdemeanor\n\ncrime of domestic violence within the purview of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(g)(9)?    We answered that question affirmatively in United\n\nStates v. Nason, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 01-1440].\n\nNason is fully dispositive here.        Accordingly, the defendant's\n\nconviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
