Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Scott F. Johnson and Stein, Volinsky &amp; Callaghan, P.A. on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Edwin J. Gale,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 24, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we conclude that this appeal clearly presents no\r\nsubstantial issue and that oral argument would not be of\r\nassistance to us.  We note that many of defendant's appellate\r\ncontentions are raised for the first time in this court.\r\n           1.  Entrapment.  The confidential informant's\r\ntestimony provided sufficient evidence that defendant was not\r\nentrapped.  The jury apparently found the confidential\r\ninformant credible notwithstanding his legal and financial\r\nmotivations.  This court cannot second-guess that credibility\r\nassessment, and the jury was not required to accept defendant's\r\ninterpretation of the events.  The jury instruction regarding\r\nentrapment was not plainly erroneous:  the government's burden\r\nof proof and the element of predisposition were adequately\r\ndescribed.\r\n          2.   Outrageous conduct.  The reverse sting was not\r\nper se outrageous, even if it involved a paid informant and\r\nsome level of \"furtiveness, duplicity, and manipulation.\"  See\r\nUnited States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 470-71 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nOn the evidence presented, and had the issue been raised, it\r\nwould have been reasonable to conclude that the investigatory\r\nmethods employed by the government were not improper, let alone\r\noutrageous.\r\n          3.  Jury conduct.  The district court's response to\r\nthe jury's note about a \"moral issue\" was well within its\r\ndiscretion.  The import of the note was clear enough, and the\r\ndistrict court had no cause to investigate the matter or deal\r\nwith it in any other way.  The note did not signal a deadlock,\r\nand there were no evident grounds for a mistrial.\r\n          We cannot say that the circumstances in which the\r\njury reached unanimity warrant reversal in this case, nor can\r\nwe say that the district court was required sua sponte to\r\ninquire further into the matter.\r\n          4.   Indictment.  Even were defendant's belated\r\nchallenge to the indictment not deemed waived, see Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 12(b)(2) &amp; (f), in any event, the starting date of the\r\nconspiracy was not an essential element of the instant offense. \r\nSee United States v. Nunez, 668 F.2d 10, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1981).\r\n          5.   Jury instructions.  Defendant's new objections\r\nto the instructions on flight, possession, and reasonable doubt\r\ndo not pass the plain error test.  The flight instruction\r\nproperly allowed the jury to decide whether or not an inference\r\nof guilt was reasonable under the circumstances, and no more\r\nwas required.  See United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1417\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  Actual possession was not an issue in this\r\ncase, and the district court adequately defined constructive\r\npossession.  The reasonable doubt instruction did not require\r\nany more specific definition, and the district court's comment\r\nabout the possible sources of reasonable doubt did not dilute\r\nthe government's burden of proof.  Taking the instructions as\r\na whole, we perceive no likelihood that the jury misunderstood\r\nits obligations, notwithstanding that the word \"should\" may\r\nhave appeared in the burden of proof instructions.\r\n          6.  Drug quantity.  Defendant's sentencing factor\r\nmanipulation claim fails because there was no showing of\r\n\"extraordinary misconduct.\"  See United State v. Montoya, 62\r\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).  Even assuming that defendant's\r\nargument about U.S.S.G.  2D1.1 note 12 were properly presented\r\nto the district court and preserved for review, we cannot say\r\nthat the district court clearly erred in attributing 5\r\nkilograms of cocaine to defendant, there being adequate\r\nevidence of defendant's intention and capability to proceed\r\nwith the deal he negotiated.\r\n          7.   Prior conviction.  On the present record, and\r\nin the context of defendant's challenge to the information\r\nfiled under 21 U.S.C.  851, the district court correctly\r\nfollowed federal precedent and counted defendant's prior\r\nconviction.  The plea was not infirm, even assuming that\r\ndefendant was not informed about deportation consequences,\r\nbecause  deportation is  a collateral, as opposed to direct,\r\nconsequence of an alien-defendant's conviction and therefore\r\nlegally irrelevant to the plea.  See United States v. Quin, 836\r\nF.2d 654, 655 (1st Cir. 1988), (citing, e.g., United States v.\r\nYearwood, 863 F.2d 6, 7-8 (4th Cir. 1988)).  \r\n          However, in light of the pending proceedings in the\r\nstate courts, we recognize that there exists the possibility\r\nthat the prior conviction could be vacated, in which event\r\ndefendant may at that time bring that fact to the district\r\ncourt's attention, and seek appropriate sentencing relief in a\r\nproceeding under 28 U.S.C.  2255.  We intend no prediction of\r\nthe outcome of any such future proceeding.\r\n          8.   Motions.  Counsel's motion to withdraw is\r\ndenied.  Defendant's pro se motion to dispense with oral\r\nargument is moot.  Defendant is reminded that he is still\r\nrepresented by counsel, and, although he was granted leave to\r\nfile a pro se supplemental brief, he has not been granted leave\r\nto file any other pro se filings in this court. \r\n          Defendant's pro se motion for summary reversal is\r\ndenied as frivolous, to the extent that it is based on the\r\ngovernment's non-specific response to a portion of defendant's\r\npro se brief.  To the extent that the motion is based on\r\ndefendant's sister's affidavit raising a new allegation of jury\r\nmisconduct, the motion is denied without prejudice.  We will\r\nnot consider the allegation raised for the first time on\r\nappeal, which must be submitted to the district court in the\r\nfirst instance.  We intend no comment on its merits, if any.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
