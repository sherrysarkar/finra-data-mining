After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ multiple submissions, we adopt the\n\ngovernment’s recommendations.                We vacate the conviction on\n\nCount 6, vacate the sentence on Counts 3 through 5, and\n\nremand the matter for re-sentencing.                 In all other respects,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                Count 6 of the indictment charged conspiracy to\n\ndistribute        marijuana    in    violation      of    21    U.S.C.    §    846.\n\nBecause     the    same   conduct         supported      the    conviction      for\n\nengaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, see 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 848, we must vacate the conviction under Count 6 as\n\nviolative of the double jeopardy clause.                       See Rutledge v.\n\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 292, 296-307 (1996); United States\n\nv. Escobar-DeJesus, 187 F.3d 148, 162 n. 8, 173 n. 24 (1st\n\nCir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1208 (2000).\n\n                The sentences imposed under Counts 3, 4 and 5\n\nexceeded the maximum sentence allowed by statute.                         See 21\n\nU.S.C.      §    841(b)(1)(D)       (maximum        sentence      for    offense\n\ninvolving        less   than   50   kilograms       of    marijuana      is    five\n\nyears).     Because appellant Patrick Vigneau’s (“Vigneau’s”)\n\nsentence on these counts was well in excess of that maximum,\n\nwe   find       plain   error,      and    vacate     and      remand    for    re-\n\nsentencing.\n\f          In all other respects, Vigneau’s arguments lack\n\nmerit.   He waived all objections to the revised Pre-Sentence\n\nReport to the extent the same information was included in\n\nthe original Pre-Sentence Report prepared for his first\n\nsentencing.     See United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24,\n\n32 (1st Cir. 1999).         Thus, any alleged failure by the court\n\nor probation to comply with Rule 32 or any related failures\n\ncannot constitute plain error.            Further, we find no plain\n\nerror in the lower court’s failure to vacate the continuing\n\ncriminal enterprise conviction; the evidence was sufficient\n\nto establish that Vigneau acted in a supervisory position\n\nwith respect to at least five participants.              This is so even\n\nif the court does not count those individuals not convicted.\n\nVigneau’s argument that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 is\n\ninapposite, given that he was not sentenced under that\n\nprovision.    Finally, we find his argument under             Apprendi v.\n\nNew   Jersey,    120   S.    Ct.   2348   (2000),   to   be   meritless.\n\nContrary to Vigneau’s assertion, Apprendi did not hold that\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841 is unconstitutional             per se, and we see\n\nnothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion or in subsequent case\n\nlaw from which we could so infer, or which would justify us\n\nin vacating any of the convictions here.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          The conviction on Count 6 of the indictment is\n\nvacated; the sentence on Counts 3, 4 and 5 is vacated\n\nwithout   prejudice,   and   the   matter   is   remanded   for   re-\n\nsentencing; in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
