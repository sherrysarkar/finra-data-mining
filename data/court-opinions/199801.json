Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Allan D. Cantrell on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Dina\nMichael Chaitowitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for\nSummary Disposition for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 29, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. Allan D. Cantrell, a federal prisoner\n\nserving a 70-month sentence for conspiring to manufacture and\n\ndistribute        methamphetamine,       21     U.S.C.     §     846,       and\n\nmanufacturing methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. § 841, appeals the\n\ndistrict court’s sua sponte dismissal of his petition for a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2241.             His habeas petition\n\nsought to challenge the validity of his federal conviction\n\non   two    grounds:     (1)    that    the     district      court    lacked\n\njurisdiction      over   the   offense    because     Congress        had   not\n\nenacted 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846 into law, and the offenses\n\nhad not occurred on U.S. property, but within the state of\n\nMissouri; and (2) his conviction and sentence violated the\n\nrule announced in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), because the indictment did not reference a drug\n\nquantity.\n\n            The    government    has    filed    a   motion    for    summary\n\ndisposition of the appeal.             We conclude that the district\n\ncourt properly determined that Cantrell could not raise his\n\nclaims challenging the validity of his federal conviction\n\nthrough a habeas petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2241 as he does not meet the requirements of the savings\n\nclause contained in 28 U.S.C. § 2255.            Moreover, Cantrell has\n\nnot demonstrated that he is actually innocent as his claims\n\ffail upon an examination of the merits.                 Thus, we grant the\n\ngovernment’s motion and affirm the dismissal of the habeas\n\npetition.\n\n             Cantrell is mistaken in his belief that Congress\n\ndid not enact 21 U.S.C. § 841. On October 27, 1970, Congress\n\nenacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control\n\nAct of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-513, Tit. II, §§ 401, 406, 84\n\nStat. 1260, 1265, codified at 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846.\n\nThus, the crimes embodied by these statutes do not represent\n\nmere regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\n\n             Cantrell’s claim that the district court lacked\n\njurisdiction because his criminal conduct occurred in a state\n\n(and   not    on   federally       owned    land,   a   territory,   or    the\n\nDistrict of Columbia) also fails.                   Congress has provided\n\nthat: “The district courts of the United States shall have\n\noriginal jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States,\n\nof all offenses against the laws of the United States.”                     18\n\nU.S.C. § 3231.             The trial court’s jurisdiction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3231 is not restricted to crimes occurring on\n\nfederally owned property.             United States v. Munat, 29 F.3d\n\n233, 237 (6th Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Prou, 199\n\nF.3d   37,    45   (1 st    Cir.   1999)    (“a   federal   district    court\n\nplainly      possesses      subject-matter        jurisdiction   over     drug\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcases”); United States v. Lussier, 929 F.2d 25, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n1991)   (rejecting    “territorial”   jurisdiction   argument    in\n\ncriminal tax case).\n\n           To   the   extent   that   Cantrell’s   claim   can   be\n\nconstrued as a general challenge to the constitutionality of\n\nthe statutes of conviction, we note that the statutes at\n\nissue, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846, were not enacted pursuant to\n\nCongress’s general police powers over its territories and the\n\nDistrict of Columbia, but, rather,       under Congress’s power\n\nto regulate commerce.      With this in mind, we have upheld\n\ntheir constitutionality.       See United States v. Zorilla, 93\n\nF.3d 7, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1996)(holding that drug trafficking is\n\nprecisely the kind of economic enterprise that substantially\n\naffects interstate commerce and that, therefore, comes within\n\nCongress's regulatory power under the Commerce Clause).\n\n           Cantrell’s Apprendi argument would fail even if\n\nApprendi could be considered retroactively applicable to\n\ncases on collateral review (which is not the case).        The rule\n\nin Apprendi is that, \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior\n\nconviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime\n\nbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to\n\na jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"        530 U.S. at\n\n490.    This rule has not been violated because Cantrell’s 70-\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fmonth sentence fell far below the 20-year maximum statutory\n\nsentence applicable to drug crimes without reference to drug\n\nquantity.    See   United States v. Campbell, 268 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir. 2001)(finding no Apprendi violation when the district\n\ncourt sentences a defendant below the default statutory\n\nmaximum   applicable     to   crimes    without    reference   to   drug\n\nquantity); see also 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (setting default\n\nstatutory    maximum).        Likewise,   his     three-year   term   of\n\nsupervised release was within the default statutory maximum.\n\n\n\n            Affirmed.    Loc.R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
