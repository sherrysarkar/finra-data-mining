MEJIAS-NEGRON,\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Raymond L. Acosta, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Ramon E.

Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 19, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam.   Proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis\n\n(IFP), Ramon Mejias Negron (Mejias) appeals from the district\n\ncourt’s denial of his motion to hold the U.S. Marshal in contempt\n\nof court. He also appeals the district court’s denial of his\n\nsubsequent motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) seeking\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law on the merits of his\n\ncontempt motion.\n\n           Mejias’s argument that the U.S. Marshal is guilty of\n\ncontempt of court because he failed to obey the district court’s\n\ndirective in its final judgment that Mejias be returned to the\n\nfederal prison facility in Rochester, Minnesota, is unavailing.\n\nA district court does not have the authority to specify a\n\nparticular prison in which the defendant is to serve his or her\n\nsentence. United States v. Wells, 766 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\nThe Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons (BOP),\n\ndesignates the place of confinement. See United States v. Wilson,\n\n503 U.S. 329, 331, (1992). Accordingly, Mejias has not established\n\ncontempt of court, and the district court did not err by denying\n\nhis motion.\n\n           Furthermore, the district court did not err in denying\n\nMejias’s motion pursuant to Rule 52(a) either because the court was\n\nnot required to make findings of fact and draw conclusions of law\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fregarding Mejias’s contempt motion. Rule 52(a) states: “Findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of\n\nmotions under Rule 12 or 56 or any other motion except as provided\n\nin subdivision (c) of this rule.” Because the exception of Rule\n\n52(c) does not apply to the present facts, it is clear that under\n\nRule 52(a) the district court did not err in summarily denying as\n\nmoot Mejias’s contempt motion without opinion. See Enzo Biochem,\n\nInc. v. Calgene, Inc., 188 F.3d 1362, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The\n\ncourt’s judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
