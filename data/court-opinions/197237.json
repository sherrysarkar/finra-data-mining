Wayne Sargent  brought  this\r                                        \r\n\naction  in the  district court  against his  former employer,\r\n\nTenaska, Inc.   On appeal,  the case has  been narrowed:  the\r\n\nissue  is whether  Sargent has a  claim to  certain ownership\r\n\ninterests  because  of  an  alleged  breach  of  the  implied\r\n\ncovenant of  good faith and fair  dealing under Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw.   Because  the district  court granted  summary judgment\r\n\nagainst Sargent  on  this issue,  we review  its decision  de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo,  drawing  reasonable  factual inferences  in  Sargent's\r                \r\n\nfavor.  Grenier v. Vermont Log Bldgs., Inc., 96 F.3d 559, 562\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n     Tenaska,   Inc.,   develops    power   generation    and\r\n\ncogeneration  projects  in  different  areas  of  the  United\r\n\nStates.  Sargent, a Massachusetts resident with many years of\r\n\npertinent engineering and management experience, was hired by\r\n\nTenaska, Inc., in May 1990.  His title was General Manager of\r\n\nthe  Eastern  Region.    Tenaska, Inc.,  had  a  cogeneration\r\n\nproject  under way  in Lee,  Massachusetts, and it  was hoped\r\n\nthat  Sargent would  organize other  projects in  the Eastern\r\n\nRegion for the company.\r\n\n     Sargent's compensation  included not only  a management-\r\n\nlevel  salary but also a promise of an \"ownership interest of\r\n\n1.50%  in  Tenaska,  Inc.,  Lee  Mass  Cogeneration  Company,\r\n\nTenaska  Gas Company  and  in any  entities  created for  new\r\n\nprojects and formed by Tenaska subsequent to [his] employment\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nstart  date.\"    This  language  appeared in  a  letter  from\r\n\nTenaska, Inc., to Sargent  offering employment.  The district\r\n\ncourt treated the  letter as setting forth  the initial terms\r\n\nof an  at-will employment  relationship and neither  side now\r\n\ndisputes this treatment.\r\n\n     Tenaska's  letter  provided  that   Sargent's  ownership\r\n\nrights would be made  available beginning twelve months after\r\n\nthe  start of his employment.  The  letter also said that the\r\n\nownership  plan,  which had  not  yet  been developed,  would\r\n\nultimately  include a right of  the company \"to  buy back the\r\n\nownership  interests of terminated  employees under specified\r\n\nterms and conditions that will penalize short-term employment\r\n\nand reward performance and long-term accomplishments.\"  \r\n\n     Tenaska, Inc.,  never developed a single  ownership plan\r\n\nbut instead set up a separate plan for each entity, including\r\n\nalmost a half-dozen new ones created after Sargent joined the\r\n\ncompany  and  during  his  tenure.    In general,  the  plans\r\n\nprovided  a vesting schedule for ownership interests acquired\r\n\nby  an employee; the company was allowed on termination of an\r\n\nemployee  to repurchase  the  unvested portion  at a  nominal\r                                                  \r\n\nprice.  The  vesting schedule, in the  typical plan, provided\r\n\nas follows:1   First 6 months:0% is vested\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1In the case  of one company, the  entire interest could\r\nbe  repurchased  even  after  the full  vesting  period,  but\r\nTenaska had to  pay book value  for the vested portion.   For\r\nanother  company, half  the vested  interest could  always be\r\nrepurchased for nominal value.  These variations do not alter\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     Months 7-18:        15% is vested\r\n\n     Months 19-30:       35% is vested\r\n\n     Months 31-42:       65% is vested\r\n\n     After 42d month:    100% is vested \r\n\n     Not  long after  Sargent joined  Tenaska, Inc.,  the Lee\r\n\nproject  was cancelled.  The  project was not  revived and no\r\n\nother projects  were secured  in Sargent's region  during his\r\n\nperiod  of  employment.   In  December  1993, Tenaska,  Inc.,\r\n\ndecided to  close its  Massachusetts office and  to eliminate\r\n\nSargent's position.   Sargent was offered  a new position  at\r\n\nthe company's Omaha headquarters;  the new position carried a\r\n\nlower  salary and  less favorable  benefits in  the ownership\r\n\nplans, including a reduction in various interests Sargent had\r\n\nor hoped to secure in existing projects.\r\n\n     Sargent  declined  the proposal  and  was  terminated by\r\n\nTenaska, Inc., in January 1994, having served about three and\r\n\none-half  years  with the  company.    Prior to  termination,\r\n\nSargent had been granted certain ownership interests in a few\r\n\nof the Tenaska projects  but less than all to which he deemed\r\n\nhimself entitled  under the  terms of the  employment letter.\r\n\nSargent immediately brought the  present suit in the district\r\n\ncourt against Tenaska, Inc.,  seeking all that his employment\r\n\nletter explicitly provided, and more.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nthe issue on  appeal, and we disregard them  for simplicity's\r\nsake.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     The  explicit  contract claim  need not  detain us.   On\r\n\ncross motions for summary  judgment, the district court ruled\r\n\nthe employment letter was a contract, suggesting that Sargent\r\n\nmight be  entitled  to  ownership  interests,  or  comparable\r\n\ndamages, to the extent that the promised interests had become\r\n\nvested  under their  plans  at the  time of  his termination.\r\n\nSargent  v. Tenaska,  Inc., 914  F. Supp.  722, 729,  730 (D.\r                                      \r\n\nMass. 1996).  Thereafter,  Sargent and Tenaska, Inc., reached\r\n\na settlement that disposed entirely of these express contract\r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n     What remains  open is  Sargent's claim for  \"more.\"   In\r\n\nsubstance, Sargent  has argued in  the district court  and on\r\n\nappeal  that he is also  entitled to the  unvested portion of\r\n\nthe ownership  interests in  question that would  have become\r\n\nvested  in due  course if he  had not  been discharged.   The\r\n\nbasis  for this claim is  the implied covenant  of good faith\r\n\nand fair dealing that Massachusetts law reads into employment\r\n\ncontracts.\r\n\n     This implied  covenant has  been taken by  Massachusetts\r\n\ncourts  to  permit  discharged employees  to  recover  unpaid\r\n\ncommissions or  other expectancies in  certain circumstances.\r\n\nFortune v. National Cash Register Co., 364 N.E.2d 1251, 1257-\r                                                 \r\n\n58  (Mass. 1977).  One  condition is that  the discharge have\r\n\nbeen done in bad  faith; another, put generally, is  that the\r\n\ninterest  or  claim pertains  to  \"past\"  services, i.e.,  to\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nservices  already performed  at  the time  of the  discharge.\r\n\nMcCone v. New England Tel.  &amp; Tel. Co., 471 N.E.2d  47, 49-50\r                                                  \r\n\n(Mass. 1984).\r\n\n     In  the  district court  Tenaska,  Inc., sought  summary\r\n\njudgment against  this Fortune claim.   It conceded  that its\r                                          \r\n\ngood  or  bad  faith  in  discharging  Sargent  could not  be\r\n\ndetermined  on  summary  judgment,   but  asserted  that  the\r\n\nunvested interests claimed  by Sargent were compensation  for\r\n\nfuture rather than past services.  The district court agreed,\r\n\nstressing  the language  in  the employment  letter that  the\r\n\nvesting provision  was designed  to  \"reward performance  and\r\n\nlong-term accomplishments.\"  This appeal followed.\r\n\n      The  Fortune doctrine  is easy to  grasp in  the simple\r                              \r\n\ncase that spawned  it:   an at-will salesman,  entitled to  a\r\n\ncommission  payable at a later date, is fired, after the sale\r\n\nbut before the date of payment; and the reason for the firing\r\n\nis  to cut off the  commission.  In  that case, Massachusetts\r\n\ncourts imply a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, treat\r\n\nthe discharge as a breach, and fix the remedy as  an award to\r\n\nthe salesman  of future compensation for  the completed sale.\r\n\nFortune, 364 N.E.2d at 1257-58.\r                   \r\n\n     Since  Fortune  so held  in 1977,  Massachusetts appeals\r                               \r\n\ncourts have both extended and limited the doctrine in several\r\n\nimportant decisions.   For example,  Fortune-based recoveries\r                                                        \r\n\nhave  been  allowed in  Gram v.  Liberty  Mut. Ins.

The\r\n\ncontract terms agreed to  by the parties are not  in dispute;\r\n\nthe  debate  is  whether  the law  should  extend  protection\r\n\n(assuming bad  faith discharge)  beyond the express  terms of\r\n\nthe contract  to certain  expectancies.  The  extent of  such\r\n\nprotection is primarily a matter for judges, not juries.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nGram II, 461 N.E.2d at 798; cf. Green v.

This kind\r\n\nof  correlation  is  harder   where  the  future  payment  is\r\n\nconnected not  with a  specific past  act but  with continued\r\n\nservice at the  company over a period  of time.  The  company\r\n\ncould be interested  simply in the  employee's service as  it\r\n\noccurs or,  at  the other  extreme, in  keeping the  employee\r\n\nuntil the last  day no matter what.  In  the former case, one\r\n\ncould treat all of the time worked prior to discharge as past\r                                                                         \r\n\nservices  and require pro rata payment; the latter case might\r\n\nsuggest otherwise.\r\n\n     In  reality, motives  are often  mixed: the  company may\r\n\nwant  both to provide an ongoing incentive to work harder and\r\n\nto retain an ever more valuable employee as long as possible.\r\n\nA  periodic  vesting schedule  achieves  both  aims; and  the\r\n\nlatter is  reenforced where, as here,  the incremental amount\r                                                                  \r\n\nvested  in each period increases in later periods.  And, with\r\n\nperiodic   vesting,  the   employee  gets   some  contractual\r\n\nprotection (i.e.,  of vested  interests) against the  loss of\r                            \r\n\nthe job in midstream.\r\n\n     A good argument  could be made  that, where a  colorable\r\n\nperiodic vesting  period is  provided, the parties  should be\r\n\ntaken  to have settled between themselves  the issue that the\r\n\nFortune doctrine  itself seeks  to mediate:  how much of  the\r                   \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\npromised  future  compensation should  be treated  as already\r\n\nearned  prior to the  discharge.  But  Massachusetts case law\r\n\nsends  mixed signals  on this  issue.   Compare Cataldo,  482\r                                                                   \r\n\nN.E.2d at  851-52 with Cort v. Bristol-Myers  Co., 431 N.E.2d\r                                                             \r\n\n908, 910-11 (Mass. 1982).\r\n\n     Certainly,  terms like  \"vested\" and  \"unvested\" do  not\r\n\nautomatically control.   An  agreement might provide  that an\r\n\nemployee  who worked for  five years to  complete a five-year\r\n\nproject would get a one-third interest at the end but nothing\r\n\nif he left prior to that date.  If  the employee was fired in\r\n\nbad  faith a  month before  completion,  it is  doubtful that\r\n\nFortune could be shrugged off by saying that the interest had\r                   \r\n\nnot yet vested.2\r\n\n     Still, ordinarily, a colorable periodic vesting schedule\r                                                        \r\n\ncrudely delineates the line between past and future services.\r\n\nWhile  Sargent remained  at  the company,  his past  services\r\n\ngrew; but so  did his  vested interests.   Most  of his  past\r\n\nservices   were   therefore   already  compensated   by   his\r\n\ncontractual   claims  to   vested  interests;   and  unvested\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2We  decline  Sargent's  invitation  to  rely  upon  the\r\nunpublished  slip opinion in Ground  Round, Inc. v.

We say \"largely\" because within the\r                                                                     \r\n\nsingle vesting  period embracing  the date of  discharge, one\r\n\ncould  make an  effort  to distinguish  and protect  services\r\n\nalready performed  between the start  of that period  and the\r\n\ndate of discharge.\r\n\n     Sargent  has made no effort to argue for or support such\r\n\na drastic narrowing of his claim; he has chosen to argue that\r\n\nyet unvested  interests  from all  then-occurring and  future\r                                             \r\n\nvesting periods are related to past compensation.  Taking the\r\n\ncase as he  has framed it, we agree with  the district court:\r\n\ntaken as a  whole, the unvested interests  claimed by Sargent\r\n\ndid not specifically and identifiably correspond to Sargent's\r\n\npast  services.     Predominantly,  they  were   oriented  to\r\n\ncompensating services not yet provided.\r\n\n     Sargent himself  is unable  to explain how  the unvested\r\n\ninterests he claims can plausibly  be treated as payment  for\r\n\npast services.  His main argument is that it would be \"an odd\r\n\nsort of 'future compensation'  indeed, when the employee pays\r\n\nfor  it, receives it,  earns income on it,  and pays taxes on\r\n\nit-- all in the present.\"  But there is nothing odd about it;\r\n\ncertainly future services can be conditionally purchased by a\r\n\nnominal transfer of ownership  subject to a vesting provision\r\n\nand enforced by a buy-back option.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     Sargent's best argument hangs on a single precedent, the\r\n\nMassachusetts  Appeals  Court  decision  Cataldo.   There,  a\r                                                            \r\n\ndeveloper hired Cataldo to supervise its projects,  promising\r\n\nhim,  in  addition  to  a  base  salary,  a  portion  of  the\r\n\ndeveloper's  equity  in  two  named projects  and  in  future\r\n\nprojects handled by the firm.  If Cataldo's  employment ended\r\n\nduring a project, the firm could buy back his interest at the\r\n\nlesser of appraised value or a sliding  scale payment, giving\r                  \r\n\nCataldo  $1,000 per  month  times the  number  of months  the\r\n\nproject had consumed.  Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 851-52.\r                                          \r\n\n     The  latter provision was effectively a periodic vesting\r\n\nprovision.  When  Cataldo was  later fired, he  sued for  his\r\n\nshare  of  the  developer's  equity  in  several  uncompleted\r\n\nprojects.   Although the  trial judge apparently  thought the\r\n\nexpress contract claim more  suitable, he also instructed the\r\n\njury under  Fortune doctrine.   Cataldo,  482 N.E.2d at  854.\r                                                   \r\n\nThe jury awarded Cataldo substantial sums.  The Appeals Court\r\n\naffirmed, saying:\r\n\n               We conclude that,  when Cataldo  was\r\n          discharged, the  possibility that Cataldo\r\n          would gain  later a  vested share  of the\r\n          developer's equity in each [firm] project\r\n          then    viable   was    sufficiently   an\r\n          `identifiable,  future  benefit  .   .  .\r\n          reflective   of  past  services'  .  .  .\r\n          performed by Cataldo,  to come within the\r\n          principle  of  the  Fortune  case.     We\r                                                 \r\n          recognize,  of  course, that  the precise\r\n          limits of  the doctrine of  that case are\r\n          not free from doubt.\r\n\nCataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 855-56 (citations omitted).\r                   \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     Yet  the  Appeals  Court  never decided  the  question--\r\n\ncritical  to us--whether the  buy-back provision  limited the\r\n\nfirm's  liability  to  Cataldo  with  respect  to uncompleted\r\n\nprojects.   Instead, the court upheld a jury finding that the\r\n\nbuy-back option  had been waived  because the firm  failed to\r\n\nexercise  that option promptly.  Cataldo,  482 N.E.2d at 857.\r                                                    \r\n\nIndeed, the court's language  implies that it might otherwise\r\n\nhave limited liability to the  vested interests.

On appeal, the case has been narrowed:  the issue is whether Sargent has a claim to certain ownership interests because of an alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Massachusetts law.  Because the district court granted summary judgment against Sargent on this issue, we review its decision de novo, drawing reasonable factual inferences in Sargent's favor.  Grenier v. Vermont Log Bldgs., Inc., 96 F.3d 559, 562 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenaska, Inc., develops power generation and cogeneration projects in different areas of the United States.  Sargent, a Massachusetts resident with many years of pertinent engineering and management experience, was hired by Tenaska, Inc., in May 1990.  His title was General Manager of the Eastern Region.  Tenaska, Inc., had a cogeneration project under way in Lee, Massachusetts, and it was hoped that Sargent would organize other projects in the Eastern Region for the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent's compensation included not only a management-level salary but also a promise of an \"ownership interest of 1.50% in Tenaska, Inc., Lee Mass Cogeneration Company, Tenaska Gas Company and in any entities created for new projects and formed by Tenaska subsequent to [his] employment start date.\"   This language appeared in a letter from Tenaska, Inc., to Sargent offering employment.  The district court treated the letter as setting forth the initial terms of an at-will employment relationship and neither side now disputes this treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenaska's letter provided that Sargent's ownership rights would be made available beginning twelve months after the start of his employment.  The letter also said that the ownership plan, which had not yet been developed, would ultimately include a right of the company \"to buy back the ownership interests of terminated employees under specified terms and conditions that will penalize short-term employment and reward performance and long-term accomplishments.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenaska, Inc., never developed a single ownership plan but instead set up a separate plan for each entity, including almost a half-dozen new ones created after Sargent joined the company and during his tenure.  In general, the plans provided a vesting schedule for ownership interests acquired by an employee;  the company was allowed on termination of an employee to repurchase the unvested portion at a nominal price.  The vesting schedule, in the typical plan, provided as follows:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not long after Sargent joined Tenaska, Inc., the Lee project was cancelled.  The project was not revived and no other projects were secured in Sargent's region during his period of employment.  In December 1993, Tenaska, Inc., decided to close its Massachusetts office and to eliminate Sargent's position.  Sargent was offered a new position at the company's Omaha headquarters;  the new position carried a lower salary and less favorable benefits in the ownership plans, including a reduction in various interests Sargent had or hoped to secure in existing projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent declined the proposal and was terminated by Tenaska, Inc., in January 1994, having served about three and one-half years with the company.  Prior to termination, Sargent had been granted certain ownership interests in a few of the Tenaska projects but less than all to which he deemed himself entitled under the terms of the employment letter.  Sargent immediately brought the present suit in the district court against Tenaska, Inc., seeking all that his employment letter explicitly provided, and more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The explicit contract claim need not detain us.  On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled the employment letter was a contract, suggesting that Sargent might be entitled to ownership interests, or comparable damages, to the extent that the promised interests had become vested under their plans at the time of his termination.  Sargent v. Tenaska, Inc., 914 F.Supp. 722, 729, 730 (D.Mass.1996).  Thereafter, Sargent and Tenaska, Inc., reached a settlement that disposed entirely of these express contract claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What remains open is Sargent's claim for \"more.\"   In substance, Sargent has argued in the district court and on appeal that he is also entitled to the unvested portion of the ownership interests in question that would have become vested in due course if he had not been discharged.  The basis for this claim is the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that Massachusetts law reads into employment contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This implied covenant has been taken by Massachusetts courts to permit discharged employees to recover unpaid commissions or other expectancies in certain circumstances.  Fortune v. National Cash Register Co., 373 Mass. 96, 364 N.E.2d 1251, 1257-58 (1977).  One condition is that the discharge have been done in bad faith;  another, put generally, is that the interest or claim pertains to \"past\" services, i.e., to services already performed at the time of the discharge.  McCone v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 393 Mass. 231, 471 N.E.2d 47, 49-50 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court Tenaska, Inc., sought summary judgment against this Fortune claim.  It conceded that its good or bad faith in discharging Sargent could not be determined on summary judgment, but asserted that the unvested interests claimed by Sargent were compensation for future rather than past services.  The district court agreed, stressing the language in the employment letter that the vesting provision was designed to \"reward performance and long-term accomplishments.\"   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fortune doctrine is easy to grasp in the simple case that spawned it:  an at-will salesman, entitled to a commission payable at a later date, is fired, after the sale but before the date of payment;  and the reason for the firing is to cut off the commission.  In that case, Massachusetts courts imply a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, treat the discharge as a breach, and fix the remedy as an award to the salesman of future compensation for the completed sale.  Fortune, 364 N.E.2d at 1257-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Fortune so held in 1977, Massachusetts appeals courts have both extended and limited the doctrine in several important decisions.  For example, Fortune-based recoveries have been allowed in Gram v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 384 Mass. 659, 429 N.E.2d 21, 29 (1981) (\"Gram I \"), Maddaloni v. Western Mass.  Bus Lines, 386 Mass. 877, 438 N.E.2d 351, 355-56 (1982), and Cataldo v. Zuckerman, 20 Mass.App.Ct. 731, 482 N.E.2d 849, 855-56 (1985).  These cases make clear that Fortune is not limited to simple cases of commission sales with deferred payments.  Id., 482 N.E.2d at 851-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Supreme Judicial Court has confined recovery to \"identifiable, future benefit[s] ... reflective of past services,\" Gram I, 429 N.E.2d at 29, and firmly excluded prospective benefits not thus tied to past services, McCone, 471 N.E.2d at 50;  Gram v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 391 Mass. 333, 461 N.E.2d 796, 798 (1984) (\"Gram II \").  The recurring difficulty, presented in the case before us, is how to decide whether the unvested interests relate to \"past\" or \"future\" services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat this characterization issue as one of law.  The contract terms agreed to by the parties are not in dispute;  the debate is whether the law should extend protection (assuming bad faith discharge) beyond the express terms of the contract to certain expectancies.  The extent of such protection is primarily a matter for judges, not juries.  See Gram II, 461 N.E.2d at 798;  cf.  Green v. Richmond, 369 Mass. 47, 337 N.E.2d 691, 695 (1975) (judge decides the legal question of whether undisputed contract terms violate public policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is easy to find a protectable interest where, as in Fortune, the promised future payment is directly tied to a particular past service, such as a discrete sale.  This kind of correlation is harder where the future payment is connected not with a specific past act but with continued service at the company over a period of time.  The company could be interested simply in the employee's service as it occurs or, at the other extreme, in keeping the employee until the last day no matter what.  In the former case, one could treat all of the time worked prior to discharge as past services and require pro rata payment;  the latter case might suggest otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reality, motives are often mixed:  the company may want both to provide an ongoing incentive to work harder and to retain an ever more valuable employee as long as possible.  A periodic vesting schedule achieves both aims;  and the latter is reenforced where, as here, the incremental amount vested in each period increases in later periods.  And, with periodic vesting, the employee gets some contractual protection (i.e., of vested interests) against the loss of the job in midstream.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A good argument could be made that, where a colorable periodic vesting period is provided, the parties should be taken to have settled between themselves the issue that the Fortune doctrine itself seeks to mediate:  how much of the promised future compensation should be treated as already earned prior to the discharge.  But Massachusetts case law sends mixed signals on this issue.  Compare Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 851-52, with Cort v. Bristol-Myers Co., 385 Mass. 300, 431 N.E.2d 908, 910-11 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, terms like \"vested\" and \"unvested\" do not automatically control.  An agreement might provide that an employee who worked for five years to complete a five-year project would get a one-third interest at the end but nothing if he left prior to that date.  If the employee was fired in bad faith a month before completion, it is doubtful that Fortune could be shrugged off by saying that the interest had not yet vested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, ordinarily, a colorable periodic vesting schedule crudely delineates the line between past and future services.  While Sargent remained at the company, his past services grew;  but so did his vested interests.  Most of his past services were therefore already compensated by his contractual claims to vested interests;  and unvested interests were largely associated with future services not protected under Fortune.   We say \"largely\" because within the single vesting period embracing the date of discharge, one could make an effort to distinguish and protect services already performed between the start of that period and the date of discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent has made no effort to argue for or support such a drastic narrowing of his claim;  he has chosen to argue that yet unvested interests from all then-occurring and future vesting periods are related to past compensation.  Taking the case as he has framed it, we agree with the district court:  taken as a whole, the unvested interests claimed by Sargent did not specifically and identifiably correspond to Sargent's past services.  Predominantly, they were oriented to compensating services not yet provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent himself is unable to explain how the unvested interests he claims can plausibly be treated as payment for past services.  His main argument is that it would be \"an odd sort of 'future compensation' indeed, when the employee pays for it, receives it, earns income on it, and pays taxes on it--all in the present.\"   But there is nothing odd about it;  certainly future services can be conditionally purchased by a nominal transfer of ownership subject to a vesting provision and enforced by a buy-back option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent's best argument hangs on a single precedent, the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision Cataldo.   There, a developer hired Cataldo to supervise its projects, promising him, in addition to a base salary, a portion of the developer's equity in two named projects and in future projects handled by the firm.  If Cataldo's employment ended during a project, the firm could buy back his interest at the lesser of appraised value or a sliding scale payment, giving Cataldo $1,000 per month times the number of months the project had consumed.  Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 851-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter provision was effectively a periodic vesting provision.  When Cataldo was later fired, he sued for his share of the developer's equity in several uncompleted projects.  Although the trial judge apparently thought the express contract claim more suitable, he also instructed the jury under Fortune doctrine.  Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 854.   The jury awarded Cataldo substantial sums.  The Appeals Court affirmed, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, when Cataldo was discharged, the possibility that Cataldo would gain later a vested share of the developer's equity in each [firm] project then viable was sufficiently an 'identifiable, future benefit ... reflective of past services' ... performed by Cataldo, to come within the principle of the Fortune case.  We recognize, of course, that the precise limits of the doctrine of that case are not free from doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 855-56 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the Appeals Court never decided the question--critical to us--whether the buy-back provision limited the firm's liability to Cataldo with respect to uncompleted projects.  Instead, the court upheld a jury finding that the buy-back option had been waived because the firm failed to exercise that option promptly.  Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 857.   Indeed, the court's language implies that it might otherwise have limited liability to the vested interests.  Hammond v. T.J. Litle &amp; Co., 82 F.3d 1166, 1168-69, 1172 (1st Cir. 1996), perhaps closer to our own facts, turned on the plain error rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent controlling precedent, we have sought to apply the principle of Fortune--protection of compensation earned for past services--and conclude that it does not fit Sargent's unvested interests.  To repeat, this is not because of any magic in the terms vested and unvested, but because the unvested interests here predominantly concern future services expected from Sargent.  Gram II, 461 N.E.2d at 798.

On appeal, the case has been narrowed:  the issue is whether Sargent has a claim to certain ownership interests because of an alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Massachusetts law.  Because the district court granted summary judgment against Sargent on this issue, we review its decision de novo, drawing reasonable factual inferences in Sargent's favor.  Grenier v. Vermont Log Bldgs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726666\"><a href=\"/opinion/726666/robert-b-grenier-v-vermont-log-buildings-inc-third-party-v-dap-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 562 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenaska, Inc., develops power generation and cogeneration projects in different areas of the United States.  Sargent, a Massachusetts resident with many years of pertinent engineering and management experience, was hired by Tenaska, Inc., in May 1990.  His title was General Manager of the Eastern Region.  Tenaska, Inc., had a cogeneration project under way in Lee, Massachusetts, and it was hoped that Sargent would organize other projects in the Eastern Region for the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent's compensation included not only a management-level salary but also a promise of an \"ownership interest of 1.50% in Tenaska, Inc., Lee Mass Cogeneration Company, Tenaska Gas Company and in any entities created for new projects and formed by Tenaska subsequent to [his] employment start date.\"   This language appeared in a letter from Tenaska, Inc., to Sargent offering employment.  The district court treated the letter as setting forth the initial terms of an at-will employment relationship and neither side now disputes this treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenaska's letter provided that Sargent's ownership rights would be made available beginning twelve months after the start of his employment.  The letter also said that the ownership plan, which had not yet been developed, would ultimately include a right of the company \"to buy back the ownership interests of terminated employees under specified terms and conditions that will penalize short-term employment and reward performance and long-term accomplishments.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tenaska, Inc., never developed a single ownership plan but instead set up a separate plan for each entity, including almost a half-dozen new ones created after Sargent joined the company and during his tenure.  In general, the plans provided a vesting schedule for ownership interests acquired by an employee;  the company was allowed on termination of an employee to repurchase the unvested portion at a nominal price.  The vesting schedule, in the typical plan, provided as follows:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not long after Sargent joined Tenaska, Inc., the Lee project was cancelled.  The project was not revived and no other projects were secured in Sargent's region during his period of employment.  In December 1993, Tenaska, Inc., decided to close its Massachusetts office and to eliminate Sargent's position.  Sargent was offered a new position at the company's Omaha headquarters;  the new position carried a lower salary and less favorable benefits in the ownership plans, including a reduction in various interests Sargent had or hoped to secure in existing projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent declined the proposal and was terminated by Tenaska, Inc., in January 1994, having served about three and one-half years with the company.  Prior to termination, Sargent had been granted certain ownership interests in a few of the Tenaska projects but less than all to which he deemed himself entitled under the terms of the employment letter.  Sargent immediately brought the present suit in the district court against Tenaska, Inc., seeking all that his employment letter explicitly provided, and more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The explicit contract claim need not detain us.  On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled the employment letter was a contract, suggesting that Sargent might be entitled to ownership interests, or comparable damages, to the extent that the promised interests had become vested under their plans at the time of his termination.  Sargent v. Tenaska, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></span>, 729, 730 (D.Mass.1996).

The basis for this claim is the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that Massachusetts law reads into employment contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This implied covenant has been taken by Massachusetts courts to permit discharged employees to recover unpaid commissions or other expectancies in certain circumstances.

It conceded that its good or bad faith in discharging Sargent could not be determined on summary judgment, but asserted that the unvested interests claimed by Sargent were compensation for future rather than past services.  The district court agreed, stressing the language in the employment letter that the vesting provision was designed to \"reward performance and long-term accomplishments.\"   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fortune doctrine is easy to grasp in the simple case that spawned it:  an at-will salesman, entitled to a commission payable at a later date, is fired, after the sale but before the date of payment;  and the reason for the firing is to cut off the commission.  In that case, Massachusetts courts imply a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, treat the discharge as a breach, and fix the remedy as an award to the salesman of future compensation for the completed sale.

The recurring difficulty, presented in the case before us, is how to decide whether the unvested interests relate to \"past\" or \"future\" services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat this characterization issue as one of law.  The contract terms agreed to by the parties are not in dispute;  the debate is whether the law should extend protection (assuming bad faith discharge) beyond the express terms of the contract to certain expectancies.  The extent of such protection is primarily a matter for judges, not juries.  See Gram II, 461 N.E.2d at 798;  cf.  Green v. Richmond, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2111140\"><a href=\"/opinion/2111140/green-v-richmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2111140\"><a href=\"/opinion/2111140/green-v-richmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span>, 695 (1975) (judge decides the legal question of whether undisputed contract terms violate public policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is easy to find a protectable interest where, as in Fortune, the promised future payment is directly tied to a particular past service, such as a discrete sale.  This kind of correlation is harder where the future payment is connected not with a specific past act but with continued service at the company over a period of time.  The company could be interested simply in the employee's service as it occurs or, at the other extreme, in keeping the employee until the last day no matter what.  In the former case, one could treat all of the time worked prior to discharge as past services and require pro rata payment;  the latter case might suggest otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reality, motives are often mixed:  the company may want both to provide an ongoing incentive to work harder and to retain an ever more valuable employee as long as possible.  A periodic vesting schedule achieves both aims;  and the latter is reenforced where, as here, the incremental amount vested in each period increases in later periods.  And, with periodic vesting, the employee gets some contractual protection (i.e., of vested interests) against the loss of the job in midstream.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A good argument could be made that, where a colorable periodic vesting period is provided, the parties should be taken to have settled between themselves the issue that the Fortune doctrine itself seeks to mediate:  how much of the promised future compensation should be treated as already earned prior to the discharge.  But Massachusetts case law sends mixed signals on this issue.  Compare Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 851-52, with Cort v. Bristol-Myers Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2038510\"><a href=\"/opinion/2038510/cort-v-bristol-myers-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2038510\"><a href=\"/opinion/2038510/cort-v-bristol-myers-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 910-11 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, terms like \"vested\" and \"unvested\" do not automatically control.  An agreement might provide that an employee who worked for five years to complete a five-year project would get a one-third interest at the end but nothing if he left prior to that date.  If the employee was fired in bad faith a month before completion, it is doubtful that Fortune could be shrugged off by saying that the interest had not yet vested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, ordinarily, a colorable periodic vesting schedule crudely delineates the line between past and future services.  While Sargent remained at the company, his past services grew;  but so did his vested interests.  Most of his past services were therefore already compensated by his contractual claims to vested interests;  and unvested interests were largely associated with future services not protected under Fortune.   We say \"largely\" because within the single vesting period embracing the date of discharge, one could make an effort to distinguish and protect services already performed between the start of that period and the date of discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent has made no effort to argue for or support such a drastic narrowing of his claim;  he has chosen to argue that yet unvested interests from all then-occurring and future vesting periods are related to past compensation.  Taking the case as he has framed it, we agree with the district court:  taken as a whole, the unvested interests claimed by Sargent did not specifically and identifiably correspond to Sargent's past services.  Predominantly, they were oriented to compensating services not yet provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent himself is unable to explain how the unvested interests he claims can plausibly be treated as payment for past services.  His main argument is that it would be \"an odd sort of 'future compensation' indeed, when the employee pays for it, receives it, earns income on it, and pays taxes on it--all in the present.\"   But there is nothing odd about it;  certainly future services can be conditionally purchased by a nominal transfer of ownership subject to a vesting provision and enforced by a buy-back option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent's best argument hangs on a single precedent, the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision Cataldo.   There, a developer hired Cataldo to supervise its projects, promising him, in addition to a base salary, a portion of the developer's equity in two named projects and in future projects handled by the firm.  If Cataldo's employment ended during a project, the firm could buy back his interest at the lesser of appraised value or a sliding scale payment, giving Cataldo $1,000 per month times the number of months the project had consumed.  Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 851-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter provision was effectively a periodic vesting provision.  When Cataldo was later fired, he sued for his share of the developer's equity in several uncompleted projects.  Although the trial judge apparently thought the express contract claim more suitable, he also instructed the jury under Fortune doctrine.  Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 854.   The jury awarded Cataldo substantial sums.  The Appeals Court affirmed, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, when Cataldo was discharged, the possibility that Cataldo would gain later a vested share of the developer's equity in each [firm] project then viable was sufficiently an 'identifiable, future benefit ... reflective of past services' ... performed by Cataldo, to come within the principle of the Fortune case.  We recognize, of course, that the precise limits of the doctrine of that case are not free from doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 855-56 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the Appeals Court never decided the question--critical to us--whether the buy-back provision limited the firm's liability to Cataldo with respect to uncompleted projects.  Instead, the court upheld a jury finding that the buy-back option had been waived because the firm failed to exercise that option promptly.  Cataldo, 482 N.E.2d at 857.   Indeed, the court's language implies that it might otherwise have limited liability to the vested interests.  Hammond v. T.J.

To repeat, this is not because of any magic in the terms vested and unvested, but because the unvested interests here predominantly concern future services expected from Sargent.  Gram II, 461 N.E.2d at 798.
