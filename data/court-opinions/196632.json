Rodriguez-Velez\r                                                                              \r\nand Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief for\r                             \r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   After carefully reviewing the  record\r                                \r\n\nand  the  parties' briefs,  we  affirm  the  judgment of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court for  essentially  the reasons  stated in  its\r\n\nOpinion and Order.  We add the following comments.\r\n\n          1.  The district  court was not required to  hold a\r\n\nhearing  on  appellant's  claim that  his  attorney  provided\r\n\nineffective assistance by failing to call as witnesses two of\r\n\nappellant's codefendants.  Conspicuously absent  from both of\r\n\nthe affidavits  of these  codefendants is any  statement that\r\n\neither  codefendant   would  have  testified   on  behalf  of\r\n\nappellant.   Also missing are averments  that appellant never\r\n\nknew  about the cocaine on board the SHEME and that appellant\r\n\nnever  had  been  told  about  the  drugs.    Indeed, neither\r\n\naffidavit is  inconsistent with the government's  position at\r\n\ntrial that  appellant was part  of the conspiracy  to possess\r\n\nwith the intent to distribute the cocaine.  Thus, even taking\r\n\nthe  rest of the allegations  in the affidavits  as true, the\r\n\nconclusions  appellant draws  from these facts  are basically\r\n\n\"self-interested  characterizations.\"   See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMcGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993) (in deciding whether\r                  \r\n\nto  hold   a  hearing,  the   district  court  must   take  a\r\n\npetitioner's factual  averments as  true but need  not credit\r\n\n\"conclusory  allegations,  self-interested  characterizations\r\n\n[or] discredited inventions\").\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Finally,  the case  upon which  appellant primarily\r\n\nrelies, United  States  v. Yizar,  956  F.2d 230  (11th  Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1992), is not to the contrary.  In Yizar, there was no doubt,\r                                                    \r\n\nunlike  here, that  the  codefendant actually  had said  that\r\n\ndefendant  was innocent.    Here, in  contrast,  there is  no\r\n\nindependent corroboration that Estupinan  or Passos-Paternina\r\n\npossessed exculpatory  evidence or that appellant  even named\r\n\nthem as  potential witnesses.   Moreover, the  information in\r\n\ntheir  affidavits hardly  amounts  to a  direct statement  of\r\n\nappellant's innocence.\r\n\n          2.  Appellant's  claim that his  attorney prevented\r\n\nhim from taking the stand is supported by only his allegation\r\n\nthat  his attorney  led  him to  believe  that he  could  not\r\n\ntestify.  This  is insufficent, without more,  to require the\r\n\ndistrict court to hold an evidentiary hearing.   Siciliano v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nVose,  834 F.2d  29, 31  (1st Cir.  1987) (an  affidavit that\r                \r\n\nstates  only  that  counsel  refused to  allow  defendant  to\r\n\ntestify  on  his  own  behalf is  insufficient  to  establish\r\n\ndefendant's  entitlement to  a hearing  on his  habeas corpus\r\n\npetition).  See also Underwood v. Clark, 939 F.2d 473, 475-76\r                                                   \r\n\n(7th Cir.  1991) (a \"barebones assertion\"  that a defendant's\r\n\nattorney would not let him testify is \"too facile a tactic to\r\n\nbe  allowed  to  succeed\";  greater  particularity  and  some\r\n\nsubstantiation are necessary).\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Again,  the  cases upon  which  appellant primarily\r\n\nrelies  do not support his  position.  In  one, United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.Walker, 772  F.2d 1172 (5th  Cir. 1985) (a  direct appeal),\r                    \r\n\nthe defendant had told his attorney that he wished to testify\r\n\nand the  attorney had  filed a motion  to reopen the  case to\r\n\nallow defendant to take the stand.  The court determined that\r\n\nthe  trial court  had abused  its discretion  in  denying the\r\n\nmotion.  Id. at 1176, 1185.  In the other case, United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Butts,  630  F.Supp. 1145  (D.  Me.  1986)  (a new  trial\r                     \r\n\nmotion), there  was independent evidence  -- courtroom scenes\r\n\nand  counsel's testimony  -- that defendant  consistently had\r\n\ndemanded to  testify on  his own  behalf.  Id.  at 1146.   As\r                                                          \r\n\nnoted  above,  there  is   no  independent  corroboration  of\r\n\nappellant's  allegation that  his attorney  told him  that he\r\n\ncould not testify.\r\n\n          3.   The remainder  of appellant's claims  were not\r\n\nraised below and therefore will  not be addressed on  appeal.\r\n\nSee Knight v.  United States, 37 F.3d 769,  772 n.2 (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1994).\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  \r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
