On this appeal, we consider\r\nwhether the district court properly enjoined a state utility\r\ncommission to allow a specific increase in electric utility rates\r\nsought by Connecticut Valley Electric Service Company (\"Connecticut\r\nValley\").  In timing and background facts, there is considerable\r\noverlap between this decision and our companion decision today in\r\nNo. 98-1764, which arises out of the same district court\r\nproceeding.  The reader's familiarity with that decision is\r\nassumed, but additional background is required to understand the\r\nevents and legal issues peculiar to Connecticut Valley.\r\n                     I. BACKGROUND\r\nConnecticut Valley is an electric utility that provides\r\nretail service to end-user customers in certain New Hampshire\r\ncommunities.  Its rates are set forth in a retail tariff subject to\r\nthe authority of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission\r\n(\"the Commission\").  R.S.A.  378:7 (1997); see Legislative Util.\r\nConsumers' Council v. Public Serv. Co., 402 A.2d 626, 631 (N.H.\r\n1979).  The company does not generate any electric power; it is\r\npart of an integrated public utility system and purchases power\r\nfrom others.\r\nAbout 76 percent of the power purchased by Connecticut\r\nValley is acquired from its parent company, Central Vermont Public\r\nService Company (\"Central Vermont\").  Rates and contracts for\r\nwholesale transactions in electric power, assuming an interstate\r\nnexus, are normally subject to regulation by the Federal Energy\r\nRegulatory Commission (\"FERC\") under the Federal Power Act, 16\r\nU.S.C.  824, 824d (1994).  FERC has accepted for filing the\r\ntariffs and contract under which Central Vermont supplies power to\r\nConnecticut Valley.  See Appeal of Sinclair Mach. Prods., Inc., 498\r\nA.2d 696, 698-99 (N.H. 1985).  \r\nIn supplying Connecticut Valley and its own retail\r\ncustomers in Vermont, Central Vermont purchases about 35 to 40\r\npercent of its power under a long-term supply contract with Hydro\r\nQuebec.  Contracts of this kind provide price and supply protection\r\n(the Hydro Quebec contract runs until 2016), but also commit the\r\npurchaser to buy even if market conditions change.  Apparently, the\r\nHydro Quebec contract price now exceeds wholesale electricity\r\nprices available in New England, so  Connecticut Valley could lower\r\nits power costs in the short run if it ceased to buy from Central\r\nVermont.\r\nThe existing contract between Connecticut Valley and\r\nCentral Vermont permits Connecticut Valley to terminate its\r\npurchase contract on short notice; oversimplifying slightly, the\r\nnotice period is one year.  Although Connecticut Valley says that\r\nthe Commission initially encouraged its contract with Central\r\nVermont, the Commission has recently criticized the purchases,\r\nsaying that the contract was being continued for the benefit of\r\nCentral Vermont and that the purchases could be regarded as\r\nimprudent from Connecticut Valley's standpoint.\r\nIn February 1997, when adopting the Final Plan discussed\r\nin our companion decision, the Commission's implementing order as\r\nto Connecticut Valley addressed the issue directly.  See Order No.\r\n22,509.  The Commission's order said that in calculating the costs\r\nthat Connecticut Valley would be able to recover through its own\r\nretail rates, the Commission would disallow the cost of power\r\nacquired from Central Vermont to the extent that it exceeded the\r\ncost of power generally available at wholesale prices in\r\nConnecticut and in New Hampshire.  See id.  \r\nCentral Vermont responded in June 1997 by initiating a\r\nproceeding before FERC to terminate the contract with Connecticut\r\nValley; the request for termination, however, was contingent on\r\nFERC's approval of a termination charge by which Central Vermont\r\ncould effectively impose upon Connecticut Valley a share of the\r\n\"loss\" resulting from the difference between the long-term Hydro\r\nQuebec rate and the lesser market rate now available.  FERC\r\nrejected the Central Vermont proposal, but invited Central Vermont\r\nto return to FERC with a differently structured plan for making\r\nConnecticut Valley share in some measure in whatever loss resulted\r\nfrom termination.  \r\nThe next event leading to the present appeal occurred in\r\nFall 1997, when Connecticut Valley submitted tariff changes to the\r\nCommission to secure an increase in Connecticut Valley's own retail\r\nrates.  The purpose of the proposed increase, sought to be made\r\neffective on January 1, 1998, was simply to pass through to\r\ncustomers increases in Central Vermont's wholesale rate under its\r\nFERC tariff.  It appears that the rate charged to Connecticut\r\nValley depended on Central Vermont's own costs of generating and\r\nacquiring power, which vary from year to year.  The Commission had\r\npreviously allowed Connecticut Valley to make corresponding\r\nincreases in its retail rates without much fuss or delay.\r\nThis time the story was different.  The Commission\r\nannounced on December 31, 1997, that it would not allow Connecticut\r\nValley to increase its retail rates to take account of the increase\r\nin Central Vermont's wholesale rate charged to Connecticut Valley. \r\nSee Order No. 22,815.  The Commission's order acknowledged that\r\nthis would cause a shortfall for Connecticut Valley, but it said\r\nthat the utility should earlier have terminated its contract with\r\nCentral Vermont.  The Commission said it would later determine what\r\nprudently acquired wholesale power should cost Connecticut Valley,\r\ncreating the threat of an actual decrease in Connecticut Valley's\r\nretail rates.\r\nOn January 19, 1998, Connecticut Valley and Central\r\nVermont filed a motion in the district court in the pending\r\nlitigation brought by Public Service Company of New Hampshire\r\n(\"PSNH\"), described in our companion opinion.  Connecticut Valley\r\nand Central Vermont, along with other utilities in New Hampshire,\r\nhad already intervened in that case.  See Public Serv. Co. v.\r\nPatch, 173 F.R.D. 17 (D.N.H. 1997).  In their motion, Connecticut\r\nValley and Central Vermont sought a temporary restraining order and\r\nthen a preliminary injunction to require the Commission to put into\r\neffect the rate increases that the Commission had disallowed in\r\nDecember 1997.\r\nIn the TRO motion, the two utilities argued that the\r\nCommission's rejection of the rate increases effectively violated\r\nthe injunction against the Final Plan previously obtained by PSNH,\r\nand further argued that, independent of the district court's prior\r\norders, the Commission's December 31, 1997, order was \"preempted\"\r\nby FERC's exclusive jurisdiction over the wholesale rate contract\r\nand over Central Vermont's pending application to modify the\r\ncontract to impose an exit fee.  The motion was also accompanied by\r\naffidavits of the two utilities' vice president and the companies'\r\nindependent auditor attesting to the severe economic harm,\r\nincluding possible bankruptcy of Connecticut Valley, threatened by\r\nthe Commission's action.  \r\nOn January 20, 1998, the Commission granted rehearing in\r\nthe rate proceeding and allowed Connecticut Valley to file\r\nadditional testimony, but the Commission did not authorize the\r\nretail rate increases sought by the utility.  In February 1998, the\r\nCommission filed papers in the district court opposing the TRO and\r\ndisputing jurisdiction, the merits, and the predictions of\r\nirreparable injury.  Further materials were filed by  Connecticut\r\nValley and Central Vermont, and on April 3, 1998, the district \r\ncourt held a hearing on the request for a TRO and preliminary\r\ninjunction.\r\nAt the hearing, there were extensive arguments and\r\ncounsel brought the district court up to date as to intervening\r\ndevelopments.  The court then took a brief recess and returned to\r\nmake extensive oral rulings, generally favorable to Connecticut\r\nValley and Central Vermont.  Describing the Commission's conduct as\r\na violation of the court's earlier grant of injunctive relief\r\nagainst the Final Plan, the court directed counsel for the\r\nutilities to prepare a preliminary injunction.\r\nOn April 9, 1997, the district court entered a formal\r\npreliminary injunction adopting its oral rulings as findings of\r\nfact and conclusions of law.  The injunction specifically directed\r\nthe Commission to allow Connecticut Valley to recover through\r\nretail rates the full cost of wholesale power obtained from Central\r\nVermont pursuant to the latter's FERC tariffs.  It appears that\r\nsince that time--possibly retroactively to January 1, 1998--\r\nConnecticut Valley has been obtaining the increased rates that it\r\nsought in its Fall 1997 filing.  \r\nThe Commission has now appealed from the April 9, 1998,\r\ninjunction.  Its appeal raises threshold objections to the grant of\r\nthe injunction, it denies that the utilities are likely to prevail\r\non the merits, and it treats very briefly the issue of irreparable\r\ninjury.  We consider the arguments in the same order.  The familiar\r\nrequirements for a preliminary injunction and the standards for\r\nappellate review are set forth in our companion decision.\r\n                    II.  DISCUSSION\r\nAt the threshold, the strictest limit on the district\r\ncourt's jurisdiction is the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C.  1342 (1994). \r\nThis statute, described more fully in our companion decision,\r\nprohibits district court injunctions against state rate orders\r\nunder certain circumstances.  But one of the circumstances in which\r\nthe Johnson Act does not bar injunction against a state rate order\r\nis where the order is found to be inconsistent with a federal\r\nstatute or federal agency determination.  See 28 U.S.C.  1342(1);\r\nNew Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 782 F.2d 1236,\r\n1242 (5th Cir. 1986), modified in part, 798 F.2d 858, cert. denied,\r\n481 U.S. 1023 (1987); see also Aluminum Co. of America v. Utilities\r\nComm'n, 713 F.2d 1024, 1028 (4th Cir. 1983).\r\nConnecticut Valley is making just such a FERC preemption\r\nargument in this case.  Such a claim is not barred by the Johnson\r\nAct.  See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96 n.14\r\n(1983); New Orleans Pub. Serv., 782 F.2d at 1242.  This is also\r\ntrue of Connecticut Valley's other claim on the merits--that the\r\ndistrict court's earlier injunction against the Final Plan required\r\nthe Commission to allow the increase; although we have found no\r\ncase in point, it is unlikely that Congress intended that\r\nenforcement of a federal court injunction be barred by the Johnson\r\nAct. \r\nThe Commission's other threshold arguments are no more\r\npersuasive.  Even if the modified Final Plan were itself too\r\ninchoate to make \"ripe\" a request to enjoin it--and we hold\r\notherwise in our companion decision--the Commission's action in\r\nrejecting the Connecticut Valley rate increase is a formal agency\r\nrate action that has an immediate effect.  See generally Abbott\r\nLabs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149-51 (1967).  Of course, the\r\npossibility that it might be corrected by the Commission itself or\r\nby a state court might raise exhaustion concerns; but those are not\r\nvery powerful in the face of a claim that the rejection violates\r\nFERC authority, and that it is going to cause immediate irreparable\r\ninjury to the utility. Cf. Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467,\r\n483-84 (1986); Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 330-31 (1976).\r\nThe Commission also argues inventively that its December\r\n31, 1997, order is akin to the so-called suspension orders by which\r\nfederal agencies, under statutes authorizing this step, temporarily\r\ndelay (\"suspend\") a carrier or utility increase rate while\r\ninvestigating it.  E.g., 16 U.S.C.  824d(e).  As a matter of\r\nfederal administrative law, a refusal by the regulatory agency to\r\nsuspend rates under these statutes is usually (but not always)\r\ndeemed unreviewable because the order is an interim measure and the\r\nshipper or customer is usually made whole automatically if the rate\r\nincrease is ultimately found unjustified.\r\nThe present situation is in no way akin to these cases. \r\nAlthough the Commission's December 31, 1997, order did suspend the\r\ntariffs, it also made a formal determination to disallow the\r\nincrease on the ground that it was imprudent for Connecticut Valley\r\nto continue its contract.  See Order No. 22,815.  This disallowance\r\nwas final and is not akin to a mere suspension; the further\r\ninvestigation contemplated by the Commission's order was directed\r\nnot to possible approval of the increase but to the possibility\r\nthat a further reduction might be ordered.\r\nIn its last threshold objection, the Commission asserts\r\nthat the district court erred in considering the utilities' request\r\nas a \"related\" case to be heard by the same judge considering the\r\noriginal action brought by PSNH.  It is sufficient to say that the\r\ntwo matters involve a substantial overlap, amply qualifying for\r\nconsolidation under the terms of Local Rule 42.1(a) &amp; (c) of the\r\nNew Hampshire District Court.  This is so even though we ultimately\r\nconclude that the December 31, 1997, order is not to be treated as\r\nan implementation of the Final Plan.\r\nWe turn now to the merits, or, more precisely, the\r\nrequirement that the party seeking injunctive relief show that it\r\nis likely to prevail on the merits.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick,\r\nInc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996).  The first\r\nground urged by the utilities in their brief is that the April 9,\r\n1998, injunction is justified as an extension of the earlier\r\ninjunctive relief secured by the PSNH against the Final Plan.  The\r\ndistrict court itself, at the April 3, 1998, hearing, described the\r\nCommission's December 31, 1997, order as an \"end run\" around the\r\nearlier injunction.\r\nIt is true that the Commission discussed the imprudence\r\nof the Connecticut Valley-Central Vermont contract in its order\r\nimplementing the Final Plan; and both the December 31, 1997, order\r\nand the Final Plan reflect a common desire to hold down customer\r\nrates.  Nevertheless, the disallowance of the specific increase\r\ndoes not purport to rest on the Final Plan and is expressed as an\r\nexercise of conventional cost-based rate regulation--whether or not\r\na lawful exercise is another matter.  Thus, the injunction of April\r\n9, 1997, requiring the rate increase, cannot be defended as\r\nenforcing the earlier injunction against the Final Plan.\r\nWhat would support a preliminary injunction requiring the\r\nrate increase is a determination that the December 31, 1997, order\r\nwould itself likely be found to violate  the Federal Power Act or\r\notherwise would contravene FERC's authority.  The two utilities\r\nhave argued forcefully that the December 31, 1997, order does\r\nviolate federal law in two respects: by disregarding FERC's\r\nauthority to determine what is a just and reasonable wholesale rate\r\nand by interfering with FERC's authority to impose a termination\r\ncharge on Connecticut Valley.\r\nThe first of these two FERC-preemption arguments is\r\nexpressed by the two utilities as a claim that the Commission has\r\n\"violated the filed-rate doctrine\" in its December 31, 1997, order\r\nrejecting the rate increase.  The \"filed rate\" locution is commonly\r\nused in the case law (and in more than one way), but it is merely\r\na shorthand as likely to confuse as to assist analysis.  Indeed,\r\nthe label is somewhat misleading, since the doctrine on which the\r\nutilities here rely is not limited to rates.\r\nRather, the Supreme Court has ruled that where the FERC\r\nhas lawfully determined a rate, allocation, or other matter, a\r\nstate commission cannot take action that contradicts that federal\r\ndetermination.  And even without explicit federal approval of a\r\nrate, the Court has treated a rate reflected in a FERC tariff as\r\nsetting a rate level binding on a state commission in regulating\r\nthe costs of the purchasing utility.  See Mississippi Power &amp; Light\r\nCo. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 373-74 (1988);\r\nNantahala Power &amp; Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953, 962-66\r\n(1986); cf. Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv.\r\nCo., 341 U.S. 246, 251-52 (1951).\r\nThe difficulty for Connecticut Valley is that the \r\nCommission did not disallow its retail rate increase on the ground\r\nthat the wholesale rates charged by Central Vermont were unjust or\r\nunreasonable.  Rather, the Commission found that it is imprudent\r\nfor Connecticut Valley to continue purchasing from Central Vermont\r\nsince lower cost sources of energy are allegedly available--even if\r\nCentral Vermont's wholesale rate might be just and reasonable in\r\nthe conventional (regulatory) sense that that rate merely covers\r\nCentral Vermont's own acquisition costs.  \r\nThe Supreme Court has never squarely decided the question\r\nof whether imprudence is an escape hatch from the Commission's\r\notherwise existing obligation to respect FERC's authority to\r\ndetermine the just and reasonable rate.  But the Court has twice\r\nsaid that it would assume arguendo that such escape hatch existed;\r\nthe Third Circuit has so held; and FERC has concurred, citing prior\r\ncases of its own.  See Mississippi Power &amp; Light, 487 U.S. at 373-\r\n74; Nantahala Power &amp; Light, 476 U.S. at 972; Kentucky W. Va. Gas\r\nCo. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 837 F.2d 600, 609 (3d Cir.\r\n1988); Palisades Generating Co., 48 FERC  61,144, at 61,574 and\r\nn.10 (1989).  We agree with FERC.\r\nConnecticut Valley says that the present situation is\r\ndifferent because it is required to purchase from Central Vermont\r\nunder a contract filed with FERC itself.  It is arguable that the\r\nCommission could not disregard a long-term commitment by\r\nConnecticut Valley if FERC had blessed a contract that contained\r\nsuch a commitment, cf. Mississippi Power &amp; Light, 487 U.S. at 373-\r\n74; Nantahala Power &amp; Light, 476 U.S. at 972; but here the contract\r\nfiled with FERC itself contains a provision allowing Connecticut\r\nValley to extract itself on one year's notice.\r\nIn the district court, the utilities made an alternative\r\nargument for preemption, namely, that Central Vermont is seeking to\r\nimpose some kind of an exit fee in proceedings before FERC, and the\r\nCommission's action in this case is trespassing on FERC's authority\r\nto impose such a fee.  As noted, FERC has in fact indicated that it\r\nmay entertain such a proposal, see 82 F.E.R.C. at 61,237, at 1998\r\nWL 111732 (F.E.R.C.), at *1, and no doubt termination without an\r\nexit fee could leave Central Vermont customers to bear the full\r\nbrunt of the higher cost power.  But nothing in the state\r\ncommission's December 31, 1997, order precludes FERC from imposing\r\nsuch a fee.\r\nIn sum, Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont have not\r\nshown likelihood of success on the merits, or even of fair ground\r\nfor further litigation, in claiming that the December 31, 1997,\r\norder violates federal law insofar as it disallows the increase\r\nsought.  That disallowance is the only issue on appeal in this\r\ncase; if reductions of Connecticut Valley rates below existing\r\nlevels are ordered, it will be time enough to consider whether they\r\nare precluded by the district court's injunction against the Final\r\nPlan or on other grounds.\r\nIf taken at face value, the claims of irreparable injury\r\nmade by Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont are serious.  The\r\nCommission's brief merely argues that Connecticut Valley had\r\nalternative means of relief--to appeal the Commission's orders to\r\nthe state supreme court and to collect the higher rate pending\r\nappeal, subject to the filing of a bond.  The utilities say that\r\nthese options will not work.  In all events irreparable injury is\r\nnot itself a basis for injunction, absent some claim likely to\r\nsucceed on the merits in the federal court action.\r\nIf we have misapprehended Connecticut Valley's arguments\r\non the merits, it is free to petition for reconsideration; and a\r\ntimely petition for reconsideration will stay the mandate--and thus\r\nmaintain the April 12, 1998, injunction in effect until the\r\npetition is disposed of.  Fed. R. App. P. 41(a).  However, if\r\nConnecticut Valley does face the kind of calamity it predicts, it\r\nwould be wise to consider at once its alternative remedies at FERC\r\nor through discussion with the Commission.\r\nAccordingly, the April 12, 1998, injunction is vacated. \r\nThe Commission is entitled, once the mandate becomes effective, to\r\nrequire Connecticut Valley to reduce rates back to the level\r\nprevailing on December 31, 1997.\r\nIt is so ordered.   \n",

In timing and background facts, there is considerable overlap between this decision and our companion decision today in No. 98-1764, which arises out of the same district court proceeding.  The reader's familiarity with that decision is assumed, but additional background is required to understand the events and legal issues peculiar to Connecticut Valley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut Valley is an electric utility that provides retail service to end-user customers in certain New Hampshire communities.  Its rates are set forth in a retail tariff subject to the authority of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (\"the Commission\").  R.S.A. &#167; 378:7 (1997);  see Legislative Util.  Consumers' Council v. Public Serv.  Co., 119 N.H. 332, 402 A.2d 626, 631 (N.H.1979).  The company does not generate any electric power;  it is part of an integrated public utility system and purchases power from others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 76 percent of the power purchased by Connecticut Valley is acquired from its parent company, Central Vermont Public Service Company (\"Central Vermont\").  Rates and contracts for wholesale transactions in electric power, assuming an interstate nexus, are normally subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") under the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 824, 824d (1994).  FERC has accepted for filing the tariffs and contract under which Central Vermont supplies power to Connecticut Valley.  See Appeal of Sinclair Mach. Prods., Inc., 126 N.H. 822, 498 A.2d 696, 698-99 (N.H.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In supplying Connecticut Valley and its own retail customers in Vermont, Central Vermont purchases about 35 to 40 percent of its power under a long-term supply contract with Hydro Quebec.  Contracts of this kind provide price and supply protection (the Hydro Quebec contract runs until 2016), but also commit the purchaser to buy even if market conditions change.  Apparently, the Hydro Quebec contract price now exceeds wholesale electricity prices available in New England, so Connecticut Valley could lower its power costs in the short run if it ceased to buy from Central Vermont.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existing contract between Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont permits Connecticut Valley to terminate its purchase contract on short notice;  oversimplifying slightly, the notice period is one year.  Although Connecticut Valley says that the Commission initially encouraged its contract with Central Vermont, the Commission has recently criticized the purchases, saying that the contract was being continued for the benefit of Central Vermont and that the purchases could be regarded as imprudent from Connecticut Valley's standpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1997, when adopting the Final Plan discussed in our companion decision, the Commission's implementing order as to Connecticut Valley addressed the issue directly.  See Order No. 22,509.  The Commission's order said that in calculating the costs that Connecticut Valley would be able to recover through its own retail rates, the Commission would disallow the cost of power acquired from Central Vermont to the extent that it exceeded the cost of power generally available at wholesale prices in Connecticut and in New Hampshire.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central Vermont responded in June 1997 by initiating a proceeding before FERC to terminate the contract with Connecticut Valley;  the request for termination, however, was contingent on FERC's approval of a termination charge by which Central Vermont could effectively impose upon Connecticut Valley a share of the \"loss\" resulting from the difference between the long-term Hydro Quebec rate and the lesser market rate now available.  FERC rejected the Central Vermont proposal, but invited Central Vermont to return to FERC with a differently structured plan for making Connecticut Valley share in some measure in whatever loss resulted from termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next event leading to the present appeal occurred in Fall 1997, when Connecticut Valley submitted tariff changes to the Commission to secure an increase in Connecticut Valley's own retail rates.  The purpose of the proposed increase, sought to be made effective on January 1, 1998, was simply to pass through to customers increases in Central Vermont's wholesale rate under its FERC tariff.  It appears that the rate charged to Connecticut Valley depended on Central Vermont's own costs of generating and acquiring power, which vary from year to year.  The Commission had previously allowed Connecticut Valley to make corresponding increases in its retail rates without much fuss or delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This time the story was different.  The Commission announced on December 31, 1997, that it would not allow Connecticut Valley to increase its retail rates to take account of the increase in Central Vermont's wholesale rate charged to Connecticut Valley.  See Order No. 22,815.  The Commission's order acknowledged that this would cause a shortfall for Connecticut Valley, but it said that the utility should earlier have terminated its contract with Central Vermont.  The Commission said it would later determine what prudently acquired wholesale power should cost Connecticut Valley, creating the threat of an actual decrease in Connecticut Valley's retail rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 1998, Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont filed a motion in the district court in the pending litigation brought by Public Service Company of New Hampshire (\"PSNH\"), described in our companion opinion.  Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont, along with other utilities in New Hampshire, had already intervened in that case.  See Public Serv.  Co. v. Patch, 173 F.R.D. 17 (D.N.H.1997).  In their motion, Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont sought a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction to require the Commission to put into effect the rate increases that the Commission had disallowed in December 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the TRO motion, the two utilities argued that the Commission's rejection of the rate increases effectively violated the injunction against the Final Plan previously obtained by PSNH, and further argued that, independent of the district court's prior orders, the Commission's December 31, 1997, order was \"preempted\" by FERC's exclusive jurisdiction over the wholesale rate contract and over Central Vermont's pending application to modify the contract to impose an exit fee.  The motion was also accompanied by affidavits of the two utilities' vice president and the companies' independent auditor attesting to the severe economic harm, including possible bankruptcy of Connecticut Valley, threatened by the Commission's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1998, the Commission granted rehearing in the rate proceeding and allowed Connecticut Valley to file additional testimony, but the Commission did not authorize the retail rate increases sought by the utility.  In February 1998, the Commission filed papers in the district court opposing the TRO and disputing jurisdiction, the merits, and the predictions of irreparable injury.  Further materials were filed by Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont, and on April 3, 1998, the district court held a hearing on the request for a TRO and preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, there were extensive arguments and counsel brought the district court up to date as to intervening developments.  The court then took a brief recess and returned to make extensive oral rulings, generally favorable to Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont.  Describing the Commission's conduct as a violation of the court's earlier grant of injunctive relief against the Final Plan, the court directed counsel for the utilities to prepare a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1997, the district court entered a formal preliminary injunction adopting its oral rulings as findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The injunction specifically directed the Commission to allow Connecticut Valley to recover through retail rates the full cost of wholesale power obtained from Central Vermont pursuant to the latter's FERC tariffs.  It appears that since that time--possibly retroactively to January 1, 1998--Connecticut Valley has been obtaining the increased rates that it sought in its Fall 1997 filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission has now appealed from the April 9, 1998, injunction.  Its appeal raises threshold objections to the grant of the injunction, it denies that the utilities are likely to prevail on the merits, and it treats very briefly the issue of irreparable injury.  We consider the arguments in the same order.  The familiar requirements for a preliminary injunction and the standards for appellate review are set forth in our companion decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the strictest limit on the district court's jurisdiction is the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1342 (1994).  This statute, described more fully in our companion decision, prohibits district court injunctions against state rate orders under certain circumstances.  But one of the circumstances in which the Johnson Act does not bar injunction against a state rate order is where the order is found to be inconsistent with a federal statute or federal agency determination.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1342(1);  New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 782 F.2d 1236, 1242 (5th Cir.1986), modified in part, 798 F.2d 858, cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1023, 107 S.Ct. 1910, 95 L.Ed.2d 515 (1987);  see also Aluminum Co. of America v. Utilities Comm'n, 713 F.2d 1024, 1028 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut Valley is making just such a FERC preemption argument in this case.  Such a claim is not barred by the Johnson Act.  See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96 n. 14, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983);  New Orleans Pub. Serv., 782 F.2d at 1242.   This is also true of Connecticut Valley's other claim on the merits--that the district court's earlier injunction against the Final Plan required the Commission to allow the increase;  although we have found no case in point, it is unlikely that Congress intended that enforcement of a federal court injunction be barred by the Johnson Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's other threshold arguments are no more persuasive.  Even if the modified Final Plan were itself too inchoate to make \"ripe\" a request to enjoin it--and we hold otherwise in our companion decision--the Commission's action in rejecting the Connecticut Valley rate increase is a formal agency rate action that has an immediate effect.  See generally Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149-51, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).  Of course, the possibility that it might be corrected by the Commission itself or by a state court might raise exhaustion concerns;  but those are not very powerful in the face of a claim that the rejection violates FERC authority, and that it is going to cause immediate irreparable injury to the utility.  Cf. Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467, 483-84, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986);  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 330-31, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission also argues inventively that its December 31, 1997, order is akin to the so-called suspension orders by which federal agencies, under statutes authorizing this step, temporarily delay (\"suspend\") a carrier or utility increase rate while investigating it.  E.g., 16 U.S.C. &#167; 824d(e).  As a matter of federal administrative law, a refusal by the regulatory agency to suspend rates under these statutes is usually (but not always) deemed unreviewable because the order is an interim measure and the shipper or customer is usually made whole automatically if the rate increase is ultimately found unjustified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present situation is in no way akin to these cases.  Although the Commission's December 31, 1997, order did suspend the tariffs, it also made a formal determination to disallow the increase on the ground that it was imprudent for Connecticut Valley to continue its contract.  See Order No. 22,815.  This disallowance was final and is not akin to a mere suspension;  the further investigation contemplated by the Commission's order was directed not to possible approval of the increase but to the possibility that a further reduction might be ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its last threshold objection, the Commission asserts that the district court erred in considering the utilities' request as a \"related\" case to be heard by the same judge considering the original action brought by PSNH.  It is sufficient to say that the two matters involve a substantial overlap, amply qualifying for consolidation under the terms of Local Rule 42.1(a) &amp; (c) of the New Hampshire District Court.  This is so even though we ultimately conclude that the December 31, 1997, order is not to be treated as an implementation of the Final Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the merits, or, more precisely, the requirement that the party seeking injunctive relief show that it is likely to prevail on the merits.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1996).  The first ground urged by the utilities in their brief is that the April 9, 1998, injunction is justified as an extension of the earlier injunctive relief secured by the PSNH against the Final Plan.  The district court itself, at the April 3, 1998, hearing, described the Commission's December 31, 1997, order as an \"end run\" around the earlier injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Commission discussed the imprudence of the Connecticut Valley-Central Vermont contract in its order implementing the Final Plan;  and both the December 31, 1997, order and the Final Plan reflect a common desire to hold down customer rates.  Nevertheless, the disallowance of the specific increase does not purport to rest on the Final Plan and is expressed as an exercise of conventional cost-based rate regulation--whether or not a lawful exercise is another matter.  Thus, the injunction of April 9, 1997, requiring the rate increase, cannot be defended as enforcing the earlier injunction against the Final Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What would support a preliminary injunction requiring the rate increase is a determination that the December 31, 1997, order would itself likely be found to violate the Federal Power Act or otherwise would contravene FERC's authority.  The two utilities have argued forcefully that the December 31, 1997, order does violate federal law in two respects:  by disregarding FERC's authority to determine what is a just and reasonable wholesale rate and by interfering with FERC's authority to impose a termination charge on Connecticut Valley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these two FERC-preemption arguments is expressed by the two utilities as a claim that the Commission has \"violated the filed-rate doctrine\" in its December 31, 1997, order rejecting the rate increase.  The \"filed rate\" locution is commonly used in the case law (and in more than one way), but it is merely a shorthand as likely to confuse as to assist analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Indeed, the label is somewhat misleading, since the doctrine on which the utilities here rely is not limited to rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the Supreme Court has ruled that where the FERC has lawfully determined a rate, allocation, or other matter, a state commission cannot take action that contradicts that federal determination.  And even without explicit federal approval of a rate, the Court has treated a rate reflected in a FERC tariff as setting a rate level binding on a state commission in regulating the costs of the purchasing utility.  See Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 373-74, 108 S.Ct. 2428, 101 L.Ed.2d 322 (1988);  Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953, 962-66, 106 S.Ct. 2349, 90 L.Ed.2d 943 (1986);  cf. Montana-Dakota Utils.  Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv.  Co., 341 U.S. 246, 251-52, 71 S.Ct. 692, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty for Connecticut Valley is that the Commission did not disallow its retail rate increase on the ground that the wholesale rates charged by Central Vermont were unjust or unreasonable.  Rather, the Commission found that it is imprudent for Connecticut Valley to continue purchasing from Central Vermont since lower cost sources of energy are allegedly available--even if Central Vermont's wholesale rate might be just and reasonable in the conventional (regulatory) sense that that rate merely covers Central Vermont's own acquisition costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has never squarely decided the question of whether imprudence is an escape hatch from the Commission's otherwise existing obligation to respect FERC's authority to determine the just and reasonable rate.  But the Court has twice said that it would assume arguendo that such escape hatch existed;  the Third Circuit has so held;  and FERC has concurred, citing prior cases of its own.  See Mississippi Power &amp; Light, 487 U.S. at 373-74, 108 S.Ct. 2428;  Nantahala Power &amp; Light, 476 U.S. at 972, 106 S.Ct. 2349;  Kentucky W. Va.  Gas Co. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util.  Comm'n, 837 F.2d 600, 609 (3d Cir.1988);  Palisades Generating Co., 48 FERC p 61,144, at 61,574 and n. 10, 1989 WL 262105 (1989).   We agree with FERC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut Valley says that the present situation is different because it is required to purchase from Central Vermont under a contract filed with FERC itself.  It is arguable that the Commission could not disregard a long-term commitment by Connecticut Valley if FERC had blessed a contract that contained such a commitment, cf. Mississippi Power &amp; Light, 487 U.S. at 373-74, 108 S.Ct. 2428;  Nantahala Power &amp; Light, 476 U.S. at 972, 106 S.Ct. 2349;  but here the contract filed with FERC itself contains a provision allowing Connecticut Valley to extract itself on one year's notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the utilities made an alternative argument for preemption, namely, that Central Vermont is seeking to impose some kind of an exit fee in proceedings before FERC, and the Commission's action in this case is trespassing on FERC's authority to impose such a fee.  As noted, FERC has in fact indicated that it may entertain such a proposal, see 82 F.E.R.C. at p 61,237, at 1998 WL 111732 (F.E.R.C.), at * 1, and no doubt termination without an exit fee could leave Central Vermont customers to bear the full brunt of the higher cost power.  But nothing in the state commission's December 31, 1997, order precludes FERC from imposing such a fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont have not shown likelihood of success on the merits, or even of fair ground for further litigation, in claiming that the December 31, 1997, order violates federal law insofar as it disallows the increase sought.  That disallowance is the only issue on appeal in this case;  if reductions of Connecticut Valley rates below existing levels are ordered, it will be time enough to consider whether they are precluded by the district court's injunction against the Final Plan or on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If taken at face value, the claims of irreparable injury made by Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont are serious.  The Commission's brief merely argues that Connecticut Valley had alternative means of relief--to appeal the Commission's orders to the state supreme court and to collect the higher rate pending appeal, subject to the filing of a bond.  The utilities say that these options will not work.  In all events irreparable injury is not itself a basis for injunction, absent some claim likely to succeed on the merits in the federal court action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we have misapprehended Connecticut Valley's arguments on the merits, it is free to petition for reconsideration;  and a timely petition for reconsideration will stay the mandate--and thus maintain the April 12, 1998, injunction in effect until the petition is disposed of.  Fed. R.App. P. 41(a).  However, if Connecticut Valley does face the kind of calamity it predicts, it would be wise to consider at once its alternative remedies at FERC or through discussion with the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the April 12, 1998, injunction is vacated.   The Commission is entitled, once the mandate becomes effective, to require Connecticut Valley to reduce rates back to the level prevailing on December 31, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Central Vermont Pub.

It is far from clear that the same doctrine automatically prohibits the carrier or utility from seeking review of an order that does suspend its rate increase tariff, although the agency's broad discretion in imposing this time-limited suspension would ordinarily defeat judicial review</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The phrase initially referred to the proposition that a shipper was bound to pay the tariff rate on file with the agency regardless of private understandings with the carrier, unless and until that rate was found to be unlawful.

In timing and background facts, there is considerable overlap between this decision and our companion decision today in No. 98-1764, which arises out of the same district court proceeding.  The reader's familiarity with that decision is assumed, but additional background is required to understand the events and legal issues peculiar to Connecticut Valley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Connecticut Valley is an electric utility that provides retail service to end-user customers in certain New Hampshire communities.  Its rates are set forth in a retail tariff subject to the authority of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (\"the Commission\").  R.S.A. &#167; 378:7 (1997);  see Legislative Util.  Consumers' Council v. Public Serv.  Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></span>, 631 (N.H.1979).  The company does not generate any electric power;  it is part of an integrated public utility system and purchases power from others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 76 percent of the power purchased by Connecticut Valley is acquired from its parent company, Central Vermont Public Service Company (\"Central Vermont\").  Rates and contracts for wholesale transactions in electric power, assuming an interstate nexus, are normally subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") under the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 824, 824d (1994).  FERC has accepted for filing the tariffs and contract under which Central Vermont supplies power to Connecticut Valley.  See Appeal of Sinclair Mach. Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></span>, 698-99 (N.H.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In supplying Connecticut Valley and its own retail customers in Vermont, Central Vermont purchases about 35 to 40 percent of its power under a long-term supply contract with Hydro Quebec.  Contracts of this kind provide price and supply protection (the Hydro Quebec contract runs until 2016), but also commit the purchaser to buy even if market conditions change.  Apparently, the Hydro Quebec contract price now exceeds wholesale electricity prices available in New England, so Connecticut Valley could lower its power costs in the short run if it ceased to buy from Central Vermont.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existing contract between Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont permits Connecticut Valley to terminate its purchase contract on short notice;  oversimplifying slightly, the notice period is one year.  Although Connecticut Valley says that the Commission initially encouraged its contract with Central Vermont, the Commission has recently criticized the purchases, saying that the contract was being continued for the benefit of Central Vermont and that the purchases could be regarded as imprudent from Connecticut Valley's standpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1997, when adopting the Final Plan discussed in our companion decision, the Commission's implementing order as to Connecticut Valley addressed the issue directly.  See Order No. 22,509.  The Commission's order said that in calculating the costs that Connecticut Valley would be able to recover through its own retail rates, the Commission would disallow the cost of power acquired from Central Vermont to the extent that it exceeded the cost of power generally available at wholesale prices in Connecticut and in New Hampshire.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central Vermont responded in June 1997 by initiating a proceeding before FERC to terminate the contract with Connecticut Valley;  the request for termination, however, was contingent on FERC's approval of a termination charge by which Central Vermont could effectively impose upon Connecticut Valley a share of the \"loss\" resulting from the difference between the long-term Hydro Quebec rate and the lesser market rate now available.  FERC rejected the Central Vermont proposal, but invited Central Vermont to return to FERC with a differently structured plan for making Connecticut Valley share in some measure in whatever loss resulted from termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next event leading to the present appeal occurred in Fall 1997, when Connecticut Valley submitted tariff changes to the Commission to secure an increase in Connecticut Valley's own retail rates.  The purpose of the proposed increase, sought to be made effective on January 1, 1998, was simply to pass through to customers increases in Central Vermont's wholesale rate under its FERC tariff.  It appears that the rate charged to Connecticut Valley depended on Central Vermont's own costs of generating and acquiring power, which vary from year to year.  The Commission had previously allowed Connecticut Valley to make corresponding increases in its retail rates without much fuss or delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This time the story was different.  The Commission announced on December 31, 1997, that it would not allow Connecticut Valley to increase its retail rates to take account of the increase in Central Vermont's wholesale rate charged to Connecticut Valley.  See Order No. 22,815.  The Commission's order acknowledged that this would cause a shortfall for Connecticut Valley, but it said that the utility should earlier have terminated its contract with Central Vermont.  The Commission said it would later determine what prudently acquired wholesale power should cost Connecticut Valley, creating the threat of an actual decrease in Connecticut Valley's retail rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 1998, Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont filed a motion in the district court in the pending litigation brought by Public Service Company of New Hampshire (\"PSNH\"), described in our companion opinion.  Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont, along with other utilities in New Hampshire, had already intervened in that case.  See Public Serv.  Co. v. Patch, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span> (D.N.H.1997).  In their motion, Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont sought a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction to require the Commission to put into effect the rate increases that the Commission had disallowed in December 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the TRO motion, the two utilities argued that the Commission's rejection of the rate increases effectively violated the injunction against the Final Plan previously obtained by PSNH, and further argued that, independent of the district court's prior orders, the Commission's December 31, 1997, order was \"preempted\" by FERC's exclusive jurisdiction over the wholesale rate contract and over Central Vermont's pending application to modify the contract to impose an exit fee.  The motion was also accompanied by affidavits of the two utilities' vice president and the companies' independent auditor attesting to the severe economic harm, including possible bankruptcy of Connecticut Valley, threatened by the Commission's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 20, 1998, the Commission granted rehearing in the rate proceeding and allowed Connecticut Valley to file additional testimony, but the Commission did not authorize the retail rate increases sought by the utility.  In February 1998, the Commission filed papers in the district court opposing the TRO and disputing jurisdiction, the merits, and the predictions of irreparable injury.  Further materials were filed by Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont, and on April 3, 1998, the district court held a hearing on the request for a TRO and preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, there were extensive arguments and counsel brought the district court up to date as to intervening developments.  The court then took a brief recess and returned to make extensive oral rulings, generally favorable to Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont.  Describing the Commission's conduct as a violation of the court's earlier grant of injunctive relief against the Final Plan, the court directed counsel for the utilities to prepare a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1997, the district court entered a formal preliminary injunction adopting its oral rulings as findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The injunction specifically directed the Commission to allow Connecticut Valley to recover through retail rates the full cost of wholesale power obtained from Central Vermont pursuant to the latter's FERC tariffs.  It appears that since that time--possibly retroactively to January 1, 1998--Connecticut Valley has been obtaining the increased rates that it sought in its Fall 1997 filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission has now appealed from the April 9, 1998, injunction.  Its appeal raises threshold objections to the grant of the injunction, it denies that the utilities are likely to prevail on the merits, and it treats very briefly the issue of irreparable injury.  We consider the arguments in the same order.  The familiar requirements for a preliminary injunction and the standards for appellate review are set forth in our companion decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the strictest limit on the district court's jurisdiction is the Johnson Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1342 (1994).  This statute, described more fully in our companion decision, prohibits district court injunctions against state rate orders under certain circumstances.  But one of the circumstances in which the Johnson Act does not bar injunction against a state rate order is where the order is found to be inconsistent with a federal statute or federal agency determination.

Such a claim is not barred by the Johnson Act.  See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110993\"><a href=\"/opinion/110993/shaw-v-delta-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 96 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110993\"><a href=\"/opinion/110993/shaw-v-delta-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (1983);  New Orleans Pub. Serv., 782 F.2d at 1242.   This is also true of Connecticut Valley's other claim on the merits--that the district court's earlier injunction against the Final Plan required the Commission to allow the increase;  although we have found no case in point, it is unlikely that Congress intended that enforcement of a federal court injunction be barred by the Johnson Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's other threshold arguments are no more persuasive.  Even if the modified Final Plan were itself too inchoate to make \"ripe\" a request to enjoin it--and we hold otherwise in our companion decision--the Commission's action in rejecting the Connecticut Valley rate increase is a formal agency rate action that has an immediate effect.  See generally Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 149-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span> (1967).  Of course, the possibility that it might be corrected by the Commission itself or by a state court might raise exhaustion concerns;  but those are not very powerful in the face of a claim that the rejection violates FERC authority, and that it is going to cause immediate irreparable injury to the utility.

E.g., 16 U.S.C. &#167; 824d(e).  As a matter of federal administrative law, a refusal by the regulatory agency to suspend rates under these statutes is usually (but not always) deemed unreviewable because the order is an interim measure and the shipper or customer is usually made whole automatically if the rate increase is ultimately found unjustified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present situation is in no way akin to these cases.  Although the Commission's December 31, 1997, order did suspend the tariffs, it also made a formal determination to disallow the increase on the ground that it was imprudent for Connecticut Valley to continue its contract.  See Order No. 22,815.  This disallowance was final and is not akin to a mere suspension;  the further investigation contemplated by the Commission's order was directed not to possible approval of the increase but to the possibility that a further reduction might be ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its last threshold objection, the Commission asserts that the district court erred in considering the utilities' request as a \"related\" case to be heard by the same judge considering the original action brought by PSNH.  It is sufficient to say that the two matters involve a substantial overlap, amply qualifying for consolidation under the terms of Local Rule 42.1(a) &amp; (c) of the New Hampshire District Court.  This is so even though we ultimately conclude that the December 31, 1997, order is not to be treated as an implementation of the Final Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the merits, or, more precisely, the requirement that the party seeking injunctive relief show that it is likely to prevail on the merits.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1996).  The first ground urged by the utilities in their brief is that the April 9, 1998, injunction is justified as an extension of the earlier injunctive relief secured by the PSNH against the Final Plan.  The district court itself, at the April 3, 1998, hearing, described the Commission's December 31, 1997, order as an \"end run\" around the earlier injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Commission discussed the imprudence of the Connecticut Valley-Central Vermont contract in its order implementing the Final Plan;  and both the December 31, 1997, order and the Final Plan reflect a common desire to hold down customer rates.  Nevertheless, the disallowance of the specific increase does not purport to rest on the Final Plan and is expressed as an exercise of conventional cost-based rate regulation--whether or not a lawful exercise is another matter.  Thus, the injunction of April 9, 1997, requiring the rate increase, cannot be defended as enforcing the earlier injunction against the Final Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What would support a preliminary injunction requiring the rate increase is a determination that the December 31, 1997, order would itself likely be found to violate the Federal Power Act or otherwise would contravene FERC's authority.  The two utilities have argued forcefully that the December 31, 1997, order does violate federal law in two respects:  by disregarding FERC's authority to determine what is a just and reasonable wholesale rate and by interfering with FERC's authority to impose a termination charge on Connecticut Valley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these two FERC-preemption arguments is expressed by the two utilities as a claim that the Commission has \"violated the filed-rate doctrine\" in its December 31, 1997, order rejecting the rate increase.  The \"filed rate\" locution is commonly used in the case law (and in more than one way), but it is merely a shorthand as likely to confuse as to assist analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Indeed, the label is somewhat misleading, since the doctrine on which the utilities here rely is not limited to rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the Supreme Court has ruled that where the FERC has lawfully determined a rate, allocation, or other matter, a state commission cannot take action that contradicts that federal determination.  And even without explicit federal approval of a rate, the Court has treated a rate reflected in a FERC tariff as setting a rate level binding on a state commission in regulating the costs of the purchasing utility.

Rather, the Commission found that it is imprudent for Connecticut Valley to continue purchasing from Central Vermont since lower cost sources of energy are allegedly available--even if Central Vermont's wholesale rate might be just and reasonable in the conventional (regulatory) sense that that rate merely covers Central Vermont's own acquisition costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has never squarely decided the question of whether imprudence is an escape hatch from the Commission's otherwise existing obligation to respect FERC's authority to determine the just and reasonable rate.  But the Court has twice said that it would assume arguendo that such escape hatch existed;  the Third Circuit has so held;  and FERC has concurred, citing prior cases of its own.

It is arguable that the Commission could not disregard a long-term commitment by Connecticut Valley if FERC had blessed a contract that contained such a commitment, cf. Mississippi Power &amp; Light, 487 U.S. at 373-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112130\"><a href=\"/opinion/112130/mississippi-power-light-co-v-mississippi-ex-rel-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2349</span></a></span>;  but here the contract filed with FERC itself contains a provision allowing Connecticut Valley to extract itself on one year's notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the utilities made an alternative argument for preemption, namely, that Central Vermont is seeking to impose some kind of an exit fee in proceedings before FERC, and the Commission's action in this case is trespassing on FERC's authority to impose such a fee.  As noted, FERC has in fact indicated that it may entertain such a proposal, see 82 F.E.R.C. at p 61,237, at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">111732</span></span> (F.E.R.C.), at * 1, and no doubt termination without an exit fee could leave Central Vermont customers to bear the full brunt of the higher cost power.  But nothing in the state commission's December 31, 1997, order precludes FERC from imposing such a fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont have not shown likelihood of success on the merits, or even of fair ground for further litigation, in claiming that the December 31, 1997, order violates federal law insofar as it disallows the increase sought.  That disallowance is the only issue on appeal in this case;  if reductions of Connecticut Valley rates below existing levels are ordered, it will be time enough to consider whether they are precluded by the district court's injunction against the Final Plan or on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If taken at face value, the claims of irreparable injury made by Connecticut Valley and Central Vermont are serious.  The Commission's brief merely argues that Connecticut Valley had alternative means of relief--to appeal the Commission's orders to the state supreme court and to collect the higher rate pending appeal, subject to the filing of a bond.  The utilities say that these options will not work.  In all events irreparable injury is not itself a basis for injunction, absent some claim likely to succeed on the merits in the federal court action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we have misapprehended Connecticut Valley's arguments on the merits, it is free to petition for reconsideration;  and a timely petition for reconsideration will stay the mandate--and thus maintain the April 12, 1998, injunction in effect until the petition is disposed of.  Fed. R.App. P. 41(a).  However, if Connecticut Valley does face the kind of calamity it predicts, it would be wise to consider at once its alternative remedies at FERC or through discussion with the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the April 12, 1998, injunction is vacated.   The Commission is entitled, once the mandate becomes effective, to require Connecticut Valley to reduce rates back to the level prevailing on December 31, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Central Vermont Pub.
