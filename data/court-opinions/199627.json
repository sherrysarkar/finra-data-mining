Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jean Baptiste-Calixce on brief pro se.\n     Gretchen Leah Witt, United States Attorney, and Peter E.\nPapps, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        September 28, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam. These consolidated appeals by Jean\n\nBaptiste-Calixce are from the district court’s denial of his\n\npost-appeal motions for relief from his 168-month prison\n\nsentence.    In 1998, Calixce was convicted following a jury\n\ntrial of possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and\n\ncocaine base.    The indictment referenced 21 U.S.C. § 841(a),\n\nbut not § 841(b), and did not refer to any specific drug\n\nquantity.    At sentencing, the court adopted the probation\n\ndepartment’s    finding    regarding    drug   quantity,   and    the\n\napplicable     guideline   sentencing     range   based    on    that\n\nquantity.    On direct appeal, Calixce did not challenge his\n\nindictment or sentence, but argued only that the district\n\ncourt had erred in denying his pre-trial suppression motion.\n\nThis court affirmed Calixce’s conviction in an unpublished\n\nopinion dated April 2, 1999.\n\n            Almost two years later, Calixce filed two motions\n\nin district court.    The first one was a motion to amend his\n\nprison sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).               The\n\nsecond one was a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.\n\n12(b)(1) and for review of his sentence pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3742.    The district court denied both motions.          We\n\nagree with the district court that Calixce has failed to\n\fshow that he is entitled to the relief that he sought in\n\nthese motions.\n\n             I. Appeal No. 01-1321: Appeal from Motion to Amend\n\nSentence\n\n             Under 18 U.S.C. § 3582, the district court may\n\nreduce a defendant’s sentence “in the case of a defendant\n\nwho has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a\n\nsentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the\n\nSentencing Commission.”       In this case, Calixce claims that\n\nAmendment 591 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines,\n\neffective November 1, 2000, lowered the sentencing range on\n\nwhich his sentence was based.             Specifically, he refers to\n\nthe amendment to U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1(a).\n\n             Calixce seems to argue that, Amendment 591 altered\n\nthe sentencing guidelines by requiring that a sentence may\n\nonly    be   based   on   factors    that    are    specified   in   the\n\nindictment.     A review of the sentencing guidelines before\n\nand    after   Amendment    591   took     effect   belies   Calixce’s\n\ninterpretation.      Both the pre- and post-amendment guidelines\n\nrefer to the “offense         conduct charged in the count of\n\nindictment” as the basis for determining the appropriate\n\n“offense guideline section.”          And both the pre- and post-\n\namendment guidelines provide that the applicable “offense\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fguideline range” should be determined “in accordance with §\n\n1B1.3    (Relevant    Conduct).”     U.S.S.G.     §    1B1.2(b).         The\n\nbackground notes to §1B1.3 (both pre- and post- amendment)\n\nspecifically provide that\n\n           [c]onduct that is not formally charged\n           or is not an element of the offense of\n           conviction    may    enter  into   the\n           determination     of   the  applicable\n           guideline sentencing range.\n\n§1B1.3, comment. (backg’d.)(Nov. 2000).\n\n           The amendment on which Calixce relies did not lower\n\nthe   sentencing     range   on   which   his   sentence      was    based.\n\nTherefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying him relief under 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(1)(B).                    The\n\ndenial of that motion is affirmed.\n\n           II. Appeal No. 01-1573: Motion to Dismiss for Want\n\nof Jurisdiction and for Review of Sentence under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3742\n\n           In this motion, Calixce argued that his indictment,\n\nconviction and sentence are unconstitutional under Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).               He contended that\n\nbecause the indictment failed to specify a drug quantity (as\n\nrequired by Apprendi), it was a nullity and the district\n\ncourt    lacked    jurisdiction      over   the       case.         In   the\n\nalternative, Calixce argued in his motion, as he does in his\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fbrief on appeal, that he is entitled to be resentenced based\n\nupon the lowest possible quantity of cocaine under the\n\nguidelines.\n\n           The   time    for    Calixce   to   appeal   his   sentence\n\npursuant to § 3742 has long since expired. See Fed.R.App.P.\n\n4(b).   Moreover, Calixce filed a timely appeal from his\n\nsentence in which he did not include the present challenge\n\nto the district court’s jurisdiction.           This court has held\n\nthat\n\n           an objection that an indictment fails to\n           state an essential element of an offense\n           “shall be noticed by the court at any\n           time   during  the   pendency   of   the\n           proceedings.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2).\n           This means that the defendant may raise\n           the objection for the first time on\n           appeal or that this court may raise the\n           issue sua sponte.\n\nUnited States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 309 (1 st Cir.\n\n2000)(emphasis added), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 121 S.Ct.\n\n2215 (2001).      Because the pendency of the proceedings in\n\nCalixce’s case had already passed when he filed this motion,\n\nhowever,   he    is     not    entitled   to   relief   pursuant    to\n\nFed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2).          Instead, the appropriate form in\n\nwhich to raise the Apprendi issue would be a motion pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 2255.           This court has not yet decided the\n\nquestion whether Apprendi applies retroactively to cases on\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fcollateral review, an issue on which courts are divided. See\n\nUnited States v. Clark, __ F.3d. __, 2001 WL 845193 (5 th\n\nCir., July 26, 2001) (Circuit Judge Parker, dissenting).   We\n\nneed not reach that question, however, because Calixce’s\n\nonly reference to § 2255 in his filings in the district\n\ncourt or this court was in an objection to the government’s\n\nsuggestion that of one of his motions might be construed as\n\npursuant to § 2255. In any event, this court has recognized\n\nthe right of a petitioner to “have his motion decided as he\n\nhad framed it.” See Raineri v. United States, 233 F.3d 96,\n\n100 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Calixce is not entitled to the relief he sought\n\npursuant to Rule 12(b) or 18 U.S.C. § 3742.   Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of that motion is affirmed.\n\n          Calixce’s motion in opposition to consolidation of\n\nthese appeals is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                            -6-\n\f",
