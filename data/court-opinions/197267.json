Concededly,  fees  are  discretionary,  the  statute\r\n\nreading as follows,\r\n\n     In  any  civil  action   under  this\r\ntitle,  the court  in its  discretion may\r\nallow the  recovery of  full costs  by or\r\nagainst any  party other than  the United\r\nStates or an officer thereof.   Except as\r\notherwise  provided  by  this title,  the\r\ncourt   may   also  award   a  reasonable\r\nattorney's fee to the prevailing party as\r\npart of the costs.\r\n\n17 U.S.C.    505.   The  court  did award  defendant  partial\r\n\ncosts.\r\n\nDefendant  has  assumed  a heavy  burden,  but  not\r\n\nwithout justification.  We reverse.\r\n\nA nationwide difference  of views  on this  subject\r\n\nled to the  case of Fogerty v.  Fantasy, Inc., 510  U.S. 517,\r                                                         \r\n\n534  (1994), where  the Court  rejected the  so-called \"dual\"\r\n\nstandard  rule.   \"[P]revailing  plaintiffs [were]  generally\r\n\nawarded  attorney's  fees  as   a  matter  of  course,  while\r\n\nprevailing defendants  must show  that the original  suit was\r\n\nfrivolous  or brought in bad faith.\"  510 U.S. at pp. 520-21.\r\n\nRather, defendants are entitled to consideration \"evenhandly\"\r\n\nwith plaintiffs.\r\n\nThe Court particularly criticized Breffort v.

Supp., at  627.  As  support, the\r\ncourt stated:   \"The purpose of an  award\r\nof  counsel  fees  to a  plaintiff  is to\r\ndeter  copyright infringement. . . .   In\r\nthe  case  of  a   prevailing  defendant,\r\nhowever,  prevention  of infringement  is\r\nobviously not  a factor; and if  an award\r\nis  to be  made at  all, it  represents a\r\npenalty  imposed  upon the  plaintiff for\r\ninstitution of a baseless,  frivolous, or\r\nunreasonable suit, or  one instituted  in\r\nbad faith.\"   Ibid.   As we  have already\r                                         \r\nexplained,  supra,  at 527,  such  is too\r                                       \r\nnarrow  a view  of  the  purposes of  the\r\nCopyright   Act   because  it   fails  to\r\nadequately  consider  the important  role\r\nplayed by copyright defendants.\r\n\n510 U.S. at 532 n.18.\r\n\nThe  district  court  ruling  that   Fogerty  found\r                                                                  \r\n\nimproper  was  that  the  defendant could  not  recover  fees\r\n\nbecause  it  had  not   \"demonstrated  that  the  action  was\r\n\nfrivolous  or was  instituted and  prosecuted in  bad faith.\"\r\n\nFantasy,  Inc. v.  Fogerty,  984 F.2d  1524,  1532 (9th  Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1993).  The  Supreme Court  condensed this  to \"frivolous  or\r\n\nbrought in bad faith.\"\r\n\nIn  the case  at  bar1 there  were three  pertinent\r\n\ncourt proceedings.  On November 16, 1995, the court delivered\r\n\nan oral  opinion denying plaintiff Martha  Edwards' claims of\r\n\n          \r                                \r\n\n1.  The plaintiff also brought claims for breach of contract,\r\nviolations of the Lanham Act and unfair competition.  None of\r\nthese claims concerns us here.\r\n\n                   -3-\r\r\n\ncopyright  infringement  on  six out  of  eight  works.2   On\r\n\nSeptember  9, 1996, it  conducted a hearing  on cross motions\r\n\nfor attorneys'  fees and  sanctions.  Except  for defendant's\r\n\nstating that it  was cited  in its memorandum,  there was  no\r\n\nmention of  Fogerty; both  counsel argued exclusively  on the\r                               \r\n\nquestion of  unreasonableness.  The court  reserved decision.\r\n\nOn  September 18, it delivered  an oral decision on copyright\r\n\nfees, Lanham Act fees, and Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions.\r\n\nOn  copyright,  our  only  issue,  the  court  gave\r\n\nreasonableness little attention.  It said,\r\n\n     The  Supreme  Court  in the  Fogerty\r                                                               \r\ncase  identified some of the factors that\r\nthe   Court   ought   to    consider   in\r\ndetermining   whether  to   exercise  its\r\ndiscretion and award counsel fees.  Those\r\n[sic], basically, there  are two  factors\r\nthat Fogerty identified.  One  is whether\r                                  \r\nthe  claim  could  be   characterized  as\r\nfrivolous    and    second,   what    the\r\nPlaintiff's motive was, whether the claim\r\nwas brought in bad faith.\r\n\nThis seems singular emphasis,  since Fogerty's point was that\r                                                        \r\n\nthese  extremes  were  no  longer  the  sole  factors  to  be\r\n\nconsidered.  510 U.S. at 534 n.19.3  The court proceeded,\r\n\n          \r                                \r\n\n2.  Defendant,  with apologies,  conceded an  inadvertence on\r\nthe other two.  The court noted that \"those claims turned out\r\nto be a pittance.\"\r\n\n3.  The Court listed  non-exclusive factors to  be considered\r\nby courts in making awards of attorney's fees including,\r\n\n     [F]rivolousness,         motivation,\r\nobjective  unreasonableness (both  in the\r\nfactual and legal components of the case)\r\nand the need in  particular circumstances\r\n\n                   -4-\r\r\n\n     Here  the  Defendant  relies on  the\r\ntwenty year course of dealing between the\r\nparties to establish  that the  Defendant\r\nacted  properly  and  that the  Plaintiff\r\nacted unreasonably and/or in bad faith in\r\nbringing the copyright claims.\r\n\nThe  district  court  then   described  plaintiff's\r\n\nasserted   justification   for    bringing   suit,    namely,\r\n\nambiguities.   Ambiguities  did not  win  the case,  but they\r\n\ndefeated frivolousness and bad faith.\r\n\n     So   in   light  of   those  things,\r\nalthough [I] found  for the Defendant for\r\na   variety   of   reasons,    I   cannot\r\ncharacterize  the  Plaintiff's  copyright\r\nclaims as  being frivolous or  brought in\r\nbad faith.\r\n\n     Therefore,  I  will  not  award  any\r\nattorney's fees to the Defendant  for the\r\ncopyright claims.\r\n\nFaced with this positive language,  plaintiff urges\r\n\nus to interpret liberally, arguing that,\r\n\n     Viewed  in  its proper  context, the\r\nrecord  elsewhere   additionally  reveals\r\nthat while the court may have principally\r\narticulated its conclusions at the moment\r\nof    its    decision    in   terms    of\r\nfrivolousness,   it    used   that   term\r\ninterchangeably       with      objective\r\nunreasonableness.\r\n\nThe \"elsewhere,\"  except in the  earlier hearing on\r\n\nSeptember 9, is not conspicuous.   Plaintiff would have  been\r\n\nmore   accurate   had   she   said  that   the   court   read\r\n\n          \r                                \r\n\nto advance considerations of compensation\r\nand deterrence.\r\n\n510 U.S. at 534 n.19 (citations omitted).\r\n\n                   -5-\r\r\n\nunreasonableness in terms of frivolousness.4   But manifestly\r\n\nFogerty did not reject the dual rule in order to add a clone.\r                   \r\n\nWe  say this  particularly  because the  court held\r\n\nthat an obligation  for fees was  not sparked by  plaintiff's\r\n\nunilaterally  rejecting a  practice between  the  parties, as\r\n\nartist  and publisher,  that plaintiff  had accepted  for two\r\n\ndecades; the more  especially when her rejection was based on\r\n\nambiguities  which,  in its  decision denying  liability, the\r\n\ncourt had said  she could not rely on because  it was she who\r\n\nhad  created them.   This,  it seems  to us,  was inescapably\r\n\nhighly unreasonable, if not  frivolous.  The court overlooked\r\n\nnot only the  tenor of  the Fogerty opinion,  but its  above-\r                                               \r\n\nquoted  footnote recognizing  \"the important  role played  by\r\n\ncopyright  defendants,\" --  preventing copyright  owners from\r\n\nrestricting  rightful publications.    It used  too strict  a\r\n\nrequirement,    acknowledged,     and    then    disregarded,\r\n\nunreasonableness, and reached a wrong result.\r\n\n          \r                                \r\n\n4.  For  good measure we note the  court's repetition of this\r\nequivalency when considering plaintiff's obligation  for fees\r\nfor the Lanham Act claims (which the court granted, plaintiff\r\nhaving introduced no evidence),\r\n\n     The  factors  to  be considered  are\r\nsimilar  to  those  applicable under  the\r\nCopyright  Act  whether  the claims  were\r\nfrivolous or brought in bad faith.   What\r\nit boils down to is whether the Plaintiff\r\nacted   reasonably   in  bringing   these\r\nclaims.\r\n\n                   -6-\r\r\n\nOrdinarily  we  would now  remand for  defendant to\r\n\nstart over.  However,  plaintiff's claim was so poor  that we\r\n\nconsider  it would  be an  abuse of  discretion not  to award\r\n\nfees; the only question should be the amount.  We reverse and\r\n\nremand  for that  purpose, cf.  Diamond Star  Bldg. Corp.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFreed,  30 F.2d  503, 506  (4th Cir.  1994), to  the original\r                 \r\n\njudge.\r\n\n                   -7-\r\r\n",

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span> (1994), where the Court rejected the so-called \"dual\" standard rule.  \"[P]revailing plaintiffs [were] generally awarded attorney's fees as a matter of course, while prevailing defendants must show that the original suit was frivolous or brought in bad faith.\"  510 U.S. at pp. 520-21, 114 S.Ct. at p. 1026.   Rather, defendants are entitled to consideration \"evenhandly\" with plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court particularly criticized Breffort v.

As support, the court stated:  \"The purpose of an award of counsel fees to a plaintiff is to deter copyright infringement....  In the case of a prevailing defendant, however, prevention of infringement is obviously not a factor;  and if an award is to be made at all, it represents a penalty imposed upon the plaintiff for institution of a baseless, frivolous, or unreasonable suit, or one instituted in bad faith.\"  Ibid. As we have already explained, supra, at 527, 114 S.Ct. at 1029-30, such is too narrow a view of the purposes of the Copyright Act because it fails to adequately consider the important role played by copyright defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">510 U.S. at 532 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. at 1032 n. 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruling that Fogerty found improper was that the defendant could not recover fees because it had not \"demonstrated that the action was frivolous or was instituted and prosecuted in bad faith.\"  Fantasy, Inc. v.

The Supreme Court condensed this to \"frivolous or brought in bad faith.\"In the case at bar<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> there were three pertinent court proceedings.  On November 16, 1995, the court delivered an oral opinion denying plaintiff Martha Edwards' claims of copyright infringement on six out of eight works.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On September 9, 1996, it conducted a hearing on cross motions for attorneys' fees and sanctions.  Except for defendant's stating that it was cited in its memorandum, there was no mention of Fogerty;  both counsel argued exclusively on the question of unreasonableness.  The court reserved decision.  On September 18, it delivered an oral decision on copyright fees, Lanham Act fees, and Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On copyright, our only issue, the court gave reasonableness little attention.
