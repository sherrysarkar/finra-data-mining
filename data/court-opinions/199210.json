Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David Michaud on brief pro se.\n     Donald E. Gardner and Devine, Millimet & Branch on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                       December 27, 2000\n\f            Per Curiam. Pro se appellant David Michaud appeals\n\nfrom the dismissal of his civil rights complaint.                In a\n\nreport   and    recommendation    dated   December     30,   1999,   a\n\nmagistrate judge recommended dismissal for failure to state\n\na federal claim.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a) & (b) (providing\n\nfor dismissal on preliminary review of prisoner complaints\n\nagainst government officers or employees if the complaints\n\ndo not state a claim for relief).               After reviewing an\n\nobjection filed by appellant, the district court approved\n\nthe recommendation in an order dated January 19, 2000, and\n\ndismissed the complaint.     We affirm.\n\n            On appeal, appellant argues that he stated a due\n\nprocess claim for relief, contending that there was state\n\naction and that he possessed a property interest sufficient\n\nto warrant protection under the Due Process Clause.           But the\n\ndistrict court did not dismiss the due process claim for\n\nlack of state action or the requisite property interest.\n\nAdopting the magistrate judge's reasoning, the district\n\ncourt essentially dismissed it under the Parratt-Hudson\n\ndoctrine.      See Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 541-43\n\n(1981) (rejecting due process claim based on negligent loss\n\nof   property    where   defendants'      act    was   \"random   and\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\funauthorized\"      and    there         was        an     adequate        state\n\npostdeprivation remedy to redress the loss), overruled in\n\npart on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327\n\n(1986);   Hudson   v.    Palmer,    468        U.S.     517,      533    (1984)\n\n(extending the ruling in Parratt to intentionally caused\n\nlosses of property).     In objecting to the magistrate judge's\n\nreport, appellant did not argue that the magistrate judge\n\nhad erred in relying on that principle of law.                 Likewise, on\n\nappeal, appellant has not argued that the district court\n\nerred in dismissing his claim based on that principle, but\n\nargues other points which the district court was apparently\n\nwilling to assume in his favor.           Due to his double default,\n\nappellant has waived consideration of the dismissal of his\n\ndue   process   claim.    See   Brown         v.   Hot,    Sexy    and    Safer\n\nProductions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 536-37 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(affirming Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of due process claim\n\nwhere, both in district court and on appeal, plaintiffs had\n\nfailed to adequately argue points pertinent to the Parratt-\n\nHudson doctrine); Sands v. Ridefilm Corp., 212 F.3d 657, 663\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (declining to consider argument on appeal\n\nwhich appellant failed to make in objecting to magistrate\n\njudge's report).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            As for the equal protection claim, we also conclude\n\n that appellant has waived appellate consideration of his\n\n claim.     In his appellate brief, appellant contends that\n\n appellees stole and destroyed his property, knowing that he\n\n was incarcerated and indigent.                 But he failed to present the\n\n same factual allegations to the district court when he\n\n objected     to    the     magistrate          judge's    report,       and     the\n\n magistrate    judge       had        recommended      dismissing      the     equal\n\n protection        claim        for     lack     of     adequate       supporting\n\n allegations.        Because          appellant       failed    to    present    his\n\n present    argument       to    the    district       court,    we    decline    to\n\n consider it.       See Sands, supra.\n\n            Affirmed.           See Loc. R. 27(c).1\n\n\n\n\n    1We deny appellant's motion for leave to assert, in a\nhearing,   claims  of   misrepresentation   against   appellees'\nattorney.   We also deny appellees' request to reconsider the\ndenial of their motion to revoke appellant's in forma pauperis\nstatus under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g). For reasons fully explained\nin the case law, we conclude that appellant has not accumulated\nthe requisite \"three strikes\" under the statute. See Adepegba\nv. Hammons, 103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996) (explaining\nthat a dismissal followed by an affirmance counts as only one\nstrike under § 1915(g) and that dismissals by the district court\nshould not be counted until after a petitioner has exhausted or\nwaived his avenues of appeal); accord Jennings v. Natrona County\nDetention Ctr., 175 F.3d 775, 779-81 (10th Cir. 1999). In view\nof our ruling, we deny appellant's motion to strike appellees'\nmotion for reconsideration as moot.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f",
