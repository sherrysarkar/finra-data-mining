At   his  sentencing  hearing,  the  government\r\n\nrequested that Gagliardi's base offense level be reduced from 32,\r\n\nwhich  the  Presentencing  Report  (\"PSR\")  recommended,  to  30,\r\n\npursuant to  the plea agreement.   The government  also requested\r\n\nthat  a three-level enhancement be  added for Gagliardi's role in\r\n\nthe  offense.  That  upward adjustment was  made, and ultimately,\r\n\nhis total offense level  was determined to be 30,1  corresponding\r\n\nto a range  under the Sentencing Guidelines of 97  to 121 months.\r\n\nThe government recommended, and  the sentencing court approved, a\r\n\nsentence  of 97  months imprisonment.   The  court also  denied a\r\n\nmotion for downward departure.\r\n\n          Gagliardi alleges two  errors by the  sentencing court:\r\n\nfirst,  that  he  was   improperly  given  a  three-level  upward\r\n\nadjustment  pursuant to U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(b)2 for being a manager\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Gagliardi  received a three-level  decrease in  offense level\r\npursuant  to  U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b)(2)  for  timely acceptance  of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\n2    Sentencing  Guideline     3B1.1(b)  mandates  a  three-level\r\nincrease if  \"the defendant was a manager or supervisor . . . and\r\nthe  criminal activity involved five  or more participants or was\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nor  supervisor  in a  criminal  activity involving  five  or more\r\n\nparticipants;  and second,  that the  sentencing court  failed to\r\n\nconsider facts  relevant to his  motion for a  downward departure\r\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.    5K2.0 based  on unusual  family circumstances.\r\n\nBoth allegations are without merit.\r\n\n          Gagliardi  appears  to  concede  that  four  other  men\r\n\nassisted in the storage  and re-packaging of the  marijuana which\r\n\nhe had acquired,  thereby satisfying the requirement of  \"five or\r\n\nmore participants\"  -- when one  counts Gagliardi himself  as the\r\n\nfifth participant -- under U.S.S.G.   3B1.1.  Moreover, there was\r\n\nample factual support in the PSR for the district court's finding\r\n\nthat Gagliardi was a \"manager or supervisor.\"  \r\n\n          Contrary  to  Gagliardi's insinuations  on  appeal, the\r\n\nfact  that there were  other persons  who had  greater managerial\r\n\nresponsibilities does  not render  the section  3B1.1 enhancement\r\n\ninapplicable to him.   See  United States v.  Goldberg, 105  F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n770, 777 (1st Cir. 1997)  (\"[A] defendant need not be at  the top\r\n\nof a criminal scheme to  be a manager or supervisor.\").   Indeed,\r\n\nthe   well-established  standard  for  upward  adjustments  under\r\n\nsection  3B1.1 requires  only  that there  be  \"'evidence that  a\r\n\ndefendant, in  committing the  crime, exercised control  over, or\r\n\nwas otherwise  responsible for  overseeing the activities  of, at\r\n\nleast one other person.'\"  United States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d  37,\r                                                             \r\n\n44 (1st Cir.  1996) (quoting  United States v.  Savoie, 985  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n612, 616 (1st Cir. 1993)). The PSR confirms that this requirement\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\notherwise extensive.\"  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nwas met.   It states, for example, that  Gagliardi directed a co-\r\n\nconspirator to bring large amounts of money he needed to purchase\r\n\nmarijuana  in Arizona,  and that  Gagliardi directed  another co-\r\n\nconspirator  to   find  a  suitable  location   for  storing  and\r\n\nrepackaging the  marijuana that  he had purchased.   Furthermore,\r\n\nevidence  related to  role in  the offense determinations  may be\r\n\nprobative  \"'by fair  inference.'\"   See Voccola,  99 F.3d  at 45\r                                                          \r\n\n(quoting United States  v. Tejada-Beltr n, 50 F.3d 105,  113 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1995)).  In this case, one can reasonably infer Gagliardi's\r\n\nsupervisory control  over those  who were engaged  in repackaging\r\n\nthe marijuana at  the storage location (an  airplane hangar) from\r\n\nGagliardi's responsibility for arranging the storage location, as\r\n\nwell as from the fact that, after the four men were discovered in\r\n\nthe hangar, they drove away and called Gagliardi.   In sum, there\r\n\nis no basis for finding any error in the district court's role in\r\n\nthe offense determination, clear or otherwise.\r\n\n          Finally,  there  is  no   support  in  the  record  for\r\n\nGagliardi's   contention  that  the   district  court  failed  to\r\n\nconsider, or  prevented Gagliardi from  producing, facts relevant\r\n\nto his motion  for a downward  departure on the basis  of unusual\r\n\nfamily circumstances.  On  review of the record, it  appears that\r\n\nthe  facts presented  in  Gagliardi's  eleventh hour  memorandum,\r\n\nwhich Gagliardi claims the district court improperly ignored, had\r\n\nalready been  substantially brought to the court's attention in a\r\n\nprevious sentencing memorandum,  in the PSR,  as well as  through\r\n\ndefense  counsel's  statements at  the  sentencing  hearing.   We\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nfurther note that the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\n\nin  determining  that  the  facts  regarding  Gagliardi's  family\r\n\ncircumstances  --   the  most   noteworthy  of  which   are  that\r\n\nGagliardi's  youngest daughter has  an attention deficit disorder\r\n\nand that her mother is being treated for breast cancer -- are not\r\n\nof  a kind so extraordinary  as to warrant  a downward departure.\r\n\nSee   U.S.S.G.    5H1.6 (\"Family  ties .  . .  are not ordinarily\r             \r\n\nrelevant.\"); United  States v.  Rivera, 994 F.2d  942, (1st  Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1993) (family  circumstances do  not ordinarily  warrant downward\r\n\ndeparture); compare United  States v.

It states, for example, that  Gagliardi directed a co-\r\n\nconspirator to bring large amounts of money he needed to purchase\r\n\nmarijuana  in Arizona,  and that  Gagliardi directed  another co-\r\n\nconspirator  to   find  a  suitable  location   for  storing  and\r\n\nrepackaging the  marijuana that  he had purchased.   Furthermore,\r\n\nevidence  related to  role in  the offense determinations  may be\r\n\nprobative  \"'by fair  inference.'\"   See Voccola,  99 F.3d  at 45\r                                                          \r\n\n(quoting United States  v.

In this case, one can reasonably infer Gagliardi's\r\n\nsupervisory control  over those  who were engaged  in repackaging\r\n\nthe marijuana at  the storage location (an  airplane hangar) from\r\n\nGagliardi's responsibility for arranging the storage location, as\r\n\nwell as from the fact that, after the four men were discovered in\r\n\nthe hangar, they drove away and called Gagliardi.   In sum, there\r\n\nis no basis for finding any error in the district court's role in\r\n\nthe offense determination, clear or otherwise.\r\n\n          Finally,  there  is  no   support  in  the  record  for\r\n\nGagliardi's   contention  that  the   district  court  failed  to\r\n\nconsider, or  prevented Gagliardi from  producing, facts relevant\r\n\nto his motion  for a downward  departure on the basis  of unusual\r\n\nfamily circumstances.  On  review of the record, it  appears that\r\n\nthe  facts presented  in  Gagliardi's  eleventh hour  memorandum,\r\n\nwhich Gagliardi claims the district court improperly ignored, had\r\n\nalready been  substantially brought to the court's attention in a\r\n\nprevious sentencing memorandum,  in the PSR,  as well as  through\r\n\ndefense  counsel's  statements at  the  sentencing  hearing.   We\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nfurther note that the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\n\nin  determining  that  the  facts  regarding  Gagliardi's  family\r\n\ncircumstances  --   the  most   noteworthy  of  which   are  that\r\n\nGagliardi's  youngest daughter has  an attention deficit disorder\r\n\nand that her mother is being treated for breast cancer -- are not\r\n\nof  a kind so extraordinary  as to warrant  a downward departure.\r\n\nSee   U.S.S.G.    5H1.6 (\"Family  ties .  . .  are not ordinarily\r             \r\n\nrelevant.\"); United  States v.
