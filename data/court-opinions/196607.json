In this  consolidated, multiparty\r                    CYR, Circuit  Judge\r                                       \r\n\nproceeding,  the  district  court entered  two  separate  summary\r\n\njudgment  orders for  intervenor  CFI.1   The first  judgment was\r\n\nagainst  Trainor and awarded CFI  a constructive trust over Trai-\r\n\nnor's  \"choses in action\"  against Biopure.   The second judgment\r\n\nawarded CFI similar relief  against Fisher.  The second  judgment\r\n\nwas  also  favorable to  Biopure.   Each judgment  was certified,\r\n\nthough at  different times,  as final and  immediately appealable\r\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  \r\n\n          The  two  judgments spawned  appeals by  three parties.\r\n\nTrainor appealed  from the  first judgment, but  then voluntarily\r\n\ndismissed the appeal.   Fisher noticed an appeal from  the second\r\n\njudgment, along  with a  purported \"cross-appeal\" from  the first\r\n\njudgment,  as did Ideal.   Fisher and Ideal  also moved to vacate\r\n\nthe voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal. \r\n\n          Based on  a thorough  record review, we  conclude that:\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The various parties are referred to as follows:\r\n\n     \"Fisher\"  collectively  designates  Peter   Fisher  and\r\n     Balfour  Holdings,  Inc.  (\"Balfour\"), an  entity  con-\r\n     trolled by Fisher.    \r\n\n     \"Ideal\" designates Ideal Environmental Systems, Inc. \r\n\n     \"Trainor\" collectively designates William  Trainor, his\r\n     daughter Diane Trainor,  and Trainor-controlled  compa-\r\n     nies,  Bio-Vita,  Ltd. (\"Bio-Vita\"),  Hemo-Innovations,\r\n     Ltd. and Laurel Mountain Trust (\"LMT\").  \r\n\n     \"Biopure\"  collectively designates  Biopure Corporation\r\n     and Biopure Associates Limited Partnership (\"BALP\"), as\r\n     well as Carl W. Rausch.  \r\n\n     \"CFI\" designates Credit Francais International, S.A.  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n(1)  the Ideal appeal  was filed late  and, in all  events, Ideal\r\n\nlacks standing  to appeal;  (2) the  Trainor appeal  was properly\r\n\ndismissed; (3) the  Fisher \"cross-appeal\"  brief challenging  the\r\n\nfirst judgment  should  be  stricken; and  (4)  the  court  lacks\r\n\nappellate  jurisdiction over  Fisher's  challenge to  the  second\r\n\njudgment. \r\n\n           At the outset, we note that our consideration of these\r\n\nappeals has been severely  hampered by the failure of  Fisher and\r\n\nIdeal to conform their  briefs and appendices as required  by the\r\n\napplicable rules.   Their briefs do not  include necessary juris-\r\n\ndictional  information, a meaningful  description of the district\r\n\ncourt  proceedings, nor  comprehensible  record references.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed.  R.  App. P.  28(a)(2)(ii), (a)(4),  (e).   The  first three\r\n\nvolumes of their appendices, approximating 2500 pages, are poorly\r\n\nindexed,  not  in  chronological  order,  and  not  consecutively\r\n\npaginated.   See Fed. R. App. P.  30(d).  Prior to oral argument,\r                          \r\n\ndespite  a careful search of the appendices and the eight volumes\r\n\nof  record originally  designated on  appeal, we  were unable  to\r\n\nlocate   crucial  pleadings  and  exhibits,  including  documents\r\n\nreferenced in appellants' own briefs. \r\n\n          At oral argument, these  matters were brought to appel-\r\n\nlants' attention and  we invited an  appropriate motion.   Appel-\r\n\nlants  later sought and were  granted leave to  file a two-volume\r\n\nsupplemental  appendix  consisting of  an additional  1400 pages.\r\n\nThe  supplement contains many     but not  all     of the missing\r\n\ndocuments.   It  also contains,  however, unindexed  documents of\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nuncertain relevance, some of  which may not have been  before the\r\n\ndistrict  court.   Moreover,  appellants did  not  seek leave  to\r\n\nrepaginate and rearrange the first three volumes of  their appen-\r\n\ndices, obliquely explaining instead that these volumes \"have been\r\n\nused by the Court and  parties for over three months.\"   And they\r\n\nfailed to revise their  record references to the documents  cited\r\n\nin their briefs.  See Fed. R. App. P. 30(c).\r                               \r\n\n          It is  appellants' responsibility to provide  the court\r\n\nwith  intelligible briefs  and appendices  sufficient to  support\r\n\ntheir  points on appeal, United  States v.

Fisher entered  into a  joint\r\n\nventure  with Trainor to invest  in, and develop, Biopure's hemo-\r\n\nglobin-based products.  Each partner was to contribute 50% of the\r\n\ncapital needed to finance their undertaking.  Trainor was respon-\r\n\nsible for negotiating  a contract  with Biopure.   Fisher was  to\r\n\narrange for human testing of a  Biopure product    Hemopure    in\r\n\nGuatemala.\r\n\n          Earlier, acting through Ideal as  the nominal borrower,\r\n\nTrainor had obtained more than $14 million  from CFI in a fraudu-\r\n\nlent loan transaction.  Although Fisher likewise was  involved in\r\n\nthe CFI loan  transaction, his knowledge of the fraud perpetrated\r\n\nby  Trainor remains  in  dispute. Trainor  used approximately  $3\r\n\nmillion  in \"tainted\"  CFI loan  proceeds to finance  the Biopure\r\n\ncontract.  These monies have been  traced directly from Trainor's\r\n\nbank account  to the Biopure  deal.  The  \"ownership\" of  this $3\r\n\nmillion  at the  time it was  invested in Biopure  is a contested\r\n\nmatter as between Fisher and Ideal.  \r\n\n          Allegedly  at  about the  same  time, Trainor  secretly\r\n\nforced  Fisher out of the Biopure  deal by substituting Bio-Vita,\r\n\nTrainor's  own company, as the  named party to  the contract with\r\n\nBiopure.   The contract entitled Trainor to an equity interest in\r\n\nBiopure and  licensing rights to  the Biopure products.   Biopure\r\n\nsubsequently  rescinded the contract  and awarded  similar equity\r\n\nand licensing rights to Upjohn.  According to Fisher, by then the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nrights licensed to Upjohn were worth at least $179 million. \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          The District Court Proceedings\r                    The District Court Proceedings\r                                                  \r\n\n          Fisher  sued  Trainor,  and  later  Biopure,  for  $250\r\n\nmillion  or a 50%  share in the Biopure  rights (\"Fisher v. Trai-\r                                                                           \r\n\nnor\").    Trainor  then  sued Biopure.    Biopure  counterclaimed\r             \r\n\nagainst  Trainor for fraud, adding Fisher as a third party defen-\r\n\ndant  in the  Trainor lawsuit  (\"Trainor v. Biopure\").   Fisher's\r                                                             \r\n\nthird  party  answer  included  a  counterclaim  against  Trainor\r\n\nseeking  to impose a constructive trust upon any Trainor recover-\r\n\nies from Biopure. \r\n\n          The first count in the Fisher v. Trainor complaint  was\r                                                            \r\n\ntried to a jury in November, 1992, resulting in a special verdict\r\n\nthat Trainor  had breached a  binding oral  contract with  Fisher\r\n\nwhereby the two were  to have shared equally in the Biopure deal.\r\n\nA  mistrial  was declared  later,  however,  because Trainor  and\r\n\nFisher were unable to agree on the meaning of the special verdict\r\n\nand how to proceed with respect to the separate action in Trainor\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

CFI  also demanded judgment  on certain direct\r\n\nclaims against Biopure. \r\n\n          The  district court first  entered summary judgment for\r\n\nCFI  and  against Trainor,  imposing  a  constructive trust  upon\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nTrainor's  claims against  Biopure based on  findings that:   (1)\r\n\nTrainor's fraud against  CFI was undisputed,2 (2)  CFI had traced\r\n\napproximately $3 million of its loan funds through Trainor to the\r\n\nBiopure investment,  and (3)  all monies  advanced by Trainor  in\r\n\nfurtherance of the Biopure deal were traceable to CFI.  \r\n\n          Fisher did not oppose CFI's motion for summary judgment\r\n\nagainst Trainor, but ambiguously purported to  reserve a right to\r\n\ndemand  a share of  Trainor's rights in  the Biopure transaction.\r\n\nThe district court accordingly ruled,\r\n\n          [T]he  court notes  the existence  of another\r\n          claim to rights  arising from the transaction\r\n          with Biopure . . .

[T]his opinion does not address\r\n          his claims and their effect, if any, on CFI's\r\n          constructive trust.\r\n\nJune  28, 1994 Order at 6.   The district court certified the CFI\r\n\nsummary judgment against  Trainor as final under  Rule 54(b), and\r\n\njudgment entered on July 1, 1994.  \r\n\n          Trainor  filed  a  premature notice  of  appeal shortly\r\n\nafter Fisher moved to amend the judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP.  59(e),  notwithstanding  Fisher's  earlier  decision  not  to\r\n\ninterpose  objection  to the  CFI  motion  for summary  judgment.\r\n\nContemporaneously,  Fisher filed  a \"first  amended counterclaim\"\r\n\nwhich purported to add Ideal as a party to the pending litigation\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2This  finding  was predicated  in  substantial  part on  an\r\nearlier  Ohio consent judgment for fraud against Trainor.  In the\r                               \r\nsame Ohio  action, a default  judgment was entered  against Ideal\r\nand  remains  outstanding, according  to  CFI,  because Ideal  is\r\ndefunct.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nfor  the first time.  Ideal also  purported to join as a party in\r\n\nthe Rule  59(e) motion  to amend  the earlier  Trainor judgment.3\r\n\nIn  response to  a  motion to  strike  the amended  counterclaim,\r\n\nFisher and Ideal formally  moved for leave to amend  it by, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia,  \"adding Ideal  as a  party plaintiff.\"   Finally,  CFI and\r              \r\n\nBiopure moved for summary judgment against Fisher.\r\n\n          On  November  22, 1994,  the  district  court issued  a\r\n\nmemorandum  opinion  denying  the  Rule 59(e)  motion  to  amend,\r\n\nstriking  as untimely  the first  amended counterclaim  which had\r\n\nattempted to insinuate Ideal as a party to the case, and granting\r\n\nthe Biopure and CFI motions  for summary judgment against Fisher.\r\n\nBased  on its conclusion that the only claims Fisher had asserted\r\n\nagainst  Biopure  were  those  Fisher and  Trainor  jointly  held\r\n\nagainst Biopure, the district  court ruled:  \"there is  no ground\r\n\nwhatsoever in law or equity that gives Fisher a right to share in\r\n\nthe benefits of  his co-venturer's  fraud to the  detriment of  a\r\n\nprior innocent party.\" \r\n\n          The  district  court's  memorandum order  provides  the\r\n\nfollowing  explanation for  its decision to  enter a  second Rule\r\n\n54(b)  certification,  covering  the  summary  judgments  against\r\n\nFisher: \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  docket sheets list two Rule 59(e) motions filed on the\r\nsame day, one  by Ideal and one by Fisher, but we can locate only\r\none such motion in the appendix and record.  It  purports to have\r\nbeen  \"submitted\" by both Fisher and Ideal, although it is titled\r\n\"Ideal's Motion  to Alter or  Amend Judgment.\"   Fisher complains\r\nthat  the district court  never ruled on  his motion.   Given the\r\nrecord before us, however,  we conclude that there was  a single,\r\njoint  motion, which was denied  by the court.   See accompanying\r                                                              \r\ntext.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n          In the  opinion of the court  the granting of\r\n          these motions for  summary judgment is likely\r\n          to lead to the simplification of the case and\r\n          the elimination of a  future trial.  For this\r\n          reason the court  finds it advisable to  make\r\n          these judgments  final under Rule 54(b).  The\r\n          court finds  no  just reason  to delay  final\r\n          judgment on these matters.\r\n\nNov. 22, 1994 Order at 13.\r\n\n          On December 6, 1994, a \"separate document,\" incorporat-\r\n\ning the second Rule  54(b) judgment, was entered on  the district\r\n\ncourt docket:  \r\n\n          In accordance with  this Court's  Memorandum,\r\n          Opinion  and  Order entered  on  November 22,\r\n          1994, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\r\n\n          Judgment is  entered in favor of  Biopure and\r\n          Credit  Francais International,  S.A. (\"CFI\")\r\n          as  against Balfour Holdings,  Inc. and Peter\r\n          Fisher.  \r\n\nBy supplementary order under Rule 60(a), the district court noted\r\n\nthe pendency  of additional,  unspecified claims,  but reiterated\r\n\nits  intention  to certify  the  second Rule  54(b)  judgment for\r\n\nimmediate  appeal \"in the interests of  justice.\"  As best we can\r\n\nglean from the record,  at that time all claims  remained pending\r                                                                           \r\n\n(with  CFI  substituted as  plaintiff  on some)  and  all parties\r                                                                           \r\n\nremained in the case on other claims. \r\n\n          The Appeals\r                    The Appeals\r                               \r\n\n          Following  the  denial of  the  Rule  59(e) motions  to\r\n\namend,  Trainor  reinstated  his  appeal from  the  July  1, 1994\r\n\njudgment (No. 94-1854).  See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).  On January\r                                      \r\n\n3, 1995, Fisher  and Ideal each  filed a notice  of appeal.   The\r\n\nFisher notice,  a single  document titled \"Notice  of Appeal  and\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nCross-Appeal,\" purported to notice an appeal from the December  6\r\n\njudgment and a  \"cross-appeal\" from  the July 1  judgment.4   The\r\n\nIdeal notice, identically titled, likewise purported to notice an\r\n\nappeal from the December 6 judgment and a \"cross-appeal\" from the\r\n\nJuly 1  judgment,  as well  as  another \"cross-appeal\"  from  the\r\n\nDecember 6  judgment, identified  only as  taken  in response  to\r                                \r                                \r\n\nFisher's notice of appeal.  The Fisher notice was docketed as No.\r\n\n95-1092;  the Ideal notice as  95-1091.  Trainor  and CFI jointly\r\n\nmoved  for voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal on March 20,\r\n\n1995, and the motion was granted the same day.   Fisher and Ideal\r\n\nmoved to vacate the voluntary dismissal.5\r\n\n          I.  Standing to Appeal (No. 95-1091)\r                    I.

Ideal\r\n\nwas not a party of record  before the district court.  Its stand-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The  term \"cross-appeal\" is a misnomer in this context.  It\r\nnormally denotes an  appeal by  an initial  appellee against  the\r\ninitial appellant from an  order or decision entered in  favor of\r\nthe initial  appellant. See  9 James Wm.  Moore, Moore's  Federal\r                                                                           \r\nPractice   204.11[1] (1995).  Fisher and  Ideal were not named as\r                  \r\nappellees  in the  Trainor  appeal, and  their so-called  \"cross-\r\nappeals,\"  as a logical  matter, were  separate appeals  from the\r                                                         \r\nfirst  judgment in favor of appellee CFI, not the original appel-\r\nlant      Trainor.    Ideal's additional  \"cross-appeal\"  against\r\nFisher is simply an enigma.\r\n\n     5We reserved decision on  this motion pending oral argument.\r\nFisher and Ideal then  filed an opaque motion to  consolidate the\r\ndismissed and pending appeals, which we denied.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ning  to  appeal thus  turns  on whether  its  attempted appellate\r\n\nchallenges are excepted  from the general rule  that only parties\r\n\nto the  district court proceedings  may appeal  a district  court\r\n\njudgment.   See United States  v. Little Joe  Trawlers, Inc., 780\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 158, 161 (1st Cir. 1986).  By itself, the Ideal challenge to\r\n\nthe denial of the Rule 59(e) motion, briefed separately under the\r\n\nrubric \"cross-appeal,\" appears to come within no exception to the\r\n\ngeneral rule. \r\n\n          Nonetheless, the denial of  Ideal's motion to amend the\r\n\nFisher counterclaim  by, inter  alia,  \"adding Ideal  as a  party\r                                              \r\n\nplaintiff,\"  may have been an  appealable order.   As the nominal\r\n\nborrower of the funds  loaned by CFI,  Ideal claims that it,  not\r\n\nCFI,  was entitled to assert a constructive trust over the equity\r\n\nclaims acquired  by  Trainor when  he wrongly  diverted the  loan\r\n\nproceeds  to Biopure.6  Ideal  thus asserts an  interest at least\r\n\nsuperficially  akin  to those  cognizable under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n24(a)(2).7 \r\n\n           An order  denying a  motion to  intervene of  right is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6There  are no  district court  findings which  would enable\r\nconfident determinations  as to  who controlled Ideal  at various\r\nmaterial times.  Moreover,  the record suggests that Ideal  was a\r\nshell, wholly owned and controlled by Trainor, at the time of the\r\nCFI loan.  During the CFI  loan transaction (\"in or about 1989\"),\r\nhowever, Fisher allegedly gained control of Ideal.  \r\n\n     7See supra  note 6.  Ideal  purports to be a  bona fide pur-\r                         \r\nchaser of the CFI loan  proceeds, so as to cut off  any right CFI\r\nmight  have  to \"trace\"  its loan  funds  into the  Biopure deal.\r\nIdeal claims  that, through  Fisher, it innocently  acquiesced in\r\nthe CFI loan arranged by Trainor,  then innocently redirected the\r\nloan  proceeds to Trainor (allegedly for the purchase of a worth-\r\nless  landfill).  Trainor used  the money to  finance the Biopure\r\ndeal. \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nimmediately appealable, without the  need for certification under\r                     \r\n\nRule 54(b).

The appeal cannot  be kept in  reserve; it must  be\r\n\ntaken  within thirty days  of the entry  of the order,  or not at\r\n\nall.   See   B.H.  by Pierce  v. Murphy, 984  F.2d 196,  199 (7th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.),  cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 2930  (1993).  As Ideal filed no\r                              \r\n\ntimely notice of  appeal from the denial of its  motion to inter-\r\n\nvene,  we lack  jurisdiction  over its  appeal.   The  thirty-day\r\n\nappeal period extended from the date of entry (November 28, 1994)\r\n\nof the November 22, 1994, order denying intervention, see Fed. R.\r                                                                   \r\n\nApp.  P. 4(a)(1),8 and  Ideal did not  file its notice  of appeal\r                                       \r\n\nuntil January 3, 1995.9            Appeals  from the  First Judg-\r                                             Appeals  from the  First Judg-\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The entry  of the  Rule  54(b) judgment  against Fisher  on\r\nDecember  6, 1994,  did not  enlarge the  appeal period,  for two\r\nreasons.  The  judgment did not include Ideal's claims and, as an\r\nexception to Rule 54(b),  the denial of intervention  was appeal-\r\nable  without an \"express direction for the entry of judgment\" on\r\na separate document.  Cf. Willhauck v. Halpin, 953  F.2d 689, 701\r                                                       \r\n(1st Cir. 1991).   Since Ideal sought intervention in  the still-\r\npending litigation, and  not relief from a  final judgment, there\r\nis  no reason to consider further the applicability of the \"sepa-\r\nrate document\" rule  in relation  to the denial  of this  motion.\r\nCompare infra note 12.\r                       \r\n\n     9Ideal did not move  for an extension of time  to appeal the\r\ndenial  of its  motion to  intervene/amend the  counterclaim, al-\r\nthough it  joined Fisher in a  motion to extend the  time to file\r\nthe so-called \"cross-appeal\" from the first judgment.  The latter\r\nrequest  was denied for failure  to show good  cause or excusable\r\nneglect. \r\n     We  simply add  that the  district court  did not  abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying the  motion to amend/intervene as untimely.\r\nSee  Conservation Law Found. v.  Mosbacher, 966 F.2d  39, 41 (1st\r                                                    \r\nCir.  1992).  The case had been  pending since 1990, the CFI loan\r\ntransaction had been addressed in pleadings dating back to April,\r\n1991,  and CFI  had  moved to  intervene  ten months  before  the\r\nattempted  counterclaim.   The court  rightly explained  that \"so\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\n                                   ment:   the  Fisher \"Cross-Ap-\r                                             ment:   the  Fisher \"Cross-Ap-\r                                                                           \r\n                                   peal\"  and the  Voluntary Dis-\r                                             peal\"  and the  Voluntary Dis-\r                                                                           \r\n                                   missal of the Trainor Appeal\r                                             missal of the Trainor Appeal\r                                                                         \r\n\n          Fisher  contends  that the  voluntary dismissal  of the\r\n\nTrainor  appeal  should be  vacated,  as a  collusive  attempt to\r\n\nforeclose his so-called \"cross-appeal\" from the same judgment.10-\r\n\n  CFI and Trainor respond  that Fisher has no standing  to oppose\r\n\ndismissal of the  Trainor appeal,  nor to appeal  from the  first\r\n\njudgment  in his own right,  because he elected  initially not to\r\n\ncontest CFI's  motion against  Trainor below.11   Fisher's stand-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nmuch blood  has passed  under the  bridge\" that  it would  work a\r\n\"perversion\" of the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15 to permit\r\nIdeal to introduce a new claim so late in the proceedings.  Other\r\n\"timeliness\"  criteria weighed  against  Ideal as  well.   First,\r\nappellees would  have been  unfairly prejudiced  had intervention\r\nbeen allowed.  Second, Ideal can point to no clear probability of\r\nsuccess on the merits, since its independence from Trainor during\r\nthe relevant time period, as well as Ideal's capacity to sue, are\r\nopen to serious  question.  And,  third, no \"exceptional  circum-\r\nstances\"  are suggested.   See  Banco Popular  de Puerto  Rico v.\r                                                                        \r\nGreenblatt, 964 F.2d 1227, 1231-34 (1st Cir. 1992) (setting forth\r                    \r\nfactors to  be considered in determining  timeliness of interven-\r\ntion).   Thus, the district  court properly denied  the motion to\r\namend and Ideal lacked standing to appeal. \r\n\n     10As already noted, see supra pp. 12-13, note 9, Ideal lacks\r                                            \r\nstanding to appeal either judgment.  Fisher argues that he should\r\nhave  been given prior notice and an opportunity to challenge the\r\ndismissal.  Although we agree that the better practice is to give\r\nnotice to all \"cross-appellants\"  prior to any voluntary dismiss-\r\nal, unless the  cross-appellant has joined  in an agreement  that\r\nincludes  the payment  of costs,  see Fed.  R. App. P.  42(b), in\r                                               \r\nthese circumstances  neither Fisher  nor Ideal was  prejudiced by\r\nthe failure to provide separate notice to Fisher.  See supra note\r                                                                      \r\n4 and infra pp. 14-18.\r                     \r\n\n     11We note, moreover, that Fisher's ambiguous response to the\r\nCFI motion in the  district court implicates a separate issue.  A\r\nparty may have standing to appeal, yet lose because he has waived\r\nor  forfeited the arguments  sought to be raised  on appeal.

Fisher  was a  party of  record at  the time  the first\r\n\njudgment  was entered.  Arguably, at least, he was \"aggrieved\" by\r\n\nthe  judgment since it entitled CFI alone to a constructive trust\r                                                   \r\n\nover the  Trainor claims against  Biopure    relief  which Fisher\r\n\nhad  sought  for himself  in  his  counterclaim against  Trainor.\r\n\nThus,  we conclude that Fisher  has standing to  appeal the first\r\n\njudgment  and, for present purposes, we  assume arguendo that the\r                                                                  \r\n\nappeal is not time-barred.12 \r\n\n          A motion for voluntary dismissal of an appeal should be\r\n\ndenied only \"in the  interest of justice or fairness.\"   American\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nafter it voluntarily absented itself from the proceedings).  \r\n\n     12The parties have  assumed that the appeal  period ran from\r\nthe  November 22 decision  denying his  Rule 59(e)  motion, hence\r\nthat  the January 3 notice of appeal  was late.  They disagree as\r\nto whether  the timeliness  of a cross-appeal  is jurisdictional,\r\nand, if not  jurisdictional, as to  the effect of  the denial  of\r\nappellants' motion to enlarge the time to file a cross-appeal.   \r\n     However, the  \"separate document\" rule does  apply to orders\r                                                                 \r\ndenying Rule  59(e) motions.   The lengthy  November 22  district\r\ncourt opinion  contained numerous orders, such  that, arguably at\r\nleast, the Fisher appeal period ran from the December  6 entry of\r\njudgment  against him  in  a separate  document.   See  Fiore  v.\r                                                                       \r\nWashington County Community Mental Health Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 235\r                                                        \r\nn.9 (1st Cir. 1992) (en banc); see also RR Village Ass'n, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\nDenver Sewer Corp., 826 F.2d 1197, 1201 (2d Cir. 1987) (words \"so\r                            \r\nordered\" at end of a 14-page opinion denying Rule 59(e) motion do\r\nnot satisfy \"separate document\"  requirement).  Since we conclude\r\nthat Fisher failed  to prosecute his \"cross-appeal,\" we  need not\r\ndwell on these other matters.  \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nAuto. Mfrs. Ass'n v.

We discern no legitimate basis for disallow-\r\n\ning the motion to withdraw the Trainor appeal. \r\n\n          Withdrawal of the Trainor appeal does not terminate the\r\n\nFisher  appeal  from the  same judgment,  nor  in any  way impede\r\n\nFisher's ability  to protect his own interests before this court.\r\n\nIt became clear at oral argument that Fisher's misapprehension in\r\n\nthis regard was driven by an  erroneous assumption on the part of\r\n\ncounsel that  the \"cross-appeal\" bore  the same docket  number as\r\n\nthe  Trainor appeal.   But  the  docket sheets,  as  well as  the\r\n\nappellate  rules, see Fed. R.  App. P. 12(a)  (requiring clerk to\r                               \r\n\ndocket  each notice  of  appeal when  received);  see also  First\r                                                                    \r\n\nCircuit Internal Operating Procedures VI.A.2 (1992) (\"in the case\r\n\nof cross-appeals, the appeals are treated as two separate appeals\r\n\nfor briefing  purposes\"), indicate otherwise.13   It appears that\r\n\nthis misconception also contributed to Fisher's decision to offer\r\n\nfor filing, together with  Ideal, a late so-called \"cross-appeal\"\r\n\nbrief challenging the first  judgment, and to affix to  this late\r\n\nfiling the  docket number  assigned to Trainor's  previously dis-\r\n\nmissed  appeal.   Had  Fisher  consulted  the docket  sheets  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13The parties did not  notify the Clerk that they  wished to\r\nproceed under Fed. R. App. P. 28(h).   See First Circuit Internal\r                                                    \r\nOperating Procedure VI.A.2. The  docket sheets identify Fisher as\r\nthe \"appellant and cross-claimant\" in  appeal no. 95-1092 --  the\r\nnumber  assigned  to his  \"notice  of  appeal and  cross-appeal.\"\r\n(Ideal is identified the  same way in appeal  no. 95-1091).   The\r\nTrainor docket sheet cross-references Fisher's and Ideal's appeal\r\nnumbers,  respectively labeling  the Fisher  appeal as  a \"cross-\r\nappeal\" and the Ideal appeal as a \"companion case.\"  The rules do\r\nnot  allow a party  simply to assume  as his own  a docket number\r\npreviously assigned to an appeal taken by another party. \r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ncomplied with the briefing schedule issued by the Clerk, he could\r\n\nhave offered  a complete initial  brief some three  weeks earlier\r\n\nbearing  the  pending  docket  number assigned  to  his  singular\r\n\n\"notice of appeal and cross-appeal.\" \r\n\n          We must  decide, therefore, whether  Fisher may proceed\r\n\nwith his appellate challenge  to the first judgment on  the basis\r\n\nof his  untimely and misnumbered \"cross-appeal\"  brief.  Although\r\n\nsuch mistakes  are  not jurisdictional  under  Rule 3(a),  see  9\r                                                                        \r\n\nMoore's Federal  Practice    203.12 (1995),  Fisher did  not seek\r                                   \r\n\ndiscretionary  relief from  his  errors and  omissions (e.g.,  by\r                                                                      \r\n\nrequesting  leave to file a  late supplement to  the brief timely\r\n\nfiled in number 95-1092).   Instead, he filed two  opaque motions\r\n\nclaiming that wrongdoing  by other parties relating to the volun-\r\n\ntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal had hampered his prosecution\r\n\nof  the cross-appeal.  Appellees spent  time responding  to those\r\n\nmotions and  court time was  devoted to  considering them.   As a\r\n\nfurther consequence,  there was  no occasion to  issue a  revised\r\n\nbriefing schedule,  and appellees  have had  no occasion  to file\r\n\nbriefs in response.  At this stage, therefore, it would be unfair\r\n\nto  foster  further  delay  and expense  by  countenancing  these\r\n\npractices at the expense of innocent appellees.  \r\n\n          Accordingly,  we decline  to  relieve  Fisher of  these\r\n\nerrors  and omissions, and  we direct  that his  so-called cross-\r\n\nappeal  brief be stricken from the record.

In Fisher v.

Biopure, the following  remain pending:  (1) Biopure's  third-\r                    \r\n\nparty claims against Fisher,  (2) the Fisher counterclaim against\r\n\nTrainor,15  and (3)  CFI's derivative  and direct  claims against\r\n\nBiopure.  Thus, all claims against Fisher remain in the case, and\r\n\nall parties as well.\r\n\n          There  is  a  substantial  interdependence  and overlap\r\n\nbetween pending and dismissed claims.  In Trainor v. Biopure, the\r                                                                      \r\n\npending  CFI  derivative  claims  against  Biopure  are  entirely\r\n\ndependent  on the validity  and value  of the  constructive trust\r\n\nover  the Fisher  claims.   In addition,  there is  a problematic\r\n\nfactual  overlap as  between the  pending Biopure  claims against\r\n\nFisher (for violations of RICO, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A, securities\r\n\nfraud, common  law fraud and  declaratory judgment) and  the con-\r\n\nstructive  trust,  declaratory  judgment  and  unjust  enrichment\r\n\nclaims resolved favorably to CFI. \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14Although we  consider  each of  the  consolidated  actions\r\nseparately in order  to expedite  our analysis, we  note as  well\r\nthat  there are  obvious  overlaps among  the  dismissed and  the\r\npending claims, which cut across these consolidated actions.  Cf.\r                                                                           \r\nFDIC v. Caledonia Inv.

An  earlier motion by Trainor to dismiss the\r\ncounterclaim also appears to remain pending.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n          Biopure  alleges  that  Fisher,  as  well  as  Trainor,\r\n\ndefrauded CFI in  connection with the CFI  loan transaction; that\r\n\nFisher misrepresented or failed to disclose that the funds he and\r\n\nTrainor invested  in Biopure had been  fraudulently obtained from\r\n\nCFI; and that their investment in Biopure was but one in a series\r\n\nof  fraudulent  transactions jointly  undertaken  by Trainor  and\r\n\nFisher.    Similarly, although  CFI  charged  Trainor alone  with\r\n\nactual  fraud, it alleged that Fisher \"knew or should have known\"\r\n\nthat the funds invested in Biopure had been fraudulently obtained\r\n\nfrom CFI, without consideration. \r\n\n          The overlapping  issues     the scope  of the  fraud on\r\n\nCFI, and  Fisher's knowledge, role, and  legal responsibility for\r\n\nit, if any    \"bid fair to form an essential  focus of successive\r\n\nappeals.\" Kersey, 3 F.3d at 487.  CFI and Biopure prevailed below\r                          \r\n\nby proffering  factual concessions  solely for purposes  of their\r                                                                           \r\n\nsummary judgment motions.  Their concessions    which have varied\r                                  \r\n\nsomewhat  on appeal     raise  ambiguous inferences  and actually\r\n\nconflict in  important respects.   CFI  offers to  stipulate that\r\n\nFisher  had  no actual  knowledge of  the  tainted source  of the\r\n\nfunds,  and that Trainor's fraud  on CFI was  independent of, and\r\n\ncommitted  prior to, the formation of the joint venture.  Biopure\r\n\ntenders  similar  factual  concessions based  on  fragments  from\r\n\nFisher's  pleadings, but  does  not assume  that Trainor's  prior\r\n\nfraud was independent of  the joint venture.  Both  parties offer\r\n\nto stipulate that Trainor may have defrauded Fisher as well.  \r\n\n          CFI  argues that  under Massachusetts  partnership law,\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nMass.

On the other\r\n\nhand, Biopure apparently assumes  that the joint venture must  be\r\n\n\"liable\"  for  Trainor's fraud,  or if  not  the fraud,  then the\r\n\n\"fraudulent  investment.\"   See  Mass.

We are less clear as to\r\nwhat  law the court utilized in  determining the remedy available\r\nto CFI  for  the fraudulent  loan  transaction.   Appellees  rely\r\nprimarily  on federal cases which  apply the law  of states other\r\nthan  the  forum.   See Federal  Deposit  Ins. Corp.  v.

As we need not resolve the choice-\r                \r\nof-law question, we intimate no  opinion.

(applying  Massachusetts partnership  law),\r\n\ncert. denied, 287 U.S. 612 (1932).  \r                      \r\n\n          The crux of the Rule 54(b) certification problem in the\r\n\npresent  context  is that  any  substantive ruling  based  on the\r\n\npresent record  would require that we  determine the hypothetical\r                                                                           \r\n\nreach of the governing partnership law and restitutionary princi-\r\n\nples.  The materiality of the conflicting stipulations would have\r\n\nto be  addressed and their limitations  and ambiguities resolved.\r\n\nMeanwhile, Fisher's knowledge of  the fraud and the scope  of the\r\n\nTrainor-Fisher  joint  venture would  remain  crucial, unresolved\r\n\nconsiderations  underlying the Biopure  claims.   Subsequent dis-\r\n\ntrict  court  proceedings  could  very  well  render  superfluous\r\n\nwhatever interim appellate resolution might be predicated on this\r\n\nfragile  hypothetical foundation,  and  another  panel  could  be\r\n\nrequired to  revisit the  central question of  Fisher's knowledge\r\n\nand participation in the alleged scam.   Such piecemeal appellate\r\n\nexercises sacrifice judicial  efficiency and risk serious,  unin-\r\n\ntended res judicata effects.   See Kersey, 3 F.3d at  487 (citing\r                                                   \r\n\ncases abjuring such risks). \r\n\n          On  the face  of  the pleadings  in  Fisher v.  Trainor\r                                                                           \r\n\nalone,  there appears  \"so substantial  a prospect  of contextual\r\n\noverlap\" between Fisher's dismissed  claims (against Biopure) and\r\n\nhis  unadjudicated claims  (against  Trainor),  as to  \"counsel[]\r\n\nstrongly against Rule 54(b) certification.\"  Id.  The crux of the\r                                                         \r\n\nFisher claims against both Trainor and Biopure for unjust enrich-\r\n\nment (Count  Five), and  against Biopure for  promissory estoppel\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n(Count Eight),  is that  Fisher contributed substantial  time and\r\n\nexpertise (\"sweat  equity\") to the  venture, resulting in  a sub-\r\n\nstantial increase in the  value of the Biopure stock  and product\r\n\nlicensing  rights.  In addition,  the Fisher \"breach of contract\"\r\n\nclaim against Biopure, and the \"interference with contract\" claim\r\n\nagainst Trainor, rest on identical factual allegations, viz., the\r\n\n\"switch\" in contracting parties.  See supra p. 6.\r                                                     \r\n\n          These overlapping  issues were not focused  upon in the\r\n\ndistrict court opinion granting  summary judgment to Biopure (and\r\n\na constructive trust to CFI).   The court presumably was able  to\r\n\ndisregard the  overlaps largely  because Fisher failed  to oppose\r\n\nthe motions  for summary  judgment on the  ground that  he had  a\r\n\nright to recover for his \"sweat equity\" contributions.  Thus, the\r\n\nsuccess of  the  motions for  summary judgment  depended upon  an\r\n\nassumption that Fisher's only  investment in Biopure consisted of\r                                       \r\n\nfunds fraudulently  obtained from CFI.   Notwithstanding the fact\r\n\nthat Fisher's \"sweat  equity\" was  a focus of  his complaint  and\r\n\nthat there  was competent testimonial evidence  of his efforts,17\r\n\nhe did not counter with the claim that he (or  the joint venture)\r\n\nhad contributed untainted  value which enhanced the  worth of the\r                            \r\n\nBiopure stock  and licensing rights.   Instead, he  argued simply\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     17Of  course, it was for Fisher to generate a material issue\r\nof   fact that might enable  him, and not merely  CFI, to recover\r\nfrom  Biopure  for  unjust  enrichment and  promissory  estoppel.\r\nFisher adverted to his \"sweat equity\" only as \"consideration\" for\r\na loan which Trainor allegedly promised Fisher.  See accompanying\r                                                              \r\ntext.

Biopure  stated that  no  proof  was\r\npresented below as to the value of the  claims.  Fisher's supple-\r\nmentary appendix includes an unindexed copy of the  contract, but\r\nthere is no indication  that it was before the  district court at\r\nsummary  judgment,  and we  have seen  no  record findings  as to\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\nvalue of  Fisher's belatedly asserted untainted  contributions   \r                                                  \r\n\nremain central  to the disputed  claims still pending  before the\r\n\ndistrict court.

The second judgment awarded CFI similar relief against Fisher.   The second judgment was also favorable to Biopure.   Each judgment was certified, though at different times, as final and immediately appealable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two judgments spawned appeals by three parties.   Trainor appealed from the first judgment, but then voluntarily dismissed the appeal.   Fisher noticed an appeal from the second judgment, along with a purported \"cross-appeal\" from the first judgment, as did Ideal.   Fisher and Ideal also moved to vacate the voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on a thorough record review, we conclude that:  (1) the Ideal appeal was filed late and, in all events, Ideal lacks standing to appeal;  (2) the Trainor appeal was properly dismissed;  (3) the Fisher \"cross-appeal\" brief challenging the first judgment should be stricken;  and (4) the court lacks appellate jurisdiction over Fisher's challenge to the second judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that our consideration of these appeals has been severely hampered by the failure of Fisher and Ideal to conform their briefs and appendices as required by the applicable rules.   Their briefs do not include necessary jurisdictional information, a meaningful description of the district court proceedings, nor comprehensible record references.   See Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(2)(ii), (a)(4), (e).   The first three volumes of their appendices, approximating 2500 pages, are poorly indexed, not in chronological order, and not consecutively paginated.   See Fed.R.App.P. 30(d).   Prior to oral argument, despite a careful search of the appendices and the eight volumes of record originally designated on appeal, we were unable to locate crucial pleadings and exhibits, including documents referenced in appellants' own briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, these matters were brought to appellants' attention and we invited an appropriate motion.   Appellants later sought and were granted leave to file a two-volume supplemental appendix consisting of an additional 1400 pages.   The supplement contains many--but not all--of the missing documents.   It also contains, however, unindexed documents of uncertain relevance, some of which may not have been before the district court.   Moreover, appellants did not seek leave to repaginate and rearrange the first three volumes of their appendices, obliquely explaining instead that these volumes \"have been used by the Court and parties for over three months.\"   And they failed to revise their record references to the documents cited in their briefs.   See Fed.R.App.P. 30(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is appellants' responsibility to provide the court with intelligible briefs and appendices sufficient to support their points on appeal, United States v. One Motor Yacht Named Mercury, 527 F.2d 1112, 1113 (1st Cir.1975), failing which \"the court in its discretion ... may scrutinize the merits of the case insofar as the record permits, or may dismiss the appeal if the absence of a [record] thwarts intelligent review.\"  Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1995).   Accordingly, in the instant case, wherever material uncertainties result from an incomplete or indecipherable record and impede or affect our decision, we resolve such uncertainties against appellants.   See Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 60 (1st Cir.1987) (\"It is the appellant who must bear the brunt of an insufficient record on appeal.\").   With this caveat, we recount the background facts as best we can.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although significant differences distinguish the parties' versions of the relevant facts, we recite the skeletal scenario upon which the parties predicate their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trainor, the central figure in the dispute, allegedly defrauded all the other parties.   Fisher entered into a joint venture with Trainor to invest in, and develop, Biopure's hemoglobin-based products.   Each partner was to contribute 50% of the capital needed to finance their undertaking.   Trainor was responsible for negotiating a contract with Biopure.   Fisher was to arrange for human testing of a Biopure product--Hemopure--in Guatemala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier, acting through Ideal as the nominal borrower, Trainor had obtained more than $14 million from CFI in a fraudulent loan transaction.   Although Fisher likewise was involved in the CFI loan transaction, his knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by Trainor remains in dispute.   Trainor used approximately $3 million in \"tainted\" CFI loan proceeds to finance the Biopure contract.   These monies have been traced directly from Trainor's bank account to the Biopure deal.   The \"ownership\" of this $3 million at the time it was invested in Biopure is a contested matter as between Fisher and Ideal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allegedly at about the same time, Trainor secretly forced Fisher out of the Biopure deal by substituting Bio-Vita, Trainor's own company, as the named party to the contract with Biopure.   The contract entitled Trainor to an equity interest in Biopure and licensing rights to the Biopure products.   Biopure subsequently rescinded the contract and awarded similar equity and licensing rights to Upjohn.   According to Fisher, by then the rights licensed to Upjohn were worth at least $179 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fisher sued Trainor, and later Biopure, for $250 million or a 50% share in the Biopure rights (\"Fisher v. Trainor \").   Trainor then sued Biopure.   Biopure counterclaimed against Trainor for fraud, adding Fisher as a third party defendant in the Trainor lawsuit (\"Trainor v. Biopure \").   Fisher's third party answer included a counterclaim against Trainor seeking to impose a constructive trust upon any Trainor recoveries from Biopure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first count in the Fisher v. Trainor complaint was tried to a jury in November, 1992, resulting in a special verdict that Trainor had breached a binding oral contract with Fisher whereby the two were to have shared equally in the Biopure deal.   A mistrial was declared later, however, because Trainor and Fisher were unable to agree on the meaning of the special verdict and how to proceed with respect to the separate action in Trainor v. Biopure.   We denied Fisher's ensuing petition for a writ of mandamus.  In re Peter Fisher &amp; Balfour Holdings, Inc., 7 F.3d 218 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1299, 127 L.Ed.2d 651 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CFI then intervened in the Trainor v. Biopure action, claiming a constructive trust over the Trainor and Fisher rights against Biopure.   CFI also demanded judgment on certain direct claims against Biopure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first entered summary judgment for CFI and against Trainor, imposing a constructive trust upon Trainor's claims against Biopure based on findings that:  (1) Trainor's fraud against CFI was undisputed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> (2) CFI had traced approximately $3 million of its loan funds through Trainor to the Biopure investment, and (3) all monies advanced by Trainor in furtherance of the Biopure deal were traceable to CFI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fisher did not oppose CFI's motion for summary judgment against Trainor, but ambiguously purported to reserve a right to demand a share of Trainor's rights in the Biopure transaction.   The district court accordingly ruled,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[T]he court notes the existence of another claim to rights arising from the transaction with Biopure ... Fisher claims to have had a joint venture agreement with Trainor to share in the outcome of the transaction with Biopure ... [T]his opinion does not address his claims and their effect, if any, on CFI's constructive trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">June 28, 1994 Order at 6.   The district court certified the CFI summary judgment against Trainor as final under Rule 54(b), and judgment entered on July 1, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trainor filed a premature notice of appeal shortly after Fisher moved to amend the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), notwithstanding Fisher's earlier decision not to interpose objection to the CFI motion for summary judgment.   Contemporaneously, Fisher filed a \"first amended counterclaim\" which purported to add Ideal as a party to the pending litigation for the first time.   Ideal also purported to join as a party in the Rule 59(e) motion to amend the earlier Trainor judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In response to a motion to strike the amended counterclaim, Fisher and Ideal formally moved for leave to amend it by, inter alia, \"adding Ideal as a party plaintiff.\"   Finally, CFI and Biopure moved for summary judgment against Fisher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1994, the district court issued a memorandum opinion denying the Rule 59(e) motion to amend, striking as untimely the first amended counterclaim which had attempted to insinuate Ideal as a party to the case, and granting the Biopure and CFI motions for summary judgment against Fisher.   Based on its conclusion that the only claims Fisher had asserted against Biopure were those Fisher and Trainor jointly held against Biopure, the district court ruled:  \"there is no ground whatsoever in law or equity that gives Fisher a right to share in the benefits of his co-venturer's fraud to the detriment of a prior innocent party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's memorandum order provides the following explanation for its decision to enter a second Rule 54(b) certification, covering the summary judgments against Fisher:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>In the opinion of the court the granting of these motions for summary judgment is likely to lead to the simplification of the case and the elimination of a future trial.

See Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).   On January 3, 1995, Fisher and Ideal each filed a notice of appeal.   The Fisher notice, a single document titled \"Notice of Appeal and Cross-Appeal,\" purported to notice an appeal from the December 6 judgment and a \"cross-appeal\" from the July 1 judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The Ideal notice, identically titled, likewise purported to notice an appeal from the December 6 judgment and a \"cross-appeal\" from the July 1 judgment, as well as another \"cross-appeal\" from the December 6 judgment, identified only as taken in response to Fisher's notice of appeal.   The Fisher notice was docketed as No. 95-1092;  the Ideal notice as 95-1091.   Trainor and CFI jointly moved for voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal on March 20, 1995, and the motion was granted the same day.   Fisher and Ideal moved to vacate the voluntary dismissal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Standing to Appeal (No. 95-1091)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the wording of its notice of appeal, Ideal has attempted to join in the Fisher challenge to two district court orders:  the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion to amend the first judgment (referred to as a \"cross-appeal\"), and the denial of the motion to amend the Fisher counterclaim.   Ideal was not a party of record before the district court.   Its standing to appeal thus turns on whether its attempted appellate challenges are excepted from the general rule that only parties to the district court proceedings may appeal a district court judgment.   See United States v. Little Joe Trawlers, Inc., 780 F.2d 158, 161 (1st Cir.1986).   By itself, the Ideal challenge to the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion, briefed separately under the rubric \"cross-appeal,\" appears to come within no exception to the general rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the denial of Ideal's motion to amend the Fisher counterclaim by, inter alia, \"adding Ideal as a party plaintiff,\" may have been an appealable order.   As the nominal borrower of the funds loaned by CFI, Ideal claims that it, not CFI, was entitled to assert a constructive trust over the equity claims acquired by Trainor when he wrongly diverted the loan proceeds to Biopure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Ideal thus asserts an interest at least superficially akin to those cognizable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An order denying a motion to intervene of right is immediately appealable, without the need for certification under Rule 54(b).

The appeal cannot be kept in reserve;  it must be taken within thirty days of the entry of the order, or not at all.   See B.H. by Pierce v. Murphy, 984 F.2d 196, 199 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 960, 113 S.Ct. 2930, 124 L.Ed.2d 680 (1993).   As Ideal filed no timely notice of appeal from the denial of its motion to intervene, we lack jurisdiction over its appeal.   The thirty-day appeal period extended from the date of entry (November 28, 1994) of the November 22, 1994, order denying intervention, see Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and Ideal did not file its notice of appeal until January 3, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>Appeals from the First Judgment:  the Fisher \"Cross-Appeal\" and the Voluntary Dismissal of the Trainor Appeal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fisher contends that the voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal should be vacated, as a collusive attempt to foreclose his so-called \"cross-appeal\" from the same judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  CFI and Trainor respond that Fisher has no standing to oppose dismissal of the Trainor appeal, nor to appeal from the first judgment in his own right, because he elected initially not to contest CFI's motion against Trainor below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Fisher's standing to appeal turns on his status before the district court at the time the challenged judgment was entered, and the extent to which he is \"aggrieved\" by the judgment.   See I.C.C. v. Holmes Transp. Inc., 983 F.2d 1122, 1125 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993);  Little Joe Trawlers, Inc., 780 F.2d at 161;  9 Moore's Federal Practice p 203.06.   Fisher was a party of record at the time the first judgment was entered.   Arguably, at least, he was \"aggrieved\" by the judgment since it entitled CFI alone to a constructive trust over the Trainor claims against Biopure--relief which Fisher had sought for himself in his counterclaim against Trainor.   Thus, we conclude that Fisher has standing to appeal the first judgment and, for present purposes, we assume arguendo that the appeal is not time-barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for voluntary dismissal of an appeal should be denied only \"in the interest of justice or fairness.\"  American Auto.  Mfrs. Ass'n v. Commissioner, Massachusetts DEP, 31 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.1994).   We discern no legitimate basis for disallowing the motion to withdraw the Trainor appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withdrawal of the Trainor appeal does not terminate the Fisher appeal from the same judgment, nor in any way impede Fisher's ability to protect his own interests before this court.   It became clear at oral argument that Fisher's misapprehension in this regard was driven by an erroneous assumption on the part of counsel that the \"cross-appeal\" bore the same docket number as the Trainor appeal.   But the docket sheets, as well as the appellate rules, see Fed.R.App.P. 12(a) (requiring clerk to docket each notice of appeal when received);  see also First Circuit Internal Operating Procedures VI.A.2 (1992) (\"in the case of cross-appeals, the appeals are treated as two separate appeals for briefing purposes\"), indicate otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  It appears that this misconception also contributed to Fisher's decision to offer for filing, together with Ideal, a late so-called \"cross-appeal\" brief challenging the first judgment, and to affix to this late filing the docket number assigned to Trainor's previously dismissed appeal.   Had Fisher consulted the docket sheets and complied with the briefing schedule issued by the Clerk, he could have offered a complete initial brief some three weeks earlier bearing the pending docket number assigned to his singular \"notice of appeal and cross-appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must decide, therefore, whether Fisher may proceed with his appellate challenge to the first judgment on the basis of his untimely and misnumbered \"cross-appeal\" brief.   Although such mistakes are not jurisdictional under Rule 3(a), see 9 Moore's Federal Practice p 203.12 (1995), Fisher did not seek discretionary relief from his errors and omissions (e.g., by requesting leave to file a late supplement to the brief timely filed in number 95-1092).   Instead, he filed two opaque motions claiming that wrongdoing by other parties relating to the voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal had hampered his prosecution of the cross-appeal.   Appellees spent time responding to those motions and court time was devoted to considering them.   As a further consequence, there was no occasion to issue a revised briefing schedule, and appellees have had no occasion to file briefs in response.   At this stage, therefore, it would be unfair to foster further delay and expense by countenancing these practices at the expense of innocent appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we decline to relieve Fisher of these errors and omissions, and we direct that his so-called cross-appeal brief be stricken from the record.   Cf. United States v. Hanks, 24 F.3d 1235, 1238-39 (10th Cir.1994) (declining to relieve appellant of nonjurisdictional delay in perfecting an appeal where appellant corrected the irregularity but caused additional prejudice and unnecessary consumption of court resources by failing to give notice of the correction).   As Fisher failed to take proper steps to pursue his challenge to the first judgment, we turn our attention to the final question:  the appealability of the second Rule 54(b) judgment entered below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>The Fisher Appeal from the Second Judgment:  Rule 54(b) Certification</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 54(b) permits entry of a final judgment as to fewer than all claims or parties upon an express determination that there is \"no just reason for delay\" in entering judgment.  Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 579 (1st Cir.1994).   Although no party has challenged these Rule 54(b) certifications, we are \"duty bound to take the matter up sua sponte,\" since \"it implicates the scope of our appellate jurisdiction.\"  Spiegel v. Trustees of Tufts College, 843 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.1988).   The required jurisdictional analysis comprises two steps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we inquire whether the trial court action underlying the judgment disposed of all the rights and liabilities of at least one party as to at least one claim.   See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. General Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7, 100 S.Ct. 1460, 1464, 64 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980);  10 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R.

Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 580 (the ruling should dispose \"completely either of all claims against a given defendant or of some discrete substantive claim or set of claims against the defendants generally\").   The first requirement was met here with respect to the summary judgments entered against Fisher and in favor of Biopure and CFI.   Although CFI's derivative rights against Biopure remain unresolved, as to Fisher nothing remained but to enter judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we must examine the sufficiency of the district court's assessments of (1) any interrelationship or overlap among the various legal and factual issues involved in the dismissed and the pending claims, and (2) any equities and efficiencies implicated by the requested piecemeal review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>In its critical role as a Rule 54(b) \"dispatcher\" ... the district court is to consider the strong judicial policy disfavoring piecemeal appellate review ... by carefully comparing the dismissed and the unadjudicated claims for indications of substantial overlap--to ensure that the appellate court is not confronted in successive appeals with common issues of law or fact to the detriment of judicial efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kersey v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 3 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).   When the district court provides a sufficient written statement of the grounds for certification, as it should, \"we normally accord its discretionary decision 'substantial deference' and will dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction only if the court's certification was 'clearly unreasonable.' \"  Id. at 486 (citation omitted);  see also Curtiss-Wright, 446 U.S. at 10, 100 S.Ct. at 1466 (\"The court of appeals must of course, scrutinize the district court's evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship of the claims ...

The district court certification contained no evaluation of the interdependence of dismissed and pending claims, no identification or analysis of the remaining claims, and no reference to \"compelling evidence that the equities favor early appellate review.\"  Id.  Consequently, we have culled the entire record on appeal for any \"compelling considerations favoring the entry of an earlier than usual judgment,\" such as might warrant a piecemeal appellate review notwithstanding the absence of specific findings.  Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 43 n. 4);  see also Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 936 (1st Cir.1995) (nothing is gained by remanding a case for entry of a properly-crafted judgment where in due course the same issues will be returned to the appellate court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the appeal was taken from the judgment against Fisher, the only appropriate consideration apparently favoring Rule 54(b) certification was the possibility that it (in combination with the earlier judgment against Trainor) might prod the parties to settle their differences, particularly in light of the fact that the district court rulings effectively substituted CFI as the sole plaintiff with respect to the purported joint venturers' claims against Biopure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still in the case, however, were all the same claims, with CFI as a derivative plaintiff on some.   Moreover, all parties remained in the case in connection with other claims.  \"Rule 54(b) certification is particularly suspect when the contestants on appeal remain, simultaneously, contestants below.\"  Kersey, 3 F.3d at 487 (citations omitted);  cf. Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 40 (upholding a district court certification which lacked specific findings, but where the judgment had disposed of all claims against all six appellees).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settlements during the pendency of the present appeal did winnow out some claims.   Trainor settled with CFI and Biopure.   Appellees suggest that there will be a further reduction in the number of pending claims should we affirm the district court judgment.   CFI and Biopure represent that they have conditionally settled CFI's derivative claims between themselves.   At oral argument, all parties indicated that they would likely forgo their remaining claims were the court to affirm the judgment against Fisher.   These prospects nonetheless do not affect the required threshold jurisdictional analysis:  \"To entertain an early appeal just because ... a [particular] ruling ... might transpire and might expedite a particular [party's] case would defoliate Rule 54(b)'s protective copse.\"  Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we scan the present landscape, the following claims remain pending before the district court.   In Fisher v. Trainor, all Fisher claims against Trainor remain pending.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  In Trainor v. Biopure, the following remain pending:  (1) Biopure's third-party claims against Fisher, (2) the Fisher counterclaim against Trainor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and (3) CFI's derivative and direct claims against Biopure.   Thus, all claims against Fisher remain in the case, and all parties as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a substantial interdependence and overlap between pending and dismissed claims.   In Trainor v. Biopure, the pending CFI derivative claims against Biopure are entirely dependent on the validity and value of the constructive trust over the Fisher claims.   In addition, there is a problematic factual overlap as between the pending Biopure claims against Fisher (for violations of RICO, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, securities fraud, common law fraud and declaratory judgment) and the constructive trust, declaratory judgment and unjust enrichment claims resolved favorably to CFI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biopure alleges that Fisher, as well as Trainor, defrauded CFI in connection with the CFI loan transaction;  that Fisher misrepresented or failed to disclose that the funds he and Trainor invested in Biopure had been fraudulently obtained from CFI;  and that their investment in Biopure was but one in a series of fraudulent transactions jointly undertaken by Trainor and Fisher.   Similarly, although CFI charged Trainor alone with actual fraud, it alleged that Fisher \"knew or should have known\" that the funds invested in Biopure had been fraudulently obtained from CFI, without consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overlapping issues--the scope of the fraud on CFI, and Fisher's knowledge, role, and legal responsibility for it, if any--\"bid fair to form an essential focus of successive appeals.\"  Kersey, 3 F.3d at 487.   CFI and Biopure prevailed below by proffering factual concessions solely for purposes of their summary judgment motions.   Their concessions--which have varied somewhat on appeal--raise ambiguous inferences and actually conflict in important respects.   CFI offers to stipulate that Fisher had no actual knowledge of the tainted source of the funds, and that Trainor's fraud on CFI was independent of, and committed prior to, the formation of the joint venture.   Biopure tenders similar factual concessions based on fragments from Fisher's pleadings, but does not assume that Trainor's prior fraud was independent of the joint venture.   Both parties offer to stipulate that Trainor may have defrauded Fisher as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CFI argues that under Massachusetts partnership law, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 108A, &#167; 12, and equitable restitutionary principles, it is entitled to a constructive trust over Fisher's claims without regard to Fisher's state of mind, because Trainor's independently-acquired guilty knowledge is to be \"imputed\" automatically to the Trainor-Fisher joint venture.   On the other hand, Biopure apparently assumes that the joint venture must be \"liable\" for Trainor's fraud, or if not the fraud, then the \"fraudulent investment.\"   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 108A, &#167; 13.   Their theories are problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determinative equity-based principles at work here are highly fact-sensitive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  See Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167;&#167; 274 cmts. b &amp; c, 282 cmts. h &amp; i (1958);  Restatement of Restitution &#167;&#167; 172-74, 202, 203, 208(3), 210-213, 215 (1937);  1 Alan R.

The materiality of the conflicting stipulations would have to be addressed and their limitations and ambiguities resolved.   Meanwhile, Fisher's knowledge of the fraud and the scope of the Trainor-Fisher joint venture would remain crucial, unresolved considerations underlying the Biopure claims.   Subsequent district court proceedings could very well render superfluous whatever interim appellate resolution might be predicated on this fragile hypothetical foundation, and another panel could be required to revisit the central question of Fisher's knowledge and participation in the alleged scam.   Such piecemeal appellate exercises sacrifice judicial efficiency and risk serious, unintended res judicata effects.   See Kersey, 3 F.3d at 487 (citing cases abjuring such risks).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the face of the pleadings in Fisher v. Trainor alone, there appears \"so substantial a prospect of contextual overlap\" between Fisher's dismissed claims (against Biopure) and his unadjudicated claims (against Trainor), as to \"counsel[ ] strongly against Rule 54(b) certification.\"  Id.  The crux of the Fisher claims against both Trainor and Biopure for unjust enrichment (Count Five), and against Biopure for promissory estoppel (Count Eight), is that Fisher contributed substantial time and expertise (\"sweat equity\") to the venture, resulting in a substantial increase in the value of the Biopure stock and product licensing rights.   In addition, the Fisher \"breach of contract\" claim against Biopure, and the \"interference with contract\" claim against Trainor, rest on identical factual allegations, viz., the \"switch\" in contracting parties.

The court presumably was able to disregard the overlaps largely because Fisher failed to oppose the motions for summary judgment on the ground that he had a right to recover for his \"sweat equity\" contributions.   Thus, the success of the motions for summary judgment depended upon an assumption that Fisher's only investment in Biopure consisted of funds fraudulently obtained from CFI.   Notwithstanding the fact that Fisher's \"sweat equity\" was a focus of his complaint and that there was competent testimonial evidence of his efforts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> he did not counter with the claim that he (or the joint venture) had contributed un tainted value which enhanced the worth of the Biopure stock and licensing rights.   Instead, he argued simply that he was a bona fide purchaser of the loan funds fraudulently obtained from CFI by Trainor, on the theory that Trainor had made a false promise to lend the CFI monies to Fisher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By offering his \"sweat equity\" theory of recovery for the first time at oral argument on appeal, Fisher essentially urged that we relieve him of his district court waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  But the Rule 54(b) safeguards against inefficient piecemeal review would be severely undermined were we to attempt to speculate at this juncture as to the labyrinthine consequences of Fisher's failure to assert this theory before the district court in the first instance.   Moreover, an argument \"surfacing for the first time on appeal\" may be excepted from the raise-or-waive rule only if it is \"so compelling as virtually to insure appellant's success, and a gross miscarriage of justice would result from [the] failure to address it.\"  American Auto.  Mfrs. Ass'n, 31 F.3d at 26;  see also Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890, 893 (1st Cir.1979) (waiver rule is relaxed only in \"horrendous cases\" where a gross miscarriage would occur).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fortiori, we think it clear that the waiver rule should be rigorously applied to interlocutory appeals certified pursuant to Rule 54(b).   The strength of the forfeited Fisher theory can be assessed only by focusing on the core factual allegations underlying both the dismissed and the pending claims, as well as the closely intertwined legal issues governing any remedy.   See and compare, e.g., Meehan v. Shaughnessy, 404 Mass. 419, 445-46, 535 N.E.2d 1255, 1270 (1989) (award of constructive trust based on usurped partnership opportunities may entail a proportionate assessment of profits generated by each partner's efforts);  Provencher v. Berman, 699 F.2d 568, 572 (1st Cir.1983) (allowing non-partner wrongdoers to retain proportionate share of property held in constructive trust for another where wrongdoers had contributed value to the property in the form of un tainted personal labor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"gross miscarriage of justice\" test likewise requires consideration of interrelated factual and legal theories.   Typically, a miscarriage of justice may be shown where a litigant would suffer grave personal harm, such as a loss of liberty or domicile, see American Auto.  Mfrs. Ass'n, 31 F.3d at 26 (citations), or where the issue involves sensitive matters of federalism or the public interest.   See Capitol Indem. Corp. v. Keller, 717 F.2d 324, 328-29 (7th Cir.1983).   A \"gross miscarriage of justice\" also may be found, however, if the forfeited claim would \"seriously effect[ ] [sic] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of a proceeding.\"  Desjardins v. Van Buren Community Hosp., 969 F.2d 1280, 1282 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any showing that a \"miscarriage of justice\" might obtain in the present context ultimately would depend on whether the constructive trust awarded CFI constituted an unwarranted \"windfall,\" grossly disproportionate to any losses.   However, the injustice in any such \"windfall\" is inextricably bound to the remedial principles utilized to resolve the dismissed claims and the pending claims.   See, e.g., Provencher, 699 F.2d at 570-72 (applying restitutionary principles where more than one claimant contributed to value of property claimed under constructive trust);  Janigan v. Taylor, 344 F.2d 781, 787 (1st Cir.)  (explaining restitutionary principles applicable to \"constructive trust\" remedy), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 879, 86 S.Ct. 163, 15 L.Ed.2d 120 (1965);  see generally 1 George E. Palmer, Law of Restitution &#167; 2.14 (1978 &amp; Supp.1995);  Austin W. Scott &amp; William F. Fratcher, Scott on Trusts &#167; 508 (4th ed. 1989 &amp; Supp.1994);  Dale A. Oesterle, Deficiencies of the Restitutionary Right to Trace Misappropriated Property in Equity and in UCC &#167; 9-306, 68 Cornell L.Rev. 172 (1983).   Moreover, crucial, unresolved facts--including the value of the claims over which CFI has been awarded a constructive trust,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> and the value of Fisher's belatedly asserted un-tainted contributions--remain central to the disputed claims still pending before the district court.   Thus, the insufficiently developed trial court record precludes any reliable determination as to whether a miscarriage of justice would obtain were the waiver rule to be applied to the Fisher v. Trainor action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) As the second Rule 54(b) certification was improvidently granted, we lack appellate jurisdiction of the Fisher appeal in No. 95-1092, which is hereby dismissed without prejudice;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) the Ideal appeal in No. 95-1091 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction and lack of standing;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) the motion to vacate the voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal in No. 94-1854 is denied, and the so-called \"cross-appeal brief\" filed by Fisher and Ideal in No. 94-1854 is hereby stricken;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) double costs are awarded to CFI and Biopure.

In the same Ohio action, a default judgment was entered against Ideal and remains outstanding, according to CFI, because Ideal is defunct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The docket sheets list two Rule 59(e) motions filed on the same day, one by Ideal and one by Fisher, but we can locate only one such motion in the appendix and record.   It purports to have been \"submitted\" by both Fisher and Ideal, although it is titled \"Ideal's Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment.\"   Fisher complains that the district court never ruled on his motion.   Given the record before us, however, we conclude that there was a single, joint motion, which was denied by the court.   See accompanying text</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The term \"cross-appeal\" is a misnomer in this context.   It normally denotes an appeal by an initial appellee against the initial appellant from an order or decision entered in favor of the initial appellant.   See 9 James Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 204.11 (1995).   Fisher and Ideal were not named as appellees in the Trainor appeal, and their so-called \"cross-appeals,\" as a logical matter, were separate appeals from the first judgment in favor of appellee CFI, not the original appellant--Trainor.   Ideal's additional \"cross-appeal\" against Fisher is simply an enigma</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We reserved decision on this motion pending oral argument.   Fisher and Ideal then filed an opaque motion to consolidate the dismissed and pending appeals, which we denied</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> There are no district court findings which would enable confident determinations as to who controlled Ideal at various material times.   Moreover, the record suggests that Ideal was a shell, wholly owned and controlled by Trainor, at the time of the CFI loan.   During the CFI loan transaction (\"in or about 1989\"), however, Fisher allegedly gained control of Ideal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> See supra note 6.   Ideal purports to be a bona fide purchaser of the CFI loan proceeds, so as to cut off any right CFI might have to \"trace\" its loan funds into the Biopure deal.   Ideal claims that, through Fisher, it innocently acquiesced in the CFI loan arranged by Trainor, then innocently redirected the loan proceeds to Trainor (allegedly for the purchase of a worthless landfill).   Trainor used the money to finance the Biopure deal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The entry of the Rule 54(b) judgment against Fisher on December 6, 1994, did not enlarge the appeal period, for two reasons.   The judgment did not include Ideal's claims and, as an exception to Rule 54(b), the denial of intervention was appealable without an \"express direction for the entry of judgment\" on a separate document.   Cf. Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 701 (1st Cir.1991).   Since Ideal sought intervention in the still-pending litigation, and not relief from a final judgment, there is no reason to consider further the applicability of the \"separate document\" rule in relation to the denial of this motion.   Compare infra note 12</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Ideal did not move for an extension of time to appeal the denial of its motion to intervene/amend the counterclaim, although it joined Fisher in a motion to extend the time to file the so-called \"cross-appeal\" from the first judgment.   The latter request was denied for failure to show good cause or excusable neglect</p>\n        <p>We simply add that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend/intervene as untimely.   See Conservation Law Found. v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir.1992).   The case had been pending since 1990, the CFI loan transaction had been addressed in pleadings dating back to April, 1991, and CFI had moved to intervene ten months before the attempted counterclaim.   The court rightly explained that \"so much blood has passed under the bridge\" that it would work a \"perversion\" of the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15 to permit Ideal to introduce a new claim so late in the proceedings.   Other \"timeliness\" criteria weighed against Ideal as well.   First, appellees would have been unfairly prejudiced had intervention been allowed.   Second, Ideal can point to no clear probability of success on the merits, since its independence from Trainor during the relevant time period, as well as Ideal's capacity to sue, are open to serious question.   And, third, no \"exceptional circumstances\" are suggested.   See Banco Popular de Puerto Rico v. Greenblatt, 964 F.2d 1227, 1231-34 (1st Cir.1992) (setting forth factors to be considered in determining timeliness of intervention).   Thus, the district court properly denied the motion to amend and Ideal lacked standing to appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> As already noted, see supra pp. 704, note 9, Ideal lacks standing to appeal either judgment.   Fisher argues that he should have been given prior notice and an opportunity to challenge the dismissal.   Although we agree that the better practice is to give notice to all \"cross-appellants\" prior to any voluntary dismissal, unless the cross-appellant has joined in an agreement that includes the payment of costs, see Fed.R.App.P. 42(b), in these circumstances neither Fisher nor Ideal was prejudiced by the failure to provide separate notice to Fisher.   See supra note 4 and infra pp. 704-706</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We note, moreover, that Fisher's ambiguous response to the CFI motion in the district court implicates a separate issue.   A party may have standing to appeal, yet lose because he has waived or forfeited the arguments sought to be raised on appeal.   Cf. Dopp v. HTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 512 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a defendant who was dismissed from the case for lack of personal jurisdiction had no standing to appeal judgments entered after it voluntarily absented itself from the proceedings)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The parties have assumed that the appeal period ran from the November 22 decision denying his Rule 59(e) motion, hence that the January 3 notice of appeal was late.   They disagree as to whether the timeliness of a cross-appeal is jurisdictional, and, if not jurisdictional, as to the effect of the denial of appellants' motion to enlarge the time to file a cross-appeal</p>\n        <p>However, the \"separate document\" rule does apply to orders denying Rule 59(e) motions.   The lengthy November 22 district court opinion contained numerous orders, such that, arguably at least, the Fisher appeal period ran from the December 6 entry of judgment against him in a separate document.   See Fiore v. Washington County Community Mental Health Ctr., 960 F.2d 229, 235 n. 9 (1st Cir.1992) (en banc);  see also RR Village Ass'n, Inc. v. Denver Sewer Corp., 826 F.2d 1197, 1201 (2d Cir.1987) (words \"so ordered\" at end of a 14-page opinion denying Rule 59(e) motion do not satisfy \"separate document\" requirement).   Since we conclude that Fisher failed to prosecute his \"cross-appeal,\" we need not dwell on these other matters.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The parties did not notify the Clerk that they wished to proceed under Fed.R.App.P. 28(h).   See First Circuit Internal Operating Procedure VI.A.2.   The docket sheets identify Fisher as the \"appellant and cross-claimant\" in appeal no. 95-1092--the number assigned to his \"notice of appeal and cross-appeal.\"  (Ideal is identified the same way in appeal no. 95-1091).   The Trainor docket sheet cross-references Fisher's and Ideal's appeal numbers, respectively labeling the Fisher appeal as a \"cross-appeal\" and the Ideal appeal as a \"companion case.\"   The rules do not allow a party simply to assume as his own a docket number previously assigned to an appeal taken by another party</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Although we consider each of the consolidated actions separately in order to expedite our analysis, we note as well that there are obvious overlaps among the dismissed and the pending claims, which cut across these consolidated actions.   Cf. FDIC v. Caledonia Inv. Corp., 862 F.2d 378, 381 (1st Cir.1988)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Apparently, no judgment has been entered on this counterclaim, although the district court denied Fisher's motion to expand and amend it, and the logic of the two judgments in favor of CFI may moot it.   An earlier motion by Trainor to dismiss the counterclaim also appears to remain pending</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The district court made no express choice-of-law determination, but assumed, as do the parties, that Massachusetts law governs the partnership issues (the Trainor-Fisher joint venture allegedly was formed in Massachusetts).   We are less clear as to what law the court utilized in determining the remedy available to CFI for the fraudulent loan transaction.   Appellees rely primarily on federal cases which apply the law of states other than the forum.   See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Braemoor Assocs., 686 F.2d 550 (7th Cir.1982) (Illinois law), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 927, 103 S.Ct. 2086, 77 L.Ed.2d 297 (1983);  Higgins v. Shenango Pottery Co., 256 F.2d 504 (3d Cir.1958) and 279 F.2d 46 (3d Cir.)  (Pennsylvania law), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 899, 81 S.Ct. 232, 5 L.Ed.2d 193 (1960).   As we need not resolve the choice-of-law question, we intimate no opinion.   We note only that the cited rulings likewise were highly fact-dependent, and are of little assistance given the ambiguities and conflicts in the hypothesized facts presented in the instant case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Of course, it was for Fisher to generate a material issue of fact that might enable him, and not merely CFI, to recover from Biopure for unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel.   Fisher adverted to his \"sweat equity\" only as \"consideration\" for a loan which Trainor allegedly promised Fisher.   See accompanying text.   Passing mention of facts from which a theory might later be carved does not place an undeveloped argument in issue.  United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Fisher made reference to this theory in an \"introductory\" comment to his reply brief as well.   Arguments omitted from an opening brief on appeal ordinarily are deemed waived.   See Pignons S.A. de Mecanique v. Polaroid Corp., 701 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1983) (\"An appellee is entitled to rely on the content of an appellant's brief for the scope of the issues appealed, and appellant generally may not preserve a claim merely by referring to it in a reply brief or at oral argument.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> New arguments may be entertained on appeal in \"exceptional circumstances\" where no prejudice would result either to other parties or to the administration of justice.

Fact Concerts, 453 U.S. 247, 255, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 2753-54, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981) (holding that a forfeited claim may be considered on appeal where the trial court addressed the merits of a belated objection, and the appellate court does not disagree with the substance of the trial court ruling)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> Fisher asserted at oral argument that these claims were worth at least $179 million, an estimate apparently based on the Biopure/Upjohn contract.

Fisher and Ideal also moved to vacate the voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on a thorough record review, we conclude that:  (1) the Ideal appeal was filed late and, in all events, Ideal lacks standing to appeal;  (2) the Trainor appeal was properly dismissed;  (3) the Fisher \"cross-appeal\" brief challenging the first judgment should be stricken;  and (4) the court lacks appellate jurisdiction over Fisher's challenge to the second judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that our consideration of these appeals has been severely hampered by the failure of Fisher and Ideal to conform their briefs and appendices as required by the applicable rules.   Their briefs do not include necessary jurisdictional information, a meaningful description of the district court proceedings, nor comprehensible record references.   See Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(2)(ii), (a)(4), (e).   The first three volumes of their appendices, approximating 2500 pages, are poorly indexed, not in chronological order, and not consecutively paginated.   See Fed.R.App.P. 30(d).   Prior to oral argument, despite a careful search of the appendices and the eight volumes of record originally designated on appeal, we were unable to locate crucial pleadings and exhibits, including documents referenced in appellants' own briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, these matters were brought to appellants' attention and we invited an appropriate motion.   Appellants later sought and were granted leave to file a two-volume supplemental appendix consisting of an additional 1400 pages.   The supplement contains many--but not all--of the missing documents.   It also contains, however, unindexed documents of uncertain relevance, some of which may not have been before the district court.   Moreover, appellants did not seek leave to repaginate and rearrange the first three volumes of their appendices, obliquely explaining instead that these volumes \"have been used by the Court and parties for over three months.\"   And they failed to revise their record references to the documents cited in their briefs.   See Fed.R.App.P. 30(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is appellants' responsibility to provide the court with intelligible briefs and appendices sufficient to support their points on appeal, United States v.

Fisher entered into a joint venture with Trainor to invest in, and develop, Biopure's hemoglobin-based products.   Each partner was to contribute 50% of the capital needed to finance their undertaking.   Trainor was responsible for negotiating a contract with Biopure.   Fisher was to arrange for human testing of a Biopure product--Hemopure--in Guatemala.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier, acting through Ideal as the nominal borrower, Trainor had obtained more than $14 million from CFI in a fraudulent loan transaction.   Although Fisher likewise was involved in the CFI loan transaction, his knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by Trainor remains in dispute.   Trainor used approximately $3 million in \"tainted\" CFI loan proceeds to finance the Biopure contract.   These monies have been traced directly from Trainor's bank account to the Biopure deal.   The \"ownership\" of this $3 million at the time it was invested in Biopure is a contested matter as between Fisher and Ideal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allegedly at about the same time, Trainor secretly forced Fisher out of the Biopure deal by substituting Bio-Vita, Trainor's own company, as the named party to the contract with Biopure.   The contract entitled Trainor to an equity interest in Biopure and licensing rights to the Biopure products.   Biopure subsequently rescinded the contract and awarded similar equity and licensing rights to Upjohn.   According to Fisher, by then the rights licensed to Upjohn were worth at least $179 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fisher sued Trainor, and later Biopure, for $250 million or a 50% share in the Biopure rights (\"Fisher v. Trainor \").   Trainor then sued Biopure.   Biopure counterclaimed against Trainor for fraud, adding Fisher as a third party defendant in the Trainor lawsuit (\"Trainor v. Biopure \").   Fisher's third party answer included a counterclaim against Trainor seeking to impose a constructive trust upon any Trainor recoveries from Biopure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first count in the Fisher v. Trainor complaint was tried to a jury in November, 1992, resulting in a special verdict that Trainor had breached a binding oral contract with Fisher whereby the two were to have shared equally in the Biopure deal.   A mistrial was declared later, however, because Trainor and Fisher were unable to agree on the meaning of the special verdict and how to proceed with respect to the separate action in Trainor v. Biopure.   We denied Fisher's ensuing petition for a writ of mandamus.

Contemporaneously, Fisher filed a \"first amended counterclaim\" which purported to add Ideal as a party to the pending litigation for the first time.   Ideal also purported to join as a party in the Rule 59(e) motion to amend the earlier Trainor judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In response to a motion to strike the amended counterclaim, Fisher and Ideal formally moved for leave to amend it by, inter alia, \"adding Ideal as a party plaintiff.\"   Finally, CFI and Biopure moved for summary judgment against Fisher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1994, the district court issued a memorandum opinion denying the Rule 59(e) motion to amend, striking as untimely the first amended counterclaim which had attempted to insinuate Ideal as a party to the case, and granting the Biopure and CFI motions for summary judgment against Fisher.   Based on its conclusion that the only claims Fisher had asserted against Biopure were those Fisher and Trainor jointly held against Biopure, the district court ruled:  \"there is no ground whatsoever in law or equity that gives Fisher a right to share in the benefits of his co-venturer's fraud to the detriment of a prior innocent party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's memorandum order provides the following explanation for its decision to enter a second Rule 54(b) certification, covering the summary judgments against Fisher:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>In the opinion of the court the granting of these motions for summary judgment is likely to lead to the simplification of the case and the elimination of a future trial.

See Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).   On January 3, 1995, Fisher and Ideal each filed a notice of appeal.   The Fisher notice, a single document titled \"Notice of Appeal and Cross-Appeal,\" purported to notice an appeal from the December 6 judgment and a \"cross-appeal\" from the July 1 judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The Ideal notice, identically titled, likewise purported to notice an appeal from the December 6 judgment and a \"cross-appeal\" from the July 1 judgment, as well as another \"cross-appeal\" from the December 6 judgment, identified only as taken in response to Fisher's notice of appeal.   The Fisher notice was docketed as No. 95-1092;  the Ideal notice as 95-1091.   Trainor and CFI jointly moved for voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal on March 20, 1995, and the motion was granted the same day.   Fisher and Ideal moved to vacate the voluntary dismissal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Standing to Appeal (No. 95-1091)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the wording of its notice of appeal, Ideal has attempted to join in the Fisher challenge to two district court orders:  the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion to amend the first judgment (referred to as a \"cross-appeal\"), and the denial of the motion to amend the Fisher counterclaim.   Ideal was not a party of record before the district court.   Its standing to appeal thus turns on whether its attempted appellate challenges are excepted from the general rule that only parties to the district court proceedings may appeal a district court judgment.   See United States v. Little Joe Trawlers, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462589\"><a href=\"/opinion/462589/united-states-v-little-joe-trawlers-inc-jerry-daughton-intervenors/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 161 (1st Cir.1986).

See I.C.C. v. Holmes Transp. Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598968\"><a href=\"/opinion/598968/fed-carr-cas-p-83804-interstate-commerce-commission-v-holmes/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span>, 1125 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993);  Little Joe Trawlers, Inc., 780 F.2d at 161;  9 Moore's Federal Practice p 203.06.   Fisher was a party of record at the time the first judgment was entered.   Arguably, at least, he was \"aggrieved\" by the judgment since it entitled CFI alone to a constructive trust over the Trainor claims against Biopure--relief which Fisher had sought for himself in his counterclaim against Trainor.   Thus, we conclude that Fisher has standing to appeal the first judgment and, for present purposes, we assume arguendo that the appeal is not time-barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for voluntary dismissal of an appeal should be denied only \"in the interest of justice or fairness.\"  American Auto.

It became clear at oral argument that Fisher's misapprehension in this regard was driven by an erroneous assumption on the part of counsel that the \"cross-appeal\" bore the same docket number as the Trainor appeal.   But the docket sheets, as well as the appellate rules, see Fed.R.App.P. 12(a) (requiring clerk to docket each notice of appeal when received);  see also First Circuit Internal Operating Procedures VI.A.2 (1992) (\"in the case of cross-appeals, the appeals are treated as two separate appeals for briefing purposes\"), indicate otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  It appears that this misconception also contributed to Fisher's decision to offer for filing, together with Ideal, a late so-called \"cross-appeal\" brief challenging the first judgment, and to affix to this late filing the docket number assigned to Trainor's previously dismissed appeal.   Had Fisher consulted the docket sheets and complied with the briefing schedule issued by the Clerk, he could have offered a complete initial brief some three weeks earlier bearing the pending docket number assigned to his singular \"notice of appeal and cross-appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must decide, therefore, whether Fisher may proceed with his appellate challenge to the first judgment on the basis of his untimely and misnumbered \"cross-appeal\" brief.   Although such mistakes are not jurisdictional under Rule 3(a), see 9 Moore's Federal Practice p 203.12 (1995), Fisher did not seek discretionary relief from his errors and omissions (e.g., by requesting leave to file a late supplement to the brief timely filed in number 95-1092).   Instead, he filed two opaque motions claiming that wrongdoing by other parties relating to the voluntary dismissal of the Trainor appeal had hampered his prosecution of the cross-appeal.   Appellees spent time responding to those motions and court time was devoted to considering them.   As a further consequence, there was no occasion to issue a revised briefing schedule, and appellees have had no occasion to file briefs in response.   At this stage, therefore, it would be unfair to foster further delay and expense by countenancing these practices at the expense of innocent appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we decline to relieve Fisher of these errors and omissions, and we direct that his so-called cross-appeal brief be stricken from the record.   Cf. United States v.

As Fisher failed to take proper steps to pursue his challenge to the first judgment, we turn our attention to the final question:  the appealability of the second Rule 54(b) judgment entered below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>The Fisher Appeal from the Second Judgment:  Rule 54(b) Certification</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 54(b) permits entry of a final judgment as to fewer than all claims or parties upon an express determination that there is \"no just reason for delay\" in entering judgment.

Moreover, all parties remained in the case in connection with other claims.  \"Rule 54(b) certification is particularly suspect when the contestants on appeal remain, simultaneously, contestants below.\"  Kersey, 3 F.3d at 487 (citations omitted);  cf.

Trainor settled with CFI and Biopure.   Appellees suggest that there will be a further reduction in the number of pending claims should we affirm the district court judgment.   CFI and Biopure represent that they have conditionally settled CFI's derivative claims between themselves.   At oral argument, all parties indicated that they would likely forgo their remaining claims were the court to affirm the judgment against Fisher.   These prospects nonetheless do not affect the required threshold jurisdictional analysis:  \"To entertain an early appeal just because ... a [particular] ruling ... might transpire and might expedite a particular [party's] case would defoliate Rule 54(b)'s protective copse.\"  Spiegel, 843 F.2d at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we scan the present landscape, the following claims remain pending before the district court.   In Fisher v. Trainor, all Fisher claims against Trainor remain pending.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  In Trainor v. Biopure, the following remain pending:  (1) Biopure's third-party claims against Fisher, (2) the Fisher counterclaim against Trainor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> and (3) CFI's derivative and direct claims against Biopure.   Thus, all claims against Fisher remain in the case, and all parties as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a substantial interdependence and overlap between pending and dismissed claims.   In Trainor v. Biopure, the pending CFI derivative claims against Biopure are entirely dependent on the validity and value of the constructive trust over the Fisher claims.   In addition, there is a problematic factual overlap as between the pending Biopure claims against Fisher (for violations of RICO, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, securities fraud, common law fraud and declaratory judgment) and the constructive trust, declaratory judgment and unjust enrichment claims resolved favorably to CFI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biopure alleges that Fisher, as well as Trainor, defrauded CFI in connection with the CFI loan transaction;  that Fisher misrepresented or failed to disclose that the funds he and Trainor invested in Biopure had been fraudulently obtained from CFI;  and that their investment in Biopure was but one in a series of fraudulent transactions jointly undertaken by Trainor and Fisher.   Similarly, although CFI charged Trainor alone with actual fraud, it alleged that Fisher \"knew or should have known\" that the funds invested in Biopure had been fraudulently obtained from CFI, without consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overlapping issues--the scope of the fraud on CFI, and Fisher's knowledge, role, and legal responsibility for it, if any--\"bid fair to form an essential focus of successive appeals.\"  Kersey, 3 F.3d at 487.   CFI and Biopure prevailed below by proffering factual concessions solely for purposes of their summary judgment motions.   Their concessions--which have varied somewhat on appeal--raise ambiguous inferences and actually conflict in important respects.   CFI offers to stipulate that Fisher had no actual knowledge of the tainted source of the funds, and that Trainor's fraud on CFI was independent of, and committed prior to, the formation of the joint venture.   Biopure tenders similar factual concessions based on fragments from Fisher's pleadings, but does not assume that Trainor's prior fraud was independent of the joint venture.   Both parties offer to stipulate that Trainor may have defrauded Fisher as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CFI argues that under Massachusetts partnership law, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 108A, &#167; 12, and equitable restitutionary principles, it is entitled to a constructive trust over Fisher's claims without regard to Fisher's state of mind, because Trainor's independently-acquired guilty knowledge is to be \"imputed\" automatically to the Trainor-Fisher joint venture.   On the other hand, Biopure apparently assumes that the joint venture must be \"liable\" for Trainor's fraud, or if not the fraud, then the \"fraudulent investment.\"   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 108A, &#167; 13.

The materiality of the conflicting stipulations would have to be addressed and their limitations and ambiguities resolved.   Meanwhile, Fisher's knowledge of the fraud and the scope of the Trainor-Fisher joint venture would remain crucial, unresolved considerations underlying the Biopure claims.   Subsequent district court proceedings could very well render superfluous whatever interim appellate resolution might be predicated on this fragile hypothetical foundation, and another panel could be required to revisit the central question of Fisher's knowledge and participation in the alleged scam.   Such piecemeal appellate exercises sacrifice judicial efficiency and risk serious, unintended res judicata effects.   See Kersey, 3 F.3d at 487 (citing cases abjuring such risks).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the face of the pleadings in Fisher v. Trainor alone, there appears \"so substantial a prospect of contextual overlap\" between Fisher's dismissed claims (against Biopure) and his unadjudicated claims (against Trainor), as to \"counsel[ ] strongly against Rule 54(b) certification.\"  Id.  The crux of the Fisher claims against both Trainor and Biopure for unjust enrichment (Count Five), and against Biopure for promissory estoppel (Count Eight), is that Fisher contributed substantial time and expertise (\"sweat equity\") to the venture, resulting in a substantial increase in the value of the Biopure stock and product licensing rights.   In addition, the Fisher \"breach of contract\" claim against Biopure, and the \"interference with contract\" claim against Trainor, rest on identical factual allegations, viz., the \"switch\" in contracting parties.   See supra p. 701.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These overlapping issues were not focused upon in the district court opinion granting summary judgment to Biopure (and a constructive trust to CFI).   The court presumably was able to disregard the overlaps largely because Fisher failed to oppose the motions for summary judgment on the ground that he had a right to recover for his \"sweat equity\" contributions.   Thus, the success of the motions for summary judgment depended upon an assumption that Fisher's only investment in Biopure consisted of funds fraudulently obtained from CFI.   Notwithstanding the fact that Fisher's \"sweat equity\" was a focus of his complaint and that there was competent testimonial evidence of his efforts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> he did not counter with the claim that he (or the joint venture) had contributed un tainted value which enhanced the worth of the Biopure stock and licensing rights.   Instead, he argued simply that he was a bona fide purchaser of the loan funds fraudulently obtained from CFI by Trainor, on the theory that Trainor had made a false promise to lend the CFI monies to Fisher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By offering his \"sweat equity\" theory of recovery for the first time at oral argument on appeal, Fisher essentially urged that we relieve him of his district court waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  But the Rule 54(b) safeguards against inefficient piecemeal review would be severely undermined were we to attempt to speculate at this juncture as to the labyrinthine consequences of Fisher's failure to assert this theory before the district court in the first instance.   Moreover, an argument \"surfacing for the first time on appeal\" may be excepted from the raise-or-waive rule only if it is \"so compelling as virtually to insure appellant's success, and a gross miscarriage of justice would result from [the] failure to address it.\"  American Auto.

Holiday Inns, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364881\"><a href=\"/opinion/364881/alfred-m-johnston-individually-alfred-m-johnston-trustee-and-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 893 (1st Cir.1979) (waiver rule is relaxed only in \"horrendous cases\" where a gross miscarriage would occur).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fortiori, we think it clear that the waiver rule should be rigorously applied to interlocutory appeals certified pursuant to Rule 54(b).   The strength of the forfeited Fisher theory can be assessed only by focusing on the core factual allegations underlying both the dismissed and the pending claims, as well as the closely intertwined legal issues governing any remedy.

Typically, a miscarriage of justice may be shown where a litigant would suffer grave personal harm, such as a loss of liberty or domicile, see American Auto.  Mfrs.

In the same Ohio action, a default judgment was entered against Ideal and remains outstanding, according to CFI, because Ideal is defunct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The docket sheets list two Rule 59(e) motions filed on the same day, one by Ideal and one by Fisher, but we can locate only one such motion in the appendix and record.   It purports to have been \"submitted\" by both Fisher and Ideal, although it is titled \"Ideal's Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment.\"   Fisher complains that the district court never ruled on his motion.   Given the record before us, however, we conclude that there was a single, joint motion, which was denied by the court.   See accompanying text</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The term \"cross-appeal\" is a misnomer in this context.   It normally denotes an appeal by an initial appellee against the initial appellant from an order or decision entered in favor of the initial appellant.   See 9 James Wm. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 204.11 (1995).   Fisher and Ideal were not named as appellees in the Trainor appeal, and their so-called \"cross-appeals,\" as a logical matter, were separate appeals from the first judgment in favor of appellee CFI, not the original appellant--Trainor.   Ideal's additional \"cross-appeal\" against Fisher is simply an enigma</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We reserved decision on this motion pending oral argument.   Fisher and Ideal then filed an opaque motion to consolidate the dismissed and pending appeals, which we denied</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> There are no district court findings which would enable confident determinations as to who controlled Ideal at various material times.   Moreover, the record suggests that Ideal was a shell, wholly owned and controlled by Trainor, at the time of the CFI loan.   During the CFI loan transaction (\"in or about 1989\"), however, Fisher allegedly gained control of Ideal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> See supra note 6.   Ideal purports to be a bona fide purchaser of the CFI loan proceeds, so as to cut off any right CFI might have to \"trace\" its loan funds into the Biopure deal.   Ideal claims that, through Fisher, it innocently acquiesced in the CFI loan arranged by Trainor, then innocently redirected the loan proceeds to Trainor (allegedly for the purchase of a worthless landfill).   Trainor used the money to finance the Biopure deal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The entry of the Rule 54(b) judgment against Fisher on December 6, 1994, did not enlarge the appeal period, for two reasons.   The judgment did not include Ideal's claims and, as an exception to Rule 54(b), the denial of intervention was appealable without an \"express direction for the entry of judgment\" on a separate document.   Cf. Willhauck v. Halpin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575825\"><a href=\"/opinion/575825/francis-a-willhauck-jr-v-paul-halpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1991).   Since Ideal sought intervention in the still-pending litigation, and not relief from a final judgment, there is no reason to consider further the applicability of the \"separate document\" rule in relation to the denial of this motion.   Compare infra note 12</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Ideal did not move for an extension of time to appeal the denial of its motion to intervene/amend the counterclaim, although it joined Fisher in a motion to extend the time to file the so-called \"cross-appeal\" from the first judgment.   The latter request was denied for failure to show good cause or excusable neglect</p>\n        <p>We simply add that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend/intervene as untimely.   See Conservation Law Found. v. Mosbacher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584188\"><a href=\"/opinion/584188/conservation-law-foundation-of-new-england-inc-v-robert-a-mosbacher/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.1992).   The case had been pending since 1990, the CFI loan transaction had been addressed in pleadings dating back to April, 1991, and CFI had moved to intervene ten months before the attempted counterclaim.   The court rightly explained that \"so much blood has passed under the bridge\" that it would work a \"perversion\" of the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15 to permit Ideal to introduce a new claim so late in the proceedings.   Other \"timeliness\" criteria weighed against Ideal as well.   First, appellees would have been unfairly prejudiced had intervention been allowed.   Second, Ideal can point to no clear probability of success on the merits, since its independence from Trainor during the relevant time period, as well as Ideal's capacity to sue, are open to serious question.   And, third, no \"exceptional circumstances\" are suggested.   See Banco Popular de Puerto Rico v. Greenblatt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583859\"><a href=\"/opinion/583859/banco-popular-de-puerto-rico-v-david-greenblatt-the-official-secured/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1231-34 (1st Cir.1992) (setting forth factors to be considered in determining timeliness of intervention).   Thus, the district court properly denied the motion to amend and Ideal lacked standing to appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> As already noted, see supra pp. 704, note 9, Ideal lacks standing to appeal either judgment.   Fisher argues that he should have been given prior notice and an opportunity to challenge the dismissal.   Although we agree that the better practice is to give notice to all \"cross-appellants\" prior to any voluntary dismissal, unless the cross-appellant has joined in an agreement that includes the payment of costs, see Fed.R.App.P. 42(b), in these circumstances neither Fisher nor Ideal was prejudiced by the failure to provide separate notice to Fisher.   See supra note 4 and infra pp. 704-706</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We note, moreover, that Fisher's ambiguous response to the CFI motion in the district court implicates a separate issue.   A party may have standing to appeal, yet lose because he has waived or forfeited the arguments sought to be raised on appeal.   Cf. Dopp v. HTP Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570480\"><a href=\"/opinion/570480/paul-s-dopp-v-htp-corporation-paul-s-dopp-v-htp-corporation-paul-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 512 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a defendant who was dismissed from the case for lack of personal jurisdiction had no standing to appeal judgments entered after it voluntarily absented itself from the proceedings)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The parties have assumed that the appeal period ran from the November 22 decision denying his Rule 59(e) motion, hence that the January 3 notice of appeal was late.   They disagree as to whether the timeliness of a cross-appeal is jurisdictional, and, if not jurisdictional, as to the effect of the denial of appellants' motion to enlarge the time to file a cross-appeal</p>\n        <p>However, the \"separate document\" rule does apply to orders denying Rule 59(e) motions.   The lengthy November 22 district court opinion contained numerous orders, such that, arguably at least, the Fisher appeal period ran from the December 6 entry of judgment against him in a separate document.   See Fiore v. Washington County Community Mental Health Ctr., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580698\"><a href=\"/opinion/580698/richard-c-fiore-v-washington-county-community-mental-health-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 235 n. 9 (1st Cir.1992) (en banc);  see also RR Village Ass'n, Inc. v.

Since we conclude that Fisher failed to prosecute his \"cross-appeal,\" we need not dwell on these other matters.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The parties did not notify the Clerk that they wished to proceed under Fed.R.App.P. 28(h).   See First Circuit Internal Operating Procedure VI.A.2.   The docket sheets identify Fisher as the \"appellant and cross-claimant\" in appeal no. 95-1092--the number assigned to his \"notice of appeal and cross-appeal.\"  (Ideal is identified the same way in appeal no. 95-1091).   The Trainor docket sheet cross-references Fisher's and Ideal's appeal numbers, respectively labeling the Fisher appeal as a \"cross-appeal\" and the Ideal appeal as a \"companion case.\"   The rules do not allow a party simply to assume as his own a docket number previously assigned to an appeal taken by another party</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Although we consider each of the consolidated actions separately in order to expedite our analysis, we note as well that there are obvious overlaps among the dismissed and the pending claims, which cut across these consolidated actions.

An earlier motion by Trainor to dismiss the counterclaim also appears to remain pending</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The district court made no express choice-of-law determination, but assumed, as do the parties, that Massachusetts law governs the partnership issues (the Trainor-Fisher joint venture allegedly was formed in Massachusetts).   We are less clear as to what law the court utilized in determining the remedy available to CFI for the fraudulent loan transaction.

Fisher adverted to his \"sweat equity\" only as \"consideration\" for a loan which Trainor allegedly promised Fisher.   See accompanying text.
