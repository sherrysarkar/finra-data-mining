VEALE,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n                KEENE PUBLISHING CORPORATION,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n       [Hon. Shane Devine, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   David T. Veale on brief pro se.\r\n\nMay 11, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  We affirm the judgment of the district\r\ncourt for essentially the reasons stated in the Report and\r\nRecommendation of the magistrate judge and in the Order of the\r\ndistrict judge.  We add only the following comments regarding\r\nappellant's attempt to set out a claim under 42 U.S.C.  1983.\r\n          Appellant does not dispute that, to be timely, he was\r\nrequired to have filed his complaint by March 2, 1998.  See\r\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.  508:4.  Thus, unless the limitations\r\nperiod was tolled, the March 11, 1998 complaint was late. \r\nArguably,  508:10 may provide tolling in the instant\r\nsituation.  However, the tolling rule set out in  508:10 only\r\napplies to the defendants named in the first action.  Rowe v.\r\nDeere, 533 A.2d 375, 378 (N.H. 1987).  The only defendant named\r\nin the first action was the Keene Publishing Corp.\r\n          As a result, the  1983 claim raised in the instant\r\ncase is timely only as to the publishing company; the complaint\r\nis not timely as to the public entities appellant listed as\r\ndefendants in his amended complaint.  The question then becomes\r\nwhether appellant can file the second action with a new claim\r\nagainst Keene Publishing Corp.   i.e., a  1983 claim based on\r\na conspiracy between public officials and the publishing\r\ncompany.  However, as well as limiting  508:10 to the same\r\nparties, the New Hampshire Supreme Court appears to have\r\nlimited the section to the same cause.  See Milford Quarry &amp;\r\nConstruction Co. v. Boston &amp; M. R.R., 151 A. 336, 338 (N.H.\r\n1930); Milford Q. &amp; C. Co. v. Boston &amp; M. R.R., 97 A. 982, 983\r\n\n                             -2-\r\n(N.H. 1916).  Arguably, then, appellant could not add the \r\n1983 claim to the original action for libel.\r\n          In any event, appellant has not alleged enough to\r\nstate a  1983 conspiracy between the police and the publishing\r\ncompany.  \"[T]he acts of a private party are fairly\r\nattributable to the state. . . [only] when the private party\r\nacted in concert with state actors.\"  Rendell-Baker v. Kohn,\r\n457 U.S. 830, 838 n.6 (1982).  Because appellant's allegation\r\nof conspiracy is completely \"bald and conclusory,\" as well as\r\nlacking \"sufficient factual detail,\" it is not enough to make\r\nthe publishing company a state actor for purposes of  1983. \r\nSee Malachowski v. City of Keene, 787 F.2d 704, 711 (1st Cir.\r\n1986) (per curiam).\r\n          Second, even if the conspiracy allegations were\r\ndeemed sufficient at the pleading stage, it is plain that\r\nappellant could not set out a cause of action for libel under\r\n 1983.  Such a claim requires that a plaintiff show \"stigma\r\nplus.\"  See Pendleton v. City of Haverhill, 156 F.3d 57, 62-63\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).  That is, \"a violation of constitutional\r\nproportions under a 'stigma plus' theory exists only if, and to\r\nthe extent that, the opportunities [a plaintiff] lost are\r\ngovernment benefits denied as a result of governmental action.\" \r\nId. at 63.  Appellant was in business for himself as a\r\nlandscaper and logger so cannot allege that he lost a\r\ngovernment job as a result of the alleged defamatory statement. \r\nThe other injury about which appellant complains   harm to his\r\npersonal and business reputation   does not involve government\r\nbenefits.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
