Plaintiff Alfred Gallant,  a Maine inmate,\r                           \r\n\nfiled a civil-rights action against thirteen prison officials\r\n\nin May 1996  complaining of an assortment  of alleged abuses.\r\n\nAccompanying his complaint was a request to proceed in  forma\r                                                                         \r\n\npauperis.    On  September  10,  1996,  the  magistrate-judge\r                    \r\n\nimposed  an initial  partial filing  fee of  $28.00--a figure\r\n\nrepresenting twenty percent of the average monthly balance in\r\n\nplaintiff's prison account for the six-month period preceding\r\n\nthe filing of  his complaint.   See 28  U.S.C.    1915(b)(1).\r                                               \r\n\nWhen plaintiff failed  to pay  such fee by  the September  30\r\n\ndeadline, the  district court  dismissed  the action  without\r\n\nprejudice.  This ruling is now challenged on appeal. \r\n\n     Plaintiff objects that  he lacked the  means to pay  the\r\n\ninitial  filing fee.    The record  reveals  that during  the\r\n\nrelevant period--in  May, in September,  and at all  times in\r\n\nbetween--the  balance in his prison account stood at zero.  A\r\n\nprisoner cannot be barred from  bringing a civil action  when\r\n\nhe \"has  no assets and no  means by which to  pay the initial\r\n\npartial filing fee.\"   28 U.S.C.   1915(b)(4); see also id.  \r                                                                       \r\n\n1915(b)(1) (the  court \"shall  assess and, when  funds exist,\r\n\ncollect\" an  initial fee); see,  e.g., Hampton v.  Hobbs, 106\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 1281, 1284 (6th Cir. 1997).\r\n\n     But while plaintiff's failure  to pay the initial filing\r\n\nfee was thus excusable, his serious default in another regard\r\n\ncannot  be  excused.    Pursuant  to  the  magistrate-judge's\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nSeptember 10 order, he  was directed to file  a consolidated,\r\n\namended complaint by  September 30.  Plaintiff never  did so,\r\n\nand never explained his failure to do so.  Instead, he simply\r\n\nsubmitted  a  series of  frivolous  objections pertaining  to\r\n\nother aspects  of the magistrate-judge's order.   Under these\r\n\ncircumstances, the action could  properly have been dismissed\r\n\nfor  lack of  prosecution.    Particularly given  plaintiff's\r\n\nhistory  of abusive  litigation, we  think it  appropriate to\r\n\naffirm  the  dismissal  on  this  basis--with   the  judgment\r\n\nmodified to  reflect a  dismissal with, rather  than without,\r                                                                        \r\n\nprejudice.   See, e.g., Hachikian  v. FDIC, 96  F.3d 502, 504\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir.   1996)  (appellate   court  may  affirm   on  any\r\n\nalternative ground made manifest by the record).\r\n\n     The judgment  is modified to provide  for dismissal with\r                                                                         \r\n\nprejudice rather than without prejudice.
