Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n James Michael Murphy, Jr. on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, James B. Farmer and\r\nStephen P. Heymann, Assistant United States Attorneys, and Kathleen\r\nA. Felton, Attorney, Department of Justice, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 19, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nthe portions of the record transmitted to this court, we\r\nconclude that defendant's conviction and sentence should be\r\nupheld.  None of the issues briefed by defendant suggest to us\r\nthat a new trial is warranted.  Particularly:\r\n          1.   The district court did not abuse its discretion\r\nin determining that the Joyce affidavit should be admitted.  In\r\nour view, the circumstances in which the affidavit was made\r\nprovide indicia of reliability sufficient to overcome\r\ndefendant's arguments about the hearsay rule and the\r\nConfrontation Clause.  \r\n          2.   The district court also acted within its\r\ndiscretion in admitting the limited evidence as to Methuen and\r\nQuinn, as relevant to establish the identity of the Fitchburg\r\nparticipants, and we cannot say that such evidence was overly\r\nprejudicial in the circumstances. \r\n          3.   We reject defendant's arguments about the\r\ntestimony of Ryan.  \r\n          4.   We cannot say that the district court abused its\r\nconsiderable discretion in dismissing certain jurors whose voir\r\ndire responses were substantially incomplete.  \r\n         5.   We find no abuse of discretion in the denial\r\nwithout prejudice of defendant's initial non-specific motion\r\nfor investigative services.  \r\n        6.   Defendant's allegations of government misconduct\r\nare unsupported by the record.  \r\n   7.   We find no merit whatsoever in defendant's claim\r\nthat his federal sentence is improper in relation to a pre-\r\nexisting state sentence, even assuming that such claim would be\r\nwithin the scope of our jurisdiction for this appeal.  \r\n    8.   Having found no specific error among those\r\nalleged by defendant, we cannot find that any cumulative error\r\nwarrants reversal here.\r\n    Defendant's \"motion for leave to file additional due\r\nprocess violation\" is denied.  We have no jurisdiction in this\r\nappeal to consider the post-judgment events of which defendant\r\ncomplains.\r\n    The judgment is affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
