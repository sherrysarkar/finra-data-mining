Pro se appellant David Michaud appeals\n\n from the dismissal of his complaint asserting violations of\n\n various criminal laws of the United States.                      In a report and\n\n recommendation dated March 8, 2000, Magistrate Judge James\n\n Muirhead recommended dismissal for failure to state a claim\n\n for relief.           See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a) & (b) (providing for\n\n dismissal        on    preliminary        review    of   prisoner       complaints\n\n against government officers or employees if the complaints\n\n do not state a claim for relief).                   In an order dated March\n\n 20,     2000,    District         Judge   Steven    McAuliffe      approved    the\n\n recommendation and dismissed the complaint.1                      We affirm.\n\n                 On    appeal,      Michaud      argues   that     his    complaint\n\n adequately alleged a civil action under the Racketeering\n\n Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C.\n\n §   1964(c).           In    his    report,     Magistrate       Judge    Muirhead\n\n concluded        that       the    complaint       failed   to    allege    facts\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     The district judge issued his order several days before\nMichaud filed his objections to the magistrate judge's report\nand recommendation. Because the record does not establish when\nMichaud received the report and recommendation (the date that\nwould trigger the start of the filing period), we cannot\nevaluate whether the objections were timely. Accordingly, we\ngive Michaud the benefit of the doubt, assume that he timely\nfiled objections to the report, and proceed to evaluate his\nappellate claims.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fsufficient to show a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"                       We\n\nagree, as is explained next.\n\n            Michaud contends that the complaint alleged acts\n\nof mail fraud, extortion, and obstruction of justice.                         See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) (defining \"racketeering activity\" to\n\ninclude, in pertinent part, violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1341,\n\npertaining       to    mail    fraud,    §§     1503,     1510,     and     1511,\n\npertaining to certain obstructions of justice, and § 1951,\n\npertaining to extortion).               But, even if we construe his\n\ncomplaint in the most generous fashion possible, he has\n\nalleged   at     best    one   predicate       act   of    mail     fraud    (the\n\nalteration of mail sent to his daughter) with the requisite\n\nspecificity.          Id. (5) (defining \"pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity\" to require \"at least two acts of racketeering\n\nactivity\"      within     a    designated       time      frame);    Ahmed     v.\n\nRosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 889 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that\n\na RICO complaint alleging mail fraud must, in conformity\n\nwith Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), \"state the time, place and\n\ncontent     of    the     alleged       mail    .    .    .   communications\n\nperpetrating      that    fraud\"),      cert.    denied,      522   U.S.    1148\n\n(1998); see also United States v. Martin, 694 F.2d 885, 889-\n\n90 (1st Cir. 1982) (noting that § 1341 extends to persons\n\nwho \"take or receive\" things from the mail and affirming\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fconviction of defendant who had intercepted and altered\n\nmailings between insurance companies and purchasers pursuant\n\nto scheme to defraud).\n\n             As for the other alleged acts of mail fraud, the\n\nallegations    in    the    complaint       either      lack    the     requisite\n\nspecificity, see Ahmed, supra, or describe unrelated conduct\n\nthat was unlikely to have continued for very long.                              See\n\nEfron v. Embassy Suites (Puerto Rico), Inc., 223 F.3d 12, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (indicating that RICO plaintiff must show\n\nthat the requisite racketeering acts are related and \"amount\n\nto or pose a threat of continued criminal activity\") (citing\n\nH.J.

Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239\n\n(1989)), pet. for cert. filed (Dec. 29, 2000) (No. 00-1069).\n\nIn addition, the complaint does not allege conduct by the\n\ndefendants    that     would    be    indictable        under    the     relevant\n\nextortion or obstruction of justice statutes.
