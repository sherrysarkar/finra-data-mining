William J. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Robert D. Dimler, by appointment of the Court, for defendant.\r\n   Jennifer Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nJune 2, 1999\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant Anibal Ortiz\r\nchallenges his money laundering convictions entered pursuant to a\r\njury verdict, contending that the district court erred in denying\r\nhis motion to suppress certain post-arrest statements.  Because we\r\nfind that the statements were admitted in violation of Ortiz's\r\nFifth Amendment rights, we vacate the convictions and remand for\r\nfurther proceedings.\r\n\"[W]e recite the facts as found by the district court to\r\nthe extent they derive support from the record and are not clearly\r\nerroneous.\"  United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 525 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  On November 14, 1997, Ortiz was arrested at his place of\r\nemployment on charges of money laundering.  At the time of the\r\narrest, the arresting officer, Special Agent Doo, read Ortiz his\r\nMiranda rights in English.  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436\r\n(1966).  When asked if he wanted an attorney, Ortiz stated that he\r\ndid.  Agent Doo immediately ceased questioning Ortiz, seated him on\r\na couch, handcuffed him, and left the room.  Shortly thereafter,\r\ntwo other officers, Agents O'Neil and Navarro, approached Ortiz and\r\nre-read him his Miranda rights a second and third time, first in\r\nSpanish and then in English.\r\nAccording to the district court, Ortiz then initiated\r\nconversation with the officers by inquiring about the charges\r\nagainst him.  Agent Navarro responded that Ortiz was being charged\r\nwith money laundering and asked whether he wanted to cooperate. \r\nOrtiz stated that he did.  A close reading of the record, however,\r\nreveals a different sequence of events.  The uncontroverted\r\ntestimony of Agent Navarro and Ortiz shows that immediately after\r\nreading Ortiz his Miranda rights, Agent Navarro asked Ortiz whether\r\nhe wanted to cooperate.  Ortiz stated that he did, and only then\r\ninquired about the charges against him.  Ortiz ultimately signed\r\ntwo forms waiving his Miranda rights and made a number of self-\r\nincriminating statements.  To the extent that the district court's\r\nfindings are inconsistent with this uncontroverted testimony, they\r\nare clearly erroneous.\r\nMiranda and Edwards v. Arizona, together, provide that\r\nwhen a suspect asserts his right to counsel, interrogation must\r\ncease and the police may not reinterrogate the suspect until\r\ncounsel is present, unless the suspect himself initiates further\r\nconversation.  See 384 U.S. at 473-74; 451 U.S. 477, 484-85 (1981). \r\nBecause the facts of this case parallel those of Edwards, we recite\r\nthe facts of that Supreme Court case in some detail.  \r\nThe defendant in Edwards was arrested at his home and\r\ntaken to a police station where an officer informed him of his\r\nMiranda rights.  Like Ortiz, Edwards asserted his right to counsel,\r\nat which point police questioning ceased and he was taken to a\r\ncounty jail.  The next day, before counsel had been made available\r\nto Edwards, two different officers approached Edwards in jail, told\r\nhim that they wanted to talk to him, and again advised him of his\r\nMiranda rights.  Edwards stated that he was willing to cooperate\r\nand implicated himself in the crime.  Prior to trial, Edwards moved\r\nto suppress his confession on the ground that his Miranda rights\r\nhad been violated when the officers returned to question him after\r\nhe had invoked his right to counsel.  The trial court denied the\r\nmotion and the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that\r\nEdwards had waived his right to counsel when he voluntarily gave\r\nhis statements to the police.  The Supreme Court, however,\r\nreversed, holding that \"when an accused has invoked his right to\r\nhave counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver\r\nof that right cannot be established by showing only that he\r\nresponded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even\r\nif he has been advised of his rights.\"  Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484.\r\nThe government's attempt to distinguish Edwards hinges\r\nentirely on its argument that Ortiz, after receiving Miranda\r\nwarnings, asked about the charges against him and thereby\r\n\"initiated\" conversation.  According to the government, the\r\nofficers' prior recitation of two additional sets of Miranda\r\nwarnings was not, strictly speaking, \"interrogation.\"  Cf. Rhode\r\nIsland v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980) (defining \"interrogation\"\r\nas \"express questioning . . . [or] any words or actions on the part\r\nof the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and\r\ncustody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to\r\nelicit an incriminating response from the suspect\").\r\nHere, the uncontroverted evidence shows that after Ortiz\r\nhad asserted his right to counsel to the first officer, the other\r\nofficers not only delivered a second and third set of Miranda\r\nwarnings, but then immediately proceeded to ask Ortiz whether he\r\nwanted to cooperate.  The officers thus reinitiated interrogation\r\nin violation of Edwards.   See Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U.S.\r\n146, 147 (1990) (stating that \"once the accused requests counsel,\r\nofficials may not reinitiate questioning 'until counsel has been\r\nmade available' to him\") (citing Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484-485)\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nIt is quite true that in Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U.S.\r\n1039 (1983), a closely divided Supreme Court held that the police\r\ncould reinterrogate, assuming a waiver after new Miranda warnings,\r\nwhere a defendant \"initiated\" the conversation, see Edwards, 451\r\nU.S. at 484-85; and the plurality opinion in Bradshaw treated as\r\ninitiation a defendant's innocuous inquiry (\"Well, what's going to\r\nhappen to me now?\"), Bradshaw, 462 U.S. at 1045.  But while\r\nBradshaw obviously qualifies Edwards, eight of the Justices still\r\nrequired that the defendant initiate a new conversation, and that\r\ndid not occur in this case.  If Edwards is to be further modified,\r\ncf. Bradshaw, 462 U.S. at 1047-51 (Powell, J., concurring), it is\r\nfor the Supreme Court to do it.\r\nOrtiz's self-incriminating statements, elicited in\r\nviolation of Miranda and Edwards, were introduced into evidence at\r\nhis trial.  There has been no suggestion that the introduction of\r\nthis evidence was harmless, and our independent review of the\r\nrecord convinces us that the error was not harmless.  We therefore\r\nvacate Ortiz's convictions and remand for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion.\n",

The officers thus reinitiated interrogation in violation of Edwards.   See Minnick v. Mississippi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112513\"><a href=\"/opinion/112513/minnick-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112513\"><a href=\"/opinion/112513/minnick-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1983), a closely divided Supreme Court held that the police could reinterrogate, assuming a waiver after new Miranda warnings, where a defendant \"initiated\" the conversation, see Edwards, 451 U.S. at 484-85;  and the plurality opinion in Bradshaw treated as initiation a defendant's innocuous inquiry (\"Well, what's going to happen to me now?\"), Bradshaw, 462 U.S. at 1045.   But while Bradshaw obviously qualifies Edwards, eight of the Justices still required that the defendant initiate a new conversation, and that did not occur in this case.  If Edwards is to be further modified, cf.  Bradshaw, 462 U.S. at 1047-51 (Powell, J., concurring), it is for the Supreme Court to do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz's self-incriminating statements, elicited in violation of Miranda and Edwards, were introduced into evidence at his trial.  There has been no suggestion that the introduction of this evidence was harmless, and our independent review of the record convinces us that the error was not harmless.  We therefore vacate Ortiz's convictions and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The relevant portion of Agent Navarro's testimony is as follows:</p>\n        <p>Q: What did you say to [Ortiz after you first approached him] and what did he say to you?</p>\n        <p>A: Ah, I went over to him and I read him his Miranda rights in Spanish.

Did he say anything else at that point?</p>\n        <p>A: Ah, we asked him if he wanted to cooperate with us.  And he said yes.  So I indicated for him to sign, you know, the waiver.</p>\n        <p>Similarly, Ortiz testified that after Agent Navarro delivered Miranda warnings,</p>\n        <p>[he] told me that, explained to me that if I were to answer their questions, I would help myself, and I had nothing to hide.  He also told me at that time that I could cooperate with them, no problem.  I asked him in Spanish what I was charged with.
