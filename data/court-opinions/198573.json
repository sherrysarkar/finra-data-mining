George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Kenneth P. McKay with whom Law Offices of K. Patrick McKay was\r\non brief for appellant.\r\n   Jane L. Willoughby, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\r\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief for appellees.\r\n\nJuly 14, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  The present appeal arises out of\r\na federal antitrust case dismissed by the district court on the\r\nground that it was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  We assume to\r\nbe true, for purposes of this appeal, the facts as alleged in the\r\ncomplaint.  Duckworth v. Pratt &amp; Whitney, Inc., 152 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  However, the district court also considered, as do we,\r\nuncontroverted facts furnished by affidavit pertaining to the\r\nstatus of the defendants under the Eleventh Amendment.\r\nThe plaintiff-appellant in this case is Neo Gen\r\nScreening, Inc., a private, for-profit Pennsylvania corporation\r\nwhose business is the medical screening of newborn children.  In\r\nMassachusetts, as elsewhere, newborns must be tested for specified\r\ndiseases, some of which can be remedied if promptly detected. \r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 111,  4E, 110A; see also id.  3, 5, 6. \r\nAccording to the complaint, Neo Gen provides hospitals in various\r\nstates with screening services to detect disorders in newborns but\r\nis being prevented by the defendants from doing so in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\nThe principal defendants named in the complaint as\r\ncurrently amended are the University of Massachusetts, a not-for-\r\nprofit corporation linked to the state through governance and\r\nfinancing, its  New England Newborn Screening Program (\"the\r\nScreening Program\"),  and two individuals--Howard Koh and Ralph\r\nTimperi--who are or were respectively the Commissioner of the\r\nMassachusetts Department of Public Health and an Assistant\r\nCommissioner responsible for laboratory testing.  Several other\r\ndefendants were named in the original complaint but later dismissed\r\nby consent.  \r\nThe original complaint was filed on March 5, 1998, and\r\ncontained eleven counts; but it was thereafter amended and reduced\r\nto two counts, the second of which was later voluntarily withdrawn. \r\nThe remaining count (count I) is subcaptioned:  \"PLAINTIFF\r\nCORPORATION VS. DEFENDANTS NENSP AND UMASS VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN\r\nANTI-TRUST LAWS.\"; and it expressly charges the Screening Program\r\nand University of Massachusetts, in concert with the Massachusetts\r\nDepartment of Public Health, with monopolizing, attempting to\r\nmonopolize and/or conspiring to monopolize \"newborn screening\r\nservices\" in Massachusetts and surrounding states.\r\nAlthough there are some collateral allegations, the main\r\nthrust of count I is an attack on the University of Massachusetts\r\nfor seeking and obtaining a monopoly in the provision of the\r\nnewborn screening services in Massachusetts.  The only relief\r\nsought by the complaint is injunctive relief, apart from attorneys'\r\nfees, and the injunctive relief sought includes a request to bar\r\nthe Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner from issuing permanent\r\nregulations that maintain the screening program's monopoly over the\r\nprovision of the testing services in question.  The complaint\r\nprovides a history, which can be summarized briefly, as to how the\r\nsupposed monopoly came about.\r\nThe Screening Program, a collection of personnel and a\r\nlaboratory, had at one time been a unit of the Department of Public\r\nHealth.  At some point in the 1980s, the Screening Program was\r\ntaken over by Tufts University and later, beginning in 1997, by the\r\nmedical school of the University of Massachusetts.  The Screening\r\nProgram currently operates, under a contract between the University\r\nof Massachusetts and the Department of Public Health, to provide\r\nscreening for specified disorders of newborn infants.  A blood\r\nsample is taken by the hospital where the child is delivered and\r\nsubmitted to the Screening Program for testing, and a charge is\r\npaid by the hospital to the Screening Program.\r\nIn the fall of 1997, Neo Gen set about trying to persuade \r\nMassachusetts hospitals to let Neo Gen screen their newborns.  It\r\nsolicited hospitals in Massachusetts and purported to offer more\r\nmodern, comprehensive screening at half the fee charged by the\r\nScreening Program.  According to the complaint,  the University of\r\nMassachusetts and its Screening Program responded by seeking\r\nadoption of regulations by the Department of Public Health that\r\nwould give the Screening Program a monopoly in the provision of\r\nscreening services in Massachusetts.\r\nThe complaint charges that the Screening Program\r\n\"influenced\" the Department of Public Health to issue emergency\r\nregulations that required testing for nine diseases and required\r\nthat the blood samples be submitted to the Department itself.  See\r\n105 C.M.R. 270.000 et seq..  Also appended to the complaint is a\r\ncontract entered into between the Department of Public Health and\r\nthe University of Massachusetts requiring the latter to provide\r\nnewborn screening laboratory work, clinical follow-up and research\r\nservices.  The proposed regulations were adopted on an emergency\r\nbasis in November 1997, accompanied by statements that the\r\nDepartment of Public Health would thereafter study the possibility\r\nof allowing other entities to perform the screening.  \r\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint as\r\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment, asserting as well that the\r\ncomplaint failed to state a claim under the federal antitrust laws\r\nand was barred by various antitrust doctrines.  In a decision\r\nissued on December 3, 1998, the district court held that the only\r\nclaim remaining in the case was count I, that this count was\r\ndirected against the University of Massachusetts and the Screening\r\nProgram, and that both entities were arms of the state and were\r\nentitled to dismissal under the Eleventh Amendment.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\nUnder the Eleventh Amendment, a state or an arm of the\r\nstate is normally immune from suits by citizens in federal court,\r\nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1974); see Chemerinsky,\r\nFederal Jurisdiction  7.4, at 403 (3d ed. 1999), unless the state\r\nwaives its immunity, Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521\r\nU.S. 261, 267 (1997), or Congress overrides that immunity as it may\r\ndo in limited situations, Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44,\r\n57-68 (1996).  Neo Gen has not argued either that there was any\r\nwaiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity by defendants or any\r\nabrogation of that immunity by Congress.\r\nWhether and when state universities are arms of the state\r\nfor Eleventh Amendment purposes have long vexed the federal courts. \r\nThe multi-part tests that we have used are not easy to apply, and,\r\nconfusingly, overlap but do not quite duplicate tests that\r\ndetermine whether a university is an independent entity for\r\npurposes of diversity jurisdiction.  Cf. University of Rhode Island\r\nv. A.W. Chesterton Co., 2 F.3d 1200, 1202-05 (1st Cir. 1993).  A\r\nnumber of decisions have held that individual state universities\r\nare arms of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes, but the\r\ninquiry tends to turn on facts peculiar to each university, and\r\nthere are cases denying protection.  See Chemerinsky, supra,  7.4,\r\nat 407 &amp; nn.33-34 (collecting cases).\r\nIn its decision under review, the district court\r\nexplicitly found that the University in conducting the Screening\r\nProgram was \"acting as an agency or arm of the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts.\"  It rested this legal conclusion on a detailed\r\ndiscussion of the University's mission, its governance, its\r\nfinancial relationship to the state and similar matters.  Its\r\nconclusion that the University is an arm of the Commonwealth\r\naccords with the view of another district court involving the\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts.  Daniel v. American Board of Emergency\r\nMedicine, 988 F. Supp. 127, 178-81 (W.D.N.Y. 1997).\r\nOn this appeal, Neo Gen has effectively failed to dispute\r\nthe district court's holding that the University and its Screening\r\nProgram are covered by the Eleventh Amendment.  Since that ruling\r\nis at least colorable and certainly not plain error, cf. Beatty v.\r\nMichael Business Machines Corp., 172 F.3d 117, 121 (1st Cir. 1999),\r\nwe treat the dismissal of the case against these two defendants as\r\nconceded.  However, Neo Gen argues that Koh and Timpari were also\r\nintended defendants in count I and that despite the Eleventh\r\nAmendment these state officials are subject to injunctive relief\r\nunder the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).\r\nEx Parte Young is one of several major qualifications on\r\nEleventh Amendment immunity.  Chemerinsky, supra,  7.5-7.7, at\r\n411-46.  Ignoring some refinements, the doctrine removes the\r\nEleventh Amendment bar where the private suit is directed not\r\nagainst the state or a state agency eo nomine but instead against\r\nstate officials acting in violation of federal law and where (in\r\naddition) retrospective damages or property transfers are not\r\nsought for official acts.  Coeur d'Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. at 269,\r\n277-80; Strahan v. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 166-67 (1st Cir. 1997),\r\ncert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 81 (1998); Chemerinsky, supra, at  7.5,\r\nat 411-30.  This exception is Neo Gen's main argument on this\r\nappeal.\r\nThe Commonwealth replies that the claims in count I were\r\nasserted only against the University of Massachusetts and the\r\nScreening Program and that no relief was sought under that count\r\nagainst the two named state officers.  That is certainly what the\r\ndistrict court thought, and its view is supported by the subcaption\r\nof the count (quoted above), which referred to those institutional\r\ndefendants and no others.  By contrast, count II, which was\r\nvoluntarily withdrawn, specifically mentions Koh and Timperi as\r\ndefendants in the corresponding subcaption.\r\nNeo Gen counters that state officials were named as\r\ndefendants in the complaint, that the Department of Public Health\r\nitself is mentioned in count I, that complaints are liberally\r\nconstrued, and that at worst it is entitled to leave to amend.  The\r\nlatter claim fails since leave to amend was not requested in the\r\ndistrict court, but the construction of count I in its present form\r\nis open to reasonable dispute.  We think that the injunctive relief\r\nagainst the two state officials is so clearly barred for a\r\nsubstantive reason that we prefer to affirm on that ground rather\r\nthan because of a possible pleading error.\r\nIt is quite true that Ex Parte Young avoids the Eleventh\r\nAmendment defense where prospective injunctive relief, not\r\ninvolving damages or property transfer, is sought against named\r\nstate officials for a violation of federal law.  See Coeur d'Alene\r\nTribe, 521 U.S. at 276-77.  Usually, such injunctions are sought to\r\nrequire compliance with the Constitution; but the Ex Parte Young\r\ndoctrine is equally applicable to compel state officials to comply\r\nwith a valid federal statute that must be obeyed under the\r\nSupremacy Clause of the Constitution.  Id. at 273-77.  Thus, if the\r\nstate officials were violating the Sherman Act, in principle the\r\nEleventh Amendment would not bar injunctive relief against them.\r\nThe difficulty for Neo Gen is that it is clearly\r\nestablished that the Sherman Act does not itself apply to state\r\naction.  In Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 350-51 (1943), the\r\nSupreme Court determined that Congress had not meant to require\r\nstates to comply with the Sherman Act.  Accordingly, a state is\r\nfree to regulate, or act on its own behalf, in ways that are anti-\r\ncompetitive and would not be permitted to a private individual. \r\nId.  This doctrine is so well settled that its rationale and\r\nunderpinnings are scarcely worth discussing.  See I Areeda &amp;\r\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law,  221-222 (1997).\r\nNo doubt the emergency regulations, coupled with the ten-\r\nyear renewable contract already described, create an effective\r\nmonopoly for the University of Massachusetts  in conducting the\r\nscreening of Massachusetts newborns.  By regulation, the blood must\r\nbe made available to the Department, and the Department has chosen\r\nto contract with the University to do the testing.  Although a\r\nhospital could also choose to engage Neo Gen, no hospital is likely\r\nto pay twice for the same service.  But a regulation or purchase of\r\nservices made by the state is classic state action immunized from\r\nthe Sherman Act.  Cf. Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 567-73\r\n(1984); Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 998 F.2d\r\n1073, 1076 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nNeo Gen mistakenly attempts to distinguish Parker v.\r\nBrown and the long line of cases that have followed it by arguing\r\nthat the Massachusetts legislature did not \"clearly articulate\" a\r\npurpose to supplant competition with monopoly.  The cases on which\r\nNeo Gen relies, such as City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor\r\nAdvertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365 (1991), and City of Lafayette v.\r\nLouisiana Power &amp; Light Co., 435 U.S. 389 (1978), do impose a\r\nrequirement of this kind (the details are not important here) where\r\nthe acts sought to be shielded under Parker v. Brown are those of\r\nmunicipalities or other local public entities.  But no such\r\nrequirement exists where the acts are those of the state itself. \r\nHoover, 466 U.S. at 568.\r\nWhether executive branch action is that of the state is\r\na different issue.  The Supreme Court has held that acts of the\r\nstate legislature or state supreme court are protected under\r\nParker, but it reserved decision as to whether state-level\r\nexecutive branch departments or agencies are entitled to similar\r\ntreatment.  Hoover, 466 U.S. at 568 n.17 (reserving question). \r\nHowever, both circuits that have squarely faced the issue have\r\nextended Parker's ordinary protection to actions of the state\r\nexecutive branch.  We agree, with possible caveats that do not\r\naffect the outcome in this case.  \r\nBroadly speaking, the Parker doctrine represents a\r\njudgment by the Supreme Court that, in regulating anti-competitive\r\nbusiness conduct, Congress was not seeking to regulate the states\r\nthemselves; and \"the states\" include their executive branches quite\r\nas much as their legislatures and their courts.  The municipalities\r\nhave been given less protection under Parker on the stated ground\r\nthat technically speaking, they are not \"the state,\" Lafayette, 435\r\nU.S. at 412-13, while the status of state boards or commissions is\r\nopen to dispute, see Areeda, supra,  224; id.  212.2d at 141 &amp;\r\nn.48 (1992 Supp.).  And there is still less of an analogy to\r\nprivate carriers or utilities, operating under some measure of\r\nstate supervision, whose protection under Parker is even more\r\nrestricted.  Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v.\r\nUnited States, 471 U.S. 48, 57-62 (1985).\r\nThe question remains whether and to what extent a\r\nplaintiff should be able to pierce the Parker defense on the ground\r\nthat the state official or agency was acting in excess of his (or\r\nits) authority under state law.  On the one hand, the Supreme Court\r\nhas made clear that the Eleventh Amendment is not to be avoided\r\nunder Ex Parte Young merely in order to enforce state law. \r\nPennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106\r\n(1984).  On the other hand, extreme cases can be imagined: suppose\r\na state executive official entered into an exclusive-dealing\r\ncontract for the state that would violate the principles of Tampa\r\nElectric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320 (1961), if done by\r\na private party, and suppose further that the state legislature had\r\nexpressly banned such a contract.\r\nWe need not resolve such conundrums here.  Neo Gen argues\r\nthat the Massachusetts legislature did not expressly approve or\r\nauthorize the kind of regulation or contract involved in this case;\r\nbut we have rejected a \"clear articulation\" test as applied to the\r\nstate's executive branch, at least where a full-fledged department\r\nis concerned.  Given the Commonwealth statutes that authorize\r\ntesting, there is nothing extraordinary or unforeseeable about the\r\nDepartment of Public Health's regulation requiring testing or its\r\ndecision to do the testing itself or through a chosen instrument.\r\nEven if a patent lack of authority could ever be an exception to\r\nParker, it is certainly not so in a case of this kind.\r\nThere are a scattering of other allegations in count I in\r\naddition to the charge that the University of Massachusetts sought\r\nand acquired a monopoly over newborn screening.  These include\r\nclaims that the \"defendants\" fixed the price of services at $42 per\r\ninfant (whereas Neo Gen offered testing at $25), and that the\r\ndefendants \"influenc[ed]\" the adoption of the regulations.  These\r\nundeveloped allegations are not pursued in Neo Gen's brief and\r\ndeserve no further comment.  King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965,\r\n970 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nIt may be, as Neo Gen charges, that the defendants'\r\nactions reflect a cozy arrangement that gives newborns inferior\r\nscreening at higher cost and that everyone--except possibly the\r\nScreening Program--would be better off if hospitals could contract\r\ncompetitively for screening services, just as they procure drugs,\r\nbandages, and other resources.  The state, in turn, says that its\r\ncontract provides for extra research and follow-up that Neo Gen\r\nfails to provide; such cross-subsidy arguments are traditional\r\ndefenses for monopoly but not invariably without merit. At bottom,\r\nthis is a policy matter to be resolved by the Commonwealth. \r\nAffirmed.\n",

However, the district court also considered, as do we,\r\nuncontroverted facts furnished by affidavit pertaining to the\r\nstatus of the defendants under the Eleventh Amendment.\r\nThe plaintiff-appellant in this case is Neo Gen\r\nScreening, Inc., a private, for-profit Pennsylvania corporation\r\nwhose business is the medical screening of newborn children.

The Screening\r\nProgram currently operates, under a contract between the University\r\nof Massachusetts and the Department of Public Health, to provide\r\nscreening for specified disorders of newborn infants.  A blood\r\nsample is taken by the hospital where the child is delivered and\r\nsubmitted to the Screening Program for testing, and a charge is\r\npaid by the hospital to the Screening Program.\r\nIn the fall of 1997, Neo Gen set about trying to persuade \r\nMassachusetts hospitals to let Neo Gen screen their newborns.

Neo Gen has not argued either that there was any\r\nwaiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity by defendants or any\r\nabrogation of that immunity by Congress.\r\nWhether and when state universities are arms of the state\r\nfor Eleventh Amendment purposes have long vexed the federal courts. \r\nThe multi-part tests that we have used are not easy to apply, and,\r\nconfusingly, overlap but do not quite duplicate tests that\r\ndetermine whether a university is an independent entity for\r\npurposes of diversity jurisdiction.  Cf. University of Rhode Island\r\nv. A.W. Chesterton Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628596\"><a href=\"/opinion/628596/university-of-rhode-island-v-aw-chesterton-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1202-05 (1st Cir. 1993).  A\r\nnumber of decisions have held that individual state universities\r\nare arms of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes, but the\r\ninquiry tends to turn on facts peculiar to each university, and\r\nthere are cases denying protection.  See Chemerinsky, supra,  7.4,\r\nat 407 &amp; nn.33-34 (collecting cases).\r\nIn its decision under review, the district court\r\nexplicitly found that the University in conducting the Screening\r\nProgram was \"acting as an agency or arm of the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts.\"  It rested this legal conclusion on a detailed\r\ndiscussion of the University's mission, its governance, its\r\nfinancial relationship to the state and similar matters.  Its\r\nconclusion that the University is an arm of the Commonwealth\r\naccords with the view of another district court involving the\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts.  Daniel v. American Board of Emergency\r\nMedicine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455720\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455720/daniel-v-american-bd-of-emergency-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178-81 (W.D.N.Y. 1997).\r\nOn this appeal, Neo Gen has effectively failed to dispute\r\nthe district court's holding that the University and its Screening\r\nProgram are covered by the Eleventh Amendment.  Since that ruling\r\nis at least colorable and certainly not plain error, cf. Beatty v.\r\nMichael Business Machines Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762749\"><a href=\"/opinion/762749/kevin-p-beatty-and-cynthia-l-beatty-v-michael-business-machines-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (1st Cir. 1999),\r\nwe treat the dismissal of the case against these two defendants as\r\nconceded.  However, Neo Gen argues that Koh and Timpari were also\r\nintended defendants in count I and that despite the Eleventh\r\nAmendment these state officials are subject to injunctive relief\r\nunder the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1908).\r\nEx Parte Young is one of several major qualifications on\r\nEleventh Amendment immunity.  Chemerinsky, supra,  7.5-7.7, at\r\n411-46.  Ignoring some refinements, the doctrine removes the\r\nEleventh Amendment bar where the private suit is directed not\r\nagainst the state or a state agency eo nomine but instead against\r\nstate officials acting in violation of federal law and where (in\r\naddition) retrospective damages or property transfers are not\r\nsought for official acts.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998); Chemerinsky, supra, at  7.5,\r\nat 411-30.  This exception is Neo Gen's main argument on this\r\nappeal.\r\nThe Commonwealth replies that the claims in count I were\r\nasserted only against the University of Massachusetts and the\r\nScreening Program and that no relief was sought under that count\r\nagainst the two named state officers.  That is certainly what the\r\ndistrict court thought, and its view is supported by the subcaption\r\nof the count (quoted above), which referred to those institutional\r\ndefendants and no others.  By contrast, count II, which was\r\nvoluntarily withdrawn, specifically mentions Koh and Timperi as\r\ndefendants in the corresponding subcaption.\r\nNeo Gen counters that state officials were named as\r\ndefendants in the complaint, that the Department of Public Health\r\nitself is mentioned in count I, that complaints are liberally\r\nconstrued, and that at worst it is entitled to leave to amend.  The\r\nlatter claim fails since leave to amend was not requested in the\r\ndistrict court, but the construction of count I in its present form\r\nis open to reasonable dispute.  We think that the injunctive relief\r\nagainst the two state officials is so clearly barred for a\r\nsubstantive reason that we prefer to affirm on that ground rather\r\nthan because of a possible pleading error.\r\nIt is quite true that Ex Parte Young avoids the Eleventh\r\nAmendment defense where prospective injunctive relief, not\r\ninvolving damages or property transfer, is sought against named\r\nstate officials for a violation of federal law.  See Coeur d'Alene\r\nTribe, 521 U.S. at 276-77.  Usually, such injunctions are sought to\r\nrequire compliance with the Constitution; but the Ex Parte Young\r\ndoctrine is equally applicable to compel state officials to comply\r\nwith a valid federal statute that must be obeyed under the\r\nSupremacy Clause of the Constitution.  Id. at 273-77.  Thus, if the\r\nstate officials were violating the Sherman Act, in principle the\r\nEleventh Amendment would not bar injunctive relief against them.\r\nThe difficulty for Neo Gen is that it is clearly\r\nestablished that the Sherman Act does not itself apply to state\r\naction.  In Parker v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103740\"><a href=\"/opinion/103740/parker-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350-51 (1943), the\r\nSupreme Court determined that Congress had not meant to require\r\nstates to comply with the Sherman Act.  Accordingly, a state is\r\nfree to regulate, or act on its own behalf, in ways that are anti-\r\ncompetitive and would not be permitted to a private individual. \r\nId.  This doctrine is so well settled that its rationale and\r\nunderpinnings are scarcely worth discussing.  See I Areeda &amp;\r\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law,  221-222 (1997).\r\nNo doubt the emergency regulations, coupled with the ten-\r\nyear renewable contract already described, create an effective\r\nmonopoly for the University of Massachusetts  in conducting the\r\nscreening of Massachusetts newborns.  By regulation, the blood must\r\nbe made available to the Department, and the Department has chosen\r\nto contract with the University to do the testing.  Although a\r\nhospital could also choose to engage Neo Gen, no hospital is likely\r\nto pay twice for the same service.  But a regulation or purchase of\r\nservices made by the state is classic state action immunized from\r\nthe Sherman Act.  Cf. Hoover v. Ronwin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111167\"><a href=\"/opinion/111167/hoover-v-ronwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567-73\r\n(1984); Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v.

The cases on which\r\nNeo Gen relies, such as City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor\r\nAdvertising, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112569\"><a href=\"/opinion/112569/columbia-v-omni-outdoor-advertising-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), and City of Lafayette v.\r\nLouisiana Power &amp; Light Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109823\"><a href=\"/opinion/109823/lafayette-v-louisiana-power-light-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), do impose a\r\nrequirement of this kind (the details are not important here) where\r\nthe acts sought to be shielded under Parker v. Brown are those of\r\nmunicipalities or other local public entities.  But no such\r\nrequirement exists where the acts are those of the state itself. \r\nHoover, 466 U.S. at 568.\r\nWhether executive branch action is that of the state is\r\na different issue.  The Supreme Court has held that acts of the\r\nstate legislature or state supreme court are protected under\r\nParker, but it reserved decision as to whether state-level\r\nexecutive branch departments or agencies are entitled to similar\r\ntreatment.  Hoover, 466 U.S. at 568 n.17 (reserving question). \r\nHowever, both circuits that have squarely faced the issue have\r\nextended Parker's ordinary protection to actions of the state\r\nexecutive branch.  We agree, with possible caveats that do not\r\naffect the outcome in this case.  \r\nBroadly speaking, the Parker doctrine represents a\r\njudgment by the Supreme Court that, in regulating anti-competitive\r\nbusiness conduct, Congress was not seeking to regulate the states\r\nthemselves; and \"the states\" include their executive branches quite\r\nas much as their legislatures and their courts.  The municipalities\r\nhave been given less protection under Parker on the stated ground\r\nthat technically speaking, they are not \"the state,\" Lafayette, 435\r\nU.S. at 412-13, while the status of state boards or commissions is\r\nopen to dispute, see Areeda, supra,  224; id.  212.2d at 141 &amp;\r\nn.48 (1992 Supp.).  And there is still less of an analogy to\r\nprivate carriers or utilities, operating under some measure of\r\nstate supervision, whose protection under Parker is even more\r\nrestricted.  Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v.\r\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111399\"><a href=\"/opinion/111399/southern-motor-carriers-rate-conference-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57-62 (1985).\r\nThe question remains whether and to what extent a\r\nplaintiff should be able to pierce the Parker defense on the ground\r\nthat the state official or agency was acting in excess of his (or\r\nits) authority under state law.  On the one hand, the Supreme Court\r\nhas made clear that the Eleventh Amendment is not to be avoided\r\nunder Ex Parte Young merely in order to enforce state law. \r\nPennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106\r\n(1984).  On the other hand, extreme cases can be imagined: suppose\r\na state executive official entered into an exclusive-dealing\r\ncontract for the state that would violate the principles of Tampa\r\nElectric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106178\"><a href=\"/opinion/106178/tampa-electric-co-v-nashville-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1961), if done by\r\na private party, and suppose further that the state legislature had\r\nexpressly banned such a contract.\r\nWe need not resolve such conundrums here.  Neo Gen argues\r\nthat the Massachusetts legislature did not expressly approve or\r\nauthorize the kind of regulation or contract involved in this case;\r\nbut we have rejected a \"clear articulation\" test as applied to the\r\nstate's executive branch, at least where a full-fledged department\r\nis concerned.  Given the Commonwealth statutes that authorize\r\ntesting, there is nothing extraordinary or unforeseeable about the\r\nDepartment of Public Health's regulation requiring testing or its\r\ndecision to do the testing itself or through a chosen instrument.\r\nEven if a patent lack of authority could ever be an exception to\r\nParker, it is certainly not so in a case of this kind.\r\nThere are a scattering of other allegations in count I in\r\naddition to the charge that the University of Massachusetts sought\r\nand acquired a monopoly over newborn screening.  These include\r\nclaims that the \"defendants\" fixed the price of services at $42 per\r\ninfant (whereas Neo Gen offered testing at $25), and that the\r\ndefendants \"influenc[ed]\" the adoption of the regulations.  These\r\nundeveloped allegations are not pursued in Neo Gen's brief and\r\ndeserve no further comment.  King v. Town of Hanover, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742622\"><a href=\"/opinion/742622/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1266-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44807-bruce-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n970 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nIt may be, as Neo Gen charges, that the defendants'\r\nactions reflect a cozy arrangement that gives newborns inferior\r\nscreening at higher cost and that everyone--except possibly the\r\nScreening Program--would be better off if hospitals could contract\r\ncompetitively for screening services, just as they procure drugs,\r\nbandages, and other resources.  The state, in turn, says that its\r\ncontract provides for extra research and follow-up that Neo Gen\r\nfails to provide; such cross-subsidy arguments are traditional\r\ndefenses for monopoly but not invariably without merit. At bottom,\r\nthis is a policy matter to be resolved by the Commonwealth. \r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
