Fahey and Pierce, Davis, Fahey &amp; Perritano, LLP \r\non brief for appellees, James Hurley, Robert McGinley, James V.\r\nSampson, Chester Gus Johnson and Town of Shrewsbury.\r\n   Bradford N. Louison and Merrick, Louison &amp; Costello on brief\r\nfor appellee James Hester.\r\n\nDecember 17,1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  In these consolidated cases, appellant\r\nMichael Elbery appeals from two orders entered by the district\r\ncourt in two separate, but related, actions.  These orders\r\nforbid appellant from filing any complaints against the Town of\r\nShrewsbury Police Department and certain individuals without\r\nfirst obtaining approval from the district court.  After\r\nbriefly setting out the facts and the law, we address each\r\norder separately.\r\n                        I.  Background\r\n          Appellant has filed various lawsuits, including the\r\ntwo below, concerning the events surrounding, and following,\r\nhis arrests by the Shrewsbury, Massachusetts police on two\r\nseparate occasions.  The first arrest arose out of a fight\r\noutside a bar in Worcester in 1992.  In connection with his\r\nprosecution for this fight, appellant was arrested and charged\r\nwith intimidating a witness (the bartender who had seen the\r\nfight).  According to appellant, he was tried in a state\r\ndistrict court and found guilty of this charge, but on appeal\r\nto the superior court, the charge was dismissed.\r\n          The second arrest took place in 1994 after a fire at\r\na warehouse storage facility in which appellant rented a\r\nstorage unit.  According to appellant, he kept his collection\r\nof guns, for which he had a license, in this unit.  Shrewsbury\r\npolice arrested appellant on five charges of possession of\r\nfirearms and one charge of carrying a firearm.  Appellant\r\nstates that the district attorney did not appear at the trial\r\nand that he was acquitted of the charges.\r\n          Based on these arrests, appellant filed two actions\r\nlisting claims for malicious prosecution and various\r\nconstitutional violations against the Shrewsbury police and\r\nothers.  These actions are entitled Elbery v. Hester and Elbery\r\nv. Sklut and are pending in the federal district court. \r\nAppellant also commenced an action against Linda Schlener, the\r\nindividual who had filed the complaint with the Shrewsbury\r\npolice concerning appellant's intimidation of the witness to\r\nthe bar fight.  This case remains in state court and is\r\nentitled Elbery v. Schlener (Schlener I).\r\n          Not content with having three pending actions,\r\nappellant filed three more suits in the federal district court\r\nconcerning events that had transpired during the arrests and\r\nalso events which had occurred in the pending cases.  In Elbery\r\nv. Schlener (Schlener II), appellant sued, among others, Linda\r\nSchlener, Schlener's lawyer in Schlener I, and the state judge\r\nin Schlener I.  Appellant alleged in this case that the\r\ndefendants had retaliated against him for filing his original\r\nactions against Schlener and Hester.  In particular, appellant\r\nstated that Schlener had asserted counterclaims in the state\r\ncase as an act of retaliation.\r\n          In the second case, Elbery v. Louison, appellant\r\nfiled a complaint which named as a defendant attorney Bradford\r\nLouison.  Louison was then representing the Town of Shrewsbury\r\nand its police officers.  The other defendants were Shrewsbury\r\npolice officers.  Appellant alleged that the police had started\r\nthe fire at the storage warehouse so that they could frame him\r\non the gun charges and stop him from filing his federal\r\nlawsuits.\r\n          Finally, in Elbery v. Klug, the third lawsuit,\r\nappellant again listed attorney Louison as a defendant.  He\r\nalso sued various Shrewsbury police officers, the United Parcel\r\nService, Day's Inn Motel, and a bartender at Day's Inn.  He\r\nessentially claimed that these defendants had engaged in a\r\ncover-up concerning what he perceived to be constitutional\r\nviolations in the defense of the Loiuson case.\r\n                       II.  The Law    \r\n          It is well-established that \"[f]ederal courts . . .\r\npossess discretionary powers to regulate the conduct of abusive\r\nlitigants.\"  Cok v. Family Court of Rhode Island, 985 F.2d 32,\r\n34 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam).  Thus, \"in extreme\r\ncircumstances involving groundless encroachment upon the\r\nlimited time and resources of the court and other parties, an\r\ninjunction barring a party from filing and processing frivolous\r\nand vexatious lawsuits may be appropriate.\"  Castro v. United\r\nStates, 775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  Such\r\nan injunction, however, must be \"narrowly drawn to fit the\r\nspecific vice encountered.\"  Id. at 410.  The issuance of an\r\ninjunction aimed at preventing vexatious litigation is reviewed\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  Id. at 408.\r\n                III.  The District Court Orders\r\n          A.  Appeal No. 99-1039\r\n          This appeal arises out of the Louison case, the first\r\naction in which appellant sued attorney Louison concerning\r\nLouison's representation of the Shrewsbury defendants in the\r\nprior cases.  In their motion for an injunction, the defendants\r\nalleged that after appellant's deposition was taken by\r\nElizabeth Fahey, the new attorney representing the Shrewsbury\r\ndefendants in Sklut and Louison, appellant called Fahey and\r\nstated that he might sue Fahey and the court reporter present\r\nat the deposition based on Fahey's alleged falsification of the\r\ndeposition transcript.  The defendants therefore requested that\r\nappellant be required to seek leave of court before filing a\r\ncomplaint against Fahey or the court reporter.\r\n          When no opposition was forthcoming, the district\r\ncourt granted the motion by endorsing it as \"allowed.\"  The\r\nfollowing entry also was made on the docket sheet:  \"Endorsed\r\nOrder entered granting . . . motion to require plaintiff to\r\nseek leave of court before plaintiff files new complaint.\" \r\nSoon thereafter, appellant filed a belated opposition to the\r\nmotion, alleging that Fahey intended to deprive him of his\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n          We think that the injunction entered by the district\r\ncourt must be read as ordering that appellant seek approval\r\nprior to filing a new complaint against Fahey or the court\r\nreporter only, not that he must seek approval before filing any\r\nnew complaint.  As read, it is plain that appellant received\r\nnotice, via the defendants' motion, that the district court was\r\ncontemplating such an injunction.  Also as read, the injunction\r\nis tailored to the specific circumstances facing the court and\r\nwas not entered just to curtail appellant's ability to initiate\r\nlitigation.\r\n          While appellant is correct that litigiousness alone\r\nwill not support an injunction, see Castro, supra, 775 F.2d at\r\n408-09, we believe that appellant's particular affinity for\r\nsuing attorneys who represent defendants in the pending cases\r\namounts to behavior which is vexatious and harassing.  In\r\nparticular, appellant already has sued Louison and Schlener's\r\nattorney in the state case.  We note that when such an attorney\r\nis so sued, the attorney often will be required to cease\r\nrepresenting his or her client, with the result that the client\r\nwill be forced to find new counsel.  Given appellant's belief\r\nthat Fahey and the court reporter are part of the ongoing\r\nconspiracy to violate his constitutional rights, an injunction\r\nrequiring appellant to secure approval before filing a\r\ncomplaint against either of them was not an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\r\n          B.  Appeal No. 99-1319\r\n          This appeal arises out of Elbery v. Hester in which\r\nappellant sued James Hester, the police officer who had\r\narrested him on the charge of intimidating a witness.  In this\r\ncase, Hester moved for an order requiring appellant to seek\r\ncourt approval before filing any more lawsuits against Hester,\r\nother members of the Shrewsbury Police Department, or Louison\r\n(the attorney then representing Hester).  The district court\r\ngranted the motion, pointing out that appellant already had\r\nfiled five pro se lawsuits against the Shrewsbury Police\r\nDepartment and that two of the cases named Louison as a\r\ndefendant.  The court thus ordered appellant \"not to file an[y]\r\nadditional lawsuits against the Shrewsbury Police Department,\r\nits members, Bradford Louison, or any of the attorneys who have\r\nfiled an appearance in these suits without obtaining advance\r\ncourt approval.\"  The court added that \"[d]efense counsel may\r\nfile a motion to deem any such case as 'related.'\"\r\n          Appellant initially argues that the above order does\r\nnot set out sufficient record support for the injunction. \r\nAlthough the court did not list by name, or discuss, all of the\r\nactions appellant had filed, this is not fatal.  Hester's\r\nmotion adequately reviewed the pending cases and pointed out\r\nhow they were connected.  Further, this court may take judicial\r\nnotice of \"proceedings in other courts, both within and outside\r\nof the federal judicial system, if the proceedings have a\r\ndirect relation to matters at issue.\"  Green v. Warden, United\r\nStates Penitentiary, 699 F.2d 364, 369 (7th Cir. 1983).  There\r\nis no question that the pending lawsuits listed above are\r\nrelated to the injunctions entered by the district court.\r\n          Turning to the merits, appellant primarily contends\r\nthat the injunction was an abuse of discretion because the\r\ncases he has filed are not vexatious or harassing.  Rather, he\r\nstates, the cases are meritorious and he is merely exercising\r\nhis right of free access to the courts.  We disagree.\r\n          At the time the motion for an injunction was filed,\r\nappellant already had initiated the two suits challenging his\r\narrests for intimidating a witness and for firearms violations\r\n(Hester and Sklut).  Had appellant stopped here, this would be\r\na different case.  However, as described above, appellant\r\ncontinued to file more actions concerning what he perceived to\r\nbe conspiracies related to, and arising out of, the two\r\noriginal suits.  As defendant pointed out in the motion for an\r\ninjunction, since the parties and underlying events were\r\nconnected, the proper course was for appellant to have asked\r\nthe district court for leave to amend the already pending cases\r\nso that he could add new claims and/or defendants.  In most\r\ninstances, though, this would have required prior court\r\npermission.\r\n          The injunction entered by the district court\r\nessentially achieves this result by ordering appellant to seek\r\napproval before filing new actions against the Shrewsbury\r\nPolice Department, its members, or any of the attorneys\r\nrepresenting these parties.  Furthermore, in light of the\r\npurpose of the order and the language added at the end\r\nreferring to relatedness, we read the injunction as limited to\r\nnew cases connected to the ones currently pending.  So read,\r\nthe injunction is \"narrowly drawn to fit the specific vice\r\nencountered,\" see Castro, supra, 775 F.2d at 410, instead of\r\nbeing overbroad as it arguably would have been if it had\r\nprevented appellant from filing any new cases against these\r\ndefendants.\r\n          Finally, that appellant's behavior is vexatious and\r\nharassing is obvious.  That is, by filing new actions,\r\nappellant forces the defendants to answer each new complaint\r\nand to defend each new suit.  If appellant must obtain\r\npermission prior to filing a new case, as he would if he sought\r\nto amend the existing complaints, the defendants will be spared\r\nthis additional effort and the associated expense.  As a\r\nresult, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nentering the above injunction.\r\n          The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n",

The court thus ordered appellant \"not to file an[y]\r\nadditional lawsuits against the Shrewsbury Police Department,\r\nits members, Bradford Louison, or any of the attorneys who have\r\nfiled an appearance in these suits without obtaining advance\r\ncourt approval.\"  The court added that \"[d]efense counsel may\r\nfile a motion to deem any such case as 'related.'\"\r\n          Appellant initially argues that the above order does\r\nnot set out sufficient record support for the injunction. \r\nAlthough the court did not list by name, or discuss, all of the\r\nactions appellant had filed, this is not fatal.  Hester's\r\nmotion adequately reviewed the pending cases and pointed out\r\nhow they were connected.  Further, this court may take judicial\r\nnotice of \"proceedings in other courts, both within and outside\r\nof the federal judicial system, if the proceedings have a\r\ndirect relation to matters at issue.\"  Green v. Warden, United\r\nStates Penitentiary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414095\"><a href=\"/opinion/414095/clovis-carl-green-jr-v-warden-us-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369 (7th Cir. 1983).  There\r\nis no question that the pending lawsuits listed above are\r\nrelated to the injunctions entered by the district court.\r\n          Turning to the merits, appellant primarily contends\r\nthat the injunction was an abuse of discretion because the\r\ncases he has filed are not vexatious or harassing.  Rather, he\r\nstates, the cases are meritorious and he is merely exercising\r\nhis right of free access to the courts.  We disagree.\r\n          At the time the motion for an injunction was filed,\r\nappellant already had initiated the two suits challenging his\r\narrests for intimidating a witness and for firearms violations\r\n(Hester and Sklut).  Had appellant stopped here, this would be\r\na different case.  However, as described above, appellant\r\ncontinued to file more actions concerning what he perceived to\r\nbe conspiracies related to, and arising out of, the two\r\noriginal suits.  As defendant pointed out in the motion for an\r\ninjunction, since the parties and underlying events were\r\nconnected, the proper course was for appellant to have asked\r\nthe district court for leave to amend the already pending cases\r\nso that he could add new claims and/or defendants.  In most\r\ninstances, though, this would have required prior court\r\npermission.\r\n          The injunction entered by the district court\r\nessentially achieves this result by ordering appellant to seek\r\napproval before filing new actions against the Shrewsbury\r\nPolice Department, its members, or any of the attorneys\r\nrepresenting these parties.  Furthermore, in light of the\r\npurpose of the order and the language added at the end\r\nreferring to relatedness, we read the injunction as limited to\r\nnew cases connected to the ones currently pending.  So read,\r\nthe injunction is \"narrowly drawn to fit the specific vice\r\nencountered,\" see Castro, supra, 775 F.2d at 410, instead of\r\nbeing overbroad as it arguably would have been if it had\r\nprevented appellant from filing any new cases against these\r\ndefendants.\r\n          Finally, that appellant's behavior is vexatious and\r\nharassing is obvious.  That is, by filing new actions,\r\nappellant forces the defendants to answer each new complaint\r\nand to defend each new suit.  If appellant must obtain\r\npermission prior to filing a new case, as he would if he sought\r\nto amend the existing complaints, the defendants will be spared\r\nthis additional effort and the associated expense.  As a\r\nresult, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nentering the above injunction.\r\n          The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n</pre>",
