Following a guilty plea to drug importation and\r                         \r\n\ndistribution charges, appellant Gladys  Lind was sentenced to the\r\n\nstatutorily mandated minimum term of 60 months imprisonment based\r\n\non  the substantial amount of heroin involved.  She challenges in\r\n\nthis appeal  the  district court's  failure to  grant a  downward\r\n\ndeparture in  the length of  her sentence.   Because there  is no\r\n\nevidentiary or legal basis for relief  from the mandatory minimum\r\n\nterm, we affirm.\r\n\n     Appellant  emphasizes  various  factors in  support  of  her\r\n\nrequest   for   leniency:  her   \"extraordinary\"   acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility, her minor role as a courier and the small payment\r\n\nshe was  to receive ($3,000),  a difficult personal  history that\r\n\nincluded diminished capacity stemming from a 23-year daily heroin\r\n\nhabit,  her efforts at drug  rehabilitation, and her  status as a\r\n\nfirst-time offender.\r\n\n     Even were we to  accept her assertion that a  five-year term\r\n\nis  overly severe  in these  circumstances,  we would  be without\r\n\nauthority  to  ameliorate it.   Neither  of  the two  methods for\r\n\nescaping a  statutory minimum  is applicable: the  government did\r\n\nnot move  for a departure  based on substantial  assistance under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K1.1, see 18 U.S.C.   3553(e), and the district court\r                               \r\n\nfound that appellant  had failed to  fulfill the requirements  of\r\n\nthe \"safety valve\" provision  of 18 U.S.C.   3553(f)  (U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n5C1.2).   Other  than in  conclusory references at  oral argument\r\n\nthat  provide no basis  for appellate  second-guessing, appellant\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nhas not  disputed the inapplicability of these  provisions.1  The\r\n\nstatutory  minimum thus  stands as  an insurmountable  barrier to\r\n\nappellant's effort  to reduce her  sentence.   See, e.g.,  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Rodriguez, 938 F.2d  319, 320 (1st  Cir. 1991) (\"[T]he\r                              \r\n\n[sentencing]  guidelines  do  not  supersede  a  minimum sentence\r\n\nmandated by statute.\")2\r\n\n     Moreover, even  if departure  were available here,  we would\r\n\nlack  jurisdiction to review the district court's decision not to\r\n\nreduce  appellant's   sentence.     Having  carefully   read  the\r\n\ntranscript of  the sentencing hearing, we are  confident that the\r\n\ndistrict court  understood its  authority to depart,  but decided\r\n\nagainst  doing so in this case.   See Tr. at  12 (\"In the Court's\r                                               \r\n\nopinion  no departure is warranted in this  case and the Court is\r\n\nbound by the mandate  of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\")   Such\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  Appellant's counsel  seemed to  suggest in  argument that\r\nappellant was given no opportunity to respond to the government's\r\nassertion   that  she   had  not   satisfied  the   safety  valve\r\nrequirements.   At the sentencing hearing,  however, counsel made\r\nno  attempt   to  show   compliance  with  the   provisions,  and\r\nappellant's brief  also includes no argument  concerning   5C1.2.\r\nThe issue is therefore entirely undeveloped, and consequently not\r\nbefore us. \r\n\n     2  At oral argument, counsel  did urge us  to reconsider our\r\nprecedent holding that statutory minimum terms may not be reduced\r\nbased   on  the   discretionary  guidelines   departure  factors.\r\nRegardless  of its substantive  merit, which we  do not consider,\r\nthis argument  is unavailing because it was not raised below.  In\r\nthe district  court, appellant simply sought a departure based on\r\nthe  various  factors  noted  above; she  did  not  suggest,  and\r\nprovided no  rationale for,  reversing the well  established rule\r\nthat departures are unavailable when a mandatory minimum  term is\r\nset  by statute  unless the  \"substantial assistance\"  or \"safety\r\nvalve\" provisions are satisfied.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ndiscretionary decisions are not appealable.
