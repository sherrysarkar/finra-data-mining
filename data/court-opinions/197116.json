This court earlier  upheld the\r                                       \r\n\nconvictions of defendant Henry Lombard; but the court vacated\r\n\nthe life sentence imposed  on one of the counts  and remanded\r\n\nfor   resentencing,  holding  that  the  district  court  had\r\n\nauthority to depart  downward.  United States  v. Lombard, 72\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 170, 187 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Lombard  I\").

This new\r\n\nappeal  raises  a  constitutional  claim  that  Lombard  made\r\n\nearlier but was not decided on the initial appeal.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     The facts are set forth at  length in Lombard I, 72 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 172-76, and only the briefest summary is needed to set the\r\n\nstage.   Lombard and  his half-brother, Hubert  Hartley, were\r\n\ntried in Maine state court for murdering two acquaintances as\r\n\nthey slept  in Hartley's Maine cabin  on Thanksgiving morning\r\n\nin  1990.   Despite something  close to  eyewitness testimony\r\n\nfrom Hartley's girlfriend, both  men were acquitted by juries\r\n\nin separate trials in 1992.\r\n\n     A federal  grand jury then indicted  Lombard and Hartley\r\n\nfor different crimes  relating to the same episode.   Lombard\r\n\nand Hartley  were charged with  conspiracy, 18 U.S.C.    371,\r\n\nthe  conspiracy  having  multiple  objectives: to  possess  a\r\n\nfirearm in violation  of the felon in  possession statute, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    922(g), to travel interstate  to avoid prosecution,\r\n\n18  U.S.C.   1073, and to remove evidence to prevent seizure,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   2232(a).  Lombard  was also charged substantively\r\n\nunder the felon in possession statute and Hartley with aiding\r\n\nand abetting this crime.\r\n\n     The  defendants  were  tried  together  on  the  federal\r\n\ncharges  in  1993.    Much  of  the  evidence  concerned  the\r\n\ncommission  of the  same  killings for  which  they had  been\r\n\nacquitted,  the evidence  being  relevant inter  alia to  the\r                                                                 \r\n\nflight and removal of evidence charges.   Hartley pled guilty\r\n\nat the close of the government's case.  Lombard was convicted\r\n\non both of the  counts directed against him:   conspiracy and\r\n\nfelon-in-possession.  Lombard's convictions were sustained in\r\n\nLombard I and are not now before us.\r                     \r\n\n     At  sentencing, Lombard--without regard to the murders--\r\n\nwas  subject  to a  statutory sentence  of  15 years  to life\r\n\nbecause his  prior convictions  brought him within  the armed\r\n\ncareer  criminal statute.   18  U.S.C.    924(e).   Under the\r\n\nSentencing   Guidelines,  again  without   reference  to  the\r\n\nmurders, the  guideline  sentencing  range  would  have  been\r\n\nroughly  between 20 and 30 years.   U.S.S.G.   4B1.4; id. ch.\r                                                                     \r\n\n5, pt. A.1   However,  Lombard had so  many criminal  history\r\n\npoints  over  the  number  needed for  the  highest  criminal\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Although the sentencing took  place in September  1994,\r\nthe district court applied  the November 1990 edition  of the\r\nguidelines  in order  to  avoid any  ex post  facto problems.\r                                                               \r\nUnited States  v.  Prezioso, 989  F.2d  52, 53-54  (1st  Cir.\r                                       \r\n1993).  All references are to that edition.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nhistory  category that  an upward  departure might  have been\r\n\nimposed.  U.S.S.G.   4A1.3.\r\n\n     However, the ordinary guideline computation went by  the\r\n\nboards. The felon in possession guideline provides that where\r\n\nthe firearm is  used in connection with  another offense, the\r\n\nbase  level should be that of the \"object\" offense.  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n    2K2.1(c)(2),  2X1.1.   The  base  level for  premeditated\r\n\nmurder requires  a life sentence.  Id.   2A1.1; ch. 5, pt. A.\r                                                  \r\n\nBecause the  district court found  by a preponderance  of the\r\n\nevidence that  Lombard had participated  in the  premeditated\r\n\nmurders, the court imposed a life sentence on Lombard.\r\n\n     On  appeal in Lombard I, this court took note of several\r                                        \r\n\nunusual circumstances,  including the impact on  the sentence\r\n\nof the uncharged murders,  Lombard's prior acquittal of those\r\n\nmurders, the qualitative  difference between  murder and  the\r\n\noffense  of  conviction,  and  the extreme  penalty  of  life\r\n\nimprisonment.   Expressing  but not  resolving constitutional\r\n\nconcerns, the court then  held that these special facts  gave\r\n\nthe   district  court   discretionary  authority   to  depart\r\n\ndownward,  U.S.S.G.     5K2.0,  and remanded  to  permit  the\r\n\ndistrict court to consider such a departure.  72 F.3d at 184-\r\n\n85.   \r\n\n     At  the resentencing,  the district  court said  that it\r\n\nfully   understood  (and   had  understood   previously)  its\r\n\nauthority  to  depart  downward.    But  the  court  remained\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nconvinced that \"the appropriate sentence in  this case is the\r\n\nsentence that  was imposed  initially,\" and it  reimposed the\r\n\nlife sentence.   Lombard now appeals again,  stating that the\r\n\nsingle question  presented  is  whether  the  district  court\r\n\nviolated his \"due process right  to proof beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt\" as to the murders when it reimposed the life sentence.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     At the threshold,  the government  asserts, somewhat  to\r\n\nour  surprise, that \"appellate  jurisdiction does not exist.\"\r\n\nIts stated reason  is that  a discretionary  decision by  the\r\n\nsentencing judge declining to depart from the guideline range\r\n\nis not subject  to appeal.   While the  premise is  generally\r\n\nsound, United States  v. Romolo,  937 F.2d 20,  22 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1991),  Lombard  has  explicitly declined  to  challenge  the\r\n\nrefusal   to  depart;   rather,   he  wants   to  renew   his\r\n\nconstitutional  challenge  to  the  use  of  the  murders  to\r\n\nestablish the guideline range for his sentence.  \r\n\n     There is  nothing outre about the  distinction.  Lombard\r\n\nis challenging  his sentence, and the  sentence--as many do--\r\n\ndepended  on several  determinants:  here,  the armed  career\r\n\ncriminal  statute, various  decisions  made  in applying  the\r\n\nguidelines   including   the   finding   that   Lombard   had\r\n\nparticipated  in  the  murders,  and  lastly a  discretionary\r\n\ndecision  by  the  district  judge  not  to  depart from  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nguideline  range.   That this  last decision  is unreviewable\r\n\nhardly precludes review of other parts of the equation.\r\n\n     A challenge  to the constitutionality  of the guidelines\r\n\nas applied is certainly a permitted subject for an appeal, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   3742(a), and  presents an issue that we  consider de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo.  United States  v. Carson, 988 F.2d 80, 82  (9th Cir.),\r                                           \r\n\ncert. denied, 510 U.S. 847 (1993).  Of course, there might be\r                        \r\n\na  law-of-the-case   bar  to  the  appeal,   although  not  a\r\n\njurisdictional  one, if  this  court had  fully rejected  the\r\n\nconstitutional claims in  Lombard I.   But Lombard I  plainly\r                                                                \r\n\nsaid  that constitutional  concerns  did exist  but might  be\r                                                    \r\n\nmooted by the remand.  72 F.3d at 184-85.\r\n\n     For reasons we will address in due course, Lombard  does\r\n\nnot place much weight on the  element in this case that would\r\n\nstrike non-lawyers  as the most  troubling: that he  has been\r\n\ngiven  a life sentence based  on a finding  that he committed\r\n\nthe  two murders of which he was earlier acquitted.  Instead,\r\n\nhe  argues  that  the   district  court  erred  by  using   a\r\n\n\"preponderance of the evidence\" standard to determine that he\r\n\nhad in fact  committed the  prior murders and  then by  using\r\n\nthis finding to sentence  Lombard as if he had  committed the\r\n\nmurders.\r\n\n     The  framework  for  federal  sentencing   is  familiar.\r\n\nDepartures aside,  the guidelines require  the district court\r\n\nto calculate  the  guideline  range based  not  only  on  the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nconduct comprising  the federal crime of  conviction but also\r\n\non \"relevant\" albeit \"uncharged\" conduct--here, the murders--\r\n\nthat  the   sentencing  court  finds   actually  occurred  in\r\n\nconnection with that crime.   U.S.S.G.    1B1.3; 2K2.1(c)(2).\r\n\nAnd ordinarily the facts at sentencing need be proved only by\r\n\na preponderance  of the evidence.   McMillan v. Pennsylvania,\r                                                                        \r\n\n477 U.S. 79, 91 (1986); United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70,\r                                                             \r\n\n80-81 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1644 (1994).\r                                               \r\n\n     The use  of uncharged  conduct at sentencing  stems from\r\n\nthe  longstanding  view  that  the judge  should  employ  all\r\n\nrelevant information  that helps to decide  where, within the\r\n\nbroad range  usually fixed by statute,  this defendant should\r                                                        \r\n\nbe sentenced.   United States  v. Tucker, 404  U.S. 443,  446\r                                                    \r\n\n(1972);  18 U.S.C.    3577.   As  for the  lower standard  of\r\n\nproof, courts sometimes say that \"guilt\" is the crucial event\r\n\nthat  alone requires  proof  beyond a  reasonable doubt,  and\r\n\nsometimes  that more  procedural  constraints would  bog down\r\n\nsentencing.  See, e.g., McMillan, 477 U.S. at 92 n.8.\r                                            \r\n\n     In  the  face  of   historical  practice  and   judicial\r\n\nprecedent,  a  frontal attack  on  these  practices would  be\r\n\ndifficult, and Lombard does not  attempt it.  Rather, quoting\r\n\n\"the tail that wags  the dog\" metaphor in McMillan,  477 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\nat 88,  Lombard says that  due process requires the  use of a\r\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard in cases where, as here,\r\n\nthe  finding that the uncharged  crime occurred has so severe\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nan effect  on the sentence.     He adds that  in view of  the\r\n\njury's prior acquittal,  there must be a reasonable  doubt in\r\n\nthis case.\r\n\n     This  is not an argument that would likely have had much\r\n\nsuccess prior to  the guidelines, cf. Patterson  v. New York,\r                                                                        \r\n\n432 U.S.  197, 214 (1977),  but the  guidelines provide  some\r\n\nbasis for reconsidering  the issue.   In the past,  uncharged\r\n\nconduct was  merely a  background fact, like  the defendant's\r\n\ncriminal record or his habit of kicking his dog, that a judge\r\n\nmight  consider  in  making  the  highly  discretionary,  and\r\n\nlargely ad hoc, decision as to sentence.  The guidelines have\r\n\naltered matters in at least one significant respect.\r\n\n     We  now  have a  regime  that, aiming  to  provide equal\r\n\ntreatment, requires the sentencing  judge to make findings as\r                               \r\n\nto relevant uncharged conduct and absent a departure requires\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe  judge to  sentence on  that basis  within a  very narrow\r\n\nrange.   See 18 U.S.C.    3553(b); U.S.S.G.     1B1.1, 1B1.2,\r                        \r\n\n5C1.1(a).    Thus  a   finding  of  an  uncharged  crime   at\r\n\nsentencing, and the compulsory fixing of the sentence on that\r\n\nbasis,  makes the  sentencing itself  now look  somewhat more\r\n\nlike a  conviction for that uncharged  crime--but without the\r\n\nbenefit of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt or, for  that matter,  an indictment or  jury trial  on\r\n\nthat crime. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     Most courts have been  less, or not at all,  troubled by\r\n\nuse of the uncharged  conduct that has only a  limited effect\r\n\non the sentence  or is  qualitatively the same  crime as  the\r\n\noffense of  conviction (such as other related  drug sales) or\r\n\nboth.  See, e.g., United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 441-\r                                                     \r\n\n42 (1st Cir. 1989).  As the impact and qualitative difference\r\n\ngrow,  courts  become  more  concerned.    The  reference  in\r\n\nMcMillan,  477  U.S.  at  88,  to  the  risk  of  the  \"tail\"\r                    \r\n\n(sentencing) \"wagging the dog\" (the substantive  offense) has\r\n\noften  been  taken to  suggest that  the Supreme  Court might\r\n\nendorse some outer limit.2\r\n\n     The  guidelines'  substantive  provisions were,  in  the\r\n\nmain, intended  to impose  sentencing results very  much like\r\n\nthose that prevailed in the  pre-guidelines era.  See Stephen\r                                                                 \r\n\nBreyer,  The  Federal  Sentencing  Guidelines   and  the  Key\r                                                                         \r\n\nCompromises Upon Which  They Rest,  17 Hofstra L.

But for  Lombard  the  latter\r\n\nelement has been largely  removed by our decision  in Lombard\r                                                                         \r\n\nI,  which restored  to the  district court  its pre-guideline\r             \r\n\ndiscretion  to decide whether and  how far to  give weight to\r\n\nthe murders.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2The reference was in fact  directed to a problem rather\r\ndifferent than our  own, namely,  the alleged  danger that  a\r\nstate legislature  might \"tailor[]\" its substantive  crime to\r\nshift  into   the  sentencing  phase  an   element  that  was\r\ntraditionally part of the crime.  Id.  \r                                                 \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     True, the district court may (and here did) still choose\r\n\nto  give  weight to  the  uncharged  offenses  in fixing  the\r\n\nsentence  within  the  statutory  range  if  it  finds  by  a\r\n\npreponderance of  evidence that  they occurred; but  this was\r\n\nalways  permitted  by  longstanding  practice   and  explicit\r\n\nSupreme  Court authority.   Wisconsin  v. Mitchell,  508 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n476,  485 (1993);  Williams v.  New York,  337 U.S.  241, 246\r                                                    \r\n\n(1949).   There is no  indication that the  Supreme Court has\r\n\naltered its  position on this  issue.  If  anything, McMillan\r                                                                         \r\n\nreinforced that  position in upholding  a mandatory  sentence\r\n\nenhancement based on uncharged conduct. \r\n\n     Some may think that even the status quo ante  is at odds\r                                                             \r\n\nwith due  process and that uncharged conduct  should never be\r\n\nconsidered without criminal-trial safeguards.  But the choice\r\n\nthen  may be,  in substance,  between turning  the sentencing\r\n\ninto a  new criminal  trial or  ignoring provable facts  that\r\n\nmost people think relevant in deciding who  deserves more and\r\n\nwho  less punishment.   See Breyer, supra,  at 9-12.   If the\r                                                     \r\n\nConstitution is now taken to forbid \"real offense\" sentencing\r\n\nunless criminal-trial  procedures  are applied,  that  ruling\r\n\nmust come from a higher court.  \r\n\n     The  only  circuit court  squarely  to  impose a  higher\r\n\nstandard  of  proof  in  certain  sentencings  is  the  Third\r\n\nCircuit.   There, in United States v. Kikumura, 918 F.2d 1084\r                                                          \r\n\n(3d Cir. 1990), the  court held that an upward  departure due\r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nto uncharged conduct should be based  on clear and convincing\r\n\nevidence where  the  finding had  an  extraordinary  impact--\r\n\nthere, \"a twelve-fold, 330-month departure from the median of\r\n\nan applicable sentencing range.\"   Id. at 1102.   This ruling\r                                                  \r\n\nwas premised on a  reading of the guidelines informed  by due\r\n\nprocess concerns  and has  been much discussed  but generally\r\n\nnot  followed.  See United  States v. Masters,  978 F.2d 281,\r                                                         \r\n\n286 (7th Cir. 1992).\r\n\n     Lombard does  not urge this halfway house in the present\r\n\ncase.  In truth, most judges are unlikely to see a great gulf\r\n\nbetween  a preponderance and \"clear and convincing\" evidence.\r\n\nBased upon the sentencing  transcripts and the trial evidence\r\n\nin this case, the  district court would probably find,  as to\r\n\nLombard, that  the latter standard had  been amply met.    By\r\n\ncontrast, the \"beyond a  reasonable doubt\" standard is widely\r\n\nregarded  as making  a substantial  difference and,  for this\r\n\nvery reason, courts have been  very cautious in extending  it\r\n\nto new realms.  Cf. Masters, 978 F.2d at 286-87.\r                                       \r\n\n     In  all  events,  given  Supreme  Court  precedents,  we\r\n\nconclude that the Constitution  does not require a heightened\r\n\nproof standard in a case such as ours.  Policy is a different\r\n\nmatter:   on this score, one can argue about imposing greater\r\n\nsafeguards for sentencing decisions that severely  affect the\r\n\ndefendant.   But  if you  asked trial  judges, most  would be\r\n\nlikely  to say that what they mainly needed was more latitude\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nand fewer constraints.  Cf. Koon v. United States, 116 S. Ct.\r                                                             \r\n\n2035,  2046-47 (1996); United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942,\r                                                          \r\n\n951-52 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n     Finally, we think it  essential to say a word  about the\r\n\nmatter  that troubled the court in Lombard I but that Lombard\r                                                        \r\n\nhas chosen not  to stress,  at least in  his legal  argument:\r\n\nthe use of acquitted  conduct to enlarge his sentence.   This\r\n\ncertainly  accorded with  the guidelines.   In  their present\r\n\nform they  draw no distinction between  relevant conduct that\r\n\nis  uncharged and relevant conduct of which the defendant has\r\n\nactually been  acquitted.   Absent a  departure, all  must be\r\n\ngiven the  weight assigned  by  the guidelines.   U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n1B1.3; United States v.  Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16  (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1989).  The question is why.\r\n\n     The explanation for including acquitted conduct  has the\r\n\nusual charm of lawyer's logic.   It is said that there  is no\r\n\ntechnical inconsistency between a prior acquittal and the use\r\n\nof the very same  acquitted conduct at sentencing  to enlarge\r\n\nthe  sentence,  because  the   jury  merely  found  that  the\r\n\ndefendant  had not  been proved  guilty \"beyond  a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt\";  the  sentencing  judge,  by  contrast,  finds  by  a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence  that the acquitted conduct did\r\n\noccur.  See, e.g., United States v. Isom, 886 F.2d 736, 738 &amp;\r                                                    \r\n\nn.3 (4th Cir. 1989).\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     This syllogism has been expressly adopted by the Supreme\r\n\nCourt  in another context, Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n342,  349 (1990),  and  is regularly  followed  by the  lower\r\n\ncourts, including  ours, in  sentencing and elsewhere.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., Rossetti v.  Curran, 80  F.3d 1, 5-6  (1st Cir.  1996).\r                                     \r\n\nPresumably, it is because  of these precedents, emphasized in\r\n\nLombard  I, that Lombard has  not challenged the syllogism or\r                      \r\n\nstressed  the fact that the uncharged conduct in this case is\r\n\nalso acquitted conduct.   As a matter of constitutional  law,\r\n\nthe syllogism is \"rational\"  enough (as well as  binding upon\r\n\nus). \r\n\n     Yet,  many   judges  think   that  the  guidelines   are\r\n\nmanifestly unwise, as  a matter of  policy, in requiring  the\r\n\nuse of acquitted conduct  in calculating the guideline range.\r\n\nSee  United  States v.  Lanoue, 71  F.3d  966, 984  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1995).   A lawyer can  explain the distinction logically but,\r\n\nas a matter of public  perception and acceptance, the  result\r\n\ncan often invite disrespect for the sentencing process.  This\r\n\nthreat is aggravated insofar as the guidelines compel--rather\r\n\nthan merely permit--the practice.\r\n\n     Certainly  situations exist  where the  sentencing court\r\n\nmight persuasively explain the use of acquitted conduct.  For\r\n\nexample, a  defendant might be acquitted  because of reliable\r\n\nevidence suppressed  by a Fourth  Amendment exclusionary rule\r\n\nor the  defendant might later  be shown  to be guilty  by co-\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nconspirator  testimony  not  available  at the  time  of  the\r\n\nearlier  trial.    But   the  present  regime  commands  that\r\n\nacquitted conduct  be taken into account  and severely limits\r\n\nthe  court's ability  to disregard  it.   That a  practice is\r\n\nconstitutional does not make it wise.\r\n\n     Affirmed. \r                          \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n",

United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170, 187 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Lombard I \").  On remand, the district court reimposed the original sentence.  This new appeal raises a constitutional claim that Lombard made earlier but was not decided on the initial appeal.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are set forth at length in Lombard I, 72 F.3d at 172-76, and only the briefest summary is needed to set the stage.  Lombard and his half-brother, Hubert Hartley, were tried in Maine state court for murdering two acquaintances as they slept in Hartley's Maine cabin on Thanksgiving morning in 1990.  Despite something close to eyewitness testimony from Hartley's girlfriend, both men were acquitted by juries in separate trials in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury then indicted Lombard and Hartley for different crimes relating to the same episode.  Lombard and Hartley were charged with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, the conspiracy having multiple objectives:  to possess a firearm in violation of the felon in possession statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), to travel interstate to avoid prosecution, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1073, and to remove evidence to prevent seizure, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2232(a).  Lombard was also charged substantively under the felon in possession statute and Hartley with aiding and abetting this crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were tried together on the federal charges in 1993.  Much of the evidence concerned the commission of the same killings for which they had been acquitted, the evidence being relevant inter alia to the flight and removal of evidence charges.  Hartley pled guilty at the close of the government's case.  Lombard was convicted on both of the counts directed against him:  conspiracy and felon-in-possession.  Lombard's convictions were sustained in Lombard I and are not now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Lombard--without regard to the murders--was subject to a statutory sentence of 15 years to life because his prior convictions brought him within the armed career criminal statute.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, again without reference to the murders, the guideline sentencing range would have been roughly between 20 and 30 years.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4;  id. ch. 5, pt. A.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  However, Lombard had so many criminal history points over the number needed for the highest criminal history category that an upward departure might have been imposed.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the ordinary guideline computation went by the boards.  The felon in possession guideline provides that where the firearm is used in connection with another offense, the base level should be that of the \"object\" offense.  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2K2.1(c)(2), 2X1.1.  The base level for premeditated murder requires a life sentence.  Id. &#167; 2A1.1;  ch. 5, pt. A.  Because the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Lombard had participated in the premeditated murders, the court imposed a life sentence on Lombard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal in Lombard I, this court took note of several unusual circumstances, including the impact on the sentence of the uncharged murders, Lombard's prior acquittal of those murders, the qualitative difference between murder and the offense of conviction, and the extreme penalty of life imprisonment.  Expressing but not resolving constitutional concerns, the court then held that these special facts gave the district court discretionary authority to depart downward, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0, and remanded to permit the district court to consider such a departure.  72 F.3d at 184-85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the resentencing, the district court said that it fully understood (and had understood previously) its authority to depart downward.  But the court remained convinced that \"the appropriate sentence in this case is the sentence that was imposed initially,\" and it reimposed the life sentence.  Lombard now appeals again, stating that the single question presented is whether the district court violated his \"due process right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" as to the murders when it reimposed the life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the government asserts, somewhat to our surprise, that \"appellate jurisdiction does not exist.\"   Its stated reason is that a discretionary decision by the sentencing judge declining to depart from the guideline range is not subject to appeal.  While the premise is generally sound, United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1991), Lombard has explicitly declined to challenge the refusal to depart;  rather, he wants to renew his constitutional challenge to the use of the murders to establish the guideline range for his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing outre about the distinction.  Lombard is challenging his sentence, and the sentence--as many do--depended on several determinants:  here, the armed career criminal statute, various decisions made in applying the guidelines including the finding that Lombard had participated in the murders, and lastly a discretionary decision by the district judge not to depart from the guideline range.  That this last decision is unreviewable hardly precludes review of other parts of the equation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A challenge to the constitutionality of the guidelines as applied is certainly a permitted subject for an appeal, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a), and presents an issue that we consider de novo.  United States v. Carson, 988 F.2d 80, 82 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 847, 114 S.Ct. 142, 126 L.Ed.2d 105 (1993).  Of course, there might be a law-of-the-case bar to the appeal, although not a jurisdictional one, if this court had fully rejected the constitutional claims in Lombard I.   But Lombard I plainly said that constitutional concerns did exist but might be mooted by the remand.  72 F.3d at 184-85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons we will address in due course, Lombard does not place much weight on the element in this case that would strike non-lawyers as the most troubling:  that he has been given a life sentence based on a finding that he committed the two murders of which he was earlier acquitted.  Instead, he argues that the district court erred by using a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard to determine that he had in fact committed the prior murders and then by using this finding to sentence Lombard as if he had committed the murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The framework for federal sentencing is familiar.  Departures aside, the guidelines require the district court to calculate the guideline range based not only on the conduct comprising the federal crime of conviction but also on \"relevant\" albeit \"uncharged\" conduct--here, the murders--that the sentencing court finds actually occurred in connection with that crime.  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 1B1.3;  2K2.1(c)(2).  And ordinarily the facts at sentencing need be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence.  McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 91, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 2418, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986);  United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 80-81 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1069, 114 S.Ct. 1644, 128 L.Ed.2d 365 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of uncharged conduct at sentencing stems from the longstanding view that the judge should employ all relevant information that helps to decide where, within the broad range usually fixed by statute, this defendant should be sentenced.  United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972);  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3577.  As for the lower standard of proof, courts sometimes say that \"guilt\" is the crucial event that alone requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and sometimes that more procedural constraints would bog down sentencing.  See, e.g., McMillan, 477 U.S. at 92 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. at 2419 n. 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of historical practice and judicial precedent, a frontal attack on these practices would be difficult, and Lombard does not attempt it.  Rather, quoting \"the tail that wags the dog\" metaphor in McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417, Lombard says that due process requires the use of a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard in cases where, as here, the finding that the uncharged crime occurred has so severe an effect on the sentence.  He adds that in view of the jury's prior acquittal, there must be a reasonable doubt in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not an argument that would likely have had much success prior to the guidelines, cf.  Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 214, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 2329, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977), but the guidelines provide some basis for reconsidering the issue.  In the past, uncharged conduct was merely a background fact, like the defendant's criminal record or his habit of kicking his dog, that a judge might consider in making the highly discretionary, and largely ad hoc, decision as to sentence.  The guidelines have altered matters in at least one significant respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now have a regime that, aiming to provide equal treatment, requires the sentencing judge to make findings as to relevant uncharged conduct and absent a departure requires the judge to sentence on that basis within a very narrow range.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b);  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 1B1.1, 1B1.2, 5C1.1(a).  Thus a finding of an uncharged crime at sentencing, and the compulsory fixing of the sentence on that basis, makes the sentencing itself now look somewhat more like a conviction for that uncharged crime--but without the benefit of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt or, for that matter, an indictment or jury trial on that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most courts have been less, or not at all, troubled by use of the uncharged conduct that has only a limited effect on the sentence or is qualitatively the same crime as the offense of conviction (such as other related drug sales) or both.  See, e.g., United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437, 441-42 (1st Cir.1989).  As the impact and qualitative difference grow, courts become more concerned.  The reference in McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417, to the risk of the \"tail\" (sentencing) \"wagging the dog\" (the substantive offense) has often been taken to suggest that the Supreme Court might endorse some outer limit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines' substantive provisions were, in the main, intended to impose sentencing results very much like those that prevailed in the pre-guidelines era.  See Stephen Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L.Rev. 1, 8 (1988).  The pertinent change, as we have noted, is that the guidelines are compulsory.  But for Lombard the latter element has been largely removed by our decision in Lombard I, which restored to the district court its pre-guideline discretion to decide whether and how far to give weight to the murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, the district court may (and here did) still choose to give weight to the uncharged offenses in fixing the sentence within the statutory range if it finds by a preponderance of evidence that they occurred;  but this was always permitted by longstanding practice and explicit Supreme Court authority.  Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476, 485, 113 S.Ct. 2194, 2199, 124 L.Ed.2d 436 (1993);  Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949).  There is no indication that the Supreme Court has altered its position on this issue.  If anything, McMillan reinforced that position in upholding a mandatory sentence enhancement based on uncharged conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some may think that even the status quo ante is at odds with due process and that uncharged conduct should never be considered without criminal-trial safeguards.  But the choice then may be, in substance, between turning the sentencing into a new criminal trial or ignoring provable facts that most people think relevant in deciding who deserves more and who less punishment.  See Breyer, supra, at 9-12.   If the Constitution is now taken to forbid \"real offense\" sentencing unless criminal-trial procedures are applied, that ruling must come from a higher court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only circuit court squarely to impose a higher standard of proof in certain sentencings is the Third Circuit.  There, in United States v. Kikumura, 918 F.2d 1084 (3d Cir.1990), the court held that an upward departure due to uncharged conduct should be based on clear and convincing evidence where the finding had an extraordinary impact--there, \"a twelve-fold, 330-month departure from the median of an applicable sentencing range.\"  Id. at 1102.   This ruling was premised on a reading of the guidelines informed by due process concerns and has been much discussed but generally not followed.  See United States v. Masters, 978 F.2d 281, 286 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard does not urge this halfway house in the present case.  In truth, most judges are unlikely to see a great gulf between a preponderance and \"clear and convincing\" evidence.  Based upon the sentencing transcripts and the trial evidence in this case, the district court would probably find, as to Lombard, that the latter standard had been amply met.  By contrast, the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard is widely regarded as making a substantial difference and, for this very reason, courts have been very cautious in extending it to new realms.  Cf. Masters, 978 F.2d at 286-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, given Supreme Court precedents, we conclude that the Constitution does not require a heightened proof standard in a case such as ours.  Policy is a different matter:  on this score, one can argue about imposing greater safeguards for sentencing decisions that severely affect the defendant.  But if you asked trial judges, most would be likely to say that what they mainly needed was more latitude and fewer constraints.  Cf. Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2046-47, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996);  United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 951-52 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we think it essential to say a word about the matter that troubled the court in Lombard I but that Lombard has chosen not to stress, at least in his legal argument:  the use of acquitted conduct to enlarge his sentence.  This certainly accorded with the guidelines.  In their present form they draw no distinction between relevant conduct that is uncharged and relevant conduct of which the defendant has actually been acquitted.  Absent a departure, all must be given the weight assigned by the guidelines.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3;  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989).  The question is why.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The explanation for including acquitted conduct has the usual charm of lawyer's logic.  It is said that there is no technical inconsistency between a prior acquittal and the use of the very same acquitted conduct at sentencing to enlarge the sentence, because the jury merely found that the defendant had not been proved guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt\";  the sentencing judge, by contrast, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the acquitted conduct did occur.  See, e.g., United States v. Isom, 886 F.2d 736, 738 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This syllogism has been expressly adopted by the Supreme Court in another context, Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 349, 110 S.Ct. 668, 672, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990), and is regularly followed by the lower courts, including ours, in sentencing and elsewhere.  See, e.g., Rossetti v. Curran, 80 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1996).  Presumably, it is because of these precedents, emphasized in Lombard I, that Lombard has not challenged the syllogism or stressed the fact that the uncharged conduct in this case is also acquitted conduct.  As a matter of constitutional law, the syllogism is \"rational\" enough (as well as binding upon us).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, many judges think that the guidelines are manifestly unwise, as a matter of policy, in requiring the use of acquitted conduct in calculating the guideline range.  See United States v. Lanoue, 71 F.3d 966, 984 (1st Cir.1995).  A lawyer can explain the distinction logically but, as a matter of public perception and acceptance, the result can often invite disrespect for the sentencing process.  This threat is aggravated insofar as the guidelines compel--rather than merely permit--the practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly situations exist where the sentencing court might persuasively explain the use of acquitted conduct.  For example, a defendant might be acquitted because of reliable evidence suppressed by a Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule or the defendant might later be shown to be guilty by co-conspirator testimony not available at the time of the earlier trial.  But the present regime commands that acquitted conduct be taken into account and severely limits the court's ability to disregard it.  That a practice is constitutional does not make it wise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the sentencing took place in September 1994, the district court applied the November 1990 edition of the guidelines in order to avoid any ex post facto problems.

Lombard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196476\"><a href=\"/opinion/196476/united-states-v-lombard/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 187 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Lombard I \").  On remand, the district court reimposed the original sentence.  This new appeal raises a constitutional claim that Lombard made earlier but was not decided on the initial appeal.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are set forth at length in Lombard I, 72 F.3d at 172-76, and only the briefest summary is needed to set the stage.  Lombard and his half-brother, Hubert Hartley, were tried in Maine state court for murdering two acquaintances as they slept in Hartley's Maine cabin on Thanksgiving morning in 1990.  Despite something close to eyewitness testimony from Hartley's girlfriend, both men were acquitted by juries in separate trials in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury then indicted Lombard and Hartley for different crimes relating to the same episode.  Lombard and Hartley were charged with conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, the conspiracy having multiple objectives:  to possess a firearm in violation of the felon in possession statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), to travel interstate to avoid prosecution, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1073, and to remove evidence to prevent seizure, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2232(a).  Lombard was also charged substantively under the felon in possession statute and Hartley with aiding and abetting this crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were tried together on the federal charges in 1993.  Much of the evidence concerned the commission of the same killings for which they had been acquitted, the evidence being relevant inter alia to the flight and removal of evidence charges.  Hartley pled guilty at the close of the government's case.  Lombard was convicted on both of the counts directed against him:  conspiracy and felon-in-possession.  Lombard's convictions were sustained in Lombard I and are not now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Lombard--without regard to the murders--was subject to a statutory sentence of 15 years to life because his prior convictions brought him within the armed career criminal statute.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, again without reference to the murders, the guideline sentencing range would have been roughly between 20 and 30 years.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4;  id. ch. 5, pt. A.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  However, Lombard had so many criminal history points over the number needed for the highest criminal history category that an upward departure might have been imposed.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the ordinary guideline computation went by the boards.  The felon in possession guideline provides that where the firearm is used in connection with another offense, the base level should be that of the \"object\" offense.  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2K2.1(c)(2), 2X1.1.  The base level for premeditated murder requires a life sentence.  Id. &#167; 2A1.1;  ch. 5, pt. A.  Because the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Lombard had participated in the premeditated murders, the court imposed a life sentence on Lombard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal in Lombard I, this court took note of several unusual circumstances, including the impact on the sentence of the uncharged murders, Lombard's prior acquittal of those murders, the qualitative difference between murder and the offense of conviction, and the extreme penalty of life imprisonment.  Expressing but not resolving constitutional concerns, the court then held that these special facts gave the district court discretionary authority to depart downward, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0, and remanded to permit the district court to consider such a departure.  72 F.3d at 184-85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the resentencing, the district court said that it fully understood (and had understood previously) its authority to depart downward.  But the court remained convinced that \"the appropriate sentence in this case is the sentence that was imposed initially,\" and it reimposed the life sentence.  Lombard now appeals again, stating that the single question presented is whether the district court violated his \"due process right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" as to the murders when it reimposed the life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the government asserts, somewhat to our surprise, that \"appellate jurisdiction does not exist.\"   Its stated reason is that a discretionary decision by the sentencing judge declining to depart from the guideline range is not subject to appeal.  While the premise is generally sound, United States v. Romolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563790\"><a href=\"/opinion/563790/united-states-v-christopher-j-romolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991), Lombard has explicitly declined to challenge the refusal to depart;  rather, he wants to renew his constitutional challenge to the use of the murders to establish the guideline range for his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing outre about the distinction.  Lombard is challenging his sentence, and the sentence--as many do--depended on several determinants:  here, the armed career criminal statute, various decisions made in applying the guidelines including the finding that Lombard had participated in the murders, and lastly a discretionary decision by the district judge not to depart from the guideline range.  That this last decision is unreviewable hardly precludes review of other parts of the equation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A challenge to the constitutionality of the guidelines as applied is certainly a permitted subject for an appeal, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a), and presents an issue that we consider de novo.  United States v. Carson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601912\"><a href=\"/opinion/601912/united-states-v-douglas-henry-carson/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 82 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span> (1993).  Of course, there might be a law-of-the-case bar to the appeal, although not a jurisdictional one, if this court had fully rejected the constitutional claims in Lombard I.   But Lombard I plainly said that constitutional concerns did exist but might be mooted by the remand.  72 F.3d at 184-85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons we will address in due course, Lombard does not place much weight on the element in this case that would strike non-lawyers as the most troubling:  that he has been given a life sentence based on a finding that he committed the two murders of which he was earlier acquitted.  Instead, he argues that the district court erred by using a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard to determine that he had in fact committed the prior murders and then by using this finding to sentence Lombard as if he had committed the murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The framework for federal sentencing is familiar.  Departures aside, the guidelines require the district court to calculate the guideline range based not only on the conduct comprising the federal crime of conviction but also on \"relevant\" albeit \"uncharged\" conduct--here, the murders--that the sentencing court finds actually occurred in connection with that crime.  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 1B1.3;  2K2.1(c)(2).  And ordinarily the facts at sentencing need be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence.  McMillan v.

United States v. Tucker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108427\"><a href=\"/opinion/108427/united-states-v-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 446, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108427\"><a href=\"/opinion/108427/united-states-v-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As for the lower standard of proof, courts sometimes say that \"guilt\" is the crucial event that alone requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and sometimes that more procedural constraints would bog down sentencing.  See, e.g., McMillan, 477 U.S. at 92 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. at 2419 n. 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of historical practice and judicial precedent, a frontal attack on these practices would be difficult, and Lombard does not attempt it.  Rather, quoting \"the tail that wags the dog\" metaphor in McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417, Lombard says that due process requires the use of a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard in cases where, as here, the finding that the uncharged crime occurred has so severe an effect on the sentence.  He adds that in view of the jury's prior acquittal, there must be a reasonable doubt in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not an argument that would likely have had much success prior to the guidelines, cf.  Patterson v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109698\"><a href=\"/opinion/109698/patterson-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 214, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109698\"><a href=\"/opinion/109698/patterson-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2319</span></a></span>, 2329, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109698\"><a href=\"/opinion/109698/patterson-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span> (1977), but the guidelines provide some basis for reconsidering the issue.  In the past, uncharged conduct was merely a background fact, like the defendant's criminal record or his habit of kicking his dog, that a judge might consider in making the highly discretionary, and largely ad hoc, decision as to sentence.  The guidelines have altered matters in at least one significant respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now have a regime that, aiming to provide equal treatment, requires the sentencing judge to make findings as to relevant uncharged conduct and absent a departure requires the judge to sentence on that basis within a very narrow range.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b);  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 1B1.1, 1B1.2, 5C1.1(a).  Thus a finding of an uncharged crime at sentencing, and the compulsory fixing of the sentence on that basis, makes the sentencing itself now look somewhat more like a conviction for that uncharged crime--but without the benefit of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt or, for that matter, an indictment or jury trial on that crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most courts have been less, or not at all, troubled by use of the uncharged conduct that has only a limited effect on the sentence or is qualitatively the same crime as the offense of conviction (such as other related drug sales) or both.  See, e.g., United States v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522147\"><a href=\"/opinion/522147/united-states-v-bertie-alexander-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 441-42 (1st Cir.1989).  As the impact and qualitative difference grow, courts become more concerned.  The reference in McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417, to the risk of the \"tail\" (sentencing) \"wagging the dog\" (the substantive offense) has often been taken to suggest that the Supreme Court might endorse some outer limit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines' substantive provisions were, in the main, intended to impose sentencing results very much like those that prevailed in the pre-guidelines era.  See Stephen Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L.Rev. 1, 8 (1988).  The pertinent change, as we have noted, is that the guidelines are compulsory.  But for Lombard the latter element has been largely removed by our decision in Lombard I, which restored to the district court its pre-guideline discretion to decide whether and how far to give weight to the murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, the district court may (and here did) still choose to give weight to the uncharged offenses in fixing the sentence within the statutory range if it finds by a preponderance of evidence that they occurred;  but this was always permitted by longstanding practice and explicit Supreme Court authority.  Wisconsin v. Mitchell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112879\"><a href=\"/opinion/112879/wisconsin-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 485, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112879\"><a href=\"/opinion/112879/wisconsin-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span> (1993);  Williams v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104681\"><a href=\"/opinion/104681/williams-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 246, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104681\"><a href=\"/opinion/104681/williams-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1337</span></span> (1949).  There is no indication that the Supreme Court has altered its position on this issue.  If anything, McMillan reinforced that position in upholding a mandatory sentence enhancement based on uncharged conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some may think that even the status quo ante is at odds with due process and that uncharged conduct should never be considered without criminal-trial safeguards.  But the choice then may be, in substance, between turning the sentencing into a new criminal trial or ignoring provable facts that most people think relevant in deciding who deserves more and who less punishment.  See Breyer, supra, at 9-12.   If the Constitution is now taken to forbid \"real offense\" sentencing unless criminal-trial procedures are applied, that ruling must come from a higher court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only circuit court squarely to impose a higher standard of proof in certain sentencings is the Third Circuit.  There, in United States v. Kikumura, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551486\"><a href=\"/opinion/551486/united-states-v-kikumura-yu/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1990), the court held that an upward departure due to uncharged conduct should be based on clear and convincing evidence where the finding had an extraordinary impact--there, \"a twelve-fold, 330-month departure from the median of an applicable sentencing range.\"  Id. at 1102.   This ruling was premised on a reading of the guidelines informed by due process concerns and has been much discussed but generally not followed.  See United States v. Masters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593337\"><a href=\"/opinion/593337/united-states-v-alan-masters-and-james-d-keating/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 286 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard does not urge this halfway house in the present case.  In truth, most judges are unlikely to see a great gulf between a preponderance and \"clear and convincing\" evidence.  Based upon the sentencing transcripts and the trial evidence in this case, the district court would probably find, as to Lombard, that the latter standard had been amply met.  By contrast, the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard is widely regarded as making a substantial difference and, for this very reason, courts have been very cautious in extending it to new realms.  Cf. Masters, 978 F.2d at 286-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, given Supreme Court precedents, we conclude that the Constitution does not require a heightened proof standard in a case such as ours.  Policy is a different matter:  on this score, one can argue about imposing greater safeguards for sentencing decisions that severely affect the defendant.  But if you asked trial judges, most would be likely to say that what they mainly needed was more latitude and fewer constraints.  Cf. Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (1996);  United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 951-52 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we think it essential to say a word about the matter that troubled the court in Lombard I but that Lombard has chosen not to stress, at least in his legal argument:  the use of acquitted conduct to enlarge his sentence.  This certainly accorded with the guidelines.  In their present form they draw no distinction between relevant conduct that is uncharged and relevant conduct of which the defendant has actually been acquitted.  Absent a departure, all must be given the weight assigned by the guidelines.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3;  United States v. Mocciola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533000\"><a href=\"/opinion/533000/united-states-v-gerard-peter-mocciola/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1989).  The question is why.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The explanation for including acquitted conduct has the usual charm of lawyer's logic.  It is said that there is no technical inconsistency between a prior acquittal and the use of the very same acquitted conduct at sentencing to enlarge the sentence, because the jury merely found that the defendant had not been proved guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt\";  the sentencing judge, by contrast, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the acquitted conduct did occur.  See, e.g., United States v. Isom, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529973\"><a href=\"/opinion/529973/united-states-v-charles-e-isom/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span>, 738 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This syllogism has been expressly adopted by the Supreme Court in another context, Dowling v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 349, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 672, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span> (1990), and is regularly followed by the lower courts, including ours, in sentencing and elsewhere.  See, e.g., Rossetti v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196645\"><a href=\"/opinion/196645/rossetti-v-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.1996).  Presumably, it is because of these precedents, emphasized in Lombard I, that Lombard has not challenged the syllogism or stressed the fact that the uncharged conduct in this case is also acquitted conduct.  As a matter of constitutional law, the syllogism is \"rational\" enough (as well as binding upon us).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, many judges think that the guidelines are manifestly unwise, as a matter of policy, in requiring the use of acquitted conduct in calculating the guideline range.  See United States v. Lanoue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196477\"><a href=\"/opinion/196477/united-states-v-lanoue/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span>, 984 (1st Cir.1995).  A lawyer can explain the distinction logically but, as a matter of public perception and acceptance, the result can often invite disrespect for the sentencing process.  This threat is aggravated insofar as the guidelines compel--rather than merely permit--the practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly situations exist where the sentencing court might persuasively explain the use of acquitted conduct.  For example, a defendant might be acquitted because of reliable evidence suppressed by a Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule or the defendant might later be shown to be guilty by co-conspirator testimony not available at the time of the earlier trial.  But the present regime commands that acquitted conduct be taken into account and severely limits the court's ability to disregard it.  That a practice is constitutional does not make it wise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the sentencing took place in September 1994, the district court applied the November 1990 edition of the guidelines in order to avoid any ex post facto problems.
