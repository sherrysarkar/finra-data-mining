AND MARILYN CHAMBERS,\r\n\n                   Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n             MIDDLESEX MUTUAL ASSURANCE COMPANY,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n       [Hon. Eugene W. Beaulieu, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n         Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Joseph L. Ferris for appellants.\r\n   Julie D. Farr with whom Carl F. Rella was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n March 24, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  After full briefing, oral argument, and\r\nsubsequent deliberation, we find ourselves in accord with the\r\nMagistrate Judge's statement of relevant facts, pertinent state\r\ncaselaw, basic analysis, and legal conclusions as set forth in his\r\nMemorandum of Decision.  We therefore affirm on the basis of that\r\nopinion.\r\nOur additional comments are directed, first, at\r\nappellants' misreading of Tibbetts v. Maine Bonding and Cas. Co.,\r\n618 A.2d 731 (Me. 1992), as revealed by their brief; we then\r\nelaborate the rationale for allowing appellee to reduce its\r\nunderinsured motorist obligation by the amounts paid appellants by\r\nthe two underinsured tortfeasors.\r\nIn Tibbetts, where only one of two tortfeasors was\r\nunderinsured, the Supreme Judicial Court made two major points: (1)\r\na determination of underinsurance was governed by whether the\r\nliability insurance on a tortfeasor's vehicle was exceeded by the\r\nvictims' underinsured motorist coverage   a vehicle specific\r\nanalysis; and (2) subrogation rights under 24-A M.R.S.A.  2902(4)\r\nand the offset permitted by the reduction clause in the\r\nunderinsured motorist policy were inapplicable to amounts received\r\nfrom the insured tortfeasors.  The court saw the statutory mandate\r\nas that of filling \"the gap left by an underinsured tortfeasor\" and\r\nthe insurer's obligation to indemnify (and its right of\r\nsubrogation) as \"triggered\" only by the damage and payment\r\nattributable to the underinsured vehicle.  Id. at 734.  The linchpin of appellants' argument rests on what they\r\nview as the \"formula enunciated by the Court in Tibbetts.\"  Citing\r\nTibbetts, 618 A.2d at 734, they state:\r\n\"To the amount of its policy limits, [the\r\nplaintiff's insurance company's] contractual\r\nobligation to the [plaintiff] is determined by\r\nthe amount of the [plaintiff's] damages that\r\nare attributable to [the tortfeasors] reduced\r\nby any recovery received from [the\r\ntortfeasor's insurer].\"\r\n\nAppellants' Brief p. 9.\r\nAgain, later in their brief, while conceding that the\r\namount of damages does not affect the determination whether a\r\ntortfeasor is underinsured, they assert, based on the above\r\nparaphrase: \"However, once the determination is made that a\r\nparticular tortfeasor is underinsured, Tibbetts holds that the\r\namount of damages is used to calculate the amount of underinsured\r\nmotorist benefits that are due the insured party.\"  Appellants'\r\nBrief p. 14.\r\nThis is unfortunate.  At no point does the court make\r\nthis statement.  What appellants have seized upon is not a\r\ndefinition of the extent of a victim's underinsured motorist\r\ncoverage (or any \"contractual obligation\"), but a passage dealing\r\nwith the statutory right of subrogation in which the court made the\r\nobservation we have noted above -- since \"the insurer's obligation\r\nto indemnify . . . is limited to damages attributable to an\r\nunderinsured vehicle,\" its right of subrogation also applies only\r\nto proceeds \"received from\" the triggering vehicle.  The point that\r\nsubrogation extends only to damages attributable to an underinsured\r\nvehicle and not to an insured one cannot be construed as a \"formula\"\r\nrequiring that Maine courts calculate underinsured motorist\r\nbenefits by deducting recoveries from a victim's total damages.\r\nAnother misimpression arises from appellants' efforts to\r\navoid the application of Middlesex's policy clause allowing a\r\nreduction for amounts paid on behalf of tortfeasors.  Appellants\r\nstate, \"the Court in Tibbetts expressly voided a similar 'reduction\r\nclause.'\"  But the Tibbetts court was dealing with recovery of\r\namounts from an insured joint tortfeasor which, if a reduction were\r\ngiven, \"would nullify the statutorily authorized coverage for\r\ndamages caused by an uninsured motorist.\"  Id. at 734.\r\nComing now to our basic rationale, we focus on the plain\r\nmeaning of both the subrogation provision of the underinsured\r\nmotorist statute and the corresponding language of appellants'\r\nMiddlesex policy.\r\nThe statutory provision reads:\r\n  In the event of payment to any person\r\nunder uninsured vehicle coverage, and subject\r\nto the terms of such coverage, to the extent\r\nof such payment the insurer shall be entitled\r\nto the proceeds of any settlement or recovery\r\nfrom any person legally responsible for the\r\nbodily injury as to which such payment was\r\nmade, and to amounts recoverable from the\r\nassets of the insolvent insurer of the other\r\nmotor vehicle.\r\n\n24-A M.R.S.A.  2902(4).\r\n\nThe relevant policy language reads:\r\n\n  Any amounts otherwise payable for\r\ndamages under the coverage shall be reduced by\r\nall sums:\r\n\n  1.  Paid because of the \"bodily\r\n  injury\" by or on behalf of\r\n  persons or organizations who may\r\n  be legally responsible . . . .\r\n\nAs appellants point out, the statute \"presumes a payment\r\nhas been made\" by the underinsured motorist insurer.  This language\r\nexpresses the generic subrogation concept of \"substitution of one\r\nperson in the place of another with reference to a lawful claim,\r\ndemand, or right,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1595 (4th ed. 1957).  In\r\nthe classic subrogation situation, Middlesex would first make\r\npayment to appellants of its underinsured policy limit of $100,000. \r\nThen, stepping into appellants' shoes, it would recover, by suit or\r\nsettlement, a total of $70,000 from the two tortfeasors' liability\r\npolicies.  The result would be a net outlay to the victims of\r\n$30,000 by Middlesex and $70,000 from the tortfeasors.  The same\r\nend result is achieved if, as is contemplated by the policy\r\nreduction clause, the victim's underinsurance motorist insurer has\r\nnot yet paid the victim, but the victim's recovery is reduced from\r\nan amount \"otherwise payable.\"\r\nAppellants assert that \"Section 2902(4) gives the\r\nunderinsured motorist provider a right of action against the\r\ntortfeasors, not a mechanism to reduce the obligation to its\r\ninsured.\"  In our view, they are unpersuasive in demonstrating why\r\na reduction of obligation does not follow from the existence of the\r\nright of action.  While appellants assert that, despite giving\r\n\"full subrogation rights,\" the statute \"simply does not permit the\r\nstacking of those underlying insurance coverages,\" it nevertheless \r\ngives the underinsured motorist carrier entitlement to \"the\r\nproceeds of any settlement or recovery from any person legally\r\nresponsible.\"  To our mind, \"any\" in this context includes \"all.\" \r\nWere the entitlement to be calculated by deducting credit for one\r\nsettlement from Middlesex's exposure, then by deducting the second\r\ncredit from the original undiminished coverage, Middlesex would be\r\na victim of having its exposure doubled.\r\nHad there been only one tortfeasor, with liability\r\ncoverage of $70,000, there would be no basis for arguing that\r\nMiddlesex should contribute more than $30,000.  No reason is\r\nadvanced why Middlesex's entitlement to settlement proceeds should\r\nbe less in the case of, say, two tortfeasors, each carrying\r\nliability insurance on the amount of $35,000.  The gap of\r\nunderinsurance remains the same.\r\nA recent Massachusetts case dealing with an\r\nunderinsurance coverage statute similar to Maine's is instructive. \r\nIt declared that a policy's underinsurance coverage was not\r\navailable \"because the limits of that coverage did not exceed the\r\nsum of the two responsible tortfeasors.\"  Hanover Insurance Co. v.\r\nPascar, 421 Mass. 442, 443 (1995).  The court also commented:\r\n  We note as well that cases from other\r\njurisdictions which have considered this issue\r\n(and which also have construed an insurance\r\npolicy or a statute written in the singular)\r\nhave concluded that the sum of the personal\r\ninjury liability limits of separate policies\r\ninsuring joint tortfeasors should be\r\nconsidered for the purpose of deciding whether\r\nunderinsured coverage will be available to an\r\ninjured insured.\r\n\nId. at 446 (citations omitted). \r\nAffirmed.\n",
