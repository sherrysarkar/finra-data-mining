Plaintiffs,  purchasers  of the\r                                        \r\n\nsecurities of Digital Equipment Corp., appeal from the district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of  two consolidated  class actions  alleging\r\n\nviolations  of the  federal securities  laws.   Both complaints\r\n\nassert that there were misleading statements and nondisclosures\r\n\nin  the  registration  statement  and  prospectus  prepared  in\r\n\nconnection  with  a public  offering of  stock.   That offering\r\n\ncommenced on March 21, 1994, just 11 days prior to the close of\r\n\nthe  quarter then in progress,  and about three  weeks prior to\r\n\nthe company's announcement of an unexpectedly negative earnings\r\n\nreport for that quarter.  One of the complaints further alleges\r\n\nthat defendants made fraudulently optimistic statements to  the\r\n\npublic in the period  leading up to the offering.  The district\r\n\ncourt found that neither complaint identified any statements or\r\n\nomissions actionable  under the  securities laws  and dismissed\r\n\nboth  for failure to state a claim.   We agree that many of the\r\n\nalleged misstatements  and omissions  do not provide  a legally\r\n\ncognizable  basis  for  the  plaintiffs' claims,  but  we  also\r\n\nconclude that  a limited set of allegations  in both complaints\r\n\nrelating to  the registration statement and  prospectus for the\r\n\nMarch 1994 offering does state a  claim.  We further find  that\r\n\nthe surviving  portions of the complaints  satisfy the pleading\r\n\nrequirements of Fed. R.  Civ. P. 9(b).  Accordingly,  we affirm\r\n\nthe  district court's  decision in  part, reverse in  part, and\r\n\nremand for further proceedings.\r\n\n                              -3-\r\r\n\n                               I.\r\n\n                           Background\r                                                 \r\n\n       Digital  Equipment  Corporation (\"DEC\")  is  one  of the\r\n\nworld's  largest suppliers of  computer hardware,  software and\r\n\nservices.  Founded  in 1957,  it first became  a publicly  held\r\n\ncompany  in 1966.  By  the early 1990's,  the company's success\r\n\nhad  burgeoned  into  $14  billion  in yearly  revenues.    The\r\n\ncompany's success story,  however, would not last forever.   By\r\n\n1992, the company had fallen on hard times.  In January 1992 it\r\n\nreported  its  first-ever quarterly  operating  loss  of $138.3\r\n\nmillion.   Faced in the ensuing months with operating losses in\r\n\nthe  range  of $30  million to  $311  million per  quarter, the\r\n\ncompany  decided to  engage in  radical surgery,  cutting loose\r\n\nsome  35,000  employees over  the course  of  15 months  in the\r\n\nprocess,  including its founder and CEO.  To cover the costs of\r\n\nthese  actions, the company accumulated \"restructuring\" charges\r\n\ntotalling  close  to $3.2  billion  in  fiscal years  1990-1992\r\n\ncombined.\r\n\n       In the midst of its financial woes, however, the company\r\n\ntook some  steps to restore its health.   In February 1992, DEC\r\n\nhad introduced a new product, the \"Alpha\" chip.  The Alpha chip\r\n\nwas hailed  as a  technological advance that  could potentially\r\n\nrestore  the  company's fortunes.    In  mid-1992, the  company\r\n\ninstalled a new CEO, Robert B. Palmer.  He took the helm in the\r\n\nfall  of  that  year, as  the  company  continued to  implement\r\n\nstrategies  to help its Alpha technology gain acceptance in the\r\n\n                              -4-\r\r\n\nmarketplace  and  to  bring   the  company  back  to  financial\r\n\nvitality.   At  the  time Palmer  took  over, the  company  had\r\n\nabsorbed  over $3 billion in  losses for the  prior three years\r\n\nand  had  been losing  money at  the  rate of  approximately $3\r\n\nmillion  per day.  Under  the new management,  it appeared that\r\n\nthe company's financial hemorrhaging had finally begun to slow.\r\n\n       On  January 14, 1993, DEC reported a loss for the second\r\n\nquarter of fiscal year 1993 that  was far smaller than had been\r\n\nanticipated by analysts.  That promising result was followed by\r\n\nanother   quarter   of  losses,   but   within   Wall  Street's\r\n\nexpectations.   Then, on July  28, 1993, the  company announced\r\n\nits first profitable quarter since before the 1992 fiscal year,\r\n\nreporting a net profit of $113.2 million for the fourth quarter\r\n\nof  fiscal year 1993.  That result was slightly below analysts'\r\n\nexpectations, but  a stark improvement over  the operating loss\r\n\nof $188.1 million (and overall loss of $2 billion) reported for\r\n\nthe comparable quarter in the prior year.\r\n\n       Still,  on October  20, 1993,  DEC announced  a  loss of\r\n\n$83.1  million for  the first quarter  of 1994,  an improvement\r\n\nover the $260.5  million loss  for the same  quarter the  prior\r\n\nyear,  but worse than analysts had been predicting.  On January\r\n\n19,  1994, the  company  announced  another setback,  reporting\r\n\nlosses for  the  second quarter  of  fiscal year  1994,  ending\r\n\nJanuary  1, 1994,  of $72  million.   The loss  was  worse than\r\n\nanalysts had expected and was virtually identical to the losses\r\n\nfor that period the prior year.\r\n\n                              -5-\r\r\n\n       It was against  this backdrop that  DEC, on January  21,\r\n\n1994,  filed  with the  SEC  a  \"shelf\" registration  statement\r\n\ngiving  the company the  option to  issue up  to $1  billion in\r\n\nvarious  classes of  debt and  equity securities.    Two months\r\n\nlater, DEC  through its  underwriters conducted an  offering of\r\n\n$400 million in depositary  shares of preferred stock, pursuant\r\n\nto the \"shelf\" registration, a prospectus dated March 11, 1994,\r\n\nand a prospectus supplement dated March 21, 1994.  The offering\r\n\ncommenced on the  date of the prospectus  supplement and closed\r\n\none  week later on March 28, 1994,  four days before the end of\r\n\nthe  third fiscal quarter.  All 16 million depositary shares of\r\n\npreferred stock were sold,  at an offering  price of $25.   DEC\r\n\nraised a badly needed $387.4 million.1\r\n\n       Less  than three  weeks later,  on April  15, 1994,  DEC\r\n\nannounced  an  operating  loss of  over  $183  million  for the\r\n\nquarter that  had ended on April  2, 1994.  This  third quarter\r\n\nloss  was far greater than analysts had been expecting, and the\r\n\nlargest that the  company had reported since  the first quarter\r\n\nof fiscal 1993.  It bucked the positive trend of reduced losses\r\n\nunder the company's new management.   The announcement sent the\r\n\nprice of  the newly  distributed preferred stock  tumbling from\r\n\nthe offering price of $25 to $20.875 by the close of trading on\r\n\nApril 15.  The common stock fell from $28.875 to $23 during the\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Because  the offering  was  conducted pursuant  to a  \"firm\r\ncommitment\"  underwriting  arrangement,  DEC  sold  all of  the\r\noffered shares to the  underwriters at a discount, who  then in\r\nturn  sold the shares to the public.  Thus, DEC's proceeds were\r\nless than the total offering amount.\r\n\n                              -6-\r\r\n\nsame period, and to  $21.125 by the  close of the next  trading\r\n\nday.\r\n\n       In its April 15 announcement, the company also disclosed\r\n\nthat it had decided to \"accelerate [its] on-going restructuring\r\n\nefforts\" and  \"also consider further restructuring.\"   This was\r\n\ndespite a representation in  the March 21 prospectus supplement\r\n\nthat   \"[t]he   Corporation   believes   that   the   remaining\r\n\nrestructuring  reserve of  $443  million is  adequate to  cover\r\n\npresently   planned   restructuring   actions.\"     Eventually,\r\n\nfollowing  the close of fiscal year 1994, DEC announced on July\r\n\n14, 1994 that it  would cut almost one-fourth of  its remaining\r\n\nworkforce and  take an additional  charge of  $1.2 billion  for\r\n\nfiscal year 1994  (beyond the $443 million remaining in reserve\r\n\nas  of March 21) to cover the costs of additional restructuring\r\n\nactivities.\r\n\n                              II.\r\n\n                   Description of the Actions\r                                                         \r\n\n       These  two lawsuits  were  filed on  Tuesday, April  19,\r\n\n1994,  two business  days after  the company's  announcement of\r\n\nApril 15, 1994.  One, the Wilensky action, brought on behalf of\r                                              \r\n\nall  persons who  purchased  shares in  the  March 1994  public\r\n\noffering, asserts claims  under Sections 11,  12(2), and 15  of\r\n\nthe Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\")  against DEC, its\r\n\nChief Executive Officer (Robert B. Palmer), its Chief Financial\r\n\nOfficer  (William Steul), and  seven underwriting or investment\r\n\nbanking firms,  representing a purported defendant  class of 65\r\n\n                              -7-\r\r\n\nunderwriters who participated in the offering.  The second, the\r\n\nShaw action, advances claims under  Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of\r                \r\n\nthe  Securities Exchange Act of 1934  (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule\r\n\n10b-5,   and  a   pendent   claim  of   common  law   negligent\r\n\nmisrepresentation, on  behalf of  all purchasers of  DEC common\r\n\nstock  between January  19  and  April  15,  1994  (the  \"Class\r\n\nPeriod\").\r\n\n       At  the heart of both complaints are two sets of claims.\r\n\nFirst, plaintiffs  assert that DEC management  had knowledge of\r\n\nmaterial facts concerning  the large  losses developing  during\r\n\nthe  third fiscal quarter of 1994, and that the defendants were\r\n\nunder  a duty  to  disclose such  material  information to  the\r\n\nmarket  in connection  with  the public  offering conducted  on\r\n\nMarch  21, 1994.  Second, both the Wilensky and Shaw plaintiffs\r                                                                \r\n\ncontend that the representation made in the March 21 prospectus\r\n\nsupplement  concerning the  \"adequacy\"  of  the  then-remaining\r\n\n\"restructuring reserve\" was  materially misleading.   The  Shaw\r                                                                           \r\n\nplaintiffs  allege,  additionally,  that throughout  the  Class\r\n\nPeriod,  the defendants made fraudulently optimistic statements\r\n\nto  the  public  concerning  DEC's future  prospects  in  order\r\n\nartificially to  inflate the market  value of  DEC shares,  and\r\n\nthat these statements were actionably false or misleading.\r\n\n       The defendants  filed motions  to dismiss under  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 9(b) and 12(b)(6).  The district court consolidated the\r\n\ncases, stayed  all discovery, and then  dismissed both actions.\r\n\nThe  district  court ruled,  inter  alia,  that defendants  had\r\n\n                              -8-\r\r\n\nviolated  no   duty  to  disclose  and   that  the  defendants'\r\n\nstatements  were  not  misleading,  bespoke  caution,  or  were\r\n\notherwise not actionable as a matter of law.  The court granted\r\n\nthe defendants' motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), without\r\n\nreaching   whether  the   complaints  satisfied   the  pleading\r\n\nrequirements  of Rule 9(b).  These appeals followed.  We affirm\r\n\nin  part and reverse in part.   For clarity, we discuss each of\r\n\nthe two actions in turn.\r\n\n                              III.\r\n\n                The Section 11 and 12(2) Claims\r                                                           \r\n\n                       (Wilensky Action)\r                                            \r\n\n       Sections 11 and 12(2) are enforcement mechanisms for the\r\n\nmandatory  disclosure  requirements of  the  Securities Act  of\r\n\n1933.     Section  11   imposes  liability  on   signers  of  a\r\n\nregistration   statement,   and   on   underwriters,   if   the\r\n\nregistration  statement \"contained  an  untrue  statement of  a\r\n\nmaterial fact or omitted  to state a material fact  required to\r\n\nbe stated therein  or necessary to make  the statements therein\r\n\nnot misleading.\"  15 U.S.C.   77k.  Section 12(2) provides that\r\n\nany person  who \"offers  or  sells\" a  security by  means of  a\r\n\nprospectus or  oral communication containing a materially false\r\n\nstatement  or that \"omits to state a material fact necessary to\r\n\nmake  the statements, in  the light of  the circumstances under\r\n\nwhich they were made,  not misleading,\" shall be liable  to any\r\n\n\"person  purchasing  such  security from  him.\"    15 U.S.C.   \r\n\n77l(2).\r\n\n                              -9-\r\r\n\n       The Wilensky plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 11,\r                               \r\n\n12(2), and  15,2 alleging  that the registration  statement and\r\n\nprospectus  filed  in connection  with  the  March 1994  public\r\n\noffering  contained materially false  statements and omitted to\r\n\nstate  material information  required  to be  provided therein.\r\n\nThe thrust of the Wilensky complaint is that defendants knew as\r                                      \r\n\nof the March 21 date  of the 1994 public offering,  of material\r\n\nfacts portending  the unexpectedly  large losses for  the third\r\n\nquarter  of fiscal  1994 that  were announced  later, and  that\r\n\nfailure to  disclose these  material facts in  the registration\r\n\nstatement  and prospectus violated  Section 11.   Additionally,\r\n\nthe  Wilensky  plaintiffs contend  that  the  statement in  the\r                         \r\n\nregistration   statement   and  prospectus   characterizing  as\r\n\n\"adequate\" the company's then-remaining \"restructuring reserve\"\r\n\nof  $443  million  was  materially  false  and  misleading,  in\r\n\nviolation of both Sections 11 and 12.\r\n\n       The defendants parry by attempting to reduce plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims to an argument that the company was required to disclose\r\n\nits internal forecasts about the outcome of the third  quarter.\r                                  \r\n\nThey argue  that the plaintiffs' position  is untenable because\r\n\nthe securities laws impose  no duty upon a company  to disclose\r\n\ninternal projections, estimates of  quarterly results, or other\r\n\nforward-looking information.  They  also say that the statement\r\n\nconcerning the adequacy of the company's restructuring reserves\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Section 15  imposes derivative  liability upon  persons who\r\n\"control\" those  liable under Section 11 or 12.  See 15  U.S.C.\r                                                                \r\n  77o.\r\n\n                              -10-\r\r\n\nis  not  actionably  misleading  when  considered  in  context.\r\n\nFinally, defendants contend that  the complaint fails to allege\r\n\nsufficient  facts  establishing that  DEC  and  the underwriter\r\n\ndefendants were statutory \"sellers\" subject to  liability under\r\n\nSection 12(2).  We evaluate each set of arguments separately.\r\n\nA.  Actionability of Alleged Nondisclosures Under Section 11\r                                                                        \r\n\n       The proposition that silence, absent a duty to disclose,\r\n\ncannot  be  actionably  misleading,  is a  fixture  in  federal\r\n\nsecurities law.  See, e.g., Backman v. Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n10,  13 (1st  Cir. 1990)  (en banc).   Equally settled  is that\r\n\naccurate reports of past successes  do not themselves give rise\r\n\nto  a duty to inform the  market whenever present circumstances\r\n\nsuggest that  the future may bring  a turn for the  worse.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSerabian v. Amoskeag Bank  Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357,  361 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1994);  Capri Optics  Profit  Sharing  v.

In short, the  mere\r                 \r\n\npossession of material nonpublic  information does not create a\r\n\nduty  to disclose  it.  See  Roeder v. Alpha  Indus., Inc., 814\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing Chiarella v.

The obligations that attend the preparation of\r\n\nthose  filings embody  nothing if  not  an affirmative  duty to\r\n\n                              -11-\r\r\n\ndisclose a broad range  of material information.  Cf.  Herman &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nMacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S.  375, 381-82 (1983). Indeed, in\r                                 \r\n\nthe context of a public offering, there is a strong affirmative\r\n\nduty  of disclosure.3   See  Ernst &amp;  Ernst v.  Hochfelder, 425\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 185,  195  (1976) (the  Securities  Act \"was  designed  to\r\n\nprovide  investors with full disclosure of material information\r\n\nconcerning public offerings\").\r\n\n       The question  here is not whether  defendants were under\r\n\nan abstract duty to disclose information -- clearly, they were.\r\n\nThe  issue, rather,  is whether the  defendants had  a specific\r\n\nobligation  to  disclose  information  of  the  type  that  the\r\n\nplaintiffs complain was omitted from the registration statement\r\n\nand  prospectus.    The  task of  deciding  whether  particular\r\n\ninformation is  subject to  mandatory disclosure is  not easily\r\n\nseparable  from   normative  judgments   about  the   kinds  of\r\n\ninformation  that  the securities  laws  should  require to  be\r                                                           \r\n\ndisclosed,  which  depend,   in  essence,  on  conceptions   of\r\n\nmateriality.     See  generally  Victor  Brudney,   A  Note  On\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  In  Roeder, this  court  alluded to  three situations  that\r                          \r\ncould give rise to a duty to disclose material facts:  (i) when\r\nan insider trades in  the company's securities on the  basis of\r\nmaterial  nonpublic  information;  (ii)   when  a  statute   or\r\nregulation requires disclosure; and  (iii) when the company has\r\npreviously made  a statement  of material  fact that is  false,\r\ninaccurate,  incomplete,   or  misleading  in   light  of   the\r\nundisclosed information.

We  do not\r                                     \r\ndecide here  whether these three  situations are the  only ones\r\nthat  could  trigger a  duty  of  disclosure,  or whether  they\r\nnecessarily would do so in every case.\r\n\n                              -12-\r\r\n\nMateriality and  Soft Information Under the  Federal Securities\r                                                                           \r\n\nLaws,  75 Va. L.  Rev. 723, 728  (1989).  For  our purposes, it\r                \r\n\nsuffices  to say that the determination  of whether the alleged\r\n\nnondisclosures in this case  provide a legally sufficient basis\r\n\nfor the plaintiffs' claims cannot be severed from consideration\r\n\nof the basic policies  underlying the disclosure obligations of\r\n\nthe applicable statutes and regulations.\r\n\n       We conclude that we cannot say that DEC was not required\r\n\nto disclose material information  concerning its performance in\r\n\nthe quarter  in progress  at the  time of  the  March 21,  1994\r\n\npublic offering.  Nor can  we conclude, as a matter of  law and\r\n\non  these pleadings,  that DEC  was not  in possession  of such\r\n\nmaterial nonpublic information at the time of the offering.\r\n\n       1.  The Insider Trading Analogy\r                                                  \r\n\n       In   understanding   the   nature  of   the   disclosure\r\n\nrequirements  attending  a  public  offering of  stock,  it  is\r\n\nhelpful  to  conceptualize DEC  (the  corporate  issuer) as  an\r\n\nindividual insider transacting in the company's securities, and\r\n\nto examine the disclosure obligations that would then arise.\r\n\n       There is  no doubt that an  individual corporate insider\r\n\nin possession of material  nonpublic information is  prohibited\r\n\nby the federal securities laws from trading on that information\r\n\nunless he makes public disclosure.  He must disclose or abstain\r\n\nfrom trading.  See SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833,\r                                                            \r\n\n848  (2d Cir.  1968)  (en banc),  cert.  denied, 394  U.S.  976\r                                                           \r\n\n(1969);  see also SEC v.

A central justification for the \"disclose or\r\n\nabstain\" rule is to deny  corporate insiders the opportunity to\r\n\nprofit  from the inherent trading advantage  they have over the\r\n\nrest of the contemporaneously trading market by reason of their\r\n\nsuperior access to information.  See Shapiro  v. Merrill Lynch,\r                                                                           \r\n\nPierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 495 F.2d 228, 235 (2d Cir. 1974);\r                                        \r\n\nSEC v.

Judge Easterbrook and  Professor Fischel ultimately  reject\r\nthis   beating-the-market  concern   as  a   justification  for\r\nmandatory disclosure.  They  argue that companies normally will\r                     \r\nvoluntarily  disclose material bad  news, because,  among other\r\nreasons,  if   a  company  consistently  fails   to  make  such\r\ndisclosure, the market will discount the value of the company's\r\nsecurities  by   the  increased  probability  that   it  is  in\r\n\n                              -14-\r\r\n\n       The policy rationale for  the \"disclose or abstain\" rule\r\n\ncarries over to  contexts where a corporate  issuer, as opposed\r\n\nto  an   individual,  is   the  party  contemplating   a  stock\r\n\ntransaction.

However,  as  the  authors  also\r                          \r\nrecognize,   the  argument  for  voluntary  disclosure  becomes\r\nconsiderably weaker in contexts where  the short-term interests\r\nof the company's managers  differ from its long-term interests,\r\nfor example, where management  is under pressure to  engineer a\r\nrapid turnaround  in the company's financial  performance.  See\r                                                                           \r\nid. at 169 (discussing  the \"agency\" problem in the  context of\r               \r\ntender offers).\r\n\n                              -15-\r\r\n\nbeen  held   to  an  obligation  of   full  disclosure  . . . .\r\n\nConceptually,  extending  the  insider  trading  prohibition to\r\n\ninstances of issuer insider trading makes perfect sense.\").\r\n\n       Just  as an individual  insider with  material nonpublic\r\n\ninformation about pending merger or license negotiations  could\r\n\nnot   purchase   his   company's  securities   without   making\r\n\ndisclosure,  the  company  itself  may  not engage  in  such  a\r\n\npurchase  of its  own stock,  if it  is in  possession of  such\r                    \r\n\nundisclosed information.   See, e.g.,  Rogen, 361 F.2d  at 268.\r                                                        \r\n\nBy extension, a comparable rule should apply to issuers engaged\r\n\nin a stock offering.  Otherwise, a corporate issuer selling its\r                               \r\n\nown securities would be left free to exploit  its informational\r\n\ntrading  advantage, at  the expense  of investors,  by delaying\r\n\ndisclosure  of  material  nonpublic negative  news  until after\r\n\ncompletion of the  offering.

The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme\r                                                          \r\n\n       Analogizing a corporate issuer  to an individual insider\r\n\nsubject  to the \"disclose  or abstain\" rule  of insider trading\r\n\nlaw  illustrates  the policy  reasons  supporting  a comparably\r\n\nstrong  disclosure  mechanism  in   the  context  of  a  public\r\n\noffering.   We look  to the explicit  statutory and  regulatory\r\n\n                              -16-\r\r\n\nframework to determine whether the Securities Act provides such\r\n\na  mechanism,  and  whether  the Wilensky  complaint  states  a\r                                                     \r\n\nlegally cognizable claim for nondisclosure under Section 11.\r\n\n       Section  11 by its terms  provides for the imposition of\r\n\nliability  if a  registration  statement, as  of its  effective\r\n\ndate: (1) \"contained an untrue statement of material fact\"; (2)\r\n\n\"omitted  to  state  a  material  fact required  to  be  stated\r\n\ntherein\"; or (3) omitted to state a material fact \"necessary to\r\n\nmake  the  statements  therein  not  misleading.\"    15  U.S.C.\r\n\n  77k(a).  The plaintiffs' claim of nondisclosure relies on the\r\n\nsecond  of these three bases  of liability.   That predicate is\r\n\nunique  to Section 11; neither Section  12(2) of the Securities\r\n\nAct  nor Section  10(b) or  Rule 10b-5  under the  Exchange Act\r\n\ncontains  comparable language.   It is intended  to ensure that\r\n\nissuers, under  pain of  civil liability,  not  cut corners  in\r\n\npreparing registration  statements and  that they  disclose all\r\n\nmaterial information required  by the  applicable statutes  and\r\n\nregulations.

Form S-3  is  a streamlined  registration form\r\n\navailable only to certain  well-capitalized and widely followed\r\n\nissuers about which a  significant amount of public information\r\n\nis  already available.8  A  registrant on Form S-3 accomplishes\r\n\ndisclosure  in  part  by  incorporating in  the  prospectus  by\r\n\nreference  its  most  recent Form  10-K  and  Forms  10-Q filed\r\n\npursuant  to the Exchange Act.

Unlike registrants on more broadly available forms\r\n\n(such as S-1), a Form S-3 registrant is not required separately\r\n\nto furnish  in the prospectus the information  required by Item\r\n\n303(a) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R.   229.303(a) (\"Management's\r\n\ndiscussion and  analysis of financial condition  and results of\r\n\noperations\"),9 because  that  information  is  presumed  to  be\r\n\ncontained   in  the   Exchange  Act   filings  that   Form  S-3\r\n\nincorporates by reference, which  are themselves subject to the\r\n\nrequirements of Regulation S-K.10   The primary purpose  of the\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  To be eligible to register on Form S-3, an issuer must have\r\nbeen subject to public reporting  requirements for at least one\r\nyear, filed all reports required  under the Exchange Act  (such\r\nas Forms 10-Q  and 10-K) timely during the past  year, and must\r\nmeet certain other requirements  relating to financial strength\r\nand stability.

By  contrast,  a registrant  on Form  S-1 (which  does not\r\npermit incorporation  by reference) must  independently furnish\r\nin the  prospectus  the information  required  by Item  303  of\r\nRegulation S-K.

The  question,  then,  is  whether  the  complaint\r\n\ncontains  sufficient  allegations  that  defendants  failed  to\r\n\ndisclose   in  the   registration  statement   any  information\r\n\nregarding \"material changes\" in DEC's \"affairs\" as of March 21,\r\n\n1994,  that had  occurred since July  3, 1993 and  had not been\r\n\nreported  in  the Form  10-Q filed  for  the second  quarter of\r\n\nfiscal  year 1994.   If  the Wilensky  complaint adequately  so\r                                                 \r\n\nalleges, then  the complaint sets  forth a cognizable  claim of\r\n\nnondisclosure under Section 11,  namely, that defendants failed\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  The  effective date  of  the  registration  statement  for\r\npurposes of Securities Act liability is  the \"speaking date\" of\r\nthe  final   prospectus.    See  Bloomenthal   et  al.,  supra,\r                                                                          \r\n  5.05[2][f] at 216.  The parties do not dispute that March 21,\r\n1994 was the effective date of the registration statement.\r\n\n                              -20-\r\r\n\nto include in the  registration statement information \"required\r\n\nto be stated therein.\"\r\n\n       3.  The Alleged Nondisclosures\r                                                 \r\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that defendants  failed to comply  with\r\n\nItem 11(a) by omitting three categories of information from the\r\n\nregistration  statement  and  prospectus.    First,  plaintiffs\r\n\ncontend  that  defendants  failed  to  disclose  that  DEC  had\r\n\nembarked on  a risky marketing strategy  that involved slashing\r\n\nprices  and   sacrificing  profit  margins  in   the  hopes  of\r\n\nincreasing  \"market  penetration\" of  the company's  Alpha chip\r\n\nproducts.  Second, plaintiffs  assert that defendants failed to\r\n\ndisclose  that under  the  company's compensation  scheme,  its\r\n\nsales  representatives  were being  paid  \"double commissions,\"\r\n\nagain to the detriment of the company's profit margins.  Third,\r\n\nand  most centrally, plaintiffs allege that, by the date of the\r\n\nMarch 21 offering, defendants were in possession of, yet failed\r\n\nto disclose,  material knowledge  of facts indicating  that the\r\n\nthird fiscal  quarter would be an  unexpectedly disastrous one.\r\n\nWe dispose of the  first two claims of nondisclosure,  and then\r\n\nfocus our discussion on the third.\r\n\n          a.  Marketing Strategy\r                                            \r\n\n       The  defendants  provide  a  decisive rejoinder  to  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  claim of  nondisclosure concerning  the \"marketing\r\n\nstrategy\":  the  relevant  aspects  and   consequences  of  the\r\n\nstrategy were in fact  prominently disclosed, both in  the text\r\n\n                              -21-\r\r\n\nof   the   prospectus   and  in   documents   incorporated   by\r\n\nreference.12   For  example, in  its Form  10-Q filing  for the\r\n\nquarter ending  October 2, 1993  (the first  quarter of  fiscal\r\n\nyear 1994), the company explained its reported decline in gross\r\n\nprofit margins as follows:13\r\n\n       The decline in product gross margin resulted from\r\n       the decrease in product  sales, a continued shift\r\n       in  the  mix  of  product  sales  toward  low-end\r\n       systems  which  typically  carry  lower  margins,\r\n       competitive  pricing  pressures  and  unfavorable\r\n       currency   fluctuations,   partially  offset   by\r\n       manufacturing cost efficiencies.\r\n\n       The  Corporation  has   adopted  an   aggressive,\r\n       competitive  price structure  for  its  Alpha AXP\r\n       systems.   Given  this  pricing, as  well  as the\r\n       factors described in the preceding paragraph, the\r\n       Corporation   expects  to   experience  continued\r\n       downward pressure on product gross margins.\r\n\nThis statement, in  conjunction with related disclosures  found\r\n\nelsewhere  in the prospectus  and incorporated filings relating\r\n\nto  \"competitive  pricing  pressures,\"  declining  gross profit\r\n\nmargins,   \"competitive   pricing    actions   taken   by   the\r\n\nCorporation,\"  an \"industry  trend toward  lower  product gross\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  As  required by Item 12  of the instructions  to Form S-3,\r\nthe  March  11, 1994  prospectus  specifically incorporated  by\r\nreference the company's Form  10-K filing for fiscal  year 1993\r\n(as amended by  Form 10-K/A dated March 11, 1994), and its Form\r\n10-Q filings for the quarterly periods that ended on October 2,\r\n1993 and January 1, 1994.\r\n\n13.  Since   the  complaint   alleges  nondisclosures   in  the\r\nregistration statement  and prospectus,  the court may  look to\r\nthe text of those materials and the incorporated SEC filings to\r\ndetermine whether the plaintiffs' allegations are well founded.\r\nSee  Kramer v. Time  Warner, Inc., 937  F.2d 767,  774 (2d Cir.\r                                             \r\n1991).   We discuss more fully later the circumstances in which\r\na court  may look outside  the four corners  of a complaint  in\r\ndeciding a motion to dismiss.\r\n\n                              -22-\r\r\n\nmargins,\"   and   \"persistent  intense   pricing  competition,\"\r\n\ntogether obviate  the plaintiffs' claim that  defendants failed\r\n\nto disclose the company's  adoption of a price-cutting strategy\r\n\nto boost the \"market penetration\" of its Alpha-based systems.\r\n\n          b.  \"Double Commissions\"\r                                              \r\n\n       The plaintiffs'  claim of a failure  to disclose \"double\r\n\ncommissions\" also fails to make out a Section 11 violation.  To\r\n\nthe   extent   that   the  claim   comprises   allegations   of\r\n\nmismanagement,14  it is  not  cognizable  under the  securities\r\n\nlaws.  See Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v.

Otherwise, the  claim fails for\r\n\nlack  of any  allegations  establishing a  plausible theory  of\r\n\nmateriality.\r\n\n       The complaint does not allege that  \"double commissions\"\r\n\nhave  some intrinsic  significance  to investors.    Plaintiffs\r\n\ncomplain, rather, that DEC  failed to tell the market  that the\r\n\ncommission-based compensation scheme, instead of boosting sales\r\n\nas it was  supposed to  do, was contributing  to the  company's\r\n\nlosses.  This argument is problematic.  As the complaint itself\r\n\nacknowledges, DEC publicly announced  the switch from a salary-\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  The  complaint's  assertion   that  \"DEC  implemented  its\r\ncommission  program  and  set  sales  quotas  without   careful\r\nevaluation\" is an example of such an allegation.\r\n\n                              -23-\r\r\n\nbased  compensation scheme  to the  incentive-based model  that\r\n\nproduced the double commissions.  Furthermore, according to the\r\n\ncomplaint,  the switch  was  made not  during the  third fiscal\r                                                 \r\n\nquarter  of 1994,  but some  two years earlier,  in 1992.   The\r                                                                    \r\n\nplaintiffs do  not  allege that  any  material changes  to  the\r\n\ncompensation scheme were implemented after that time.  Whatever\r\n\nthe bearing of DEC's incentive-based compensation scheme on the\r\n\ncompany's expenses  in relation to its  revenues, the investing\r\n\npublic  had  at least  a year's  worth  of hard  financial data\r\n\n(through the second quarter of fiscal 1994) to evaluate whether\r\n\nthe  commission   system   was  working   to   increase   gross\r\n\nmargins,15 or  instead, as  plaintiffs allege, to  shrink them.\r\n\nPlaintiffs  do not allege that  there were any material changes\r\n\nin the payment  of commissions  between the time  of the  March\r\n\npublic  offering  and the  last prior  Form  10-Q filed  by the\r\n\ncompany  (for the  second fiscal  quarter of  1994), and  so on\r\n\ntheir  own theory  the claim  that DEC  failed to  disclose the\r\n\npayment of \"double commissions\" amounts to naught.\r\n\n          c.

In evaluating  this claim, we\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  The payments made to  sales representatives constituted  a\r\ncomponent   of  the  company's   quarterly  expenses,  and  the\r\naggregate effect of such payments could have been determined by\r\nexamining the  company's quarterly earnings  data, as disclosed\r\nin the required SEC filings.\r\n\n                              -24-\r\r\n\naccept arguendo  the complaint's allegations16 that  DEC had in\r                           \r\n\nits  possession as  of  the March  21  offering date  nonpublic\r\n\ninformation  concerning  the company's  ongoing quarter-to-date\r\n\nperformance,   indicating   that  the   company   would  suffer\r\n\nunexpectedly large  losses  for that  quarter.   We ask,  then,\r\n\nwhether  there was a duty  to disclose such  information in the\r\n\nregistration  statement and  prospectus  under  the  rubric  of\r\n\n\"material changes\" under Item 11(a) of Form S-3.  We focus upon\r\n\nthe defendants' primary legal arguments on this point: that DEC\r\n\nwas under no duty to disclose \"intra-quarterly\" results or  any\r\n\nother  information  concerning  its  third  quarter performance\r\n\nuntil  after the quarter ended; and that defendants had no duty\r\n\nas  of March 21, 1994  to disclose any  internal projections or\r\n\npredictions concerning the expected outcome of the quarter.\r\n\n       A central  goal underlying the  disclosure provisions of\r\n\nthe securities laws  is to promote  fairness and efficiency  in\r\n\nthe  securities markets.

Plaintiffs, however,  insist  that  their\r\n\nSection 11  claim is concerned  not with  the nondisclosure  of\r\n\nprojections, but of current  information that DEC allegedly had\r\n\nin  its  possession as  of March  21,  1994 about  \"losses\" the\r\n\ncompany  was  incurring in  the  ongoing  quarter.   Defendants\r\n\nrespond, in turn, that  under a system of  quarterly reporting,\r\n\n\"losses\" cannot be realized until a quarter has ended, and that\r\n\nbecause  the quarter  in question  did not  end until  April 2,\r\n\n1994, whatever information  DEC had as  of March 21  concerning\r\n\nthat quarter necessarily must have been forward-looking, in the\r\n\nnature  of a projection or forecast, which it had no obligation\r\n\nto disclose.\r\n\n       DEC's  argument elevates  form  over  substance.   DEC's\r\n\nassertion that  companies do not realize \"losses\" as such until\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nplanned offering until  after the quarter is completed  and the\r\nresults from the quarter are publicly reported.\r\n\n                              -31-\r\r\n\na  quarter has  ended is,  of course,  largely unexceptionable.\r\n\nBut it does  not follow that DEC's  only information concerning\r\n\nthe  ongoing quarter  as of  March 21  must have  been forward-\r\n\nlooking.   That  contention  relies on  two faulty  components.\r\n\nFirst,  it assumes  that plaintiffs  could not  adduce adequate\r\n\nevidence   that  defendants  were  actually  in  possession  of\r\n\nmaterial information about the  ongoing quarter at the relevant\r\n\ntime.  Second,  it assumes that the potential  unreliability of\r\n\ninferences that  could be drawn from  current information about\r\n\noperating results as of eleven days before the end of a quarter\r\n\nabsolutely protects that information from mandatory disclosure.\r\n\nThe first premise is  inconsistent with the standards governing\r\n\na Rule 12(b)(6)  motion to  dismiss.  The  second confuses  the\r\n\nissue of materiality with the duty to disclose.\r\n\n       Defendants  posit, in essence, that there can never be a\r\n\nduty to disclose internally known, pre-end-of-quarter financial\r\n\ninformation,  because  any inferences  about  the  quarter that\r\n\nmight  be  drawn  from   such  information  could  be  rendered\r\n\nunreliable by later developments in the same quarter, such as a\r\n\nsudden  surge of  profitable  sales.   This  position does  not\r\n\nwithstand scrutiny.  Present,  known information that  strongly\r\n\nimplies  an  important  future   outcome  is  not  immune  from\r\n\nmandatory disclosure merely because  it does not foreordain any\r\n\nparticular  outcome.     The  question  whether  such   present\r\n\ninformation  must be  disclosed  (assuming the  existence of  a\r\n\nduty), poses  a classic  materiality issue: given  that at  any\r\n\n                              -32-\r\r\n\npoint in a quarter, the remainder of the period may not  mirror\r\n\nthe  quarter-to-date, is  there a  sufficient probability  that\r\n\nunexpectedly disastrous quarter-to-date performance  will carry\r\n\nforward  to  the end  of the  quarter,  such that  a reasonable\r\n\ninvestor   would  likely   consider  the   interim  performance\r\n\nimportant to the overall mix of information available?\r\n\n       As desirable as bright-line  rules may be, this question\r\n\ncannot be answered by reference to  such a rule.  To try  to do\r\n\nso would  be contrary to Basic, Inc.  v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224\r                                                             \r\n\n(1988).  The Supreme Court there refused to adopt a bright-line\r\n\napproach   to  determine  at   what  stage  preliminary  merger\r\n\ndiscussions   create  a   sufficient   probability  of   actual\r\n\nconsummation to become  material.  See id. at 237-39 (rejecting\r                                                      \r\n\n\"agreement-in-principle\" test).  So here.  We decline to adopt,\r\n\nas defendants  would have  us do,  a  hard and  fast rule  that\r\n\ncurrent information concerning a company's operating experience\r\n\nis  never  subject to  disclosure until  after  the end  of the\r\n\nquarter  to  which  the  information  pertains.    Rather,  the\r\n\nquestion is whether the nondisclosure of interim facts rendered\r\n\nthe prospectus materially  incomplete.  An  issuer's compliance\r\n\nwith the  periodic disclosure requirements of  the Exchange Act\r\n\ndoes  not per  se preclude  such undisclosed  facts  from being\r                             \r\n\nmaterial.\r\n\n       By the same token,  we reject any bright-line rule  that\r\n\nan  issuer  engaging  in  a  public offering  is  obligated  to\r\n\ndisclose interim operating results  for the quarter in progress\r\n\n                              -33-\r\r\n\nwhenever it perceives a  possibility that the quarter's results\r\n\nmay  disappoint the market.  Far from it.  Reasonable investors\r\n\nunderstand that businesses fluctuate,  and that past success is\r\n\nnot a guarantee of more of the same.  There is always some risk\r\n\nthat the quarter in progress at  the time of an investment will\r\n\nturn out  for the issuer  to be  worse than  anticipated.   The\r\n\nmarket  takes   this  risk  of  variability   into  account  in\r\n\nevaluating the company's prospects based on the available facts\r\n\nconcerning  the  issuer's   past  historical  performance,  its\r\n\ncurrent   financial  condition,   present  trends   and  future\r\n\nuncertainties.    But,  strong-form  efficient  market theories\r\n\naside, the  ability of market  observers to evaluate  a company\r\n\ndepends  upon the information publicly  available to them.  If,\r\n\nas plaintiffs  allege  here, the  issuer  is in  possession  of\r\n\nnonpublic information  indicating that the quarter  in progress\r\n\nat the time of the public offering will be an extreme departure\r\n\nfrom the range of  results which could be anticipated  based on\r\n\ncurrently available  information,  it is  consistent  with  the\r\n\nbasic  statutory  policies   favoring  disclosure  to   require\r\n\ninclusion of that information in the registration statement.\r\n\n       We  do not  mean to  imply, however,  that nondisclosure\r\n\nclaims  similar to those asserted  by plaintiffs here can never\r\n\nbe disposed  of as a matter of law.  In many circumstances, the\r\n\nrelationship between the  nonpublic information that plaintiffs\r\n\nclaim  should  have been  disclosed and  the actual  results or\r\n\nevents that  the undisclosed information  supposedly would have\r\n\n                              -34-\r\r\n\npresaged will be so attenuated that the undisclosed information\r\n\nmay be  deemed immaterial as a matter of law.

They contend that\r\n\nthe statement of DEC's  \"belie[f]\" as to the \"adequacy\"  of the\r\n\nthen-remaining $443  million  restructuring reserve  \"to  cover\r\n\npresently   planned  restructuring   actions\"  was   false  and\r\n\nmisleading, in light of information  contemporaneously known to\r\n\nthe company.\r\n\n       1.  Background\r                                 \r\n\n       The   \"restructuring   reserve\"  referred   to   in  the\r\n\nprospectus supplement originated as a $1.5 billion charge taken\r\n\nby DEC  at the close  of its fiscal  year 1992 (ended  June 27,\r\n\n1992) as part  of the company's  ongoing efforts to  streamline\r\n\nthe company  \"to achieve  a competitive cost  structure.\"   The\r\n\nreserve was intended to cover the anticipated costs of employee\r\n\nseparations,  facilities   consolidations,  asset  retirements,\r\n\nrelocations, and  related expenses.   The company  had absorbed\r\n\nsimilar restructuring charges of  $1.1 billion and $550 million\r\n\nin fiscal years 1991 and 1990, respectively.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nlaw,  unless the market would have had some reason to discredit\r\nthe projection, thereby creating a substantial  likelihood that\r\na  reasonable investor  might still  have found  the underlying\r\ninformation  important   to  the  total   mix  of   information\r\navailable.\r\n\n                              -37-\r\r\n\n       During fiscal year  1993, DEC took  a number of  actions\r\n\nconsistent with the $1.5 billion dollar reserve recorded at the\r\n\nend  of fiscal year 1992.  By the  end of the fiscal year (July\r\n\n3,   1993),  the   remaining   reserve  was   reported  to   be\r\n\napproximately $739 million.  During  the first two quarters  of\r\n\nthe  next fiscal year, the  company continued to  draw from the\r\n\nreserve, so that by the  end of the second quarter  (January 1,\r\n\n1994), the reserve stood at approximately $443 million.  In its\r\n\nForm  10-Q  for  that  quarter, dated  February  4,  1994  (and\r\n\nincorporated by reference  into the registration statement  and\r\n\nprospectus  at issue here), DEC stated its belief that the $443\r\n\nmillion   reserve  was   \"adequate\"   to  cover   restructuring\r\n\nactivities  planned at that time.   This statement was repeated\r\n\nin  the prospectus supplement dated  March 21, 1994.   The full\r\n\nstatement,  with its  immediately surrounding  context, was  as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n       While spending for R&amp;E  [research &amp;  engineering]\r\n       and SG&amp;A  [selling, general &amp; administrative]  is\r\n       declining, the Corporation  believes its cost and\r\n       expense levels  are still too high  for the level\r\n       and  mix  of  total  operating  revenues.     The\r\n       Corporation is reducing  expenses by streamlining\r\n       its   product   offerings    and   selling    and\r\n       administrative practices, resulting in reductions\r\n       in employee population, closing and consolidation\r\n       of  facilities  and  reductions  in discretionary\r\n       spending.    The Corporation  believes  that  the\r\n       remaining restructuring reserve  of $443  million\r\n       is   adequate   to    cover   presently   planned\r\n       restructuring  actions.    The  Corporation  will\r\n       continue to take  actions necessary to  achieve a\r\n       level of costs  appropriate for its revenues  and\r\n       competitive for its business.\r\n\n                              -38-\r\r\n\n       As events turned  out, additional restructuring  charges\r\n\nwere in fact taken  later in fiscal year 1994.  At  the time of\r\n\nthe company's  announcement  on  April  15, 1994  of  the  $183\r\n\nmillion loss for  the third fiscal  quarter of 1994,  defendant\r\n\nPalmer  stated that  he  had already  instructed management  to\r\n\n\"accelerate [the company's] on-going restructuring efforts\" and\r\n\nthat  the company  would  \"consider  further  restructuring  to\r\n\nachieve [its]  goals.\"   In  line  with these  statements,  the\r\n\ncompany announced on  July 20,  1994 (just after  the close  of\r\n\nfiscal year 1994)  that it  had decided to  take an  additional\r\n\nrestructuring charge of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1994 (ended\r\n\nJune 30, 1994).\r\n\n       2.  Whether the Statement Was Misleading\r                                                           \r\n\n       Although defendants were  required to disclose the  size\r\n\nof  the remaining  restructuring  reserve  in the  registration\r\n\nstatement and  prospectus as affecting the  company's liquidity\r\n\nand capital resources,22  the characterization  of the  reserve\r\n\nas adequate was  arguably voluntary.

The \"adequacy\"  statement has  both a\r\n\nforward-looking  aspect  and  an  aspect  that   encompasses  a\r\n\nrepresentation of present fact.  In its forward-looking aspect,\r\n\nthe  statement   suggests  that  DEC  would   take  no  further\r\n\nrestructuring charges in the near-term future.  In its present-\r\n\noriented aspect, it represents  that as of March 21,  1994, DEC\r\n\nhad  no  current  intent  to undertake  activities  that  would\r\n\nrequire any such further restructuring charges to be taken.  To\r\n\nthe extent  that plaintiffs allege that  the reserve \"adequacy\"\r\n\nstatement  encompasses  the  latter representation  of  present\r                                                                           \r\n\nfact, and that  such a representation  was false or  misleading\r                \r\n\nwhen made,  the surrounding cautionary language  could not have\r\n\nrendered  the statement  immaterial as  a matter  of law.

The prospectus supplement does state\r\n\nthat  DEC will \"continue  to take actions,\"  but it  is at best\r\n\nambiguous  whether those \"actions\"  refer to  any restructuring\r\n\nactivities  other than  those \"presently  planned.\"   Thus, one\r\n\nmight  easily interpret  the purportedly  cautionary statement,\r\n\nespecially in light of the \"adequacy\" characterization, to mean\r\n\nthat  the  company's  ongoing  \"actions\" will  continue  to  be\r\n\ncovered by the existing restructuring reserve.  If it was true,\r\n\nas plaintiffs allege, that defendants knew as of March 21, 1994\r\n\nthat DEC's  performance in the third  quarter would precipitate\r\n\nactions  on a  scale  and schedule  that would  necessitate the\r\n\ntaking  of additional  restructuring  charges,  the  \"adequacy\"\r\n\nstatement may well have been materially misleading.\r\n\n       We  cannot conclude,  as a  matter of  law and  on these\r\n\npleadings,  that the  actionability of  the \"reserve  adequacy\"\r\n\nstatement is precluded by a context that bespeaks caution.  The\r\n\ncautionary statements to which defendants point did not provide\r\n\nan unambiguous  warning of the possibility that  DEC might take\r\n\nadditional restructuring  charges in the  near future --  as it\r\n\nturned out, a charge of $1.2 billion in the fiscal year then in\r\n\nprogress.

The dismissal  of the  Section 12(2)\r\n\nclaim as to the other defendants will accordingly be affirmed.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n25.  Defendants argue that, as a matter of fact, the market was\r\nwell aware in January 1994 or earlier that DEC might eventually\r\nbe forced to take further restructuring charges in fiscal  year\r\n1994.   This, however, does not address whether the disclosures\r\nin the prospectus supplement  themselves \"bespeak caution\" as a\r\nmatter of law.   Moreover, the evidence cited by  defendants on\r\nthis point  goes far beyond  the allegations of  the complaint.\r\nWhile evidence of actual market knowledge might be proper grist\r\nfor  the summary judgment mill  on the question of materiality,\r\nit  cannot properly  be  considered in  evaluating whether  the\r\nplaintiffs' complaint is legally sufficient to survive a motion\r\nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\r\n\n26.  The  district  court,  having  dismissed  the  plaintiffs'\r\nclaims on other grounds, did not reach this issue.   We may, of\r\ncourse,   affirm  the   district  court's   dismissal  on   any\r\nindependently sufficient  ground.

The plaintiffs  do not\r\n\ncontend  otherwise.   In  a firm  commitment underwriting,  the\r\n\nissuer of the securities sells all  of the shares to be offered\r\n\nto one or more underwriters, at some discount from the offering\r\n\nprice.  Investors thus purchase shares in the offering directly\r\n\nfrom the underwriters (or  broker-dealers who purchase from the\r\n\nunderwriters), not  directly  from the  issuer.   In fact,  the\r\n\nMarch 21, 1994  prospectus supplement  represented that  \"[DEC]\r\n\nhas agreed not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer or enter\r\n\n                              -47-\r\r\n\ninto any agreement  to offer  or sell, shares  of [the  offered\r\n\nstock].\"\r\n\n       Because the  issuer in  a firm  commitment  underwriting\r\n\ndoes not pass  title to  the securities, DEC  and its  officers\r\n\ncannot be held liable as  \"sellers\" under Section 12(2)  unless\r\n\nthey   actively  \"solicited\"   the   plaintiffs'  purchase   of\r\n\nsecurities  to  further their  own  financial  motives, in  the\r\n\nmanner of a broker or  vendor's agent.

Steul was quoted\r\n\nas saying  that the company's  transition to selling  its Alpha\r\n\nchip products was  \"going reasonably well\" and that the company\r\n\n\"should show  progress quarter  over quarter, year  over year.\"\r\n\nWe  hold  to  be  similarly not  actionable  (because  patently\r\n\nimmaterial)  Steul's  comment  of  January 19,  1994  that  the\r\n\ncompany  was \"basically on  track\"; his comment  of January 20,\r\n\n1994 that  \"DEC was a  very healthy company\";  defendant Robert\r\n\nPalmer's statement of the same date that he was \"confident that\r\n\nDEC  was pursuing the right strategy\"; and the February 8, 1994\r\n\nstatement by DEC's head of European operations (not a defendant\r\n\nhere) that he  was \"pretty optimistic\"  that the company  would\r\n\n\"be  able  to stabilize  [its] revenue\"  in  the first  half of\r\n\ncalendar  year 1994 and \"start  to grow revenue\"  in the second\r\n\nhalf.    These statements  all so  obviously  fail to  pose any\r\n\n\"substantial  likelihood\"  of being  \"viewed by  the reasonable\r\n\ninvestor\" -- let  alone the market --  \"as having significantly\r\n\naltered  the total  mix of  information available,\"  Basic, 485\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  at 231-32  (quotation  omitted), that  they are  properly\r\n\ndeemed immaterial as a matter of law.33\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n33.

Whatever  the  circumstances  in which  a\r\ncompany  might be  subject  to a  duty to  \"update\" information\r\npreviously disclosed, we do not think that the pre-Class Period\r\nstatements identified by  plaintiffs are of the kind that could\r\ntrigger  any  such  duty.    The  alleged  statement  regarding\r\n\"service revenues\"  constitutes a statement of  historical fact\r\nnot alleged  to be  false, and  as such,  does not  provide the\r\nbasis for a duty to update.  See Serabian, 24 F.3d at 361.  The\r                                                     \r\nother alleged  statements  are cautiously  optimistic  comments\r\nthat  would not be actionable  in the first  instance.

Moreover,  it seems\r\nlikely  that  any  \"duty  to  update\"  DEC's  pre-Class  Period\r\nstatements  would  have  been  extinguished  by  the  company's\r\ndisclosure of  financial information  in the  negative earnings\r\nannouncement  of January 19, 1994, the first day of the alleged\r\nClass Period.\r\n\n                              -58-\r\r\n\nprovide reason for pause.

Rather,  they appear,  in\r\n\nisolation, to  be statements quantifying  the company's current\r\n\noperating inflows as more  or less approximating outflows, thus\r\n\ninviting  an  inference  that the  end  results  for the  third\r\n\nquarter  might turn  out likewise.   The  rub, however,  is the\r\n\ncontext surrounding the statements.

We  look to  the full context  of the  \"break-even\"\r\n\nstatements attributed to defendant Steul.34\r\n\n       The  first time the \"break-even\"  statement appeared was\r\n\nin a  Boston Herald article headlined \"Digital falls short with\r\n\n$72.1M  loss,\" published on January 20, 1994, the day after DEC\r\n\nhad announced its disappointing earnings results for the second\r\n\nquarter  of  fiscal year  1994.    The article  attributed  the\r\n\nfollowing statement to Steul:\r\n\n       The $72 million loss represents  only 2.2 percent\r\n       of revenues, Steul said.   \"We are operating very\r\n       close to break-even.  It's a lot of money, but on\r\n       the other hand it's small compared to what losses\r\n       have been in the past.\"  Steul would not say when\r\n       Digital will again be profitable.  \"I hesitate to\r\n       give  you an  estimate because  we just  have too\r\n       much  uncertainty   in  the   immediate   future\"\r\n       [paragraph structure omitted].\r\n\nIt is  plain that Steul's \"break-even\"  characterization refers\r\n\nto  the fact  that  the $72  million  loss that  had just  been\r\n\nreported for the  second quarter  of fiscal year  1994 was,  in\r                                    \r\n\nfact, only a small percentage of the company's total  revenues.\r\n\nThe  statement cannot  reasonably be  understood as  a material\r\n\ncomment on  the current status  or anticipated  results of  the\r\n\ncompany's  third quarter.  Since  plaintiffs do not allege that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n34.

Plaintiffs have not objected to the district court's\r\nnor  the defendants' making reference to the full text of those\r\narticles.\r\n\n                              -60-\r\r\n\nthe  characterization  of  \"close   to  break-even\"  placed  an\r\n\nactionably fraudulent spin on DEC's second quarter results, the\r                                                      \r\n\nstatement in that context can be of no moment.\r\n\n       The second \"break-even\" statement appeared in a February\r\n\n23, 1994 Wall Street Journal article.  The article's author had\r                                        \r\n\nobtained  an \"internal\"  DEC finance  review, and  divulged its\r\n\ncontents as follows:\r\n\n       \"We're  running very  close to  break-even,\"  the\r\n       [internal]  review  says,   though  \"revenue   is\r\n       uncertain  for  next  two-plus  quarters.\"    The\r\n       review concludes  that Digital \"will still  be in\r\n       turnaround for the  next two  or three  quarters\"\r\n       and that managers  should \"focus heavily on  cash\r\n       conservation.\"   There is a chance,  it adds, \"if\r\n       we keep at Q2 spending levels, that we can make a\r\n       profit this  fiscal  year.\"    While  Mr.  Palmer\r\n       confirmed many  of these points  in an interview,\r\n       he wouldn't  make any forecast.  \"This is a large\r\n       organization that  was  in deep  trouble  when  I\r\n       started,  and   we  still  have  a   way  to  go\"\r\n       [paragraph structure omitted].\r\n\nThe  context  of the  \"break-even\"  statement  in the  internal\r\n\nreview,  as reported,  sufficiently bespeaks caution  to render\r\n\nany forward-looking connotation that  could otherwise be  taken\r\n\nfrom the statement immaterial as a matter of law.

Given  the statements attributed\r                  \r\n\nto the internal review that \"revenue is uncertain for next two-\r\n\nplus quarters\"; that \"[DEC] will still be in turnaround for the\r\n\nnext two or three quarters\"; that \"we still have a  way to go\";\r\n\n                              -61-\r\r\n\nand  given  Palmer's reported  refusal  to  make any  forecast,\r\n\ncoupled  with  the  absence  of  any  specifics  regarding  the\r\n\nauthoritativeness or timeliness  of the  \"internal\" report,  no\r\n\nreasonable  investor  (nor  the  market)  could  have  attached\r\n\nimportance to  any forward-looking connotation  of the  \"break-\r\n\neven\" statement described in the article.\r\n\n       A similar analysis applies to the \"break-even\" statement\r\n\nthat appeared in the  March 29, 1994 issue of  Financial World.\r                                                                          \r\n\nIn that article, defendant  Steul was quoted as saying  \"We are\r\n\nvery  close to break-even.   If it hadn't  been for currencies,\r\n\nand had we been able to ship  everything ordered, we would have\r\n\nbeen in  the black in  the second quarter.\"   As with  the Wall\r                                                                           \r\n\nStreet Journal piece, neither  the Financial World piece itself\r                                                              \r\n\nnor  the  Shaw  complaint  specifies  the  date  on  which  the\r                          \r\n\nstatement was  actually made.35   But, again, Rule  9(b) issues\r\n\naside, the \"break-even\" comment is most naturally understood as\r\n\nlooking backward to the  second quarter of fiscal 1994,  not to\r\n\nthe  future.  Furthermore, to the extent that any other meaning\r\n\ncould be discerned, it is directly negated by other  qualifying\r\n\ncomments attributed to Steul in the same article, including the\r\n\nfollowing:\r\n\n       What Digital needs at  this point is time.   Says\r\n       Steul, \"Wall  Street always  wants quick results,\r\n       but it took a couple of years to get where we are\r\n       and  it will take more than  a couple of quarters\r\n       to turn it around.\"  \r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n35.  It is  unclear whether  the statement quoted  in Financial\r                                                                           \r\nWorld had been freshly made by Steul, or was recycled from pre-\r                 \r\nexisting sources.  The Shaw complaint does not specify.\r                                       \r\n\n                              -62-\r\r\n\nThis warning that favorable results would be slow to come is  a\r\n\nfar cry from a  \"prediction of a break-even year,\" which is how\r\n\nplaintiffs  characterize  Steul's   comments.     Additionally,\r\n\nbecause plaintiffs  allege  that  a fraud  on  the  market  was\r\n\ncommitted   by  statements   communicated  in   this  financial\r\n\nanalyst's article,  it is only  fair to note that  the tenor of\r\n\nthe   article  is   one  of   skepticism  about   DEC's  future\r\n\nprospects.36  On the  facts as alleged, the district  court did\r\n\nnot err  in concluding that  the \"break-even\" statement  in the\r\n\nFinancial World piece was immaterial as a matter of law.\r                           \r\n\nC.

These alleged misstatements\r\n\nand omissions are identical to those that underlie the Wilensky\r                                                                           \r\n\nplaintiffs'  claims   under  Sections  11  and   12(2)  of  the\r\n\nSecurities  Act.   We  conclude  that the  Shaw  plaintiffs may\r                                                           \r\n\npursue their Section 10(b) claim based on these alleged defects\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n36.  For  example, the  article quotes  statements by  analysts\r\nexpressing  skepticism  about  DEC's prospects,  and  cautions:\r\n\"Reasonable as [Steul's comments  concerning a turn-around] may\r\nsound,  recall  that it  was  only last  September  [1993] that\r\nSteul's boss boasted  that Digital  was on its  way back  after\r\nthree  years and  over 83  billion of  red ink.\"   We  need not\r\ndecide here whether an allegedly misleading statement appearing\r\nin one source can be rendered immaterial as a matter of law, at\r\nthe  pleading stage,  by third-party  commentary  in that  or a\r\ndifferent source.\r\n\n                              -63-\r\r\n\nin the registration statement and prospectus.

In the context of\r\n\na  fraud-on-the-market  claim,  this  principle  has  a  simple\r\n\nrationale.  The registration statement and prospectus speak not\r\n\nonly to  those who purchase in the  offering, but to the entire\r\n\nmarket.    If an  issuer's  registration  statement contains  a\r\n\nmisleading  statement of  fact  about  the company's  financial\r\n\ncondition  or   omits  material  information  required   to  be\r\n\ndisclosed, the impact of  such statements or omissions, to  the\r\n\nextent  material,  would  not  necessarily be  limited  to  the\r\n\nsecurities  covered by the registration statement.  There is no\r\n\n                              -64-\r\r\n\nlogical  reason that  a registration  statement and  prospectus\r\n\ncould  not  serve as  a vehicle  for  an alleged  fraud  on the\r\n\nmarket, affecting all of the company's securities.   Thus, even\r\n\nthough the Shaw plaintiffs purchased shares of DEC common stock\r                           \r\n\nin  the  aftermarket,  not  shares of  preferred  stock  in the\r\n\noffering,   their   fraud-on-the-market  claims   may  properly\r\n\nencompass  any  material  misstatements  or  omissions  in  the\r\n\nregistration statement.

In so  holding, we do not intend to create a private right\r\nof action under Section  10(b) for violations of any  SEC rule.\r\nOur  holding is limited to the proposition that, in the context\r\nof a  public offering, plaintiffs who (through the market) rely\r\nupon the completeness of a registration statement or prospectus\r\nmay sue under Section  10(b) and Rule 10b-5  for nondisclosures\r\nof material facts omitted from those documents in  violation of\r\nthe applicable  SEC rules  and regulations.

A different\r\nrule  would  lead  to the  anomalous  result  of  a Rule  10b-5\r\nplaintiff being able  to sue an individual  insider selling his\r\ncompany's   securities  for   the  nondisclosure   of  material\r\nnonpublic information,  but not being  able to  sue the  issuer\r\nitself  for  failing  to   disclose  the  same  information  in\r\nconnection with an offering.\r\n\n                              -65-\r\r\n\n       Our conclusion  that the Shaw complaint  states a claim,\r                                                \r\n\nbut only to the extent  it is based on the same  statements and\r\n\nomissions  that form the basis  of the surviving  claims in the\r\n\nWilensky complaint,  requires  an important  adjustment  to  be\r                    \r\n\nmade.  The Shaw  plaintiffs allege that they were  injured when\r                           \r\n\nthey purchased DEC common stock at prices that were inflated as\r\n\na  result of misleading statements and omissions by DEC and the\r\n\nindividual  defendants.    The   named  plaintiffs  purport  to\r\n\nrepresent a  class of persons  who purchased DEC  stock between\r\n\nJanuary  19  and April  15, 1994.    However, because  the only\r\n\nallegations  in the Shaw complaint that state a claim are those\r                                    \r\n\nthat depend  upon the purported misstatements  and omissions in\r\n\nthe registration statement  as of its  effective date --  March\r\n\n21,  1994 --  it follows  that only  those who  purchased their\r\n\nshares on or after  March 21, 1994 (and before  April 15, 1994,\r                              \r\n\nwhen   disclosure  occurred)  could  have  suffered  cognizable\r\n\ninjury.\r\n\n       Of the four plaintiffs named in the Shaw complaint, only\r                                                           \r\n\nGary Phillips is alleged to have made his purchase within those\r\n\ntwo limiting dates; thus only his claim may be reinstated.  The\r\n\ndistrict court's  dismissal of the  claims of  the three  other\r\n\nnamed plaintiffs is  affirmed.  On  remand, the district  court\r\n\nshould require the Shaw plaintiffs to amend  their complaint to\r                                   \r\n\nredefine the \"Class Period\" accordingly.\r\n\n                               V.\r\n\n                           Rule 9(b)\r                                                \r\n\n                              -66-\r\r\n\n       Defendants argue, as  an alternative basis for affirming\r\n\nthe  district court's  dismissals, that  both the  Wilensky and\r                                                                       \r\n\nShaw complaints fail to meet the requirement of Fed.

Although the complaint does assert that\r\n\ndefendants actually possessed the  information that they failed\r\n\nto disclose, those allegations  cannot be thought to constitute\r\n\n\"averments  of  fraud,\"  absent   any  claim  of  scienter  and\r\n\nreliance.    Otherwise,  any  allegation  of  nondisclosure  of\r\n\nmaterial information would be transformed into a claim of fraud\r\n\nfor purposes of  Rule 9(b).  In the circumstances, we hold that\r\n\nthe  Wilensky  complaint  was   not  subject  to  the  pleading\r                         \r\n\nrequirements of Rule 9(b).\r\n\nB.  Whether the Shaw Complaint Satisfies Rule 9(b)\r                                                              \r\n\n       The defendants' primary challenge to  the sufficiency of\r\n\nthe Shaw complaint under  Rule 9(b) is that it  fails to allege\r                    \r\n\n                              -68-\r\r\n\nspecific facts  that would  permit a reasonable  inference that\r\n\ndefendants   had  knowledge  of   information  foretelling  the\r\n\nfinancial results  for the third  quarter of  fiscal year  1994\r\n\nprior to  the quarter's end.   We limit  our analysis to  those\r\n\nallegations in the Shaw complaint that state a cognizable claim\r                                   \r\n\nfor securities fraud.  The issue is thus whether the plaintiffs\r\n\nhave  sufficiently pleaded  that  defendants knew  facts as  of\r\n\nMarch  21, 1994 that indicated  the third quarter  was going to\r\n\nturn out as it did, and that the company would  soon thereafter\r\n\nannounce   further   restructuring  actions   necessitating  an\r\n\nadditional restructuring charge for  the fiscal year.  Although\r\n\nthe question  is close, we  think that  the complaint  survives\r\n\nRule 9(b) scrutiny.\r\n\n       This court  has been  \"especially rigorous\" in  applying\r\n\nRule 9(b) in securities  fraud actions \"to minimize the  chance\r\n\n'that  a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim will bring a\r\n\nsuit  and conduct extensive discovery in the hopes of obtaining\r\n\nan  increased settlement,  rather than  in the  hopes that  the\r\n\nprocess will  reveal relevant evidence.'\"  Romani,  929 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n878  (quoting New England Data Servs., Inc. v.

We  have  emphasized that  the\r\n\nparticularity requirement  cannot be avoided \"simply  through a\r\n\ngeneral  averment that  defendants  'knew'  earlier what  later\r\n\nturned out badly.\"  Greenstone v. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 25\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).   A securities plaintiff cannot  plead \"'fraud\r\n\nby  hindsight.'\"  Id.

This  means that  a plaintiff  may not\r\n\nsimply contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable\r\n\nactual results, and then \"contend[] that the difference must be\r\n\nattributable  to fraud.\"  DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young, 901 F.2d 624,\r                                                            \r\n\n627 (7th Cir.),  cert. denied,  498 U.S. 941  (1990).   Rather,\r                                         \r\n\nRule  9(b) requires  that the  complaint \"set[]  forth specific\r\n\nfacts that make  it reasonable to  believe that defendant  knew\r\n\nthat  a   statement  was   materially  false   or  misleading.\"\r\n\nGreenstone,  975  F.2d  at  25  (collecting  cases);  see  also\r                                                                           \r\n\nSerabian, 24 F.3d at 361 (quoting Greenstone).\r                                                        \r\n\n       Here,  the complaint cannot  fairly be  characterized as\r\n\nresting on conclusory allegations of the defendants' knowledge.\r\n\nThe plaintiffs provide a series of factual allegations relating\r\n\nto  a combination of  developments known to  the company (e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nfailing product  pricing strategies,  market resistance  to new\r\n\nproducts, wayward compensation  policies, failure to  implement\r\n\ndownsizing  plans) that could have provided a basis for advance\r\n\nknowledge  of the  information disclosed  on April  15, 1994.38\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n38.  In asserting that defendants had direct knowledge of DEC's\r\nthird quarter operating  results as they  developed, plaintiffs\r\nallege that \"[m]ore so  than the management of  most companies,\r\nDEC's  management,  including  the Individual  Defendants,  was\r\nvirtually   immediately  cognizant   of  the   Company's  sales\r\ninformation\"  by  virtue of  the  company's use  of  \"a highly-\r\nefficient reporting system which  allows the Company to forward\r\nsales and  cost information  to senior management  virtually as\r\nsales are  made.\"  The defendants argue  that these allegations\r\nshould  be viewed with skepticism and as the product of nothing\r\nmore than  \"pure speculation.\"   Speculation  or not,  we think\r\nthat  the  plaintiffs'   allegations  of  a   \"highly-efficient\r\nreporting  system\" may speak to the  question of how defendants\r                                                                \r\nmight  have known  what they  allegedly  knew, but  absent some\r\nindication of the specific factual content of any single report\r                                                      \r\n\n                              -70-\r\r\n\nThese factual  allegations, together with other  aspects of the\r\n\ncomplaint  discussed below,  provide a  basis for  a reasonable\r\n\ninference  that defendants  knew facts  by March  21 indicating\r\n\nthat the  third fiscal  quarter would  be disastrous, and  that\r\n\naccelerated   restructuring   efforts   requiring   a   further\r\n\nrestructuring charge  were likely  to follow.39   Cf. Serabian,\r                                                                          \r\n\n24 F.3d at 365; In re Wells Fargo, 12 F.3d at 931.\r                                             \r\n\n       In  additional   support   of   their   allegations   of\r\n\ndefendants' knowledge,  plaintiffs assert that two  insiders of\r\n\nthe  company, neither  of whom  is a  defendant here,  sold DEC\r\n\nstockholdings  during  the  third  fiscal quarter.    One,  the\r\n\ncompany's treasurer,  sold 1,625  shares (68% of  the officer's\r\n\ntotal holdings) on February  11, 1994.  The other,  the general\r\n\nmanager and  vice president of the  company's personal computer\r\n\nbusiness,  sold 2,000 shares (20% of his position) on March 22,\r\n\n1994.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ngenerated by the alleged reporting system, do not independently\r\nprovide a factual basis  for inferring any such knowledge.   On\r\nbalance, we do not think that generalized allegations regarding\r\nthe existence of  an internal \"reporting system\"  substantially\r\nassist a securities fraud complaint in overcoming the hurdle of\r\nRule 9(b).   See  Pitten v.  Jacobs, 903  F. Supp.  937, 949-50\r                                               \r\n(D.S.C.  1995); cf. Arazie v.  Mullane, 2 F.3d  1456, 1467 (7th\r                                                  \r\nCir. 1993) (refusing to credit \"scanty\" allegations  concerning\r\ninternal  documents, absent  indication  of  \"who prepared  the\r\nprojected  figures,  when  they  were prepared,  how  firm  the\r\nnumbers were, or which . . . officers reviewed them\").\r\n\n39.  We  reject defendants' argument  that the  complaint fails\r\nadequately  to  particularize  the   roles  of  the  individual\r\ndefendants  in the purported fraud.   Cf. Serabian,  24 F.3d at\r                                                              \r\n367-68.\r\n\n                              -71-\r\r\n\n       Of  course,  the  mere  fact  that insider  stock  sales\r\n\noccurred does not  suffice to establish scienter.   See Tapogna\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Egan,  141  F.R.D. 370,  373  (D.  Mass.  1992).   However,\r                    \r\n\nallegations  of \"insider  trading in  suspicious amounts  or at\r\n\nsuspicious  times\" may permit  an inference that  the trader --\r\n\nand  by further  inference, the  company --  possessed material\r\n\nnonpublic information at the time.  See Greenstone, 975 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n26 (citing  In re Apple Computer,  886 F.2d at 1117);  see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nRubinstein,  20  F.3d  at 169-70  (characterizing  sufficiently\r                      \r\n\nsuspicious trading as \"presumptively probative of bad faith and\r\n\nscienter\").   Here,  the level  of suspicion  warranted by  the\r\n\nalleged  insider  stock  sales  is  marginal:  the  first  sale\r\n\noccurred more than a  month prior to the  date of concern  here\r\n\n(March  21, 1994);  and the  second sale,  though made  at what\r\n\nmight  be  considered a  \"suspicious\"  time,  involved a  small\r\n\n(albeit not  insignificant) percentage  of the  insider's total\r\n\nholdings  of  DEC  stock.    Nonetheless,  we  think  that  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  allegations of insider  trading, inasmuch  as they\r\n\nare  at least  consistent with their  theory of  fraud, provide\r\n\nsome support  against the  defendants' motion to  dismiss under\r\n\nRule 9(b).\r\n\n       Finally,  in testing  the allegations  of  the complaint\r\n\nagainst Rule 9(b), we need not turn a blind eye to the obvious:\r\n\nthe  proximity   of  the  date  of   the  allegedly  fraudulent\r\n\nstatements and omissions to both the end of the quarter then in\r\n\nprogress  and the date on which disclosure was eventually made.\r\n\n                              -72-\r\r\n\nWhile  the short  time  frame between  an allegedly  fraudulent\r\n\nstatement or  omission and  a later disclosure  of inconsistent\r\n\ninformation  does  not, standing  alone,  provide  a sufficient\r\n\nfactual grounding to satisfy  Rule 9(b), see Arazie, 2  F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n1467-68,  there   is  nothing  in  Rule   9(b)  that  precludes\r\n\nconsideration  of  such temporal  proximity  as a  circumstance\r\n\npotentially bolstering  the complaint's  claims of fraud.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFecht,  70 F.3d at  1083-84.  On  the facts as  alleged in this\r                 \r\n\ncase, we think that the proximity of the date of  the allegedly\r\n\nmisleading statements  and omissions to the end  of the ongoing\r\n\nquarter  (and the  date of  eventual disclosure)  provides some\r\n\ncircumstantial  factual support  to  be taken  into account  in\r\n\ndetermining whether the complaint  pleads an adequate basis for\r\n\ninferring defendants' culpable knowledge.\r\n\n       We  have no  intention  here of  diluting  the stringent\r\n\nmandate of  Rule 9(b).   But in  determining the adequacy  of a\r\n\ncomplaint under  that  rule, we  cannot  hold plaintiffs  to  a\r\n\nstandard that would effectively require them, pre-discovery, to\r\n\nplead evidence.  Rule 9(b) proscribes the pleading of \"fraud by\r\n\nhindsight,\" Denny, 576 F.2d at  470, but neither can plaintiffs\r                             \r\n\nbe  expected to plead fraud with complete insight.  We conclude\r\n\nthat  the  portions of  the  Shaw complaint  that  survive Rule\r                                             \r\n\n12(b)(6)  scrutiny also satisfy  the particularity requirements\r\n\nof Rule 9(b).\r\n\n                              VI.\r\n\n                           Conclusion\r                                                 \r\n\n                              -73-\r\r\n\n       The district court erred  in dismissing the Wilensky and\r                                                                       \r\n\nShaw complaints in their entirety.  Portions of both complaints\r                \r\n\nsurvive Rule 12(b)(6), but only to the extent that they allege:\r                                           \r\n\n(i) that  the registration  statement filed in  connection with\r\n\nthe public  offering  of March  21,  1994, failed  to  disclose\r\n\nmaterial information in DEC's  possession as of that date  that\r\n\nwould have alerted the  market to the likelihood  of disastrous\r\n\nquarterly  results;   and  (ii)  that  the   statement  in  the\r\n\nprospectus supplement as to the \"adequacy\" of the restructuring\r\n\nreserve  remaining as of March 21, 1994 was materially false or\r\n\nmisleading.40   We hold,  however, that the  Wilensky complaint\r                                                                 \r\n\nfails  to state a claim  under Section 12(2)  of the Securities\r\n\nAct as to DEC  and the individual defendants.   Furthermore, in\r\n\nlight of the limited basis  on which we permit the Shaw  action\r                                                                   \r\n\nto  go forward, only the  claims of the  single named plaintiff\r\n\nwho  purchased  DEC  shares   after  March  21,  1994   may  be\r\n\nreinstated,  and  the   allegations  in   the  Shaw   complaint\r                                                               \r\n\npertaining to the scope of the putative plaintiff class must be\r\n\nmodified  accordingly.   Finally, the  requirements of  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P. 9(b)  do  not  apply  to  the  Wilensky  complaint  as\r                                                            \r\n\ncurrently  pleaded,  and  the  surviving portion  of  the  Shaw\r                                                                           \r\n\ncomplaint  does satisfy  Rule 9(b).   On  remand,  the district\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n40.  The district  court did not state  any independent reasons\r\nfor dismissing the Wilensky plaintiffs' derivative claims under\r                                       \r\nSection 15 of the Securities Act or the Shaw plaintiffs' claims\r                                                        \r\nunder  Section 20(a)  of the  Exchange Act  and for  common law\r\nnegligent misrepresentation.   Those claims  should, therefore,\r\nbe reinstated and permitted to proceed to the extent consistent\r\nwith this opinion.\r\n\n                              -74-\r\r\n\ncourt  may  choose to  require  the plaintiffs  to  amend their\r\n\ncomplaints in accordance with these conclusions.\r\n\n       In  closing,  we  note   that  although  the  issues  of\r\n\nmateriality and knowledge raised by the two complaints preclude\r\n\nterminating this  litigation on  the pleadings, nothing  we say\r\n\nhere is  intended to foreclose  the possibility that  those and\r\n\nother issues,  after discovery  and an opportunity  for factual\r\n\ndevelopment, might be susceptible  to resolution on motions for\r\n\nsummary judgment.

Both complaints assert that there were misleading statements and nondisclosures in the registration statement and prospectus prepared in connection with a public offering of stock.   That offering commenced on March 21, 1994, just 11 days prior to the close of the quarter then in progress, and about three weeks prior to the company's announcement of an unexpectedly negative earnings report for that quarter.   One of the complaints further alleges that defendants made fraudulently optimistic statements to the public in the period leading up to the offering.   The district court found that neither complaint identified any statements or omissions actionable under the securities laws and dismissed both for failure to state a claim.   We agree that many of the alleged misstatements and omissions do not provide a legally cognizable basis for the plaintiffs' claims, but we also conclude that a limited set of allegations in both complaints relating to the registration statement and prospectus for the March 1994 offering does state a claim.   We further find that the surviving portions of the complaints satisfy the pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).   Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Digital Equipment Corporation (\"DEC\") is one of the world's largest suppliers of computer hardware, software and services.   Founded in 1957, it first became a publicly held company in 1966.   By the early 1990's, the company's success had burgeoned into $14 billion in yearly revenues.   The company's success story, however, would not last forever.   By 1992, the company had fallen on hard times.   In January 1992 it reported its first-ever quarterly operating loss of $138.3 million.   Faced in the ensuing months with operating losses in the range of $30 million to $311 million per quarter, the company decided to engage in radical surgery, cutting loose some 35,000 employees over the course of 15 months in the process, including its founder and CEO.   To cover the costs of these actions, the company accumulated \"restructuring\" charges totalling close to $3.2 billion in fiscal years 1990-1992 combined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the midst of its financial woes, however, the company took some steps to restore its health.   In February 1992, DEC had introduced a new product, the \"Alpha\" chip.   The Alpha chip was hailed as a technological advance that could potentially restore the company's fortunes.   In mid-1992, the company installed a new CEO, Robert B. Palmer.   He took the helm in the fall of that year, as the company continued to implement strategies to help its Alpha technology gain acceptance in the marketplace and to bring the company back to financial vitality.   At the time Palmer took over, the company had absorbed over $3 billion in losses for the prior three years and had been losing money at the rate of approximately $3 million per day.   Under the new management, it appeared that the company's financial hemorrhaging had finally begun to slow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 1993, DEC reported a loss for the second quarter of fiscal year 1993 that was far smaller than had been anticipated by analysts.   That promising result was followed by another quarter of losses, but within Wall Street's expectations.   Then, on July 28, 1993, the company announced its first profitable quarter since before the 1992 fiscal year, reporting a net profit of $113.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1993.   That result was slightly below analysts' expectations, but a stark improvement over the operating loss of $188.1 million (and overall loss of $2 billion) reported for the comparable quarter in the prior year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, on October 20, 1993, DEC announced a loss of $83.1 million for the first quarter of 1994, an improvement over the $260.5 million loss for the same quarter the prior year, but worse than analysts had been predicting.   On January 19, 1994, the company announced another setback, reporting losses for the second quarter of fiscal year 1994, ending January 1, 1994, of $72 million.   The loss was worse than analysts had expected and was virtually identical to the losses for that period the prior year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was against this backdrop that DEC, on January 21, 1994, filed with the SEC a \"shelf\" registration statement giving the company the option to issue up to $1 billion in various classes of debt and equity securities.   Two months later, DEC through its underwriters conducted an offering of $400 million in depositary shares of preferred stock, pursuant to the \"shelf\" registration, a prospectus dated March 11, 1994, and a prospectus supplement dated March 21, 1994.   The offering commenced on the date of the prospectus supplement and closed one week later on March 28, 1994, four days before the end of the third fiscal quarter.   All 16 million depositary shares of preferred stock were sold, at an offering price of $25.   DEC raised a badly needed $387.4 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than three weeks later, on April 15, 1994, DEC announced an operating loss of over $183 million for the quarter that had ended on April 2, 1994.   This third quarter loss was far greater than analysts had been expecting, and the largest that the company had reported since the first quarter of fiscal 1993.   It bucked the positive trend of reduced losses under the company's new management.   The announcement sent the price of the newly distributed preferred stock tumbling from the offering price of $25 to $20.875 by the close of trading on April 15.   The common stock fell from $28.875 to $23 during the same period, and to $21.125 by the close of the next trading day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its April 15 announcement, the company also disclosed that it had decided to \"accelerate [its] on-going restructuring efforts\" and \"also consider further restructuring.\"   This was despite a representation in the March 21 prospectus supplement that \"[t]he Corporation believes that the remaining restructuring reserve of $443 million is adequate to cover presently planned restructuring actions.\"   Eventually, following the close of fiscal year 1994, DEC announced on July 14, 1994 that it would cut almost one-fourth of its remaining workforce and take an additional charge of $1.2 billion for fiscal year 1994 (beyond the $443 million remaining in reserve as of March 21) to cover the costs of additional restructuring activities.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Description of the Actions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two lawsuits were filed on Tuesday, April 19, 1994, two business days after the company's announcement of April 15, 1994.   One, the Wilensky action, brought on behalf of all persons who purchased shares in the March 1994 public offering, asserts claims under Sections 11, 12(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") against DEC, its Chief Executive Officer (Robert B. Palmer), its Chief Financial Officer (William Steul), and seven underwriting or investment banking firms, representing a purported defendant class of 65 underwriters who participated in the offering.   The second, the Shaw action, advances claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5, and a pendent claim of common law negligent misrepresentation, on behalf of all purchasers of DEC common stock between January 19 and April 15, 1994 (the \"Class Period\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of both complaints are two sets of claims.   First, plaintiffs assert that DEC management had knowledge of material facts concerning the large losses developing during the third fiscal quarter of 1994, and that the defendants were under a duty to disclose such material information to the market in connection with the public offering conducted on March 21, 1994.   Second, both the Wilensky and Shaw plaintiffs contend that the representation made in the March 21 prospectus supplement concerning the \"adequacy\" of the then-remaining \"restructuring reserve\" was materially misleading.   The Shaw plaintiffs allege, additionally, that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made fraudulently optimistic statements to the public concerning DEC's future prospects in order artificially to inflate the market value of DEC shares, and that these statements were actionably false or misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and 12(b)(6).   The district court consolidated the cases, stayed all discovery, and then dismissed both actions.   The district court ruled, inter alia, that defendants had violated no duty to disclose and that the defendants' statements were not misleading, bespoke caution, or were otherwise not actionable as a matter of law.   The court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), without reaching whether the complaints satisfied the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).   These appeals followed.   We affirm in part and reverse in part.   For clarity, we discuss each of the two actions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Section 11 and 12(2) Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>(Wilensky Action)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sections 11 and 12(2) are enforcement mechanisms for the mandatory disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.   Section 11 imposes liability on signers of a registration statement, and on underwriters, if the registration statement \"contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k.   Section 12(2) provides that any person who \"offers or sells\" a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication containing a materially false statement or that \"omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,\" shall be liable to any \"person purchasing such security from him.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77 l (2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Wilensky plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 11, 12(2), and 15,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> alleging that the registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with the March 1994 public offering contained materially false statements and omitted to state material information required to be provided therein.   The thrust of the Wilensky complaint is that defendants knew, as of the March 21 date of the 1994 public offering, of material facts portending the unexpectedly large losses for the third quarter of fiscal 1994 that were announced later, and that failure to disclose these material facts in the registration statement and prospectus violated Section 11.   Additionally, the Wilensky plaintiffs contend that the statement in the registration statement and prospectus characterizing as \"adequate\" the company's then-remaining \"restructuring reserve\" of $443 million was materially false and misleading, in violation of both Sections 11 and 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants parry by attempting to reduce plaintiffs' claims to an argument that the company was required to disclose its internal forecasts about the outcome of the third quarter.   They argue that the plaintiffs' position is untenable because the securities laws impose no duty upon a company to disclose internal projections, estimates of quarterly results, or other forward-looking information.   They also say that the statement concerning the adequacy of the company's restructuring reserves is not actionably misleading when considered in context.   Finally, defendants contend that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts establishing that DEC and the underwriter defendants were statutory \"sellers\" subject to liability under Section 12(2).   We evaluate each set of arguments separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>A. Actionability of Alleged Nondisclosures Under Section 11</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposition that silence, absent a duty to disclose, cannot be actionably misleading, is a fixture in federal securities law.   See, e.g., Backman v. Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1990) (en banc).   Equally settled is that accurate reports of past successes do not themselves give rise to a duty to inform the market whenever present circumstances suggest that the future may bring a turn for the worse.   See Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir.1994);  Capri Optics Profit Sharing v. Digital Equip.  Corp., 950 F.2d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir.1991).   In short, the mere possession of material nonpublic information does not create a duty to disclose it.   See Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc., 814 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1987) (citing Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 235, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 1118, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To focus here on a duty to disclose in the abstract, however, would be to miss the obvious in favor of the obscure.   This action arises out of an allegedly defective registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with a public stock offering.   The obligations that attend the preparation of those filings embody nothing if not an affirmative duty to disclose a broad range of material information.   Cf. Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 381-82, 103 S.Ct. 683, 686-87, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983).   Indeed, in the context of a public offering, there is a strong affirmative duty of disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 195, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1382, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976) (the Securities Act \"was designed to provide investors with full disclosure of material information concerning public offerings\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here is not whether defendants were under an abstract duty to disclose information--clearly, they were.   The issue, rather, is whether the defendants had a specific obligation to disclose information of the type that the plaintiffs complain was omitted from the registration statement and prospectus.   The task of deciding whether particular information is subject to mandatory disclosure is not easily separable from normative judgments about the kinds of information that the securities laws should require to be disclosed, which depend, in essence, on conceptions of materiality.   See generally Victor Brudney, A Note On Materiality and Soft Information Under the Federal Securities Laws, 75 Va.L.Rev. 723, 728 (1989).   For our purposes, it suffices to say that the determination of whether the alleged nondisclosures in this case provide a legally sufficient basis for the plaintiffs' claims cannot be severed from consideration of the basic policies underlying the disclosure obligations of the applicable statutes and regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that we cannot say that DEC was not required to disclose material information concerning its performance in the quarter in progress at the time of the March 21, 1994 public offering.   Nor can we conclude, as a matter of law and on these pleadings, that DEC was not in possession of such material nonpublic information at the time of the offering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Insider Trading Analogy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In understanding the nature of the disclosure requirements attending a public offering of stock, it is helpful to conceptualize DEC (the corporate issuer) as an individual insider transacting in the company's securities, and to examine the disclosure obligations that would then arise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that an individual corporate insider in possession of material nonpublic information is prohibited by the federal securities laws from trading on that information unless he makes public disclosure.   He must disclose or abstain from trading.   See SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 848 (2d Cir.1968) (en banc), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (1969);  see also SEC v. MacDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 50 (1st Cir.1983) (en banc).   A central justification for the \"disclose or abstain\" rule is to deny corporate insiders the opportunity to profit from the inherent trading advantage they have over the rest of the contemporaneously trading market by reason of their superior access to information.   See Shapiro v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 495 F.2d 228, 235 (2d Cir.1974);  SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 848 (2d Cir.1968) (en banc).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The rule eliminates both the incentives that insiders would otherwise have to delay the disclosure of material information, and minimizes any efficiency losses associated with the diversion of resources by insiders to \"beating the market.\"   See Robert C. Clark, Corporate Law &#167; 8.2, at 273-75 (1986);  Frank H. Easterbrook &amp; Daniel R. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 288 (1991) (\"The lure of trading profits may induce people to spend a lot of effort and other resources 'beating the market';  ...  [T]he prompt disclosure of information by the affected firm will extinguish the trading opportunity.   When everyone knows the truth, no one can speculate on it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy rationale for the \"disclose or abstain\" rule carries over to contexts where a corporate issuer, as opposed to an individual, is the party contemplating a stock transaction.   Courts, including this one, have treated a corporation trading in its own securities as an \"insider\" for purposes of the \"disclose or abstain\" rule.   See, e.g., McCormick v. Fund American Cos., Inc., 26 F.3d 869, 876 (9th Cir.1994) (collecting cases) (\"[T]he corporate issuer in possession of material nonpublic information, must, like other insiders in the same situation, disclose that information to its shareholders or refrain from trading with them.\");  Rogen v. Ilikon Corp., 361 F.2d 260, 268 (1st Cir.1966);  Kohler v. Kohler Co., 319 F.2d 634, 638 (7th Cir.1963);  Green v. Hamilton Int'l Corp., 437 F.Supp. 723, 728-29 (S.D.N.Y.1977);  VII Louis Loss &amp; Joel Seligman, Securities Regulation 1505 (3d ed. 1991) (\"When the issuer itself wants to buy or sell its own securities, it has a choice:  desist or disclose.\");   18 Donald C. Langevoort, Insider Trading:  Regulation, Enforcement &amp; Prevention &#167; 3.02[d], at 5 (3d rel. 1994) (\"Issuers themselves may buy or sell their own securities, and have long been held to an obligation of full disclosure....  Conceptually, extending the insider trading prohibition to instances of issuer insider trading makes perfect sense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as an individual insider with material nonpublic information about pending merger or license negotiations could not purchase his company's securities without making disclosure, the company itself may not engage in such a purchase of its own stock, if it is in possession of such undisclosed information.   See, e.g., Rogen, 361 F.2d at 268.   By extension, a comparable rule should apply to issuers engaged in a stock offering.   Otherwise, a corporate issuer selling its own securities would be left free to exploit its informational trading advantage, at the expense of investors, by delaying disclosure of material nonpublic negative news until after completion of the offering.   Cf. Ian Ayres, Back to Basics:  Regulating How Corporations Speak to the Market, 77 Va.L.Rev. 945, 959-60 (1991) (describing the argument that securities laws impose needed discipline, because companies do not always internalize the costs of failing to provide the market with accurate information that would lower stock prices).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analogizing a corporate issuer to an individual insider subject to the \"disclose or abstain\" rule of insider trading law illustrates the policy reasons supporting a comparably strong disclosure mechanism in the context of a public offering.   We look to the explicit statutory and regulatory framework to determine whether the Securities Act provides such a mechanism, and whether the Wilensky complaint states a legally cognizable claim for nondisclosure under Section 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 11 by its terms provides for the imposition of liability if a registration statement, as of its effective date:  (1) \"contained an untrue statement of material fact\";  (2) \"omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein\";  or (3) omitted to state a material fact \"necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k(a).   The plaintiffs' claim of nondisclosure relies on the second of these three bases of liability.   That predicate is unique to Section 11;  neither Section 12(2) of the Securities Act nor Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act contains comparable language.   It is intended to ensure that issuers, under pain of civil liability, not cut corners in preparing registration statements and that they disclose all material information required by the applicable statutes and regulations.

See Instructions to Form S-3, Item 12(a).   Unlike registrants on more broadly available forms (such as S-1), a Form S-3 registrant is not required separately to furnish in the prospectus the information required by Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a) (\"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> because that information is presumed to be contained in the Exchange Act filings that Form S-3 incorporates by reference, which are themselves subject to the requirements of Regulation S-K.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The primary purpose of the \"material changes\" disclosure requirement of Item 11(a), then, is to ensure that the prospectus provides investors with an update of the information required to be disclosed in the incorporated Exchange Act filings, including the information provided in those filings concerning \"known trends and uncertainties\" with respect to \"net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.\"  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a)(3)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the date of the final prospectus for the March 1994 offering and the effective date of the registration statement was March 21, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Prior to that date, the end of DEC's latest fiscal year was July 3, 1993 (fiscal year 1993), and the last Form 10-Q filed by the company was for the quarter that had ended on January 1, 1994 (DEC's second fiscal quarter).   The question, then, is whether the complaint contains sufficient allegations that defendants failed to disclose in the registration statement any information regarding \"material changes\" in DEC's \"affairs\" as of March 21, 1994, that had occurred since July 3, 1993 and had not been reported in the Form 10-Q filed for the second quarter of fiscal year 1994.   If the Wilensky complaint adequately so alleges, then the complaint sets forth a cognizable claim of nondisclosure under Section 11, namely, that defendants failed to include in the registration statement information \"required to be stated therein.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Alleged Nondisclosures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that defendants failed to comply with Item 11(a) by omitting three categories of information from the registration statement and prospectus.   First, plaintiffs contend that defendants failed to disclose that DEC had embarked on a risky marketing strategy that involved slashing prices and sacrificing profit margins in the hopes of increasing \"market penetration\" of the company's Alpha chip products.   Second, plaintiffs assert that defendants failed to disclose that under the company's compensation scheme, its sales representatives were being paid \"double commissions,\" again to the detriment of the company's profit margins.   Third, and most centrally, plaintiffs allege that, by the date of the March 21 offering, defendants were in possession of, yet failed to disclose, material knowledge of facts indicating that the third fiscal quarter would be an unexpectedly disastrous one.   We dispose of the first two claims of nondisclosure, and then focus our discussion on the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Marketing Strategy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants provide a decisive rejoinder to the plaintiffs' claim of nondisclosure concerning the \"marketing strategy\":  the relevant aspects and consequences of the strategy were in fact prominently disclosed, both in the text of the prospectus and in documents incorporated by reference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  For example, in its Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ending October 2, 1993 (the first quarter of fiscal year 1994), the company explained its reported decline in gross profit margins as follows:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>The decline in product gross margin resulted from the decrease in product sales, a continued shift in the mix of product sales toward low-end systems which typically carry lower margins, competitive pricing pressures and unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by manufacturing cost efficiencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>The Corporation has adopted an aggressive, competitive price structure for its Alpha AXP systems.   Given this pricing, as well as the factors described in the preceding paragraph, the Corporation expects to experience continued downward pressure on product gross margins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement, in conjunction with related disclosures found elsewhere in the prospectus and incorporated filings relating to \"competitive pricing pressures,\" declining gross profit margins, \"competitive pricing actions taken by the Corporation,\" an \"industry trend toward lower product gross margins,\" and \"persistent intense pricing competition,\" together obviate the plaintiffs' claim that defendants failed to disclose the company's adoption of a price-cutting strategy to boost the \"market penetration\" of its Alpha-based systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. \"Double Commissions\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' claim of a failure to disclose \"double commissions\" also fails to make out a Section 11 violation.   To the extent that the claim comprises allegations of mismanagement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> it is not cognizable under the securities laws.   See Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v. Green, 430 U.S. 462, 477-80, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 1302-05, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977);  In re Craftmatic Sec. Litig., 890 F.2d 628, 638-39 (3d Cir.1989) (stating that plaintiffs cannot circumvent Santa Fe by simply pleading a mismanagement claim as a failure to disclose management practices);  see also Hayes v. Gross, 982 F.2d 104, 106 (3d Cir.1992).   Otherwise, the claim fails for lack of any allegations establishing a plausible theory of materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint does not allege that \"double commissions\" have some intrinsic significance to investors.   Plaintiffs complain, rather, that DEC failed to tell the market that the commission-based compensation scheme, instead of boosting sales as it was supposed to do, was contributing to the company's losses.   This argument is problematic.   As the complaint itself acknowledges, DEC publicly announced the switch from a salary-based compensation scheme to the incentive-based model that produced the double commissions.   Furthermore, according to the complaint, the switch was made not during the third fiscal quarter of 1994, but some two years earlier, in 1992.   The plaintiffs do not allege that any material changes to the compensation scheme were implemented after that time.   Whatever the bearing of DEC's incentive-based compensation scheme on the company's expenses in relation to its revenues, the investing public had at least a year's worth of hard financial data (through the second quarter of fiscal 1994) to evaluate whether the commission system was working to increase gross margins,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> or instead, as plaintiffs allege, to shrink them.   Plaintiffs do not allege that there were any material changes in the payment of commissions between the time of the March public offering and the last prior Form 10-Q filed by the company (for the second fiscal quarter of 1994), and so on their own theory the claim that DEC failed to disclose the payment of \"double commissions\" amounts to naught.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

In evaluating this claim, we accept arguendo the complaint's allegations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> that DEC had in its possession as of the March 21 offering date nonpublic information concerning the company's ongoing quarter-to-date performance, indicating that the company would suffer unexpectedly large losses for that quarter.   We ask, then, whether there was a duty to disclose such information in the registration statement and prospectus under the rubric of \"material changes\" under Item 11(a) of Form S-3.   We focus upon the defendants' primary legal arguments on this point:  that DEC was under no duty to disclose \"intra-quarterly\" results or any other information concerning its third quarter performance until after the quarter ended;  and that defendants had no duty as of March 21, 1994 to disclose any internal projections or predictions concerning the expected outcome of the quarter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A central goal underlying the disclosure provisions of the securities laws is to promote fairness and efficiency in the securities markets.

Litig., 88 F.R.D. 134, 145 (N.D.Tex.1980).   The disclosure of accurate firm-specific information enables investors to compare the prospects of investing in one firm versus another, and enables capital to flow to its most valuable uses.  LHLC Corp. v. Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., 842 F.2d 928, 931 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 926, 109 S.Ct. 311, 102 L.Ed.2d 329 (1988);  cf. Acme Propane, Inc. v. Tenexco, Inc., 844 F.2d 1317, 1323 (7th Cir.1988) (securities laws aim at ensuring the availability to the investing public of information not otherwise in the public domain).   The availability of reliable firm-specific information is also essential to the market's ability to align stock price with a security's \"fundamental value.\"   See Marcel Kahan, Securities Laws and the Social Costs of \"Inaccurate\" Stock Prices, 41 Duke L.J. 977, 988-89 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for issuers to disclose material information is crucial in the context of a public offering, where investors typically must rely (unless the offering is \"at the market\") on an offering price determined by the issuer and/or the underwriters of the offering.   See Kahan, supra, at 1014-15 (explaining the heightened need to target disclosure requirements to companies engaged in public offerings).   Accordingly, the disclosure requirements associated with a stock offering are more stringent than, for example, the regular periodic disclosures called for in the company's annual Form 10-K or quarterly Form 10-Q filings under the Exchange Act.   See id. at 1014-15 &amp; n. 163.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for complete and prompt disclosure is particularly keen when a corporation issues stock pursuant to a \"shelf registration\" under SEC Rule 415(a), as DEC did in its public offering of March 1994.   See 17 C.F.R. &#167; 230.415(a) (permitting registration of securities to be issued on a \"continuous\" or \"delayed\" basis).   The shelf registration rule permits a company to file a single registration statement covering a certain quantity of securities (register securities \"for the shelf\"), and then over a period of up to two years,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> with the appropriate updates of information,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> issue installments of securities under that registration statement (take the securities \"down from the shelf\") almost instantly, in amounts and at times the company and its underwriters deem most propitious.   See Clark, supra, at 751 (explaining that the shelf registration process enables firms to pinpoint the timing of offerings to the issuer's advantage);  see generally Jeffrey N. Gordon &amp; Lewis A. Kornhauser, Efficient Markets, Costly Information, and Securities Research, 60 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 761, 819-20 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The social benefit of the shelf registration rule is that it can enable an issuer to decrease its costs of raising capital.   See Clark, supra, at 751.   The concomitant risk is that, by permitting securities to be offered on a \"delayed\" basis, the rule may adversely affect the quality and timeliness of the disclosures made in connection with the actual issuance of securities.   See Shelf Registration, SEC Release Nos. 33-6499, 34-20384, 35-23122, 1983 WL 35832 (SEC), * 2 (\"Shelf Reg.Rel.\");  see also I Loss &amp; Seligman, supra, at 355 (\"The rationale for limiting the time during which registered securities may be sold is that investors need current information when considering an offering.   To permit 'registration for the shelf' runs the risk that investors subsequently will be offered securities on the basis of outdated or stale information.\").   In response to these concerns, the SEC, in adopting Rule 415 in its current form, assured that \"[p]ost-effective amendments [to the initial registration statement] and prospectus supplements [would] serve to ensure that investors are provided with complete, accurate and current information at the time of the offering or sale of securities.\"   Shelf Reg.Rel., supra, 1983 WL 35832 (SEC), * 9.   The SEC explained that registrants would not be permitted \"to use the shelf registration rule as a basis for omitting required information from their registration statements when they become effective.\"   Id., 1983 WL 35832 (SEC), * 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on concerns about Rule 415's effect on the adequacy and timeliness of disclosure, the SEC chose to limit the availability of the rule, in the context of primary stock offerings, to the widely-followed companies (like DEC) that are eligible to register securities on SEC Form S-3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  See 17 C.F.R. &#167; 230.415(a)(1)(x);  Shelf Reg.Rel., supra, 1983 WL 35832 (SEC) at * 5;  I Loss &amp; Seligman, supra, at 361 &amp; n. 90.   The theory was that the concerns about adequacy of disclosure were less prominent in the case of \"S-3\" registrants, because those companies are precisely the ones that in the ordinary course of their businesses \"provide a steady stream of high quality corporate information to the marketplace and whose corporate information is broadly disseminated[ ] ... and is constantly digested and synthesized by financial analysts.\"   Shelf Reg.Rel., supra, 1983 WL 35832 (SEC), * 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert here that the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act and regulations, including Item 11(a) of Form S-3, should be interpreted so that they would never mandate the provision of current information about a company's performance in the quarter in progress at the time of a public offering, so long as the company satisfies its quarterly and annual periodic disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act.   That argument cuts severely against the very reason the shelf registration rule was made available to issuers like DEC:  that \"S-3\" companies would provide the market with a continuous stream of high quality corporate information.   The rule permits offerings to be made on a \"continuous\" or \"delayed\" basis because it envisions \"continuous\" disclosure.   It would be inconsistent with this rationale to permit an issuer to take refuge in its periodically-filed Forms 10-Q or 10-K to avoid the obligation to disclose current material facts in its shelf offering prospectus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent some mechanism requiring a registrant to disclose internally known, material nonpublic information pertaining to a quarter in progress, the shelf registration procedure, by enabling the issuer to pinpoint the timing of its offering, would give a company anticipating a negative earnings announcement the ability to time its offerings of securities from the shelf to be completed prior to the public release of the known negative news.   This would allow companies to exploit what amounts to a naked informational trading advantage.   Cf. Gordon &amp; Kornhauser, supra, at 819-20.   Item 11(a) of Form S-3, by requiring the issuer to disclose current information concerning \"material changes\" from previously reported data, provides a mechanism--comparable in effect to the \"disclose or abstain\" rule governing insider trading--to prevent such strategic behavior.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these concerns, DEC argues that the plaintiffs' claims of nondisclosure are without merit, because they seek to impose liability upon DEC for a failure to disclose its internal projections about the outcome of the third quarter of fiscal 1994.   The federal securities laws impose no obligation upon an issuer to disclose forward-looking information such as internal projections, estimates of future performance, forecasts, budgets, and similar data.   See, e.g., In re VeriFone Sec. Litig., 11 F.3d 865, 869 (9th Cir.1993);  In re Convergent Technologies Sec. Litig., 948 F.2d 507, 516 (9th Cir.1991).   Plaintiffs, however, insist that their Section 11 claim is concerned not with the nondisclosure of projections, but of current information that DEC allegedly had in its possession as of March 21, 1994 about \"losses\" the company was incurring in the ongoing quarter.   Defendants respond, in turn, that under a system of quarterly reporting, \"losses\" cannot be realized until a quarter has ended, and that because the quarter in question did not end until April 2, 1994, whatever information DEC had as of March 21 concerning that quarter necessarily must have been forward-looking, in the nature of a projection or forecast, which it had no obligation to disclose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEC's argument elevates form over substance.   DEC's assertion that companies do not realize \"losses\" as such until a quarter has ended is, of course, largely unexceptionable.   But it does not follow that DEC's only information concerning the ongoing quarter as of March 21 must have been forward-looking.   That contention relies on two faulty components.   First, it assumes that plaintiffs could not adduce adequate evidence that defendants were actually in possession of material information about the ongoing quarter at the relevant time.   Second, it assumes that the potential unreliability of inferences that could be drawn from current information about operating results as of eleven days before the end of a quarter absolutely protects that information from mandatory disclosure.   The first premise is inconsistent with the standards governing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.   The second confuses the issue of materiality with the duty to disclose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants posit, in essence, that there can never be a duty to disclose internally known, pre-end-of-quarter financial information, because any inferences about the quarter that might be drawn from such information could be rendered unreliable by later developments in the same quarter, such as a sudden surge of profitable sales.   This position does not withstand scrutiny.   Present, known information that strongly implies an important future outcome is not immune from mandatory disclosure merely because it does not foreordain any particular outcome.   The question whether such present information must be disclosed (assuming the existence of a duty), poses a classic materiality issue:  given that at any point in a quarter, the remainder of the period may not mirror the quarter-to-date, is there a sufficient probability that unexpectedly disastrous quarter-to-date performance will carry forward to the end of the quarter, such that a reasonable investor would likely consider the interim performance important to the overall mix of information available?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As desirable as bright-line rules may be, this question cannot be answered by reference to such a rule.   To try to do so would be contrary to Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988).   The Supreme Court there refused to adopt a bright-line approach to determine at what stage preliminary merger discussions create a sufficient probability of actual consummation to become material.   See id. at 237-39, 108 S.Ct. at 986-88 (rejecting \"agreement-in-principle\" test).   So here.   We decline to adopt, as defendants would have us do, a hard and fast rule that current information concerning a company's operating experience is never subject to disclosure until after the end of the quarter to which the information pertains.   Rather, the question is whether the nondisclosure of interim facts rendered the prospectus materially incomplete.   An issuer's compliance with the periodic disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act does not per se preclude such undisclosed facts from being material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, we reject any bright-line rule that an issuer engaging in a public offering is obligated to disclose interim operating results for the quarter in progress whenever it perceives a possibility that the quarter's results may disappoint the market.   Far from it.   Reasonable investors understand that businesses fluctuate, and that past success is not a guarantee of more of the same.   There is always some risk that the quarter in progress at the time of an investment will turn out for the issuer to be worse than anticipated.   The market takes this risk of variability into account in evaluating the company's prospects based on the available facts concerning the issuer's past historical performance, its current financial condition, present trends and future uncertainties.   But, strong-form efficient market theories aside, the ability of market observers to evaluate a company depends upon the information publicly available to them.   If, as plaintiffs allege here, the issuer is in possession of nonpublic information indicating that the quarter in progress at the time of the public offering will be an extreme departure from the range of results which could be anticipated based on currently available information, it is consistent with the basic statutory policies favoring disclosure to require inclusion of that information in the registration statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to imply, however, that nondisclosure claims similar to those asserted by plaintiffs here can never be disposed of as a matter of law.   In many circumstances, the relationship between the nonpublic information that plaintiffs claim should have been disclosed and the actual results or events that the undisclosed information supposedly would have presaged will be so attenuated that the undisclosed information may be deemed immaterial as a matter of law.   Cf. VeriFone, 11 F.3d at 867-70 (affirming dismissal of claim that registration statement allegedly failed to disclose information concerning development that came to light six months later);  Krim v. BancTexas Group, Inc., 989 F.2d 1435, 1439, 1449-50 (5th Cir.1993) (affirming summary judgment disallowing claim that prospectus failed to disclose information of developments that matured four months later);  Convergent, 948 F.2d at 509-11, 515-16 (same, where prospectuses in March and August 1983 allegedly failed to disclose negative developments announced in February 1984);  Zucker v. Quasha, 891 F.Supp. 1010, 1012, 1018 (D.N.J.1995) (dismissing complaint based on alleged nondisclosure in March 31 registration statement of information relating to results of period ending July 2), aff'd, 82 F.3d 408 (3d Cir.1996) (table, No. 95-5428).   In such circumstances, where the allegedly undisclosed information is sufficiently remote in time or causation from the ultimate events of which it purportedly forewarned, the plaintiff's claim of nondisclosure may be indistinguishable from a claim that the issuer should have divulged its internal predictions about what would come of the undisclosed information.   Cf. VeriFone, 11 F.3d at 869 (characterizing plaintiffs' claims of nondisclosure of \"adverse material facts and trends\" as of March 13 as claims that defendants failed to disclose forecasts of news actually released to public on September 17).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the prospectus in question was filed 11 days prior to the end of the quarter in progress.   The results for that quarter turned out to be, by all accounts, the product of more than a minor business fluctuation.   Accepting, as we must, the plaintiffs' allegation that DEC, by March 21, 1994, was in possession of information about the company's quarter-to-date performance (e.g., operating results) indicating some substantial likelihood that the quarter would turn out to be an extreme departure from publicly known trends and uncertainties, we cannot conclude as a matter of law and at this early stage of the litigation that such information was not subject to mandatory disclosure under the rubric of \"material changes\" in Item 11(a) of Form S-3.   We conclude, accordingly, that the Wilensky plaintiffs' complaint as to this theory states a legally cognizable claim under Section 11 of the Securities Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>B.

They contend that the statement of DEC's \"belie[f]\" as to the \"adequacy\" of the then-remaining $443 million restructuring reserve \"to cover presently planned restructuring actions\" was false and misleading, in light of information contemporaneously known to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"restructuring reserve\" referred to in the prospectus supplement originated as a $1.5 billion charge taken by DEC at the close of its fiscal year 1992 (ended June 27, 1992) as part of the company's ongoing efforts to streamline the company \"to achieve a competitive cost structure.\"   The reserve was intended to cover the anticipated costs of employee separations, facilities consolidations, asset retirements, relocations, and related expenses.   The company had absorbed similar restructuring charges of $1.1 billion and $550 million in fiscal years 1991 and 1990, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During fiscal year 1993, DEC took a number of actions consistent with the $1.5 billion dollar reserve recorded at the end of fiscal year 1992.   By the end of the fiscal year (July 3, 1993), the remaining reserve was reported to be approximately $739 million.   During the first two quarters of the next fiscal year, the company continued to draw from the reserve, so that by the end of the second quarter (January 1, 1994), the reserve stood at approximately $443 million.   In its Form 10-Q for that quarter, dated February 4, 1994 (and incorporated by reference into the registration statement and prospectus at issue here), DEC stated its belief that the $443 million reserve was \"adequate\" to cover restructuring activities planned at that time.   This statement was repeated in the prospectus supplement dated March 21, 1994.   The full statement, with its immediately surrounding context, was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>While spending for R &amp; E [research &amp; engineering] and SG &amp; A [selling, general &amp; administrative] is declining, the Corporation believes its cost and expense levels are still too high for the level and mix of total operating revenues.   The Corporation is reducing expenses by streamlining its product offerings and selling and administrative practices, resulting in reductions in employee population, closing and consolidation of facilities and reductions in discretionary spending.   The Corporation believes that the remaining restructuring reserve of $443 million is adequate to cover presently planned restructuring actions.   The Corporation will continue to take actions necessary to achieve a level of costs appropriate for its revenues and competitive for its business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As events turned out, additional restructuring charges were in fact taken later in fiscal year 1994.   At the time of the company's announcement on April 15, 1994 of the $183 million loss for the third fiscal quarter of 1994, defendant Palmer stated that he had already instructed management to \"accelerate [the company's] on-going restructuring efforts\" and that the company would \"consider further restructuring to achieve [its] goals.\"   In line with these statements, the company announced on July 20, 1994 (just after the close of fiscal year 1994) that it had decided to take an additional restructuring charge of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1994 (ended June 30, 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether the Statement Was Misleading</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although defendants were required to disclose the size of the remaining restructuring reserve in the registration statement and prospectus as affecting the company's liquidity and capital resources,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> the characterization of the reserve as adequate was arguably voluntary.   But whether voluntary or not, DEC's description of its belief as of March 21, 1994 that the remaining $443 million reserve was \"adequate\" carried with it an obligation to ensure that the representation was not misleading.   See Roeder, 814 F.2d at 26;  cf. Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 365 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[I]f a defendant characterizes ... reserves as 'adequate' or 'solid' even though it knows they are inadequate or unstable, it exposes itself to possible liability [under the securities laws].\"  (quoting Shapiro v. UJB Financial Corp., 964 F.2d 272, 282 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 934, 113 S.Ct. 365, 121 L.Ed.2d 278 (1992)));  cf. also In re Wells Fargo Sec. Litig., 12 F.3d 922, 930 (9th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 295, 130 L.Ed.2d 209 (1994).   Plaintiffs assert that defendants failed to meet that obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undeniable purport of the \"adequacy\" statement is that DEC had no plans as of the date of the prospectus supplement to engage in actions that would require the taking of a restructuring charge beyond the $443 million then remaining in \"reserve.\"   This was false or misleading, plaintiffs say, because DEC knew as of March 21, 1994 that further restructuring actions would be necessary to put the company back on the right track after its impending third quarter setback, and that these actions would deplete the remaining reserve and require further restructuring charges to be taken.   Defendants reply, as the district court noted, that whatever the natural implication of the \"adequacy\" statement, its context sufficiently \"bespeaks caution\" to render any misleading inference from the statement immaterial as a matter of law.   We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"bespeaks caution\" doctrine \"is essentially shorthand for the well-established principle that a statement or omission must be considered in context.\"  In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., 7 F.3d 357, 364 (3d Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1219, 127 L.Ed.2d 565 (1994);  see also Rubinstein v. Collins, 20 F.3d 160, 167 (5th Cir.1994).   It embodies the principle that when statements of \"soft\" information such as forecasts, estimates, opinions, or projections are accompanied by cautionary disclosures that adequately warn of the possibility that actual results or events may turn out differently, the \"soft\" statements may not be materially misleading under the securities laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  See Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 879 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Harden v. Raffensperger, Hughes &amp; Co., 65 F.3d 1392, 1404 (7th Cir.1995);  In re Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig., 35 F.3d 1407, 1413-14 (9th Cir.1994) (collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 185, 133 L.Ed.2d 123 (1995);  Rubinstein, 20 F.3d at 166-68;  In re Trump, 7 F.3d at 371-72;  I. Meyer Pincus &amp; Assocs. v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., 936 F.2d 759, 763 (2d Cir.1991).   In short, if a statement is couched in or accompanied by prominent cautionary language that clearly disclaims or discounts the drawing of a particular inference, any claim that the statement was materially misleading because it gave rise to that very inference may fail as a matter of law.  In re Trump, 7 F.3d at 364.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the bespeaks caution doctrine does not preclude a claim that the reserve \"adequacy\" statement was materially misleading.   The \"adequacy\" statement has both a forward-looking aspect and an aspect that encompasses a representation of present fact.   In its forward-looking aspect, the statement suggests that DEC would take no further restructuring charges in the near-term future.   In its present-oriented aspect, it represents that as of March 21, 1994, DEC had no current intent to undertake activities that would require any such further restructuring charges to be taken.   To the extent that plaintiffs allege that the reserve \"adequacy\" statement encompasses the latter representation of present fact, and that such a representation was false or misleading when made, the surrounding cautionary language could not have rendered the statement immaterial as a matter of law.   See Harden, 65 F.3d at 1405-06 (explaining that the bespeaks caution doctrine cannot render misrepresentations of \"hard\" fact nonactionable).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, to the extent that plaintiffs allege that the \"adequacy\" statement implies a hiatus on new restructuring charges for the near future, we do not think that the surrounding context warns against such an implication with sufficient clarity to be thought to bespeak caution.   See Fecht v. Price Co., 70 F.3d 1078, 1082 (9th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1422, 134 L.Ed.2d 547 (1996).   The prospectus supplement does state that DEC will \"continue to take actions,\" but it is at best ambiguous whether those \"actions\" refer to any restructuring activities other than those \"presently planned.\"   Thus, one might easily interpret the purportedly cautionary statement, especially in light of the \"adequacy\" characterization, to mean that the company's ongoing \"actions\" will continue to be covered by the existing restructuring reserve.   If it was true, as plaintiffs allege, that defendants knew as of March 21, 1994 that DEC's performance in the third quarter would precipitate actions on a scale and schedule that would necessitate the taking of additional restructuring charges, the \"adequacy\" statement may well have been materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot conclude, as a matter of law and on these pleadings, that the actionability of the \"reserve adequacy\" statement is precluded by a context that bespeaks caution.   The cautionary statements to which defendants point did not provide an unambiguous warning of the possibility that DEC might take additional restructuring charges in the near future--as it turned out, a charge of $1.2 billion in the fiscal year then in progress.   See id. at 1082 (bespeaks caution doctrine provides basis for dismissal as matter of law \"only when reasonable minds could not disagree as to whether the mix of information in the [allegedly actionable] document is misleading\" (emphasis in original));  Rubinstein, 20 F.3d at 167-68 (stating that questions of whether disclosures were sufficiently cautionary may not always be resolved as a matter of law).   Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs' allegations pertaining to the prospectus supplement's description of the restructuring reserve as \"adequate\" fail to state a claim under Sections 11 and 12(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>C.

The dismissal of the Section 12(2) claim as to the other defendants will accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622, 108 S.Ct. 2063, 100 L.Ed.2d 658 (1988), the Supreme Court described in detail the class of defendants who may be sued as \"sellers\" under Section 12(1) of the Securities Act.   See id. at 641-44, 108 S.Ct. at 2075-77.   Section 12(2) defines the persons who may sue and be sued thereunder in language identical to the language used in Section 12(1).   Thus, Pinter 's analysis of \"seller\" for purposes of Section 12(1) applies with equal force to the interpretation of \"seller\" under Section 12(2).   See, e.g., Ackerman v. Schwartz, 947 F.2d 841, 844-45 (7th Cir.1991);  In re Craftmatic Sec. Litig., 890 F.2d 628, 635 (3d Cir.1989);  Moore v. Kayport Package Express, Inc., 885 F.2d 531, 536 (9th Cir.1989);  Wilson v. Saintine Exploration &amp; Drilling Corp., 872 F.2d 1124, 1125-26 (2d Cir.1989);  Dawe v. Main St. Management Co., 738 F.Supp. 36, 37 (D.Mass.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person who \"offers or sells\" a security may be liable under Section 12 to any person \"purchasing such security from him.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77l (2) (emphasis added).   Although the \"purchasing from\" language in the statute literally appears to contemplate a relationship between defendant and plaintiff \"not unlike traditional contractual privity,\" Pinter, 486 U.S. at 642, 108 S.Ct. at 2076, the Pinter Court held that Section 12 liability is not limited to those who actually pass title to the suing purchaser.   See id. at 645, 108 S.Ct. at 2077-78.   This is so because even \"[i]n common parlance,\" a person may \"offer or sell\" property without actually passing title.  Id. at 642, 108 S.Ct. at 2076.   For example, a broker or agent who solicits a purchase \"would commonly be said ... to be among those 'from' whom the buyer 'purchased,' even though the agent himself did not pass title.\"   Id. at 644, 108 S.Ct. at 2077.   Furthermore, because \"solicitation is the stage at which an investor is most likely to be injured,\" id. at 646, 108 S.Ct. at 2078, the Court found it consistent with the policies of the statute to permit imposition of liability on a non-owner of securities who \"successfully solicits\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> the plaintiff's purchase of the securities, provided that the solicitor is \"motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or those of the securities owner.\"   Id. at 647, 108 S.Ct. at 2078.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pinter Court limited its holding in ways that govern the result here.   The Court held that the \"purchasing ... from\" requirement of Section 12 limits the imposition of liability to \"the buyer's immediate seller,\" and thus, \"a buyer cannot recover against his seller's seller.\"  Pinter, 486 U.S. at 644 n. 21, 108 S.Ct. at 2077 n. 21 (citations omitted).   Second, the Court stated that proof the defendant caused a plaintiff's purchase of a security is not enough to establish that the defendant \"solicited\" the sale for Section 12 purposes.   See id. at 651, 108 S.Ct. at 2080-81 (explaining that \"[t]he 'purchase from' requirement of &#167; 12 focuses on the defendant's relationship with the plaintiff-purchaser\" and rejecting use of a test under which defendant could qualify as a seller if he was a \"substantial factor\" in causing the transaction to take place).   Finally, the Court indicated that a person's \"remote\" involvement in a sales transaction or his mere \"participat[ion] in soliciting the purchase\" does not subject him to Section 12 liability.   See id. at 651 n. 27, 108 S.Ct. at 2081.   A defendant must be directly involved in the actual solicitation of a securities purchase in order to qualify, on that basis, as a Section 12 \"seller.\"   See In re Craftmatic, 890 F.2d at 636;  Capri v. Murphy, 856 F.2d 473, 478-79 (2d Cir.1988);  Dawe, 738 F.Supp. at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We apply these principles to the Wilensky complaint.   The March 1994 public offering was made pursuant to a \"firm commitment\" underwriting, as disclosed in the registration statement and prospectus supplement.   The plaintiffs do not contend otherwise.   In a firm commitment underwriting, the issuer of the securities sells all of the shares to be offered to one or more underwriters, at some discount from the offering price.   Investors thus purchase shares in the offering directly from the underwriters (or broker-dealers who purchase from the underwriters), not directly from the issuer.   In fact, the March 21, 1994 prospectus supplement represented that \"[DEC] has agreed not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer or enter into any agreement to offer or sell, shares of [the offered stock].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the issuer in a firm commitment underwriting does not pass title to the securities, DEC and its officers cannot be held liable as \"sellers\" under Section 12(2) unless they actively \"solicited\" the plaintiffs' purchase of securities to further their own financial motives, in the manner of a broker or vendor's agent.   See Pinter 486 U.S. at 644-47, 108 S.Ct. at 2076-79.   Absent such solicitation, DEC can be viewed as no more than a \"seller's seller,\" whom plaintiffs would have no right to sue under Section 12(2).   See id. at 644 n. 21, 108 S.Ct. at 2077 n. 21;  PPM Am., Inc. v. Marriott Corp., 853 F.Supp. 860, 874-75 (D.Md.1994);  Louis Loss &amp; Joel Seligman, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation 1000-01 (3d ed. 1995) (\"[I]t seems quite clear that &#167; 12 contemplates only an action by a buyer against his or her immediate seller.   That is to say, in the case of the typical 'firm-commitment underwriting,' the ultimate investor can recover only from the dealer who sold to him or her.\"  (emphasis in original;  footnotes omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual allegations in the complaint supporting the purported status of DEC and the individual defendants as Section 12(2) sellers are sparse, and all pertain to those defendants' involvement in preparing the registration statement, prospectus, and other \"activities necessary to effect the sale of the [ ] securities to the investing public.\"   Under Pinter, however, neither involvement in preparation of a registration statement or prospectus nor participation in \"activities\" relating to the sale of securities, standing alone, demonstrates the kind of relationship between defendant and plaintiff that could establish statutory seller status.   See Pinter, 486 U.S. at 651 &amp; n. 27, 108 S.Ct. at 2081 &amp; n. 27;  Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 286.   Although the complaint also contains a conclusory allegation that each defendant \"solicited and/or was a substantial factor in the purchase by plaintiffs\" of securities in the offering, the Supreme Court specifically rejected a proposed test under which a defendant's being a \"substantial factor\" in bringing about a sale could establish statutory seller status.   See Pinter, 486 U.S. at 651, 108 S.Ct. at 2080-81.   Furthermore, the term \"solicitation\" is a legal term of art in this context.   In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must take all well-pleaded facts as true, but it need not credit a complaint's \"bald assertions\" or legal conclusions.  Washington Legal Found. v. Massachusetts Bar Found., 993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 115 (1st Cir.1992)).   Here it is undisputed that the public offering was conducted pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting, and plaintiffs' bald and factually unsupported allegation that the issuer and individual officers of the issuer \"solicited\" the plaintiffs' securities purchases is not, standing alone, sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While, on a different set of allegations, an issuer involved in a firmly underwritten public offering could be a \"seller\" for purposes of Section 12(2), we hold that the Wilensky complaint does not contain sufficient non-conclusory factual allegations which, if true, would establish that DEC or the individual defendants qualify as such.   However, the complaint does adequately allege that the underwriter defendants directly sold securities to the plaintiffs (in the literal sense of passing title), consistent with the underwriting arrangements disclosed in the prospectus supplement of March 21, 1994.   We conclude that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged statutory seller status as against the underwriter defendants, but not against DEC or the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>The Section 10(b) Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>(Shaw Action)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in the Shaw action assert claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5.

The defendants respond that they were under no duty to disclose the information identified by plaintiff, and that none of the statements attributed to them was materially false, misleading, or otherwise actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>A.

The district court, after analyzing each of the statements identified by the plaintiffs, held as a matter of law that none was sufficiently material to support a claim of securities fraud.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most circumstances, disputes over the materiality of allegedly false or misleading statements must be reserved for the trier of fact.   See Basic, 485 U.S. at 236, 108 S.Ct. at 986;  Lucia, 36 F.3d at 176.   But not every unfulfilled expression of corporate optimism, even if characterized as misstatement, can give rise to a genuine issue of materiality under the securities laws.   See Lucia, 36 F.3d at 176 (leaving open possibility that some materiality determinations may be made as a matter of law).   In particular, courts have demonstrated a willingness to find immaterial as a matter of law a certain kind of rosy affirmation commonly heard from corporate managers and numbingly familiar to the marketplace--loosely optimistic statements that are so vague, so lacking in specificity, or so clearly constituting the opinions of the speaker, that no reasonable investor could find them important to the total mix of information available.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  See, e.g., San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 807, 811 (holding not actionable statement that the company \"expect[ed] ... another year of strong growth in earnings per share\");  Hillson Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Adage, Inc., 42 F.3d 204, 213 (4th Cir.1994) (similar, where alleged fraudulent statement was:  \"[the company] is on target toward achieving the most profitable year in its history\");  In re Caere Corporate Sec. Litig., 837 F.Supp. 1054, 1057-58 (N.D.Cal.1993) (\"[The company is] 'well-positioned' for growth.\");  Colby v. Hologic, Inc., 817 F.Supp. 204, 211 (D.Mass.1993) (\"Prospects for long term growth are bright.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of vaguely optimistic statements for immateriality as a matter of law may be especially robust in cases involving a fraud-on-the-market theory of liability.   In such cases, the statements identified by plaintiffs as actionably misleading are alleged to have caused injury, if at all, not through the plaintiffs' direct reliance upon them, but by dint of the statements' inflating effect on the market price of the security purchased.   See Basic, 485 U.S. at 241-47, 108 S.Ct. at 988-92;  Rand v. Cullinet Software, Inc., 847 F.Supp. 200, 205 (D.Mass.1994).   When the truth is disclosed and the market self-corrects, investors who bought at the inflated price suffer losses.   Those losses can be deemed to have been caused by the defendants' statements, even absent direct reliance by plaintiffs, because the statements were presumptively absorbed into and reflected by the security's price.   See Basic, 485 U.S. at 243-44, 108 S.Ct. at 989-90 (quoting In re LTV, 88 F.R.D. at 143).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This presumption of investor reliance on the integrity of stock prices has the primary effect of obviating the need for plaintiff purchasers to plead individual reliance.   But by its underlying rationale, the presumption also shifts the critical focus of the materiality inquiry.   In a fraud-on-the-market case the hypothetical \"reasonable investor,\" by reference to whom materiality is gauged, must be \"the market\" itself, because it is the market, not any single investor, that determines the price of a publicly traded security.   See In re VeriFone Sec. Litig., 784 F.Supp. 1471, 1479 (N.D.Cal.1992) (\"The fraud-on-the-market theory thus shifts the inquiry from whether an individual investor was fooled to whether the market as a whole was fooled.\"), aff'd, 11 F.3d 865 (9th Cir.1993);  see also In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig., 886 F.2d 1109, 1113-14 (9th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 943, 110 S.Ct. 3229, 110 L.Ed.2d 676 (1990);  cf. Easterbrook &amp; Fischel, Corporate Law, supra, at 297 (explaining how unsophisticated investors \"take a free ride on the information impounded by the market\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, a claim that a fraud was perpetrated on the market can draw no sustenance from allegations that defendants made overly-optimistic statements, if those statements are ones that any reasonable investor (ergo, the market) would easily recognize as nothing more than a kind of self-directed corporate puffery.   The market is not so easily duped, even granted that individual investors sometimes are.   See In re Apple Computer, 886 F.2d at 1114;  Wielgos v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 892 F.2d 509, 515 (7th Cir.1989);  see also Raab v. General Physics Corp., 4 F.3d 286, 289-90 (4th Cir.1993) (\"[T]he market price of a share is not inflated by vague statements predicting growth....  Analysts and arbitrageurs rely on facts in determining the value of a security, not mere expressions of optimism from company spokesmen.\"  (citations omitted)).   This is particularly so with respect to the securities of an actively traded and closely followed company like DEC.   Cf. LTV, 88 F.R.D. at 144 (citing empirical studies demonstrating that assumptions about market efficiency are strongest with respect to \"[t]the prices of stocks of larger corporations, such as those listed on the New York Stock Exchange\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have no occasion or intention to adopt here a per se rule that expressions of optimism uttered by corporate managers can never support a claim of securities fraud, we think that in this case, the statements outside of the registration statement and prospectus identified by plaintiffs as actionably misleading are--with one exception discussed separately below--by their nature, too patently immaterial to support a fraud-on-the-market claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court, for example, that a claim of securities fraud cannot lie on the basis of the statements made by defendant Steul (DEC's chief financial officer) in January 1994, in reaction to the disappointing earnings results for the quarter just ended.   Steul was quoted as saying that the company's transition to selling its Alpha chip products was \"going reasonably well\" and that the company \"should show progress quarter over quarter, year over year.\"   We hold to be similarly not actionable (because patently immaterial) Steul's comment of January 19, 1994 that the company was \"basically on track\";  his comment of January 20, 1994 that \"DEC was a very healthy company\";  defendant Robert Palmer's statement of the same date that he was \"confident that DEC was pursuing the right strategy\";  and the February 8, 1994 statement by DEC's head of European operations (not a defendant here) that he was \"pretty optimistic\" that the company would \"be able to stabilize [its] revenue\" in the first half of calendar year 1994 and \"start to grow revenue\" in the second half.   These statements all so obviously fail to pose any \"substantial likelihood\" of being \"viewed by the reasonable investor\"--let alone the market--\"as having significantly altered the total mix of information available,\" Basic, 485 U.S. at 231-32, 108 S.Ct. at 983-84 (quotation omitted), that they are properly deemed immaterial as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>B.

The statements cannot accurately be described as the kind of diffuse expressions of opinion or optimism that can be deemed, by their nature, obviously immaterial as a matter of law.   Rather, they appear, in isolation, to be statements quantifying the company's current operating inflows as more or less approximating outflows, thus inviting an inference that the end results for the third quarter might turn out likewise.   The rub, however, is the context surrounding the statements.   When evaluated in context, the \"break-even\" statements do not give rise to a claim of securities fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding a motion to dismiss a securities action, a court may properly consider the relevant entirety of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint, even though not attached to the complaint, without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.   See Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that the main problem of looking to documents outside the complaint--lack of notice to plaintiff--is dissipated \"[w]here plaintiff has actual notice ... and has relied upon these documents in framing the complaint\" (quoting Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., 949 F.2d 42, 48 (2d Cir.1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 960, 112 S.Ct. 1561, 118 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992));  see also San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 808-09;  Romani, 929 F.2d at 879 n. 3.   Were the rule otherwise, a plaintiff could maintain a claim of fraud by excising an isolated statement from a document and importing it into the complaint, even though the surrounding context imparts a plainly non-fraudulent meaning to the allegedly wrongful statement.   We look to the full context of the \"break-even\" statements attributed to DEC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first time the \"break-even\" statement appeared was in a Boston Herald article headlined \"Digital falls short with $72.1M loss,\" published on January 20, 1994, the day after DEC had announced its disappointing earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal year 1994.   The article attributed the following statement to Steul:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>The $72 million loss represents only 2.2 percent of revenues, Steul said.  \"We are operating very close to break-even.   It's a lot of money, but on the other hand it's small compared to what losses have been in the past.\"   Steul would not say when Digital will again be profitable.  \"I hesitate to give you an estimate because we just have too much uncertainty in the immediate future\" [paragraph structure omitted].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is plain that Steul's \"break-even\" characterization refers to the fact that the $72 million loss that had just been reported for the second quarter of fiscal year 1994 was, in fact, only a small percentage of the company's total revenues.   The statement cannot reasonably be understood as a material comment on the current status or anticipated results of the company's third quarter.   Since plaintiffs do not allege that the characterization of \"close to break-even\" placed an actionably fraudulent spin on DEC's second quarter results, the statement in that context can be of no moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second \"break-even\" statement appeared in a February 23, 1994 Wall Street Journal article.   The article's author had obtained an \"internal\" DEC finance review, and divulged its contents as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>\"We're running very close to break-even,\" the [internal] review says, though \"revenue is uncertain for next two-plus quarters.\"   The review concludes that Digital \"will still be in turnaround for the next two or three quarters\" and that managers should \"focus heavily on cash conservation.\"   There is a chance, it adds, \"if we keep at Q2 spending levels, that we can make a profit this fiscal year.\"   While Mr. Palmer confirmed many of these points in an interview, he wouldn't make any forecast.  \"This is a large organization that was in deep trouble when I started, and we still have a way to go\" [paragraph structure omitted].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The context of the \"break-even\" statement in the internal review, as reported, sufficiently bespeaks caution to render any forward-looking connotation that could otherwise be taken from the statement immaterial as a matter of law.   Cf. Polin v. Conductron Corp., 552 F.2d 797, 806 n. 28 (8th Cir.)  (holding that statement by company that it \"saw a 'possibility' of a break-even soon\" was immaterial as matter of law, since it was phrased so as to \"bespeak caution in outlook\"), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 857, 98 S.Ct. 178, 54 L.Ed.2d 129 (1977).   Given the statements attributed to the internal review that \"revenue is uncertain for next two-plus quarters\";  that \"[DEC] will still be in turnaround for the next two or three quarters\";  that \"we still have a way to go\";  and given Palmer's reported refusal to make any forecast, coupled with the absence of any specifics regarding the authoritativeness or timeliness of the \"internal\" report, no reasonable investor (nor the market) could have attached importance to any forward-looking connotation of the \"break-even\" statement described in the article.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar analysis applies to the \"break-even\" statement that appeared in the March 29, 1994 issue of Financial World.   In that article, defendant Steul was quoted as saying \"We are very close to break-even.   If it hadn't been for currencies, and had we been able to ship everything ordered, we would have been in the black in the second quarter.\"   As with the Wall Street Journal piece, neither the Financial World piece itself nor the Shaw complaint specifies the date on which the statement was actually made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  But, again, Rule 9(b) issues aside, the \"break-even\" comment is most naturally understood as looking backward to the second quarter of fiscal 1994, not to the future.   Furthermore, to the extent that any other meaning could be discerned, it is directly negated by other qualifying comments attributed to Steul in the same article, including the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>What Digital needs at this point is time.   Says Steul, \"Wall Street always wants quick results, but it took a couple of years to get where we are and it will take more than a couple of quarters to turn it around.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This warning that favorable results would be slow to come is a far cry from a \"prediction of a break-even year,\" which is how plaintiffs characterize Steul's comments.   Additionally, because plaintiffs allege that a fraud on the market was committed by statements communicated in this financial analyst's article, it is only fair to note that the tenor of the article is one of skepticism about DEC's future prospects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  On the facts as alleged, the district court did not err in concluding that the \"break-even\" statement in the Financial World piece was immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p>C.

These alleged misstatements and omissions are identical to those that underlie the Wilensky plaintiffs' claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act.   We conclude that the Shaw plaintiffs may pursue their Section 10(b) claim based on these alleged defects in the registration statement and prospectus.   Because we hold that the Shaw complaint survives Rule 12(b)(6) only to that extent, we also conclude that the putative class on whose behalf the Shaw complaint was brought must be narrowed accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Material omissions and misleading statements in a registration statement and prospectus are, in addition to being actionable under the Securities Act by purchasers in the offering, also actionable under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by contemporaneous purchasers in the aftermarket, provided, of course, that the additional elements of liability (scienter and reliance) are established.   See In re Ames Dept. Stores Inc. Stock Litig., 991 F.2d 953, 963 (2d Cir.1993);  Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., 188 F.2d 783, 786-87 (2d Cir.1951);  cf. Huddleston, 459 U.S. at 383, 103 S.Ct. at 688 (\"[I]t is hardly a novel proposition that the 1934 Act and the 1933 Act 'prohibit some of the same conduct.' \"  (citation omitted)).   In the context of a fraud-on-the-market claim, this principle has a simple rationale.   The registration statement and prospectus speak not only to those who purchase in the offering, but to the entire market.   If an issuer's registration statement contains a misleading statement of fact about the company's financial condition or omits material information required to be disclosed, the impact of such statements or omissions, to the extent material, would not necessarily be limited to the securities covered by the registration statement.   There is no logical reason that a registration statement and prospectus could not serve as a vehicle for an alleged fraud on the market, affecting all of the company's securities.   Thus, even though the Shaw plaintiffs purchased shares of DEC common stock in the aftermarket, not shares of preferred stock in the offering, their fraud-on-the-market claims may properly encompass any material misstatements or omissions in the registration statement.   See In re Ames, 991 F.2d at 963-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, then, that the same allegations of misleading statements and omissions in the Wilensky complaint that state a claim under Sections 11 and 12(2) also form the basis of a cognizable claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  The allegations in the Wilensky complaint which we found lacking are similarly without force in the Shaw complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.

The Shaw plaintiffs allege that they were injured when they purchased DEC common stock at prices that were inflated as a result of misleading statements and omissions by DEC and the individual defendants.   The named plaintiffs purport to represent a class of persons who purchased DEC stock between January 19 and April 15, 1994.   However, because the only allegations in the Shaw complaint that state a claim are those that depend upon the purported misstatements and omissions in the registration statement as of its effective date--March 21, 1994--it follows that only those who purchased their shares on or after March 21, 1994 (and before April 15, 1994, when disclosure occurred) could have suffered cognizable injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the four plaintiffs named in the Shaw complaint, only Gary Phillips is alleged to have made his purchase within those two limiting dates;  thus only his claim may be reinstated.   The district court's dismissal of the claims of the three other named plaintiffs is affirmed.

We then test the allegations of the Shaw complaint and conclude that it satisfies Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p>A.

The threshold question is whether the Wilensky complaint, which sets forth claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act, contains any \"averments of fraud.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fraud is not an element of a claim under either Section 11 or 12(2), and a plaintiff asserting such claims may avoid altogether any allegations of scienter or reliance.   See Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 288;  Lucia v. Prospect St. High Income Portfolio, Inc., 769 F.Supp. 410, 416 (D.Mass.1991), aff'd, 36 F.3d 170 (1st Cir.1994).   However, despite the minimal requirements of Sections 11 and 12(2), a complaint asserting violations of those statutes may yet \"sound[ ] in fraud.\"  Haft v. Eastland Financial Corp., 755 F.Supp. 1123, 1126 (D.R.I.1991).   For example, if a plaintiff were to attempt to establish violations of Sections 11 and 12(2) as well as the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act through allegations in a single complaint of a unified course of fraudulent conduct, fraud might be said to \"lie[ ] at the core of the action.\"  Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir.1985).   In such a case, the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b) would probably apply to the Sections 11, 12(2), and Rule 10b-5 claims alike.  \"It is the allegation of fraud, not the 'title' of the claim that brings the policy concerns [underlying Rule 9(b) ] ... to the forefront.\"  Haft, 755 F.Supp. at 1133;  accord Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 287-88 (applying Rule 9(b) to Section 11 and 12(2) claims \"grounded in fraud\");  Lucia, 769 F.Supp. at 416-17 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, the Wilensky complaint avoids grounding its Section 11 and 12(2) claims on any allegations of fraud.   Although the complaint does assert that defendants actually possessed the information that they failed to disclose, those allegations cannot be thought to constitute \"averments of fraud,\" absent any claim of scienter and reliance.   Otherwise, any allegation of nondisclosure of material information would be transformed into a claim of fraud for purposes of Rule 9(b).   In the circumstances, we hold that the Wilensky complaint was not subject to the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p>B.

We limit our analysis to those allegations in the Shaw complaint that state a cognizable claim for securities fraud.   The issue is thus whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded that defendants knew facts as of March 21, 1994 that indicated the third quarter was going to turn out as it did, and that the company would soon thereafter announce further restructuring actions necessitating an additional restructuring charge for the fiscal year.   Although the question is close, we think that the complaint survives Rule 9(b) scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has been \"especially rigorous\" in applying Rule 9(b) in securities fraud actions \"to minimize the chance 'that a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim will bring a suit and conduct extensive discovery in the hopes of obtaining an increased settlement, rather than in the hopes that the process will reveal relevant evidence.' \"  Romani, 929 F.2d at 878 (quoting New England Data Servs., Inc. v. Becher, 829 F.2d 286, 288 (1st Cir.1987)).   We have emphasized that the particularity requirement cannot be avoided \"simply through a general averment that defendants 'knew' earlier what later turned out badly.\"  Greenstone v. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1992).   A securities plaintiff cannot plead \" 'fraud by hindsight.' \"  Id. (quoting Denny v. Barber, 576 F.2d 465, 470 (2d Cir.1978)).   This means that a plaintiff may not simply contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results, and then \"contend[ ] that the difference must be attributable to fraud.\"  DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 941, 111 S.Ct. 347, 112 L.Ed.2d 312 (1990).   Rather, Rule 9(b) requires that the complaint \"set[ ] forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that defendant knew that a statement was materially false or misleading.\"  Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 25 (collecting cases);  see also Serabian, 24 F.3d at 361 (quoting Greenstone ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the complaint cannot fairly be characterized as resting on conclusory allegations of the defendants' knowledge.   The plaintiffs provide a series of factual allegations relating to a combination of developments known to the company (e.g., failing product pricing strategies, market resistance to new products, wayward compensation policies, failure to implement downsizing plans) that could have provided a basis for advance knowledge of the information disclosed on April 15, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a>  These factual allegations, together with other aspects of the complaint discussed below, provide a basis for a reasonable inference that defendants knew facts by March 21 indicating that the third fiscal quarter would be disastrous, and that accelerated restructuring efforts requiring a further restructuring charge were likely to follow.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  Cf. Serabian, 24 F.3d at 365;  In re Wells Fargo, 12 F.3d at 931.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In additional support of their allegations of defendants' knowledge, plaintiffs assert that two insiders of the company, neither of whom is a defendant here, sold DEC stockholdings during the third fiscal quarter.   One, the company's treasurer, sold 1,625 shares (68% of the officer's total holdings) on February 11, 1994.   The other, the general manager and vice president of the company's personal computer business, sold 2,000 shares (20% of his position) on March 22, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the mere fact that insider stock sales occurred does not suffice to establish scienter.   See Tapogna v. Egan, 141 F.R.D. 370, 373 (D.Mass.1992).   However, allegations of \"insider trading in suspicious amounts or at suspicious times\" may permit an inference that the trader--and by further inference, the company--possessed material nonpublic information at the time.   See Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26 (citing In re Apple Computer, 886 F.2d at 1117);  see also Rubinstein, 20 F.3d at 169-70 (characterizing sufficiently suspicious trading as \"presumptively probative of bad faith and scienter\").   Here, the level of suspicion warranted by the alleged insider stock sales is marginal:  the first sale occurred more than a month prior to the date of concern here (March 21, 1994);  and the second sale, though made at what might be considered a \"suspicious\" time, involved a small (albeit not insignificant) percentage of the insider's total holdings of DEC stock.   Nonetheless, we think that the plaintiffs' allegations of insider trading, inasmuch as they are at least consistent with their theory of fraud, provide some support against the defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in testing the allegations of the complaint against Rule 9(b), we need not turn a blind eye to the obvious:  the proximity of the date of the allegedly fraudulent statements and omissions to both the end of the quarter then in progress and the date on which disclosure was eventually made. While the short time frame between an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and a later disclosure of inconsistent information does not, standing alone, provide a sufficient factual grounding to satisfy Rule 9(b), see Arazie, 2 F.3d at 1467-68, there is nothing in Rule 9(b) that precludes consideration of such temporal proximity as a circumstance potentially bolstering the complaint's claims of fraud.   See Fecht, 70 F.3d at 1083-84.   On the facts as alleged in this case, we think that the proximity of the date of the allegedly misleading statements and omissions to the end of the ongoing quarter (and the date of eventual disclosure) provides some circumstantial factual support to be taken into account in determining whether the complaint pleads an adequate basis for inferring defendants' culpable knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no intention here of diluting the stringent mandate of Rule 9(b).   But in determining the adequacy of a complaint under that rule, we cannot hold plaintiffs to a standard that would effectively require them, pre-discovery, to plead evidence.   Rule 9(b) proscribes the pleading of \"fraud by hindsight,\" Denny, 576 F.2d at 470, but neither can plaintiffs be expected to plead fraud with complete insight.   We conclude that the portions of the Shaw complaint that survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny also satisfy the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred in dismissing the Wilensky and Shaw complaints in their entirety.   Portions of both complaints survive Rule 12(b)(6), but only to the extent that they allege:  (i) that the registration statement filed in connection with the public offering of March 21, 1994, failed to disclose material information in DEC's possession as of that date that would have alerted the market to the likelihood of disastrous quarterly results;  and (ii) that the statement in the prospectus supplement as to the \"adequacy\" of the restructuring reserve remaining as of March 21, 1994 was materially false or misleading.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  We hold, however, that the Wilensky complaint fails to state a claim under Section 12(2) of the Securities Act as to DEC and the individual defendants.   Furthermore, in light of the limited basis on which we permit the Shaw action to go forward, only the claims of the single named plaintiff who purchased DEC shares after March 21, 1994 may be reinstated, and the allegations in the Shaw complaint pertaining to the scope of the putative plaintiff class must be modified accordingly.   Finally, the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) do not apply to the Wilensky complaint as currently pleaded, and the surviving portion of the Shaw complaint does satisfy Rule 9(b).   On remand, the district court may choose to require the plaintiffs to amend their complaints in accordance with these conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, we note that although the issues of materiality and knowledge raised by the two complaints preclude terminating this litigation on the pleadings, nothing we say here is intended to foreclose the possibility that those and other issues, after discovery and an opportunity for factual development, might be susceptible to resolution on motions for summary judgment.   To borrow wise words from one of our prior decisions:  \"Despite our conclusion that certain allegations survive threshold consideration, we note that plaintiffs remain a great distance from actually proving\" any violations of the federal securities laws.

Id. at 288-89.   However, as the authors also recognize, the argument for voluntary disclosure becomes considerably weaker in contexts where the short-term interests of the company's managers differ from its long-term interests, for example, where management is under pressure to engineer a rapid turnaround in the company's financial performance.

But even though DEC had no obligation to disclose a forecast of results for the quarter in progress at the time of the offering, it was permitted to do so.   If it had chosen to disclose such a forward-looking projection, and if the projection was made with reasonable basis and in good faith, it may have been protected by the SEC's safe harbor provision.

Plaintiffs point to a statement by Steul in October of 1993 that the company's continuing restructuring actions over the fiscal year \"will probably be smaller than the last four quarters\";  a September 1993 statement that \"[s]ervice revenues have continued to grow\";  and a statement by defendant Palmer on November 4, 1993 that the prospect of turning a profit was a \"reasonable expectation\" in fiscal year 1994.   Whatever the circumstances in which a company might be subject to a duty to \"update\" information previously disclosed, we do not think that the pre-Class Period statements identified by plaintiffs are of the kind that could trigger any such duty.   The alleged statement regarding \"service revenues\" constitutes a statement of historical fact not alleged to be false, and as such, does not provide the basis for a duty to update.   See Serabian, 24 F.3d at 361.   The other alleged statements are cautiously optimistic comments that would not be actionable in the first instance.   See San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 811.   They express, at most, \"only the hope of any company\" for a positive future, and \"lack the sort of definite positive projections that might require later correction.\"  In re Time Warner, Inc.

Moreover, it seems likely that any \"duty to update\" DEC's pre-Class Period statements would have been extinguished by the company's disclosure of financial information in the negative earnings announcement of January 19, 1994, the first day of the alleged Class Period</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn34\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34_ref\">34</a>\n        <p> The full text of the news articles in which the \"break-even\" statements appeared, and which are cited in the complaint, have been provided to us in a jointly-prepared appendix.

Cf. Backman, 910 F.2d at 12-13 (suggesting that SEC regulations and insider trading may create a duty to disclose under Rule 10b-5);  Roeder, 814 F.2d at 27 (same).   But cf. In re Wells Fargo, 12 F.3d at 930 n. 6 (declining to reach the issue).   A different rule would lead to the anomalous result of a Rule 10b-5 plaintiff being able to sue an individual insider selling his company's securities for the nondisclosure of material nonpublic information, but not being able to sue the issuer itself for failing to disclose the same information in connection with an offering</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> In asserting that defendants had direct knowledge of DEC's third quarter operating results as they developed, plaintiffs allege that \"[m]ore so than the management of most companies, DEC's management, including the Individual Defendants, was virtually immediately cognizant of the Company's sales information\" by virtue of the company's use of \"a highly-efficient reporting system which allows the Company to forward sales and cost information to senior management virtually as sales are made.\"   The defendants argue that these allegations should be viewed with skepticism and as the product of nothing more than \"pure speculation.\"   Speculation or not, we think that the plaintiffs' allegations of a \"highly-efficient reporting system\" may speak to the question of how defendants might have known what they allegedly knew, but absent some indication of the specific factual content of any single report generated by the alleged reporting system, do not independently provide a factual basis for inferring any such knowledge.   On balance, we do not think that generalized allegations regarding the existence of an internal \"reporting system\" substantially assist a securities fraud complaint in overcoming the hurdle of Rule 9(b).   See Pitten v. Jacobs, 903 F.Supp. 937, 949-50 (D.S.C.1995);  cf. Arazie v. Mullane, 2 F.3d 1456, 1467 (7th Cir.1993) (refusing to credit \"scanty\" allegations concerning internal documents, absent indication of \"who prepared the projected figures, when they were prepared, how firm the numbers were, or which ... officers reviewed them\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn39\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39_ref\">39</a>\n        <p> We reject defendants' argument that the complaint fails adequately to particularize the roles of the individual defendants in the purported fraud.

Both complaints assert that there were misleading statements and nondisclosures in the registration statement and prospectus prepared in connection with a public offering of stock.   That offering commenced on March 21, 1994, just 11 days prior to the close of the quarter then in progress, and about three weeks prior to the company's announcement of an unexpectedly negative earnings report for that quarter.   One of the complaints further alleges that defendants made fraudulently optimistic statements to the public in the period leading up to the offering.   The district court found that neither complaint identified any statements or omissions actionable under the securities laws and dismissed both for failure to state a claim.   We agree that many of the alleged misstatements and omissions do not provide a legally cognizable basis for the plaintiffs' claims, but we also conclude that a limited set of allegations in both complaints relating to the registration statement and prospectus for the March 1994 offering does state a claim.   We further find that the surviving portions of the complaints satisfy the pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).   Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Digital Equipment Corporation (\"DEC\") is one of the world's largest suppliers of computer hardware, software and services.   Founded in 1957, it first became a publicly held company in 1966.   By the early 1990's, the company's success had burgeoned into $14 billion in yearly revenues.   The company's success story, however, would not last forever.   By 1992, the company had fallen on hard times.   In January 1992 it reported its first-ever quarterly operating loss of $138.3 million.   Faced in the ensuing months with operating losses in the range of $30 million to $311 million per quarter, the company decided to engage in radical surgery, cutting loose some 35,000 employees over the course of 15 months in the process, including its founder and CEO.   To cover the costs of these actions, the company accumulated \"restructuring\" charges totalling close to $3.2 billion in fiscal years 1990-1992 combined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the midst of its financial woes, however, the company took some steps to restore its health.   In February 1992, DEC had introduced a new product, the \"Alpha\" chip.   The Alpha chip was hailed as a technological advance that could potentially restore the company's fortunes.   In mid-1992, the company installed a new CEO, Robert B. Palmer.   He took the helm in the fall of that year, as the company continued to implement strategies to help its Alpha technology gain acceptance in the marketplace and to bring the company back to financial vitality.   At the time Palmer took over, the company had absorbed over $3 billion in losses for the prior three years and had been losing money at the rate of approximately $3 million per day.   Under the new management, it appeared that the company's financial hemorrhaging had finally begun to slow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 1993, DEC reported a loss for the second quarter of fiscal year 1993 that was far smaller than had been anticipated by analysts.   That promising result was followed by another quarter of losses, but within Wall Street's expectations.   Then, on July 28, 1993, the company announced its first profitable quarter since before the 1992 fiscal year, reporting a net profit of $113.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1993.   That result was slightly below analysts' expectations, but a stark improvement over the operating loss of $188.1 million (and overall loss of $2 billion) reported for the comparable quarter in the prior year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, on October 20, 1993, DEC announced a loss of $83.1 million for the first quarter of 1994, an improvement over the $260.5 million loss for the same quarter the prior year, but worse than analysts had been predicting.   On January 19, 1994, the company announced another setback, reporting losses for the second quarter of fiscal year 1994, ending January 1, 1994, of $72 million.   The loss was worse than analysts had expected and was virtually identical to the losses for that period the prior year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was against this backdrop that DEC, on January 21, 1994, filed with the SEC a \"shelf\" registration statement giving the company the option to issue up to $1 billion in various classes of debt and equity securities.   Two months later, DEC through its underwriters conducted an offering of $400 million in depositary shares of preferred stock, pursuant to the \"shelf\" registration, a prospectus dated March 11, 1994, and a prospectus supplement dated March 21, 1994.   The offering commenced on the date of the prospectus supplement and closed one week later on March 28, 1994, four days before the end of the third fiscal quarter.   All 16 million depositary shares of preferred stock were sold, at an offering price of $25.   DEC raised a badly needed $387.4 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than three weeks later, on April 15, 1994, DEC announced an operating loss of over $183 million for the quarter that had ended on April 2, 1994.   This third quarter loss was far greater than analysts had been expecting, and the largest that the company had reported since the first quarter of fiscal 1993.   It bucked the positive trend of reduced losses under the company's new management.   The announcement sent the price of the newly distributed preferred stock tumbling from the offering price of $25 to $20.875 by the close of trading on April 15.   The common stock fell from $28.875 to $23 during the same period, and to $21.125 by the close of the next trading day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its April 15 announcement, the company also disclosed that it had decided to \"accelerate [its] on-going restructuring efforts\" and \"also consider further restructuring.\"   This was despite a representation in the March 21 prospectus supplement that \"[t]he Corporation believes that the remaining restructuring reserve of $443 million is adequate to cover presently planned restructuring actions.\"   Eventually, following the close of fiscal year 1994, DEC announced on July 14, 1994 that it would cut almost one-fourth of its remaining workforce and take an additional charge of $1.2 billion for fiscal year 1994 (beyond the $443 million remaining in reserve as of March 21) to cover the costs of additional restructuring activities.II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Description of the Actions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two lawsuits were filed on Tuesday, April 19, 1994, two business days after the company's announcement of April 15, 1994.   One, the Wilensky action, brought on behalf of all persons who purchased shares in the March 1994 public offering, asserts claims under Sections 11, 12(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") against DEC, its Chief Executive Officer (Robert B. Palmer), its Chief Financial Officer (William Steul), and seven underwriting or investment banking firms, representing a purported defendant class of 65 underwriters who participated in the offering.   The second, the Shaw action, advances claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5, and a pendent claim of common law negligent misrepresentation, on behalf of all purchasers of DEC common stock between January 19 and April 15, 1994 (the \"Class Period\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of both complaints are two sets of claims.   First, plaintiffs assert that DEC management had knowledge of material facts concerning the large losses developing during the third fiscal quarter of 1994, and that the defendants were under a duty to disclose such material information to the market in connection with the public offering conducted on March 21, 1994.   Second, both the Wilensky and Shaw plaintiffs contend that the representation made in the March 21 prospectus supplement concerning the \"adequacy\" of the then-remaining \"restructuring reserve\" was materially misleading.   The Shaw plaintiffs allege, additionally, that throughout the Class Period, the defendants made fraudulently optimistic statements to the public concerning DEC's future prospects in order artificially to inflate the market value of DEC shares, and that these statements were actionably false or misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and 12(b)(6).   The district court consolidated the cases, stayed all discovery, and then dismissed both actions.   The district court ruled, inter alia, that defendants had violated no duty to disclose and that the defendants' statements were not misleading, bespoke caution, or were otherwise not actionable as a matter of law.   The court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), without reaching whether the complaints satisfied the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).   These appeals followed.   We affirm in part and reverse in part.   For clarity, we discuss each of the two actions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Section 11 and 12(2) Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>(Wilensky Action)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sections 11 and 12(2) are enforcement mechanisms for the mandatory disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.   Section 11 imposes liability on signers of a registration statement, and on underwriters, if the registration statement \"contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k.   Section 12(2) provides that any person who \"offers or sells\" a security by means of a prospectus or oral communication containing a materially false statement or that \"omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,\" shall be liable to any \"person purchasing such security from him.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77 l (2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Wilensky plaintiffs assert claims under Sections 11, 12(2), and 15,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> alleging that the registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with the March 1994 public offering contained materially false statements and omitted to state material information required to be provided therein.   The thrust of the Wilensky complaint is that defendants knew, as of the March 21 date of the 1994 public offering, of material facts portending the unexpectedly large losses for the third quarter of fiscal 1994 that were announced later, and that failure to disclose these material facts in the registration statement and prospectus violated Section 11.   Additionally, the Wilensky plaintiffs contend that the statement in the registration statement and prospectus characterizing as \"adequate\" the company's then-remaining \"restructuring reserve\" of $443 million was materially false and misleading, in violation of both Sections 11 and 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants parry by attempting to reduce plaintiffs' claims to an argument that the company was required to disclose its internal forecasts about the outcome of the third quarter.   They argue that the plaintiffs' position is untenable because the securities laws impose no duty upon a company to disclose internal projections, estimates of quarterly results, or other forward-looking information.   They also say that the statement concerning the adequacy of the company's restructuring reserves is not actionably misleading when considered in context.   Finally, defendants contend that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts establishing that DEC and the underwriter defendants were statutory \"sellers\" subject to liability under Section 12(2).   We evaluate each set of arguments separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>A.

See, e.g., Backman v.

Equally settled is that accurate reports of past successes do not themselves give rise to a duty to inform the market whenever present circumstances suggest that the future may bring a turn for the worse.

This action arises out of an allegedly defective registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with a public stock offering.   The obligations that attend the preparation of those filings embody nothing if not an affirmative duty to disclose a broad range of material information.   Cf. Herman &amp; MacLean v.

The issue, rather, is whether the defendants had a specific obligation to disclose information of the type that the plaintiffs complain was omitted from the registration statement and prospectus.   The task of deciding whether particular information is subject to mandatory disclosure is not easily separable from normative judgments about the kinds of information that the securities laws should require to be disclosed, which depend, in essence, on conceptions of materiality.   See generally Victor Brudney, A Note On Materiality and Soft Information Under the Federal Securities Laws, 75 Va.L.Rev. 723, 728 (1989).   For our purposes, it suffices to say that the determination of whether the alleged nondisclosures in this case provide a legally sufficient basis for the plaintiffs' claims cannot be severed from consideration of the basic policies underlying the disclosure obligations of the applicable statutes and regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that we cannot say that DEC was not required to disclose material information concerning its performance in the quarter in progress at the time of the March 21, 1994 public offering.   Nor can we conclude, as a matter of law and on these pleadings, that DEC was not in possession of such material nonpublic information at the time of the offering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Insider Trading Analogy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In understanding the nature of the disclosure requirements attending a public offering of stock, it is helpful to conceptualize DEC (the corporate issuer) as an individual insider transacting in the company's securities, and to examine the disclosure obligations that would then arise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that an individual corporate insider in possession of material nonpublic information is prohibited by the federal securities laws from trading on that information unless he makes public disclosure.   He must disclose or abstain from trading.   See SEC v.

A central justification for the \"disclose or abstain\" rule is to deny corporate insiders the opportunity to profit from the inherent trading advantage they have over the rest of the contemporaneously trading market by reason of their superior access to information.   See Shapiro v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318483\"><a href=\"/opinion/318483/fed-sec-l-rep-p-94473-maurice-shapiro-v-merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 235 (2d Cir.1974);  SEC v.

Clark, Corporate Law &#167; 8.2, at 273-75 (1986);  Frank H. Easterbrook &amp; Daniel R. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 288 (1991) (\"The lure of trading profits may induce people to spend a lot of effort and other resources 'beating the market';  ...

Courts, including this one, have treated a corporation trading in its own securities as an \"insider\" for purposes of the \"disclose or abstain\" rule.   See, e.g., McCormick v.

See, e.g., Rogen, 361 F.2d at 268.   By extension, a comparable rule should apply to issuers engaged in a stock offering.   Otherwise, a corporate issuer selling its own securities would be left free to exploit its informational trading advantage, at the expense of investors, by delaying disclosure of material nonpublic negative news until after completion of the offering.   Cf. Ian Ayres, Back to Basics:  Regulating How Corporations Speak to the Market, 77 Va.L.Rev. 945, 959-60 (1991) (describing the argument that securities laws impose needed discipline, because companies do not always internalize the costs of failing to provide the market with accurate information that would lower stock prices).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analogizing a corporate issuer to an individual insider subject to the \"disclose or abstain\" rule of insider trading law illustrates the policy reasons supporting a comparably strong disclosure mechanism in the context of a public offering.   We look to the explicit statutory and regulatory framework to determine whether the Securities Act provides such a mechanism, and whether the Wilensky complaint states a legally cognizable claim for nondisclosure under Section 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 11 by its terms provides for the imposition of liability if a registration statement, as of its effective date:  (1) \"contained an untrue statement of material fact\";  (2) \"omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein\";  or (3) omitted to state a material fact \"necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 77k(a).   The plaintiffs' claim of nondisclosure relies on the second of these three bases of liability.   That predicate is unique to Section 11;  neither Section 12(2) of the Securities Act nor Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act contains comparable language.   It is intended to ensure that issuers, under pain of civil liability, not cut corners in preparing registration statements and that they disclose all material information required by the applicable statutes and regulations.   See Huddleston, 459 U.S. at 381-82, 103 S.Ct. at 686-87;  Harold S. Bloomenthal et al., Securities Law Handbook &#167; 14.08, at 663 (1996 ed.)  (\"Congress ... devised Section 11 of the Securities Act as an in terrorem remedy that would ... encourage careful preparation of the registration statement and prospectus.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The information \"required to be stated\" in a registration statement is spelled out both in Schedule A to Section 7(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 77g(a), 77aa, and in various regulations promulgated by the SEC pursuant to its statutory authority.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Those rules and regulations are no less essential to the statutory scheme than the general outlines of the statute itself.

Item 11(a) of the instructions to Form S-3<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> requires that the issuer (registrant) describe in the portion of the registration statement comprising the prospectus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>any and all material changes in the registrant's affairs which have occurred since the end of the latest fiscal year for which certified financial statements were included in the latest annual report to security holders and which have not been described in a report on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed under the Exchange Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instructions to Form S-3, Item 11(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand the scope of the \"material changes\" disclosure requirement, it is helpful to understand the nature of Form S-3.   Form S-3 is a streamlined registration form available only to certain well-capitalized and widely followed issuers about which a significant amount of public information is already available.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  A registrant on Form S-3 accomplishes disclosure in part by incorporating in the prospectus by reference its most recent Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q filed pursuant to the Exchange Act.   See Instructions to Form S-3, Item 12(a).   Unlike registrants on more broadly available forms (such as S-1), a Form S-3 registrant is not required separately to furnish in the prospectus the information required by Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a) (\"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> because that information is presumed to be contained in the Exchange Act filings that Form S-3 incorporates by reference, which are themselves subject to the requirements of Regulation S-K.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The primary purpose of the \"material changes\" disclosure requirement of Item 11(a), then, is to ensure that the prospectus provides investors with an update of the information required to be disclosed in the incorporated Exchange Act filings, including the information provided in those filings concerning \"known trends and uncertainties\" with respect to \"net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.\"  17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a)(3)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the date of the final prospectus for the March 1994 offering and the effective date of the registration statement was March 21, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Prior to that date, the end of DEC's latest fiscal year was July 3, 1993 (fiscal year 1993), and the last Form 10-Q filed by the company was for the quarter that had ended on January 1, 1994 (DEC's second fiscal quarter).   The question, then, is whether the complaint contains sufficient allegations that defendants failed to disclose in the registration statement any information regarding \"material changes\" in DEC's \"affairs\" as of March 21, 1994, that had occurred since July 3, 1993 and had not been reported in the Form 10-Q filed for the second quarter of fiscal year 1994.   If the Wilensky complaint adequately so alleges, then the complaint sets forth a cognizable claim of nondisclosure under Section 11, namely, that defendants failed to include in the registration statement information \"required to be stated therein.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Alleged Nondisclosures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that defendants failed to comply with Item 11(a) by omitting three categories of information from the registration statement and prospectus.   First, plaintiffs contend that defendants failed to disclose that DEC had embarked on a risky marketing strategy that involved slashing prices and sacrificing profit margins in the hopes of increasing \"market penetration\" of the company's Alpha chip products.   Second, plaintiffs assert that defendants failed to disclose that under the company's compensation scheme, its sales representatives were being paid \"double commissions,\" again to the detriment of the company's profit margins.   Third, and most centrally, plaintiffs allege that, by the date of the March 21 offering, defendants were in possession of, yet failed to disclose, material knowledge of facts indicating that the third fiscal quarter would be an unexpectedly disastrous one.   We dispose of the first two claims of nondisclosure, and then focus our discussion on the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

Plaintiffs complain, rather, that DEC failed to tell the market that the commission-based compensation scheme, instead of boosting sales as it was supposed to do, was contributing to the company's losses.   This argument is problematic.   As the complaint itself acknowledges, DEC publicly announced the switch from a salary-based compensation scheme to the incentive-based model that produced the double commissions.   Furthermore, according to the complaint, the switch was made not during the third fiscal quarter of 1994, but some two years earlier, in 1992.   The plaintiffs do not allege that any material changes to the compensation scheme were implemented after that time.   Whatever the bearing of DEC's incentive-based compensation scheme on the company's expenses in relation to its revenues, the investing public had at least a year's worth of hard financial data (through the second quarter of fiscal 1994) to evaluate whether the commission system was working to increase gross margins,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> or instead, as plaintiffs allege, to shrink them.   Plaintiffs do not allege that there were any material changes in the payment of commissions between the time of the March public offering and the last prior Form 10-Q filed by the company (for the second fiscal quarter of 1994), and so on their own theory the claim that DEC failed to disclose the payment of \"double commissions\" amounts to naught.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

In evaluating this claim, we accept arguendo the complaint's allegations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> that DEC had in its possession as of the March 21 offering date nonpublic information concerning the company's ongoing quarter-to-date performance, indicating that the company would suffer unexpectedly large losses for that quarter.   We ask, then, whether there was a duty to disclose such information in the registration statement and prospectus under the rubric of \"material changes\" under Item 11(a) of Form S-3.   We focus upon the defendants' primary legal arguments on this point:  that DEC was under no duty to disclose \"intra-quarterly\" results or any other information concerning its third quarter performance until after the quarter ended;  and that defendants had no duty as of March 21, 1994 to disclose any internal projections or predictions concerning the expected outcome of the quarter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A central goal underlying the disclosure provisions of the securities laws is to promote fairness and efficiency in the securities markets.

The availability of reliable firm-specific information is also essential to the market's ability to align stock price with a security's \"fundamental value.\"   See Marcel Kahan, Securities Laws and the Social Costs of \"Inaccurate\" Stock Prices, 41 Duke L.J. 977, 988-89 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for issuers to disclose material information is crucial in the context of a public offering, where investors typically must rely (unless the offering is \"at the market\") on an offering price determined by the issuer and/or the underwriters of the offering.   See Kahan, supra, at 1014-15 (explaining the heightened need to target disclosure requirements to companies engaged in public offerings).   Accordingly, the disclosure requirements associated with a stock offering are more stringent than, for example, the regular periodic disclosures called for in the company's annual Form 10-K or quarterly Form 10-Q filings under the Exchange Act.   See id. at 1014-15 &amp; n. 163.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for complete and prompt disclosure is particularly keen when a corporation issues stock pursuant to a \"shelf registration\" under SEC Rule 415(a), as DEC did in its public offering of March 1994.   See 17 C.F.R. &#167; 230.415(a) (permitting registration of securities to be issued on a \"continuous\" or \"delayed\" basis).   The shelf registration rule permits a company to file a single registration statement covering a certain quantity of securities (register securities \"for the shelf\"), and then over a period of up to two years,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> with the appropriate updates of information,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> issue installments of securities under that registration statement (take the securities \"down from the shelf\") almost instantly, in amounts and at times the company and its underwriters deem most propitious.   See Clark, supra, at 751 (explaining that the shelf registration process enables firms to pinpoint the timing of offerings to the issuer's advantage);  see generally Jeffrey N. Gordon &amp; Lewis A. Kornhauser, Efficient Markets, Costly Information, and Securities Research, 60 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 761, 819-20 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The social benefit of the shelf registration rule is that it can enable an issuer to decrease its costs of raising capital.   See Clark, supra, at 751.   The concomitant risk is that, by permitting securities to be offered on a \"delayed\" basis, the rule may adversely affect the quality and timeliness of the disclosures made in connection with the actual issuance of securities.   See Shelf Registration, SEC Release Nos. 33-6499, 34-20384, 35-23122, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35832</span></span> (SEC), * 2 (\"Shelf Reg.Rel.\");  see also I Loss &amp; Seligman, supra, at 355 (\"The rationale for limiting the time during which registered securities may be sold is that investors need current information when considering an offering.   To permit 'registration for the shelf' runs the risk that investors subsequently will be offered securities on the basis of outdated or stale information.\").   In response to these concerns, the SEC, in adopting Rule 415 in its current form, assured that \"[p]ost-effective amendments [to the initial registration statement] and prospectus supplements [would] serve to ensure that investors are provided with complete, accurate and current information at the time of the offering or sale of securities.\"   Shelf Reg.Rel., supra, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35832</span></span> (SEC), * 9.   The SEC explained that registrants would not be permitted \"to use the shelf registration rule as a basis for omitting required information from their registration statements when they become effective.\"   Id., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35832</span></span> (SEC), * 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on concerns about Rule 415's effect on the adequacy and timeliness of disclosure, the SEC chose to limit the availability of the rule, in the context of primary stock offerings, to the widely-followed companies (like DEC) that are eligible to register securities on SEC Form S-3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  See 17 C.F.R. &#167; 230.415(a)(1)(x);  Shelf Reg.Rel., supra, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35832</span></span> (SEC) at * 5;  I Loss &amp; Seligman, supra, at 361 &amp; n. 90.   The theory was that the concerns about adequacy of disclosure were less prominent in the case of \"S-3\" registrants, because those companies are precisely the ones that in the ordinary course of their businesses \"provide a steady stream of high quality corporate information to the marketplace and whose corporate information is broadly disseminated[ ] ... and is constantly digested and synthesized by financial analysts.\"   Shelf Reg.Rel., supra, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35832</span></span> (SEC), * 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert here that the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act and regulations, including Item 11(a) of Form S-3, should be interpreted so that they would never mandate the provision of current information about a company's performance in the quarter in progress at the time of a public offering, so long as the company satisfies its quarterly and annual periodic disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act.   That argument cuts severely against the very reason the shelf registration rule was made available to issuers like DEC:  that \"S-3\" companies would provide the market with a continuous stream of high quality corporate information.   The rule permits offerings to be made on a \"continuous\" or \"delayed\" basis because it envisions \"continuous\" disclosure.   It would be inconsistent with this rationale to permit an issuer to take refuge in its periodically-filed Forms 10-Q or 10-K to avoid the obligation to disclose current material facts in its shelf offering prospectus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent some mechanism requiring a registrant to disclose internally known, material nonpublic information pertaining to a quarter in progress, the shelf registration procedure, by enabling the issuer to pinpoint the timing of its offering, would give a company anticipating a negative earnings announcement the ability to time its offerings of securities from the shelf to be completed prior to the public release of the known negative news.   This would allow companies to exploit what amounts to a naked informational trading advantage.   Cf. Gordon &amp; Kornhauser, supra, at 819-20.   Item 11(a) of Form S-3, by requiring the issuer to disclose current information concerning \"material changes\" from previously reported data, provides a mechanism--comparable in effect to the \"disclose or abstain\" rule governing insider trading--to prevent such strategic behavior.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these concerns, DEC argues that the plaintiffs' claims of nondisclosure are without merit, because they seek to impose liability upon DEC for a failure to disclose its internal projections about the outcome of the third quarter of fiscal 1994.   The federal securities laws impose no obligation upon an issuer to disclose forward-looking information such as internal projections, estimates of future performance, forecasts, budgets, and similar data.   See, e.g., In re VeriFone Sec. Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658615\"><a href=\"/opinion/658615/in-re-verifone-securities-litigation-martin-halkin-michael-minichino-lois/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>, 869 (9th Cir.1993);  In re Convergent Technologies Sec. Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571326\"><a href=\"/opinion/571326/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96211-in-re-convergent-technologies-securities/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 516 (9th Cir.1991).   Plaintiffs, however, insist that their Section 11 claim is concerned not with the nondisclosure of projections, but of current information that DEC allegedly had in its possession as of March 21, 1994 about \"losses\" the company was incurring in the ongoing quarter.   Defendants respond, in turn, that under a system of quarterly reporting, \"losses\" cannot be realized until a quarter has ended, and that because the quarter in question did not end until April 2, 1994, whatever information DEC had as of March 21 concerning that quarter necessarily must have been forward-looking, in the nature of a projection or forecast, which it had no obligation to disclose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEC's argument elevates form over substance.   DEC's assertion that companies do not realize \"losses\" as such until a quarter has ended is, of course, largely unexceptionable.   But it does not follow that DEC's only information concerning the ongoing quarter as of March 21 must have been forward-looking.   That contention relies on two faulty components.   First, it assumes that plaintiffs could not adduce adequate evidence that defendants were actually in possession of material information about the ongoing quarter at the relevant time.   Second, it assumes that the potential unreliability of inferences that could be drawn from current information about operating results as of eleven days before the end of a quarter absolutely protects that information from mandatory disclosure.   The first premise is inconsistent with the standards governing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.   The second confuses the issue of materiality with the duty to disclose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants posit, in essence, that there can never be a duty to disclose internally known, pre-end-of-quarter financial information, because any inferences about the quarter that might be drawn from such information could be rendered unreliable by later developments in the same quarter, such as a sudden surge of profitable sales.   This position does not withstand scrutiny.   Present, known information that strongly implies an important future outcome is not immune from mandatory disclosure merely because it does not foreordain any particular outcome.   The question whether such present information must be disclosed (assuming the existence of a duty), poses a classic materiality issue:  given that at any point in a quarter, the remainder of the period may not mirror the quarter-to-date, is there a sufficient probability that unexpectedly disastrous quarter-to-date performance will carry forward to the end of the quarter, such that a reasonable investor would likely consider the interim performance important to the overall mix of information available?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As desirable as bright-line rules may be, this question cannot be answered by reference to such a rule.   To try to do so would be contrary to Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112022\"><a href=\"/opinion/112022/basic-inc-v-levinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112022\"><a href=\"/opinion/112022/basic-inc-v-levinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span> (1988).   The Supreme Court there refused to adopt a bright-line approach to determine at what stage preliminary merger discussions create a sufficient probability of actual consummation to become material.   See id. at 237-39, 108 S.Ct. at 986-88 (rejecting \"agreement-in-principle\" test).   So here.   We decline to adopt, as defendants would have us do, a hard and fast rule that current information concerning a company's operating experience is never subject to disclosure until after the end of the quarter to which the information pertains.   Rather, the question is whether the nondisclosure of interim facts rendered the prospectus materially incomplete.   An issuer's compliance with the periodic disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act does not per se preclude such undisclosed facts from being material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, we reject any bright-line rule that an issuer engaging in a public offering is obligated to disclose interim operating results for the quarter in progress whenever it perceives a possibility that the quarter's results may disappoint the market.   Far from it.   Reasonable investors understand that businesses fluctuate, and that past success is not a guarantee of more of the same.   There is always some risk that the quarter in progress at the time of an investment will turn out for the issuer to be worse than anticipated.   The market takes this risk of variability into account in evaluating the company's prospects based on the available facts concerning the issuer's past historical performance, its current financial condition, present trends and future uncertainties.   But, strong-form efficient market theories aside, the ability of market observers to evaluate a company depends upon the information publicly available to them.   If, as plaintiffs allege here, the issuer is in possession of nonpublic information indicating that the quarter in progress at the time of the public offering will be an extreme departure from the range of results which could be anticipated based on currently available information, it is consistent with the basic statutory policies favoring disclosure to require inclusion of that information in the registration statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to imply, however, that nondisclosure claims similar to those asserted by plaintiffs here can never be disposed of as a matter of law.   In many circumstances, the relationship between the nonpublic information that plaintiffs claim should have been disclosed and the actual results or events that the undisclosed information supposedly would have presaged will be so attenuated that the undisclosed information may be deemed immaterial as a matter of law.   Cf. VeriFone, 11 F.3d at 867-70 (affirming dismissal of claim that registration statement allegedly failed to disclose information concerning development that came to light six months later);  Krim v.

In such circumstances, where the allegedly undisclosed information is sufficiently remote in time or causation from the ultimate events of which it purportedly forewarned, the plaintiff's claim of nondisclosure may be indistinguishable from a claim that the issuer should have divulged its internal predictions about what would come of the undisclosed information.   Cf. VeriFone, 11 F.3d at 869 (characterizing plaintiffs' claims of nondisclosure of \"adverse material facts and trends\" as of March 13 as claims that defendants failed to disclose forecasts of news actually released to public on September 17).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the prospectus in question was filed 11 days prior to the end of the quarter in progress.   The results for that quarter turned out to be, by all accounts, the product of more than a minor business fluctuation.   Accepting, as we must, the plaintiffs' allegation that DEC, by March 21, 1994, was in possession of information about the company's quarter-to-date performance (e.g., operating results) indicating some substantial likelihood that the quarter would turn out to be an extreme departure from publicly known trends and uncertainties, we cannot conclude as a matter of law and at this early stage of the litigation that such information was not subject to mandatory disclosure under the rubric of \"material changes\" in Item 11(a) of Form S-3.   We conclude, accordingly, that the Wilensky plaintiffs' complaint as to this theory states a legally cognizable claim under Section 11 of the Securities Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>B.

They contend that the statement of DEC's \"belie[f]\" as to the \"adequacy\" of the then-remaining $443 million restructuring reserve \"to cover presently planned restructuring actions\" was false and misleading, in light of information contemporaneously known to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"restructuring reserve\" referred to in the prospectus supplement originated as a $1.5 billion charge taken by DEC at the close of its fiscal year 1992 (ended June 27, 1992) as part of the company's ongoing efforts to streamline the company \"to achieve a competitive cost structure.\"   The reserve was intended to cover the anticipated costs of employee separations, facilities consolidations, asset retirements, relocations, and related expenses.   The company had absorbed similar restructuring charges of $1.1 billion and $550 million in fiscal years 1991 and 1990, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During fiscal year 1993, DEC took a number of actions consistent with the $1.5 billion dollar reserve recorded at the end of fiscal year 1992.   By the end of the fiscal year (July 3, 1993), the remaining reserve was reported to be approximately $739 million.   During the first two quarters of the next fiscal year, the company continued to draw from the reserve, so that by the end of the second quarter (January 1, 1994), the reserve stood at approximately $443 million.   In its Form 10-Q for that quarter, dated February 4, 1994 (and incorporated by reference into the registration statement and prospectus at issue here), DEC stated its belief that the $443 million reserve was \"adequate\" to cover restructuring activities planned at that time.   This statement was repeated in the prospectus supplement dated March 21, 1994.   The full statement, with its immediately surrounding context, was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>While spending for R &amp; E [research &amp; engineering] and SG &amp; A [selling, general &amp; administrative] is declining, the Corporation believes its cost and expense levels are still too high for the level and mix of total operating revenues.   The Corporation is reducing expenses by streamlining its product offerings and selling and administrative practices, resulting in reductions in employee population, closing and consolidation of facilities and reductions in discretionary spending.   The Corporation believes that the remaining restructuring reserve of $443 million is adequate to cover presently planned restructuring actions.

In short, if a statement is couched in or accompanied by prominent cautionary language that clearly disclaims or discounts the drawing of a particular inference, any claim that the statement was materially misleading because it gave rise to that very inference may fail as a matter of law.  In re Trump, 7 F.3d at 364.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the bespeaks caution doctrine does not preclude a claim that the reserve \"adequacy\" statement was materially misleading.   The \"adequacy\" statement has both a forward-looking aspect and an aspect that encompasses a representation of present fact.   In its forward-looking aspect, the statement suggests that DEC would take no further restructuring charges in the near-term future.   In its present-oriented aspect, it represents that as of March 21, 1994, DEC had no current intent to undertake activities that would require any such further restructuring charges to be taken.   To the extent that plaintiffs allege that the reserve \"adequacy\" statement encompasses the latter representation of present fact, and that such a representation was false or misleading when made, the surrounding cautionary language could not have rendered the statement immaterial as a matter of law.   See Harden, 65 F.3d at 1405-06 (explaining that the bespeaks caution doctrine cannot render misrepresentations of \"hard\" fact nonactionable).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, to the extent that plaintiffs allege that the \"adequacy\" statement implies a hiatus on new restructuring charges for the near future, we do not think that the surrounding context warns against such an implication with sufficient clarity to be thought to bespeak caution.   See Fecht v.

The prospectus supplement does state that DEC will \"continue to take actions,\" but it is at best ambiguous whether those \"actions\" refer to any restructuring activities other than those \"presently planned.\"   Thus, one might easily interpret the purportedly cautionary statement, especially in light of the \"adequacy\" characterization, to mean that the company's ongoing \"actions\" will continue to be covered by the existing restructuring reserve.   If it was true, as plaintiffs allege, that defendants knew as of March 21, 1994 that DEC's performance in the third quarter would precipitate actions on a scale and schedule that would necessitate the taking of additional restructuring charges, the \"adequacy\" statement may well have been materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot conclude, as a matter of law and on these pleadings, that the actionability of the \"reserve adequacy\" statement is precluded by a context that bespeaks caution.   The cautionary statements to which defendants point did not provide an unambiguous warning of the possibility that DEC might take additional restructuring charges in the near future--as it turned out, a charge of $1.2 billion in the fiscal year then in progress.

Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs' allegations pertaining to the prospectus supplement's description of the restructuring reserve as \"adequate\" fail to state a claim under Sections 11 and 12(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>C.

Although the \"purchasing from\" language in the statute literally appears to contemplate a relationship between defendant and plaintiff \"not unlike traditional contractual privity,\" Pinter, 486 U.S. at 642, 108 S.Ct. at 2076, the Pinter Court held that Section 12 liability is not limited to those who actually pass title to the suing purchaser.   See id. at 645, 108 S.Ct. at 2077-78.   This is so because even \"[i]n common parlance,\" a person may \"offer or sell\" property without actually passing title.  Id. at 642, 108 S.Ct. at 2076.   For example, a broker or agent who solicits a purchase \"would commonly be said ... to be among those 'from' whom the buyer 'purchased,' even though the agent himself did not pass title.\"   Id. at 644, 108 S.Ct. at 2077.   Furthermore, because \"solicitation is the stage at which an investor is most likely to be injured,\" id. at 646, 108 S.Ct. at 2078, the Court found it consistent with the policies of the statute to permit imposition of liability on a non-owner of securities who \"successfully solicits\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> the plaintiff's purchase of the securities, provided that the solicitor is \"motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or those of the securities owner.\"   Id. at 647, 108 S.Ct. at 2078.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pinter Court limited its holding in ways that govern the result here.

Second, the Court stated that proof the defendant caused a plaintiff's purchase of a security is not enough to establish that the defendant \"solicited\" the sale for Section 12 purposes.   See id. at 651, 108 S.Ct. at 2080-81 (explaining that \"[t]he 'purchase from' requirement of &#167; 12 focuses on the defendant's relationship with the plaintiff-purchaser\" and rejecting use of a test under which defendant could qualify as a seller if he was a \"substantial factor\" in causing the transaction to take place).   Finally, the Court indicated that a person's \"remote\" involvement in a sales transaction or his mere \"participat[ion] in soliciting the purchase\" does not subject him to Section 12 liability.   See id. at 651 n. 27, 108 S.Ct. at 2081.

The March 1994 public offering was made pursuant to a \"firm commitment\" underwriting, as disclosed in the registration statement and prospectus supplement.   The plaintiffs do not contend otherwise.   In a firm commitment underwriting, the issuer of the securities sells all of the shares to be offered to one or more underwriters, at some discount from the offering price.   Investors thus purchase shares in the offering directly from the underwriters (or broker-dealers who purchase from the underwriters), not directly from the issuer.   In fact, the March 21, 1994 prospectus supplement represented that \"[DEC] has agreed not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer or enter into any agreement to offer or sell, shares of [the offered stock].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the issuer in a firm commitment underwriting does not pass title to the securities, DEC and its officers cannot be held liable as \"sellers\" under Section 12(2) unless they actively \"solicited\" the plaintiffs' purchase of securities to further their own financial motives, in the manner of a broker or vendor's agent.   See Pinter 486 U.S. at 644-47, 108 S.Ct. at 2076-79.   Absent such solicitation, DEC can be viewed as no more than a \"seller's seller,\" whom plaintiffs would have no right to sue under Section 12(2).

See Pinter, 486 U.S. at 651 &amp; n. 27, 108 S.Ct. at 2081 &amp; n. 27;  Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 286.   Although the complaint also contains a conclusory allegation that each defendant \"solicited and/or was a substantial factor in the purchase by plaintiffs\" of securities in the offering, the Supreme Court specifically rejected a proposed test under which a defendant's being a \"substantial factor\" in bringing about a sale could establish statutory seller status.   See Pinter, 486 U.S. at 651, 108 S.Ct. at 2080-81.   Furthermore, the term \"solicitation\" is a legal term of art in this context.   In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must take all well-pleaded facts as true, but it need not credit a complaint's \"bald assertions\" or legal conclusions.

See Basic, 485 U.S. at 236, 108 S.Ct. at 986;  Lucia, 36 F.3d at 176.   But not every unfulfilled expression of corporate optimism, even if characterized as misstatement, can give rise to a genuine issue of materiality under the securities laws.   See Lucia, 36 F.3d at 176 (leaving open possibility that some materiality determinations may be made as a matter of law).   In particular, courts have demonstrated a willingness to find immaterial as a matter of law a certain kind of rosy affirmation commonly heard from corporate managers and numbingly familiar to the marketplace--loosely optimistic statements that are so vague, so lacking in specificity, or so clearly constituting the opinions of the speaker, that no reasonable investor could find them important to the total mix of information available.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  See, e.g., San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 807, 811 (holding not actionable statement that the company \"expect[ed] ... another year of strong growth in earnings per share\");  Hillson Partners Ltd.

In such cases, the statements identified by plaintiffs as actionably misleading are alleged to have caused injury, if at all, not through the plaintiffs' direct reliance upon them, but by dint of the statements' inflating effect on the market price of the security purchased.   See Basic, 485 U.S. at 241-47, 108 S.Ct. at 988-92;  Rand v. Cullinet Software, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></span>, 205 (D.Mass.1994).   When the truth is disclosed and the market self-corrects, investors who bought at the inflated price suffer losses.   Those losses can be deemed to have been caused by the defendants' statements, even absent direct reliance by plaintiffs, because the statements were presumptively absorbed into and reflected by the security's price.   See Basic, 485 U.S. at 243-44, 108 S.Ct. at 989-90 (quoting In re LTV, 88 F.R.D. at 143).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This presumption of investor reliance on the integrity of stock prices has the primary effect of obviating the need for plaintiff purchasers to plead individual reliance.   But by its underlying rationale, the presumption also shifts the critical focus of the materiality inquiry.   In a fraud-on-the-market case the hypothetical \"reasonable investor,\" by reference to whom materiality is gauged, must be \"the market\" itself, because it is the market, not any single investor, that determines the price of a publicly traded security.

Steul was quoted as saying that the company's transition to selling its Alpha chip products was \"going reasonably well\" and that the company \"should show progress quarter over quarter, year over year.\"   We hold to be similarly not actionable (because patently immaterial) Steul's comment of January 19, 1994 that the company was \"basically on track\";  his comment of January 20, 1994 that \"DEC was a very healthy company\";  defendant Robert Palmer's statement of the same date that he was \"confident that DEC was pursuing the right strategy\";  and the February 8, 1994 statement by DEC's head of European operations (not a defendant here) that he was \"pretty optimistic\" that the company would \"be able to stabilize [its] revenue\" in the first half of calendar year 1994 and \"start to grow revenue\" in the second half.

The statements cannot accurately be described as the kind of diffuse expressions of opinion or optimism that can be deemed, by their nature, obviously immaterial as a matter of law.   Rather, they appear, in isolation, to be statements quantifying the company's current operating inflows as more or less approximating outflows, thus inviting an inference that the end results for the third quarter might turn out likewise.   The rub, however, is the context surrounding the statements.

Were the rule otherwise, a plaintiff could maintain a claim of fraud by excising an isolated statement from a document and importing it into the complaint, even though the surrounding context imparts a plainly non-fraudulent meaning to the allegedly wrongful statement.

The article attributed the following statement to Steul:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>The $72 million loss represents only 2.2 percent of revenues, Steul said.  \"We are operating very close to break-even.

The statement cannot reasonably be understood as a material comment on the current status or anticipated results of the company's third quarter.   Since plaintiffs do not allege that the characterization of \"close to break-even\" placed an actionably fraudulent spin on DEC's second quarter results, the statement in that context can be of no moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second \"break-even\" statement appeared in a February 23, 1994 Wall Street Journal article.

Cf. Polin v.

Given the statements attributed to the internal review that \"revenue is uncertain for next two-plus quarters\";  that \"[DEC] will still be in turnaround for the next two or three quarters\";  that \"we still have a way to go\";  and given Palmer's reported refusal to make any forecast, coupled with the absence of any specifics regarding the authoritativeness or timeliness of the \"internal\" report, no reasonable investor (nor the market) could have attached importance to any forward-looking connotation of the \"break-even\" statement described in the article.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar analysis applies to the \"break-even\" statement that appeared in the March 29, 1994 issue of Financial World.   In that article, defendant Steul was quoted as saying \"We are very close to break-even.   If it hadn't been for currencies, and had we been able to ship everything ordered, we would have been in the black in the second quarter.\"   As with the Wall Street Journal piece, neither the Financial World piece itself nor the Shaw complaint specifies the date on which the statement was actually made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  But, again, Rule 9(b) issues aside, the \"break-even\" comment is most naturally understood as looking backward to the second quarter of fiscal 1994, not to the future.   Furthermore, to the extent that any other meaning could be discerned, it is directly negated by other qualifying comments attributed to Steul in the same article, including the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>What Digital needs at this point is time.

Additionally, because plaintiffs allege that a fraud on the market was committed by statements communicated in this financial analyst's article, it is only fair to note that the tenor of the article is one of skepticism about DEC's future prospects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  On the facts as alleged, the district court did not err in concluding that the \"break-even\" statement in the Financial World piece was immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p>C.

These alleged misstatements and omissions are identical to those that underlie the Wilensky plaintiffs' claims under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act.   We conclude that the Shaw plaintiffs may pursue their Section 10(b) claim based on these alleged defects in the registration statement and prospectus.   Because we hold that the Shaw complaint survives Rule 12(b)(6) only to that extent, we also conclude that the putative class on whose behalf the Shaw complaint was brought must be narrowed accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Material omissions and misleading statements in a registration statement and prospectus are, in addition to being actionable under the Securities Act by purchasers in the offering, also actionable under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by contemporaneous purchasers in the aftermarket, provided, of course, that the additional elements of liability (scienter and reliance) are established.

In the context of a fraud-on-the-market claim, this principle has a simple rationale.   The registration statement and prospectus speak not only to those who purchase in the offering, but to the entire market.   If an issuer's registration statement contains a misleading statement of fact about the company's financial condition or omits material information required to be disclosed, the impact of such statements or omissions, to the extent material, would not necessarily be limited to the securities covered by the registration statement.   There is no logical reason that a registration statement and prospectus could not serve as a vehicle for an alleged fraud on the market, affecting all of the company's securities.   Thus, even though the Shaw plaintiffs purchased shares of DEC common stock in the aftermarket, not shares of preferred stock in the offering, their fraud-on-the-market claims may properly encompass any material misstatements or omissions in the registration statement.

The Shaw plaintiffs allege that they were injured when they purchased DEC common stock at prices that were inflated as a result of misleading statements and omissions by DEC and the individual defendants.   The named plaintiffs purport to represent a class of persons who purchased DEC stock between January 19 and April 15, 1994.   However, because the only allegations in the Shaw complaint that state a claim are those that depend upon the purported misstatements and omissions in the registration statement as of its effective date--March 21, 1994--it follows that only those who purchased their shares on or after March 21, 1994 (and before April 15, 1994, when disclosure occurred) could have suffered cognizable injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the four plaintiffs named in the Shaw complaint, only Gary Phillips is alleged to have made his purchase within those two limiting dates;  thus only his claim may be reinstated.

For example, if a plaintiff were to attempt to establish violations of Sections 11 and 12(2) as well as the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act through allegations in a single complaint of a unified course of fraudulent conduct, fraud might be said to \"lie[ ] at the core of the action.\"  Hayduk v.

Although the complaint does assert that defendants actually possessed the information that they failed to disclose, those allegations cannot be thought to constitute \"averments of fraud,\" absent any claim of scienter and reliance.   Otherwise, any allegation of nondisclosure of material information would be transformed into a claim of fraud for purposes of Rule 9(b).

We limit our analysis to those allegations in the Shaw complaint that state a cognizable claim for securities fraud.   The issue is thus whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded that defendants knew facts as of March 21, 1994 that indicated the third quarter was going to turn out as it did, and that the company would soon thereafter announce further restructuring actions necessitating an additional restructuring charge for the fiscal year.   Although the question is close, we think that the complaint survives Rule 9(b) scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has been \"especially rigorous\" in applying Rule 9(b) in securities fraud actions \"to minimize the chance 'that a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim will bring a suit and conduct extensive discovery in the hopes of obtaining an increased settlement, rather than in the hopes that the process will reveal relevant evidence.' \"  Romani, 929 F.2d at 878 (quoting New England Data Servs., Inc. v.

The plaintiffs provide a series of factual allegations relating to a combination of developments known to the company (e.g., failing product pricing strategies, market resistance to new products, wayward compensation policies, failure to implement downsizing plans) that could have provided a basis for advance knowledge of the information disclosed on April 15, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a>  These factual allegations, together with other aspects of the complaint discussed below, provide a basis for a reasonable inference that defendants knew facts by March 21 indicating that the third fiscal quarter would be disastrous, and that accelerated restructuring efforts requiring a further restructuring charge were likely to follow.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  Cf. Serabian, 24 F.3d at 365;  In re Wells Fargo, 12 F.3d at 931.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In additional support of their allegations of defendants' knowledge, plaintiffs assert that two insiders of the company, neither of whom is a defendant here, sold DEC stockholdings during the third fiscal quarter.   One, the company's treasurer, sold 1,625 shares (68% of the officer's total holdings) on February 11, 1994.   The other, the general manager and vice president of the company's personal computer business, sold 2,000 shares (20% of his position) on March 22, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the mere fact that insider stock sales occurred does not suffice to establish scienter.   See Tapogna v. Egan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></span>, 373 (D.Mass.1992).   However, allegations of \"insider trading in suspicious amounts or at suspicious times\" may permit an inference that the trader--and by further inference, the company--possessed material nonpublic information at the time.   See Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 26 (citing In re Apple Computer, 886 F.2d at 1117);  see also Rubinstein, 20 F.3d at 169-70 (characterizing sufficiently suspicious trading as \"presumptively probative of bad faith and scienter\").   Here, the level of suspicion warranted by the alleged insider stock sales is marginal:  the first sale occurred more than a month prior to the date of concern here (March 21, 1994);  and the second sale, though made at what might be considered a \"suspicious\" time, involved a small (albeit not insignificant) percentage of the insider's total holdings of DEC stock.   Nonetheless, we think that the plaintiffs' allegations of insider trading, inasmuch as they are at least consistent with their theory of fraud, provide some support against the defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in testing the allegations of the complaint against Rule 9(b), we need not turn a blind eye to the obvious:  the proximity of the date of the allegedly fraudulent statements and omissions to both the end of the quarter then in progress and the date on which disclosure was eventually made. While the short time frame between an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and a later disclosure of inconsistent information does not, standing alone, provide a sufficient factual grounding to satisfy Rule 9(b), see Arazie, 2 F.3d at 1467-68, there is nothing in Rule 9(b) that precludes consideration of such temporal proximity as a circumstance potentially bolstering the complaint's claims of fraud.   See Fecht, 70 F.3d at 1083-84.   On the facts as alleged in this case, we think that the proximity of the date of the allegedly misleading statements and omissions to the end of the ongoing quarter (and the date of eventual disclosure) provides some circumstantial factual support to be taken into account in determining whether the complaint pleads an adequate basis for inferring defendants' culpable knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no intention here of diluting the stringent mandate of Rule 9(b).   But in determining the adequacy of a complaint under that rule, we cannot hold plaintiffs to a standard that would effectively require them, pre-discovery, to plead evidence.   Rule 9(b) proscribes the pleading of \"fraud by hindsight,\" Denny, 576 F.2d at 470, but neither can plaintiffs be expected to plead fraud with complete insight.   We conclude that the portions of the Shaw complaint that survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny also satisfy the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred in dismissing the Wilensky and Shaw complaints in their entirety.   Portions of both complaints survive Rule 12(b)(6), but only to the extent that they allege:  (i) that the registration statement filed in connection with the public offering of March 21, 1994, failed to disclose material information in DEC's possession as of that date that would have alerted the market to the likelihood of disastrous quarterly results;  and (ii) that the statement in the prospectus supplement as to the \"adequacy\" of the restructuring reserve remaining as of March 21, 1994 was materially false or misleading.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  We hold, however, that the Wilensky complaint fails to state a claim under Section 12(2) of the Securities Act as to DEC and the individual defendants.   Furthermore, in light of the limited basis on which we permit the Shaw action to go forward, only the claims of the single named plaintiff who purchased DEC shares after March 21, 1994 may be reinstated, and the allegations in the Shaw complaint pertaining to the scope of the putative plaintiff class must be modified accordingly.   Finally, the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) do not apply to the Wilensky complaint as currently pleaded, and the surviving portion of the Shaw complaint does satisfy Rule 9(b).   On remand, the district court may choose to require the plaintiffs to amend their complaints in accordance with these conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, we note that although the issues of materiality and knowledge raised by the two complaints preclude terminating this litigation on the pleadings, nothing we say here is intended to foreclose the possibility that those and other issues, after discovery and an opportunity for factual development, might be susceptible to resolution on motions for summary judgment.   To borrow wise words from one of our prior decisions:  \"Despite our conclusion that certain allegations survive threshold consideration, we note that plaintiffs remain a great distance from actually proving\" any violations of the federal securities laws.

Plaintiffs point to a statement by Steul in October of 1993 that the company's continuing restructuring actions over the fiscal year \"will probably be smaller than the last four quarters\";  a September 1993 statement that \"[s]ervice revenues have continued to grow\";  and a statement by defendant Palmer on November 4, 1993 that the prospect of turning a profit was a \"reasonable expectation\" in fiscal year 1994.   Whatever the circumstances in which a company might be subject to a duty to \"update\" information previously disclosed, we do not think that the pre-Class Period statements identified by plaintiffs are of the kind that could trigger any such duty.   The alleged statement regarding \"service revenues\" constitutes a statement of historical fact not alleged to be false, and as such, does not provide the basis for a duty to update.   See Serabian, 24 F.3d at 361.   The other alleged statements are cautiously optimistic comments that would not be actionable in the first instance.   See San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 811.   They express, at most, \"only the hope of any company\" for a positive future, and \"lack the sort of definite positive projections that might require later correction.\"  In re Time Warner, Inc.

Cf. Backman, 910 F.2d at 12-13 (suggesting that SEC regulations and insider trading may create a duty to disclose under Rule 10b-5);  Roeder, 814 F.2d at 27 (same).   But cf. In re Wells Fargo, 12 F.3d at 930 n. 6 (declining to reach the issue).   A different rule would lead to the anomalous result of a Rule 10b-5 plaintiff being able to sue an individual insider selling his company's securities for the nondisclosure of material nonpublic information, but not being able to sue the issuer itself for failing to disclose the same information in connection with an offering</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> In asserting that defendants had direct knowledge of DEC's third quarter operating results as they developed, plaintiffs allege that \"[m]ore so than the management of most companies, DEC's management, including the Individual Defendants, was virtually immediately cognizant of the Company's sales information\" by virtue of the company's use of \"a highly-efficient reporting system which allows the Company to forward sales and cost information to senior management virtually as sales are made.\"   The defendants argue that these allegations should be viewed with skepticism and as the product of nothing more than \"pure speculation.\"   Speculation or not, we think that the plaintiffs' allegations of a \"highly-efficient reporting system\" may speak to the question of how defendants might have known what they allegedly knew, but absent some indication of the specific factual content of any single report generated by the alleged reporting system, do not independently provide a factual basis for inferring any such knowledge.
