The  uncontroverted\r\n\nevidence at  sentencing showed  Smith decided  where to  make\r\n\ndeposits and withdrawals  and when and how  much to withdraw.\r\n\nHe accompanied  many of  the recruits to  the banks  and took\r\n\nphysical possession  of the money.   He gave each  recruit 25\r\n\nper  cent of  the proceeds  and kept  the larger  portion for\r\n\nhimself and  his three co-conspirators.  He recruited many of\r\n\nthe  29  individuals whose  bank accounts  were used  for the\r\n\nscheme.   Thus,  Smith  exercised decision-making  authority,\r\n\nparticipated  heavily   in  the  ongoing   scheme,  recruited\r\n\naccomplices, claimed  a larger  share  of the  fruits of  the\r\n\ncrime  (for  himself  and  his  three  co-conspirators),  and\r\n\nexercised  control  and  authority over  the  recruits.

But there  is no evidence\r\n\nin the  record to  support  counsel's version  of the  facts.\r\n\nEven if this  evidence were present, the court  still did not\r\n\ncommit  clear error in concluding Smith  was an \"organizer or\r\n\nleader;\"  ample evidence existed to satisfy the other factors\r\n\nlisted in  the sentencing  guideline commentary.
