Defendant-appellant  Rigoberto Lantigua-Bonilla\r                         \r\n\nseeks return on constitutional  grounds of some $80,000 forfeited\r\n\nto  the  government  as part  of  his  plea  agreement.   Because\r\n\nappellant is a fugitive  who has failed to comply  with the terms\r\n\nof  his  sentence,  we  exercise our  discretion  to  dismiss his\r\n\nappeal.   See Ortega-Rodriguez v.

At our request following\r\n\noral argument, the government submitted affidavits  detailing the\r\n\ncircumstances of  appellant's fugitive status.   These statements\r\n\nreported  that the  Metropolitan Detention Center  (MDC) released\r\n\nappellant to  the custody  of the Immigration  and Naturalization\r\n\nService  (INS) on July 25,  1995, upon completion  of his term of\r\n\nconfinement  in the case now on appeal.  MDC officials apparently\r\n\nhad not  received notification  that sentencing of  appellant was\r\n\npending  -- scheduled  for August  31 --  in a  separate criminal\r\n\ncase.  The INS released him on August 18.\r\n\n     On August 31, 1995, after appellant failed to appear for the\r\n\nsentencing and his  attorney advised  the court that  he did  not\r\n\nknow  his   client's  whereabouts,  a  warrant   was  issued  for\r\n\nappellant's  arrest.  On May  1, 1996, the  U.S. Probation Office\r\n\nnotified the  district court that  appellant was in  violation of\r\n\nhis  supervised release  conditions in  this case,  and requested\r\n\nthat another warrant be issued for his arrest.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     This case differs somewhat from prior cases in which we have\r\n\ndismissed an  appeal based on  an appellant's escape  because, at\r\n\nthe  time of his erroneous release,  appellant already had served\r\n\nthe  full term  of imprisonment  imposed in  the case  on appeal.\r\n\nAnd, his escape before sentencing  in the separate criminal  case\r\n\ndoes not provide a basis for dismissing this appeal.  See Ortega-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodriguez, 113 S.  Ct. at 1209  (appellate sanction of  dismissal\r                   \r\n\njustified only if  there is a \"connection between  fugitivity and\r\n\nthe  appellate process\"); United States v.

He has paid  the $75, but  has not\r\n\npaid the  fine and,  as noted  above, has  not complied  with the\r\n\nsupervised  release  terms.   Appellant  thus  has \"flouted  `the\r\n\nrestraints   placed  upon  him   pursuant  to  the  conviction,'\"\r\n\nPuzzanghera,  820 F.2d at 27 (quoting Molinaro, 396 U.S. at 366),\r                                                        \r\n\nand is in our view equally \"disentitled\" to call on the resources\r\n\nof the  appeals court, id. at  26, as a defendant  who escapes to\r                                    \r\n\navoid further custody.\r\n\n     Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n",
