Boots, 80  F.3d 580, 582-83  (1st Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 417 S. Ct. 263 (1996) (\"Boots I\").\r                                                 \r\n\n          Following conviction by  the district court, Boots  and\r\n\nhis  co-defendants appealed to this  court.  We  reversed in part\r\n\nand  remanded for  resentencing.   Id. at  595.  On  November 22,\r                                                \r\n\n1996,  the  district court  sentenced  Boots  to fourteen  months\r\n\nimprisonment.  He now appeals the sentence.\r\n\n          Boots first argues that he was entitled  to a two-point\r\n\nreduction   in   his   sentencing   level   for   acceptance   of\r\n\nresponsibility.  This issue was reviewed by this court in Boots I\r                                                                           \r\n\nand,  therefore,  the ruling  in Boots  I  -- which  affirmed the\r                                                   \r\n\ndistrict court's denial of a downward departure for acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility -- is the law  of the case.  Boots  is, therefore,\r\n\nprecluded from seeking  review of the issue  unless \"the evidence\r\n\non a  subsequent trial  was substantially  different, controlling\r\n\nauthority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nsuch issues, or the decision was clearly erroneous and would work\r\n\nan injustice.\"  Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 168 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1469 (1997).\r                             \r\n\n          Boots  alleges that the  district court's  statement on\r\n\nremand that  he had been  truthful with  the court was  enough to\r\n\nallow  reconsideration of  our  earlier decision.   We  disagree.\r\n\nAlthough it is true  that the district court commented  on Boots'\r\n\ntruthfulness, this  choice of  words by the  sentencing court  is\r\n\ninsufficient to overcome  the law of  the case doctrine.   As  we\r\n\nstated in  Cohen v.  Brown  University, \"only  a few  exceptional\r                                                \r\n\ncircumstances can  overcome the interests served  by adherence to\r\n\nthe  [law of the case] doctrine and those exceptions are narrowly\r\n\ncircumscribed.\"   Id.   It  is insufficient  for  appellant Boots\r                               \r\n\nsimply to point  to comments  by the district  court that  differ\r\n\nfrom comments made by that court prior to Boots I without showing\r                                                           \r\n\nthat these  comments amount to substantially  different evidence.\r\n\nAs  he has failed  to show that  substantially different evidence\r\n\nwas  presented, we affirm the district court's decision as to the\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility issue.1\r\n\n          Boots' second argument is that the district court erred\r\n\nin imposing a  fourteen month sentence.  He does not dispute that\r\n\nthe  district court correctly calculated  his offense level to be\r\n\nthirteen,  which implies a  sentence range of  twelve to eighteen\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   We  add that  even if  we decided  that the  law of  the case\r\ndoctrine  did not  apply,  we would  be  required to  affirm  the\r\ndistrict court  decision unless it were  clearly erroneous, which\r\nit is not.  See United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n1990).\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmonths.    He claims,  however, that  in  choosing a  sentence of\r\n\nfourteen months,  the court impermissibly considered  tax revenue\r\n\nloss suffered by Canada.\r\n\n          As a general  rule, it is  established that this  court\r\n\nordinarily  has no jurisdiction  to review a  sentence within the\r\n\napplicable sentencing guideline range if that range was correctly\r\n\ndetermined.  United  States v. Panet-Collazo,  960 F.2d 256,  261\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1992).    Since  there  is  no  indication  that  the\r\n\nsentencing  court's affixation  of  the  fourteen-month term  was\r\n\notherwise \"in violation of law,\"2 18 U.S.C.   3742(a)(1), we lack\r\n\njurisdiction to consider this claim.  See United States v. Col n,\r                                                                          \r\n\n884 F.2d 1550 (2d Cir. 1989).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  On plain error review,  we conclude that the district  court's\r\nconsideration  of the Canadian  tax revenue loss,  although not a\r\npredicate for wire fraud, see United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580\r                                                              \r\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 417 S. Ct. 263 (1996), was not improper\r                                  \r\ngiven that  the  guidelines permit  the  court to  consider  \"any\r\ninformation  . . . unless otherwise prohibited by law.\"  U.S.S.G.\r\n  1B1.4.     We  note  also  that  other  circuits  have  allowed\r\nconsideration  of foreign  convictions in  determining sentencing\r\nwithin the applicable range.   See United States v.  Soliman, 889\r                                                                      \r\nF.2d 441  (2d Cir. 1989)  (interpreting United States  v.

We  disagree.\r\n\nAlthough it is true  that the district court commented  on Boots'\r\n\ntruthfulness, this  choice of  words by the  sentencing court  is\r\n\ninsufficient to overcome  the law of  the case doctrine.   As  we\r\n\nstated in  Cohen v.  Brown  University, \"only  a few  exceptional\r                                                \r\n\ncircumstances can  overcome the interests served  by adherence to\r\n\nthe  [law of the case] doctrine and those exceptions are narrowly\r\n\ncircumscribed.\"   Id.   It  is insufficient  for  appellant Boots\r                               \r\n\nsimply to point  to comments  by the district  court that  differ\r\n\nfrom comments made by that court prior to Boots I without showing\r                                                           \r\n\nthat these  comments amount to substantially  different evidence.\r\n\nAs  he has failed  to show that  substantially different evidence\r\n\nwas  presented, we affirm the district court's decision as to the\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility issue.1\r\n\n          Boots' second argument is that the district court erred\r\n\nin imposing a  fourteen month sentence.  He does not dispute that\r\n\nthe  district court correctly calculated  his offense level to be\r\n\nthirteen,  which implies a  sentence range of  twelve to eighteen\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   We  add that  even if  we decided  that the  law of  the case\r\ndoctrine  did not  apply,  we would  be  required to  affirm  the\r\ndistrict court  decision unless it were  clearly erroneous, which\r\nit is not.

He claims,  however, that  in  choosing a  sentence of\r\n\nfourteen months,  the court impermissibly considered  tax revenue\r\n\nloss suffered by Canada.\r\n\n          As a general  rule, it is  established that this  court\r\n\nordinarily  has no jurisdiction  to review a  sentence within the\r\n\napplicable sentencing guideline range if that range was correctly\r\n\ndetermined.
