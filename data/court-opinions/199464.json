Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Selya, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Nydia María Díaz-Buxó, with whom Orlin P. Goble was on brief, for\nappellants.\n     Sigfredo Rodríguez-Isaac, with whom Roberto J. Sánchez Ramos,\nSolicitor General, Puerto Rico Department of Justice, Vanessa Lugo\nFlores, Deputy Solicitor General, Sylvia Roger Stefani, Assistant\nSolicitor General, Leigh M. Manasevit, and Brunstein & Manasevit were\non brief, for appellee.\n\f                            June 26, 2001\n\n\n\n          Per Curiam. This appeal is brought by Héctor Gonzalez, his\n\nwife Gricelle Nazario González, and their seventeen-year-old son\n\nGabriel González, who is autistic. For the past nine years, Gabriel\n\nhas attended the Higashi School in Boston, a residential school\n\nspecializing in the education of autistic children. While at Higashi,\n\nGabriel has progressed well. Plaintiffs wish Gabriel to continue his\n\nattendance at the Higashi School, or, failing that, at some comparable\n\nresidential program. They claim that the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nEducation must pay for such residential placement as part of its\n\nobligation to provide Gabriel a \"free appropriate public education,\"\n\npursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.     The Department instead has proposed an\n\nindividualized education plan (IEP) under which Gabriel would reside at\n\nhome in Puerto Rico and attend special education classes at a local\n\npublic school, supplemented by extra instructional personnel and\n\nextended-year services.\n\n          After lengthy administrative proceedings, a hearing officer\n\nruled that the Department's proposed IEP was sufficient to meet the\n\nrequirements of the IDEA; the hearing officer also ordered that the IEP\n\nbe amended to include additional services that he thought would\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fstrengthen the plan and that the Department had itself expressed a\n\nwillingness to offer. Plaintiffs sought review by the district court.\n\nThe district court found the case close, but affirmed the hearing\n\nofficer's determination; also, the court ordered that the IEP be\n\namended to include additional services (beyond those added by the\n\nhearing officer), mainly designed to ensure that Gabriel's transition\n\nto schooling in Puerto Rico would be smooth and that his daily life\n\nwould continue to be highly structured, as it has been at the Higashi\n\nSchool. See González v. Puerto Rico Dep't of Educ., Civ. No. 95-2284\n\n(D.P.R. Mar. 30, 2000).\n\n          Plaintiffs now appeal the district court's ruling. They\n\nchallenge, in essence, the court's finding of fact that although\n\nGabriel needs to be educated in a highly structured environment, such\n\nstructure can be achieved through the Department's IEP and hence does\n\nnot require residential placement. We review the district court's\n\nfindings of fact only for clear error, Kathleen H. v. Mass. Dep't of\n\nEduc., 154 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1998), and find none. As the district\n\ncourt explained, it had before it conflicting testimony from credible\n\nexperts as to whether Gabriel could be appropriately educated outside\n\na residential program; owing a degree of deference to the hearing\n\nofficer's determination, see, e.g., Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson\n\nCent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982); Lenn v. Portland\n\nSch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1086 (1st Cir. 1993), the district court\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffelt bound to affirm in the face of this reasonable disagreement.\n\nGonzález, Civ. No. 95-2284, slip op. at      16.   We see no cause for\n\ndisturbing the court's finding.        The district court has dealt\n\nextensively and sensitively with this case since 1995 and was well\n\npositioned to assess the facts. Our review of the record confirms that\n\nthere was indeed conflicting testimony by several witnesses as to the\n\nneed for residential placement; and the district court acted within its\n\nbounds in finding the testimony of the defendant's expert credible and\n\nsufficient to support the hearing officer's decision.1\n\n          Besides challenging the district court's factual findings,\n\nthe plaintiffs might also be understood as raising a legal issue as to\n\nwhether the district court sufficiently took into account Gabriel's\n\npast behavioral difficulties at home in deciding the appropriateness of\n\nremoving him from a residential program. Gabriel has a history of\n\nthrowing tantrums at home (although the frequency and controllability\n\nof those tantrums is disputed by the parties); and his parents have\n\nexpressed considerable concern for their safety and that of their\n\ndaughter if Gabriel returns home pursuant to the proposed IEP.\n\n\n     1    While plaintiffs suggest in their brief that the\ndefendant's expert, Dr. Linares, actually agreed with their experts\nthat removing Gabriel from a residential program was too risky and\nwould likely cause him to regress, that characterization of Dr.\nLinares' testimony is inaccurate. In the portion of his testimony to\nwhich plaintiffs refer, Dr. Linares simply testified that absent\ncareful planning -- in particular, absent the measures outlined in\nthe Department's IEP -- removing Gabriel from a residential program\nwould be too risky and would likely cause him to regress.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          The district court took cognizance of Gabriel's behavior\n\nproblems at home, but stated as a matter of law that\n\n          [a] court deciding on the appropriateness of residential\n          placement must determine whether such placement is necessary\n          for the child's education . . . , rather than for any\n          social, medical, or emotional problems distinct from his\n          learning problem. . . . Although a child may have severe\n          behavior problems at home which make it difficult for his\n          parents to control, the educational agency is not\n          necessarily responsible to remedy this problem.\n\nGonzález, Civ. No. 95-2284, slip op. at 10 (paragraph structure and\n\ncitations omitted). As to Gabriel's parents' safety concerns, the\n\ncourt found them separable from Gabriel's educational problems and\n\ntherefore an insufficient ground to justify a residential placement.\n\nId. at 11.\n\n          As a conceptual matter, the district court's recitation of\n\nthe relevant legal standard was correct as to problems truly \"distinct\"\n\nfrom learning problems. Educational benefit is indeed the touchstone\n\nin determining the extent of governmental obligations under the IDEA.\n\nSee Rome Sch. Comm. v. Mrs. B., 247 F.3d 29, 33 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"The question is whether these behavioral disturbances interfere[]\n\nwith the child's ability to learn.\") Thus we have said, for example,\n\nthat the Act does not require\n\n          a local school committee to support a handicapped child in\n          a residential program simply to remedy a poor home setting\n          or to make up for some other deficit not covered by the Act.\n          It is not the responsibility of local officials under the\n          Act to finance foster care as such: other resources must be\n          looked to.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fAbrahamson v. Hershman, 701 F.2d 223, 227-28 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\nNonetheless, as a practical matter, in cases such as this one, where\n\nall agree that the student's activities need to be highly structured\n\nboth during and after school in order for him to receive an appropriate\n\neducation, clear lines can rarely be drawn between the student's\n\neducational needs and his social problems at home. Thus, typically an\n\nIEP in cases where the student's disability is this serious (and\n\nrequires such a degree of structure) must address such problems in some\n\nfashion, even if they do not warrant residential placement.\n\n          The district court here did not dismiss the significance of\n\nGabriel's problems at home. While it did not find that those problems\n\nso affected Gabriel's ability to learn as to warrant residential\n\nplacement, the court did find it necessary for the Department's IEP to\n\naddress them. Accordingly, it ordered that the IEP be expanded to\n\ninclude further services and training for Gabriel's parents designed to\n\nhelp them manage Gabriel's behavior at home. And there is sufficient\n\nevidence in the record as to the nature of Gabriel's behavioral\n\nproblems to support the district court's conclusion that they can be\n\nmanaged effectively through such means. Accordingly, we find no error\n\nin the way in which the district court addressed the link between\n\nGabriel's problems at home and his educational needs.2\n\n     2    Plaintiffs raise two further issues in their brief that\ncan be summarily dispatched. First, plaintiffs argue that the burden\nbelow was on the Department to show that residential placement was\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          Finally, we note that plaintiffs' oral argument focused\n\nlargely on events that have occurred since the district court's ruling;\n\nspecifically, plaintiffs alleged that the Department has failed to\n\ncomply with the district court's order to make effective preparations\n\nfor Gabriel's return to Puerto Rico. Two points are in order. First,\n\nany charges of non-compliance with the court's order are not properly\n\nbefore us on appeal; if such charges are to be brought, plaintiffs must\n\nbring them in the first instance before the district court. Second,\n\nhaving said that, we urge cooperation between the parties at this\n\npoint. Despite plaintiffs' deep and sincere reservations about the\n\nwisdom of educating Gabriel in Puerto Rico, that course of action has\n\nbeen duly determined. It is now soon to be effected, and, clearly,\n\nsuccess will depend on the careful collaboration and determined efforts\n\nof both parties.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed. No costs are\n\n\n\nunnecessary to provide Gabriel a free appropriate public education.\nBut the burden was not the defendant's to bear; it properly belonged\nto plaintiffs, as they were the party challenging the hearing\nofficer's decision. E.g., Hampton Sch. Dist. v. Dobrowolski, 976\nF.2d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 1992).\n          Second, plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to\nattorney's fees. The district court awarded plaintiffs partial\nattorney's fees based on their partial success before the court (in\nthat the court amended the IEP in a way beneficial to the\nplaintiffs). On appeal, plaintiffs present no developed argument as\nto why the district court's award was legally flawed. Hence, the\nissue has been waived. See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (possible arguments raised only in \"skeletal\"\nform on appeal deemed waived).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fawarded.\n\n\n\n\n           -8-\n\f",

Dobrowolski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591386\"><a href=\"/opinion/591386/hampton-school-district-v-charles-dobrowolski/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st Cir. 1992).\n          Second, plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to\nattorney's fees. The district court awarded plaintiffs partial\nattorney's fees based on their partial success before the court (in\nthat the court amended the IEP in a way beneficial to the\nplaintiffs). On appeal, plaintiffs present no developed argument as\nto why the district court's award was legally flawed. Hence, the\nissue has been waived. See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (possible arguments raised only in \"skeletal\"\nform on appeal deemed waived).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fawarded.\n\n\n\n\n           -8-\n\f</pre>",
