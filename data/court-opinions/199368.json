Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Harry A. Ezratty for appellants.\n     William A. Graffam, with whom Patricia A. Garrity was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           April 11, 2001\n\f\f           COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.          This is a maritime tort\n\naction in which plaintiff-appellant Franco Morales, a San Juan\n\nharbor   pilot,    appeals   from   a   summary    judgment    in   favor    of\n\ndefendant-appellee, owner of the vessel M/V Malene.                   Morales\n\nseeks damages for an injury occasioned by a fall as he was\n\ndisembarking from the Malene and boarding the plaintiff's pilot\n\nboat after guiding the Malene out of San Juan Harbor.                       The\n\ncomplaint alleged that defendant was negligent for failing to\n\n\"make a lee,\" i.e., to turn the Malene perpendicular to the\n\nwaves as requested in order to minimize pitching on the leeward\n\nside of the boat from which plaintiff was disembarking.               Morales\n\nalso claimed that the rope ladder used to exit the Malene was\n\nnot in a safe position, and that the area was not properly\n\nilluminated.      On the basis of facts deemed admitted because they\n\nwere not controverted by the plaintiff, and his own deposition\n\ntestimony, the district court held that the sole cause of the\n\naccident was Morales' own negligence.             We affirm.\n\n           This case is a lesson in summary judgment practice.\n\nAs might be expected, the various motion papers, memoranda,\n\nexhibits, affidavits, and depositions of parties, witnesses, and\n\nexperts produced an appendix of two thick volumes.                  In such a\n\ncase, the filing of a motion for summary judgment signals a\n\nformidable search for a genuine issue of material fact.               If this\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fis not to impose the daunting burden of seeking a needle in a\n\nhaystack, the court needs help from counsel.          Almost two decades\n\nago, we confessed our increasing \"frustration [with] the more\n\nand more typical phenomenon . . . of a district court having to\n\ndecide a motion for summary judgment without the assistance the\n\ncourt should expect from counsel.\"          Stepanischen v. Merchants\n\nDespatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 927 (1st Cir. 1983).              We\n\nencouraged district courts to adopt \"anti-ferreting\" rules,\n\nwhich warn parties opposing summary judgment that, to preclude\n\njudgment as a matter of law, they must identify factual issues\n\nbuttressed by record citations.          \"[O]nce so warned,\" we added,\n\n\"a   party's   failure   to   comply    would,   where   appropriate,   be\n\ngrounds for judgment against that party.\"           Id. at 931.\n\n          The district of Puerto Rico has such a rule, Local Rule\n\n311.12, which in relevant part requires a party opposing summary\n\njudgment to submit \"a separate, short, and concise statement of\n\nthe material facts as to which it is contended that there exists\n\na genuine issue to be tried, properly supported by specific\n\nreference to the record.\"        D.P.L.R. 311.12.        We have recently\n\nreiterated,    with   reference    to    this    particular   rule,   that\n\n\"parties ignore [it] at their own peril,\" and that \"failure to\n\npresent a statement of disputed facts, embroidered with specific\n\ncitations to the record, justifies deeming the facts presented\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fin the movant's statement of undisputed facts admitted.\"                        Ruiz\n\nRivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing prior\n\ncases).\n\n             Along with its motion for summary judgment, defendant-\n\nappellee submitted to the district court, in accordance with the\n\nlocal rule, a statement meticulously enumerating some three\n\ndozen     uncontested        facts.         Plaintiff   responded      by     filing\n\ncontemporaneously two separate documents, his own designation of\n\nuncontested facts and an opposition to defendant's statement of\n\nuncontested facts, both of which were deficient.\n\n             Two    thirds     of     the    items    listed      in   plaintiff's\n\ndesignation        of   uncontested          facts    are     either    completely\n\nunsupported by citations to the record, or else only reference\n\nan entire deposition or statement without page citations.                      There\n\nis not a single record citation in plaintiff's opposition to\n\ndefendant's statement of uncontested facts.                   Plaintiff accepted\n\ntwo-thirds of the proffered statements.                     Among those to which\n\nthe plaintiff objected, the district court found none sufficient\n\nto   raise   a     triable    issue,    and    accordingly        granted   summary\n\njudgment in favor of defendant.\n\n             The    district    court       found    that    by   conceding   facts\n\nproffered by the defendant, and then lending support to those\n\nuncontroverted facts in his deposition, Morales admitted that he\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\falone was at fault for his injury.    Although plaintiff contested\n\nthe general proposition that harbor pilots take over the command\n\nof vessels once aboard, he accepted defendant's proffered fact\n\nnumber 8, which stated that, on this occasion, Morales gave all\n\ninstructions and navigational orders for maneuvering the Malene\n\n\"up to and including the positioning of the vessel for his\n\ndisembarkation.\"    He   also   accepted   number   30,   defendant's\n\ncharacterization of the critical moment: \"[Morales] stepped from\n\nthe ladder into the pilot boat when he deemed it safe to do so.\"\n\nThis admission was based on Morales' own deposition testimony,\n\nspecifically referenced by defendant in number 30:\n\n    Q. [H]ow long a time was it that you waited at the\n    ladder for the captain to make this turn that you had\n    asked him to make?\n\n    A.  It would have been three or five seconds, five\n    minutes. Not seconds; minutes.\n                            * * *\n    Q. [D]id the MALENE actually start the turn to the\n    left, as you had asked them?\n\n    A.   As I asked, and he would run back in and I guess\n    he would put more w[heel] to the ship and the ship\n    would have come down. By that time, not only would\n    the ship help the swell, but the swell would ease down\n    with the boat and as the boat came up, I saw that it\n    was safe enough for me to grab the boat and release\n    the ladder and that's what I did.      It so happened\n    that[,] as I let go of the ladder[,] the boat just\n    went down, the swell went down, and I went down with\n    it.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fThus, Morales' deposition testimony reflecting his own judgment\n\nabout      the     conditions      for    disembarkation             foreclosed     any\n\npossibility of recovery from defendant.\n\n             On appeal, recognizing the damning nature of his own\n\ntestimony, Morales points to other evidence, which, he argues,\n\ncontradicts the version of events articulated in his deposition\n\nand thereby creates a triable issue for a jury.                         He cites two\n\nitems, neither of which we find persuasive.\n\n             The    first,     deposition       testimony       of   another   harbor\n\npilot, Montes, who claimed to have seen the Malene heading due\n\nnorth out to sea, suggests that the vessel at some unidentified\n\ntime was not turning to shelter the leeward side as requested by\n\nMorales.         But    this     fact,   even    if     true,    does    nothing     to\n\ncontradict the uncontested facts that Morales was in charge of\n\nthe Malene's course during the positioning maneuver and that he\n\nand   he    alone      decided    when   to     jump.      Furthermore,        in   his\n\nsubmissions to the district court, plaintiff made only a general\n\nreference to Montes' testimony without pinpointing where in that\n\n89-page deposition support for that reference could be found.\n\nThis is precisely the situation that Local Rule 311.12 seeks to\n\navoid.      As the district court generously observed, although\n\nplaintiff did not fully comply with Local Rule 311.12, that\n\ndeficiency was \"not at all outcome determinative in the instant\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fcase.\"    In this circumstance, we would not be inclined to give\n\nsuch   hitherto   unreferenced    testimony     dispositive   effect   on\n\nappeal.   Forgiving plaintiff's noncompliance with the local rule\n\nwould undercut our efforts over the years to enlist counsel as\n\naides to the court.\n\n           The other evidence from which plaintiff purports to\n\nraise an issue of fact is Morales' affidavit, which was filed in\n\nopposition   to   defendant's    motion   for   summary   judgment   some\n\ntwenty months after his deposition, and which contradicts his\n\nprior deposition testimony.       In the affidavit, Morales averred\n\nthat the Malene turned ten degrees to port as requested, but\n\nthat was not enough.     He returned from the ladder to the deck\n\nand shouted to the captain to turn more to port.              Then, the\n\naffidavit states:\n\n       I waited some time and returned to the ladder.      I\n       still did not have what I asked for. I told the men\n       standing by, [sic] about my problem. At this time no\n       one was complying with my requests. I had no choice\n       but to try to board the pilot boat under these\n       conditions.   I waited for the correct moment to go\n       into the pilot boat. I would say it took me about a\n       half hour from the time I left the wheelhouse until I\n       was finally able to get on to the pilot boat. That\n       was the time I injured myself.\n\n           The disparity of views between those expressed in this\n\naffidavit and those in Morales' earlier deposition is dramatic.\n\nIn his deposition, Morales testified that he leaped when he\n\nthought it was safe.    The affidavit, by contrast, describes him\n\n                                  -8-\n\fas having \"no choice\" but to jump when he did.                  The distinct\n\nimplication of Morales' deposition testimony was that the ship\n\nwas responding to his instructions; the affidavit states that\n\nthere was absolutely no compliance.\n\n            These    disparities,      however,   do   not    create   a   jury\n\nquestion.       We have refused to allow issues of fact to be created\n\nsimply    by    submitting   a   subsequent   contradictory       affidavit.\n\nColantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni & Sons, 44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (\"When an interested witness has given clear answers to\n\nunambiguous questions, he cannot create a conflict and resist\n\nsummary        judgment   with    an     affidavit     that     is     clearly\n\ncontradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation of\n\nwhy the testimony is changed.\"); see also Torres v. E.I. DuPont\n\nDe Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 20-21 (1st Cir. 2000).                We adhere\n\nto that practice now.\n\n            We therefore conclude as a matter of law that the\n\ndefendant was not at all negligent in its maneuvering of the\n\nvessel during plaintiff's disembarkation.               The two remaining\n\nissues, ladder position and illumination, are likewise precluded\n\nby plaintiff's own account.            Morales admitted that there was\n\nnothing physically wrong with the ladder and that it was secured\n\nfirmly.     He did not contend that a lack of visibility on the\n\npart of the harbor pilot had anything to do with the accident.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fNor does he argue that improper lighting in any way affected his\n\ndecision    when   to   disembark.     There   is   simply   no   basis   to\n\nconclude that the ladder or visibility had anything to do with\n\nthe accident.\n\n            Appellant devotes a surprising amount of space in his\n\nbrief to arguing that the court improperly relied on the opinion\n\nevidence of his former expert, who subsequently gave damaging\n\ntestimony supporting the defendant.         Although this testimony was\n\nalso not controverted, it played no significant part in our\n\nanalysis.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

Then, the affidavit states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I waited some time and returned to the ladder. I still did not have what I asked for. I told the men standing by, [sic] about my problem. At this time no one was complying with my requests. I had no choice but to try to board the pilot boat under these conditions. I waited for the correct moment to go into the pilot boat. I would say it took me about a half hour from the time I left the wheelhouse until I was finally able to get on to the pilot boat. That was the time I injured myself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disparity of views between those expressed in this affidavit and those in Morales' earlier deposition is dramatic. In his deposition, Morales testified that he leaped when he thought it was safe. The affidavit, by contrast, describes him as having \"no choice\" but to jump when he did. The distinct implication of Morales' deposition testimony was that the ship was responding to his instructions; the affidavit states that there was absolutely no compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These disparities, however, do not create a jury question.

Morales seeks damages for an injury occasioned by a fall as he was disembarking from the Malene and boarding the plaintiff's pilot boat after guiding the Malene out of San Juan Harbor. The complaint alleged that defendant was negligent for failing to \"make a lee,\" i.e., to turn the Malene perpendicular to the waves as requested in order to minimize pitching on the leeward side of the boat from which plaintiff was disembarking. Morales also claimed that the rope ladder used to exit the Malene was not in a safe position, and that the area was not properly illuminated. On the basis of facts deemed admitted because they were not controverted by the plaintiff, and his own deposition testimony, the district court held that the sole cause of the accident was Morales' own negligence. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a lesson in summary judgment practice. As might be expected, the various motion papers, memoranda, exhibits, affidavits, and depositions of parties, witnesses, and experts produced an appendix of two thick volumes. In such a case, the filing of a motion for summary judgment signals a formidable search for a genuine issue of material fact. If this is not to impose the daunting burden of seeking a needle in a haystack, the court needs help from counsel. Almost two decades ago, we confessed our increasing \"frustration [with] the more and more typical phenomenon . . . of a district court having to decide a motion for summary judgment without the assistance the court should expect from counsel.\" Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428311\"><a href=\"/opinion/428311/simion-stepanischen-v-merchants-despatch-transportation-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 927 (1st Cir. 1983). We encouraged district courts to adopt \"anti-ferreting\" rules, which warn parties opposing summary judgment that, to preclude judgment as a matter of law, they must identify factual issues buttressed by record citations. \"[O]nce so warned,\" we added, \"a party's failure to comply would, where appropriate, be grounds for judgment against that party.\" Id. at 931.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district of Puerto Rico has such a rule, Local Rule 311.12, which in relevant part requires a party opposing summary judgment to submit \"a separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried, properly supported by specific reference to the record.\" D.P.L.R. 311.12. We have recently reiterated, with reference to this particular rule, that \"parties ignore [it] at their own peril,\" and that \"failure to present a statement of disputed facts, embroidered with specific citations to the record, justifies deeming the facts presented in the movant's statement of undisputed facts admitted.\" Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198879\"><a href=\"/opinion/198879/ruiz-rivera-v-dept-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing prior cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with its motion for summary judgment, defendant-appellee submitted to the district court, in accordance with the local rule, a statement meticulously enumerating some three dozen uncontested facts. Plaintiff responded by filing contemporaneously two separate documents, his own designation of uncontested facts and an opposition to defendant's statement of uncontested facts, both of which were deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two thirds of the items listed in plaintiff's designation of uncontested facts are either completely unsupported by citations to the record, or else only reference an entire deposition or statement without page citations. There is not a single record citation in plaintiff's opposition to defendant's statement of uncontested facts. Plaintiff accepted two-thirds of the proffered statements. Among those to which the plaintiff objected, the district court found none sufficient to raise a triable issue, and accordingly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that by conceding facts proffered by the defendant, and then lending support to those uncontroverted facts in his deposition, Morales admitted that he alone was at fault for his injury. Although plaintiff contested the general proposition that harbor pilots take over the command of vessels once aboard, he accepted defendant's proffered fact number 8, which stated that, on this occasion, Morales gave all instructions and navigational orders for maneuvering the Malene \"up to and including the positioning of the vessel for his disembarkation.\" He also accepted number 30, defendant's characterization of the critical moment: \"[Morales] stepped from the ladder into the pilot boat when he deemed it safe to do so.\" This admission was based on Morales' own deposition testimony, specifically referenced by defendant in number 30:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. [H]ow long a time was it that you waited at the ladder for the captain to make this turn that you had asked him to make?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. It would have been three or five seconds, five minutes. Not seconds; minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. [D]id the MALENE actually start the turn to the left, as you had asked them?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. As I asked, and he would run back in and I guess he would put more w[heel] to the ship and the ship would have come down. By that time, not only would the ship help the swell, but the swell would ease down with the boat and as the boat came up, I saw that it was safe enough for me to grab the boat and release the ladder and that's what I did. It so happened that[,] as I let go of the ladder[,] the boat just went down, the swell went down, and I went down with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Morales' deposition testimony reflecting his own judgment about the conditions for disembarkation foreclosed any possibility of recovery from defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, recognizing the damning nature of his own testimony, Morales points to other evidence, which, he argues, contradicts the version of events articulated in his deposition and thereby creates a triable issue for a jury. He cites two items, neither of which we find persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first, deposition testimony of another harbor pilot, Montes, who claimed to have seen the Malene heading due north out to sea, suggests that the vessel at some unidentified time was not turning to shelter the leeward side as requested by Morales. But this fact, even if true, does nothing to contradict the uncontested facts that Morales was in charge of the Malene's course during the positioning maneuver and that he and he alone decided when to jump. Furthermore, in his submissions to the district court, plaintiff made only a general reference to Montes' testimony without pinpointing where in that 89-page deposition support for that reference could be found. This is precisely the situation that Local Rule 311.12 seeks to avoid. As the district court generously observed, although plaintiff did not fully comply with Local Rule 311.12, that deficiency was \"not at all outcome determinative in the instant case.\" In this circumstance, we would not be inclined to give such hitherto unreferenced testimony dispositive effect on appeal. Forgiving plaintiff's noncompliance with the local rule would undercut our efforts over the years to enlist counsel as aides to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other evidence from which plaintiff purports to raise an issue of fact is Morales' affidavit, which was filed in opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment some twenty months after his deposition, and which contradicts his prior deposition testimony. In the affidavit, Morales averred that the Malene turned ten degrees to port as requested, but that was not enough. He returned from the ladder to the deck and shouted to the captain to turn more to port. Then, the affidavit states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I waited some time and returned to the ladder.
