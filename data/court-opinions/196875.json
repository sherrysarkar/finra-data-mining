We\r\n\nadd only these comments.\r\n\n          Because appellant did not  offer any showing that a\r\n\ntransfer would  be in  the interest  of justice, we  conclude\r\n\nthat the  district  court did  not  abuse its  discretion  in\r\n\nfailing to order one under 28  U.S.C.   1406(a).  See Cote v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWadel, 796 F.2d  981, 984  (7th Cir. 1986);  Dubin v.

The  injunction  concerns only\r\n\nfilings  against  the  federal  defendants  in  Massachusetts\r\n\ndistrict  court, and  it  allows appellant  to  apply to  the\r\n\ndistrict court for  leave to  file claims upon  a showing  of\r\n\npersonal  jurisdiction, proper  venue, and  merit.   In these\r\n\ncircumstances,  we perceive  no abuse  of discretion  in this\r\n\nlimitation on  appellant's future filings.
