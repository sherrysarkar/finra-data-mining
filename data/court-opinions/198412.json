Jeanne B. Demars brought this suit\r\nagainst the Insurance Company of North America (\"ICNA\"), the\r\nprovider of her long-term disability insurance, and ICNA's parent\r\ncorporation CIGNA Corporation (\"CIGNA\"), after CIGNA -- upon\r\nreviewing the accuracy of information on a conversion application\r\nDemars had submitted seven years earlier -- recalculated her\r\ndisability benefit level and demanded that she remit alleged\r\noverpayments totaling more than $70,000.  Demars brought state law\r\nclaims of unfair trade practices, breach of contract, intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress, bad faith breach of contract, and\r\nbad faith refusal to pay an insurance claim, as well as a claim for\r\ndisability benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security\r\nAct of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C.  1001 et seq.\r\nThe sole question on appeal is whether ERISA preempts all\r\nstate law claims related to an individual insurance policy obtained\r\nby an employee after termination of employment through the exercise\r\nof conversion rights granted by an employee welfare benefit plan. \r\nIn other words, we consider whether ERISA regulation extends to\r\n\"conversion policies.\"  The district court found that it does and\r\ntherefore granted defendants' motion to dismiss Demars's state law\r\nclaims.  We reverse.\r\n                          I\r\nFor the purposes of a motion to dismiss, we accept as\r\ntrue the facts alleged in the complaint.  See Duckworth v. Pratt &amp;\r\nWhitney, Inc., 152 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998).  Demars began working\r\nas an agent for National Life of Vermont (\"National Life\") in 1983. \r\nAs a National Life employee, she was entitled to enroll in a group\r\nlong-term disability policy underwritten by ICNA.  National Life's\r\ngroup policy included a \"conversion clause\" that permitted employees\r\nto convert from group disability coverage to individual policies\r\nwhen their employment with National Life came to an end.  Demars\r\ninitially enrolled in the group disability policy.  In 1990, when\r\nshe left National Life, she elected to convert her group coverage\r\nto an individual ICNA policy.\r\nICNA's conversion application consisted of two pages. \r\nThe first page, to be filled out by the applicant, asked for\r\ngeneral information.  The second page was to be completed by\r\nDemars's employer.  Since Demars had already left National Life,\r\nshe considered her employer to be Demars Financial Services, Inc.,\r\na business that she and her husband ran.  Accordingly, in response\r\nto a question about her earnings at the time of termination, she\r\ndid not report her final National Life salary; instead, she\r\nreported the gross annual commissions she earned as an employee of\r\nDemars Financial Services. \r\nIn August 1990, ICNA notified Demars that her application\r\nhad been approved, sent her a certificate of insurance for the\r\nconversion policy, and requested an initial premium payment. \r\nDemars paid the initial premium and the quarterly premiums\r\nthereafter.\r\nIn November 1993, Demars filed a claim with ICNA for long\r\nterm disability benefits.  Her claim was approved in April 1994,\r\nand ICNA commenced monthly payments of $1,972 ($3,000 less Social\r\nSecurity disability benefits) in May 1994.\r\nIn March 1997, CIGNA requested that Demars forward\r\nfinancial information pertaining to the years 1990 through 1996. \r\nAfter examining this information, CIGNA concluded that Demars had\r\nincorrectly reported her income on the conversion application, that\r\nshe was actually entitled only to a $100 minimum monthly benefit,\r\nand that ICNA had therefore overpaid her by more than $70,000\r\nbetween May 1994 and June 1997.  CIGNA sent Demars a letter dated\r\nJune 26, 1997 that explained these conclusions and informed her\r\nthat CIGNA would withhold all further monthly benefit payments (now\r\nset at $100) until she had repaid the sums allegedly owed.  Demars\r\nhas not received any benefit payments since that date.\r\nRather than repaying CIGNA the allegedly excessive\r\nbenefits and accepting the reduction in future benefits, Demars\r\nbrought suit against CIGNA and ICNA, asserting both diversity and\r\nfederal question jurisdiction.  After Demars stipulated to the\r\ndismissal of her ERISA claim and the district court granted the\r\ndefendants' motion to dismiss her state law claims, judgment was\r\nentered against Demars, who now appeals.\r\n                           II  We review de novo the legal question whether ERISA\r\npreemption applies to claims arising from a conversion policy, seeDegnan v. Publicker Indus., Inc., 83 F.3d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 1996),\r\nand begin with the words of the statute.  Section 1144(a)  states\r\nthat ERISA provisions \"shall supercede any and all State laws\r\ninsofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any [ERISA] employee\r\nbenefit plan.\"  29 U.S.C.  1144(a).  \r\nWe note at the outset that Demars's state law claims\r\nclearly \"relate to\" her conversion policy in the sense intended by\r\n1144(a), since in order to prevail on those claims Demars would\r\nneed to prove the existence of, or specific terms of, the\r\nconversion policy.  See Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S.\r\n133, 140 (1990) (stating \"relates to\" test); see also McMahon v.\r\nDigital Equip. Corp., 162 F.3d 28, 38-39 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying\r\nIngersoll-Rand test to breach of contract and unfair trade practice\r\nclaims).   \r\nDefendants would like us to complete the analysis by\r\nasking \"whether the conversion policy is sufficiently connected\r\nto[] (or related to) the underlying ERISA plan.\"  They argue that\r\nthe conversion policy and the ERISA plan are clearly \"connected\" or\r\n\"related\" to each other, since Demars obtained the conversion policy\r\nby virtue of rights granted by National Life's group disability\r\nbenefits plan.  We do not disagree with this point; there is\r\nobviously a type of \"but for\" relationship linking Demars's\r\nconversion policy and National Life's ERISA plan.  But \"infinite\r\nrelations cannot be the measure of pre-emption.\"  New York State\r\nConference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\r\n514 U.S. 645, 656 (1995).  If a chain of \"relates to\" links could\r\nestablish ERISA preemption, then ERISA preemption and ERISA\r\nregulation could be separated in an anomalous way.  The proper\r\nquestion to ask under  1144(a) is not whether Demars's claims\r\nrelate to her conversion policy, which relates in turn to an ERISA\r\nplan, but rather whether the conversion policy is itself subject to\r\nERISA regulation as an ERISA plan.\r\nThe statute defines an \"employee welfare benefit plan\"\r\n(the type of ERISA plan at issue here, see 29 U.S.C.  1002(3)) as:\r\nany plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is\r\nhereafter established or maintained by an employer . . .\r\nfor the purpose of providing for its participants or\r\ntheir beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or\r\notherwise, . . . benefits in the event of sickness,\r\naccident, disability, death or unemployment.  \r\n\n29 U.S.C.  1002(1).  \r\nThis nearly tautological definition offers little\r\nguidance.  The key phrase for present purposes is \"established or\r\nmaintained by an employer.\"  Demars's conversion policy was\r\ncertainly \"established\" in some sense by her former employer -- but\r\nwas it \"established\" in the relevant sense?  Case law provides no\r\ndefinitive answers.  \"[N]o single act in itself necessarily\r\nconstitutes the establishment of the plan, fund, or program,\"\r\nDonovan v. Dillingham, 688 F.2d 1367, 1373 (11th Cir. 1982) (en\r\nbanc), quoted in Belanger v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 71 F.3d 451, 455\r\n(1st Cir. 1995), and \"[t]here is no authoritative checklist that\r\ncan be consulted\" to determine whether an employer's actions\r\nestablish an ERISA plan, Belanger, 71 F.3d at 455.\r\nIn passing ERISA, Congress's purpose was twofold: to\r\nprotect employees and to protect employers.  See McMahon, 162 F.3d\r\nat 35-36.  Congress wanted to safeguard employee interests by\r\nreducing the threat of abuse or mismanagement of funds that had\r\nbeen accumulated to finance employee benefits, see Fort Halifax\r\nPacking Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 15 (1987), while at the same time\r\nsafeguarding employer interests by eliminating \"the threat of\r\nconflicting and inconsistent State and local regulation\" of\r\nemployee benefit plans, Travelers, 514 U.S. at 657 (quoting 120\r\nCong. Rec. 29197 (1974)).\r\nNeither concern seems to be strongly implicated here. \r\nThere is little threat of abuse of funds in the ERISA sense.  While\r\nthere is a risk that funds accumulated to finance benefits under\r\nthe conversion policy could be mismanaged or abused, there is no\r\nrisk of Demars's former employer abusing or mismanaging these\r\nfunds, since it does not control them, or indeed have any tie to\r\nthem.  Rather, it is the insurers who issued the policy --\r\ndefendants here -- who are in a position to possibly abuse or\r\nmismanage the funds.  Yet Congress placed into ERISA an express\r\ndisavowal of any intent to regulate insurers qua insurers.  See 29\r\nU.S.C.  1144(b)(2).\r\nThe uniformity of regulations concern is equally\r\nattenuated.  While conversion policies like Demars's undoubtedly\r\nimpose an administrative burden, that burden lies on the insurers\r\nwho provide the policy, not on the former employer.  As Fort\r\nHalifax noted, \"Congress intended pre-emption to afford employers\r\nthe advantages of a uniform set of administrative procedures\r\ngoverned by a single set of regulations.  This concern only arises\r\n. . . with respect to benefits whose provision by nature requires\r\nan ongoing administrative program to meet the employer's\r\nobligation.\"  Fort Halifax, 482 U.S. at 11.  Thus, \"an employee\r\nbenefit may be considered a plan for purposes of ERISA only if it\r\ninvolves the undertaking of continuing administrative and financial\r\nobligations by the employer.\"  Belanger, 71 F.3d at 454.  Under\r\nthis analysis, conversion policies are not ERISA plans, because\r\nemployers do not bear any administrative or financial\r\nresponsibility for them.\r\nDefendants argue that there is a residual uniformity\r\ninterest affecting employers.  They point out that if different\r\nstates can regulate conversion policies, then there will be\r\ndifferential costs associated with the provision of conversion\r\npolicies in the different states.  These differential costs could\r\ndrive up the costs of granting conversion rights and thus reduce\r\nthe incentive of employers with employee welfare benefit plans to\r\ngrant those rights.  This may or may not be true, but it does not,\r\nin any event, argue for ERISA preemption of state law claims\r\nrelating to conversion policies.  That is because \"cost uniformity\r\nwas almost certainly not an object of [ERISA] pre-emption.\" \r\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 662.  ERISA preemption was intended to\r\nguarantee regulatory uniformity, not intrastate or interstate cost\r\nuniformity.  See id. (rejecting argument that ERISA demands the\r\nequalization of \"relative costs of various health insurance\r\npackages in a given state\"); De Buono, 520 U.S. at 816 (noting that\r\nERISA does not attempt to equalize the cost of benefits across\r\nstates).  \r\nOther arguments bolster the conclusion that conversion\r\npolicies are not subject to ERISA.  A Department of Labor\r\nregulation interpreting the term \"employee welfare benefit plan,\"\r\nwhile not directly on point, provides a useful analogy.  Section\r\n2510.3-1(j) creates a \"safe harbor\" for certain \"group or group-type\r\ninsurance programs\": a group or group-type insurance program\r\noffered by an employer will not be considered to be an employee\r\nwelfare benefit plan if the employer does not make contributions to\r\nand receives no consideration from the insurer, employee\r\nparticipation in the program is voluntary, and the employer's sole\r\nfunctions are to permit the insurer to publicize the program to\r\nemployees and to collect and remit premiums to the insurer.  See 29\r\nC.F.R.  2510.3-1(j) (1998).  The regulation is not directly\r\napplicable to Demars's conversion policy, since hers is not a group\r\npolicy or even a \"group-type\" policy, and since granting a\r\nconversion right is not identical to \"publicizing\" an insurance\r\nprogram.  But the logic of ERISA suggests that a conversion policy\r\nlike Demars's would be even more securely anchored in a safe harbor\r\nthan the type of policy addressed by  2510.3-1(j), since her\r\npolicy does not require any ongoing employer involvement.\r\nMoving from analogy to contrast, the \"continuation\r\ncoverage\" mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget\r\nReconciliation Act (\"COBRA\"), 29 U.S.C.  1161 et seq., provides an\r\ninstructive counterpoint to the conversion policy considered here. \r\nCOBRA amended ERISA in 1985 to require employers to permit an\r\nemployee to continue group coverage for up to eighteen months after\r\ntermination of employment, if the employee elects to do so and\r\nagrees to reimburse the employer for up to 102% of the average per-\r\nemployee cost of that group coverage.  See 29 U.S.C.  1162. \r\nUnlike coverage under a conversion policy, COBRA continuation\r\ncoverage does place ongoing administrative burdens on the employer\r\n(since the ex-employee continues to belong to the employer's group\r\nplan), as well as ongoing financial obligations (since COBRA\r\ncoverage may in fact cost the employer more than the permitted\r\nreimbursement amount).  Given employers' ongoing administrative and\r\nfinancial involvement, courts have found that claims related to\r\nCOBRA coverage are preempted by ERISA.  See Mimbs v. Commercial\r\nLife Ins. Co., 818 F. Supp. 1556, 1560-61 (S.D. Ga. 1993)\r\n(explaining why COBRA continuation coverage is subject to ERISA\r\nregulation).\r\nCertain practical concerns -- not present in the COBRA\r\ncontext -- also suggest that state law claims related to conversion\r\npolicies should not be preempted by ERISA.  Consider, for example,\r\nthe effect on insurers if conversion policies were found to be\r\nERISA plans:  as ERISA plan administrators, insurers would be\r\nrequired to file plan descriptions and detailed annual reports with\r\nthe Department of Labor, see 29 U.S.C.  1023, 1024, and to\r\nprovide regularly updated plan summaries to the plan beneficiaries,\r\nsee 29 U.S.C.  1022.  Given the individual nature of the typical\r\nconversion policy, the insurer would presumably be required to meet\r\nthese extensive requirements separately for each individual\r\nconversion policy.  An even more unwarranted outcome would result\r\nif former employers, rather than insurers, were deemed to be ERISA\r\nplan administrators for conversion policies, since employers would\r\nthen have to meet ERISA's reporting and disclosure requirements for\r\nall of the policies issued, perhaps by a bevy of different\r\ninsurers, to an ever-growing collection of difficult-to-locate\r\nformer employees. \r\nFinally, many other courts appear to agree with our\r\nconclusion regarding the status of conversion policies, although\r\nthe compatibility of certain decisions is apparent only upon close\r\nreading.  A small set of decisions clearly reach the contrary\r\nconclusion -- but based, we believe, on unpersuasive reasoning.\r\nSeveral district courts have adopted the careful\r\ndistinction between conversion rights and conversion policies that\r\nwe drew at the outset and that was first drawn in Mimbs.  Mimbsfound that state law claims involving the right to convert are\r\npreempted by ERISA, but that claims related to the conversion\r\npolicy itself are not.  See Mimbs, 818 F. Supp. at 1561-62 (finding\r\nthat \"[a]ny claim that Defendant failed to offer proper conversion\r\nplan options . . . relates to the ERISA plan and is pre-empted by\r\nERISA,\" but that \"[t]he concerns behind ERISA pre-emption are not\r\nimplicated by state-law claims arising from obligations incurred\r\nunder the conversion policy itself\"); see also Barringer-Willis v.\r\nHealthsource North Carolina Inc., 14 F. Supp. 2d 780, 783-85\r\n(E.D.N.C. 1998) (adopting Mimbs distinction); Mizrahi v. Provident\r\nLife and Accident Ins. Co., 994 F. Supp. 1452, 1453-54 (S.D. Fla.\r\n1998) (same); Powers v. United Health Plans of New England, Inc.,\r\n979 F. Supp. 64, 69-70 (D. Mass. 1997) (same); Loudermilch v. New\r\nEngland Mut Life Ins. Co., 942 F. Supp. 1434, 1437 (S.D. Ala. 1996)\r\n(same); McCale v. Union Labor Life Ins. Co., 881 F. Supp. 233, 235-\r\n36 (S.D. W. Va. 1995) (same); Vaughn v. Owen Steel Co., 871 F.\r\nSupp. 247, 249 (D.S.C. 1994) (same).\r\nThe Second Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have agreed\r\nwith the first half of the Mimbs rule -- that state law claims\r\nrelated to conversion rights are preempted by ERISA -- without\r\ndeciding whether ERISA regulation extends to conversion policies. \r\nSee White v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 114 F.3d 26, 28\r\n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 369 (1997); Howard v. Gleason\r\nCorp., 901 F.2d 1154, 1157-58 (2d Cir. 1990).\r\nThe Ninth Circuit has spoken less clearly on this\r\nquestion.  One Ninth Circuit decision obviously concerned only the\r\nright to convert, see Tingey v. Pixley-Richards West, Inc., 953\r\nF.2d 1124, 1132-33 (9th Cir. 1992), while a subsequent decision,\r\nGreany v. Western Farm Bureau Life Insurance Co., 973 F.2d 812 (9th\r\nCir. 1992), has proven far more difficult to interpret.  The\r\ndispute underlying Greany arose when an employee was mistakenly\r\ntold that his group health insurance would terminate on a date\r\nlater than it actually did, causing a gap between his group\r\ncoverage and the conversion coverage he obtained.  See id. at 814-\r\n15.  The insurer quickly admitted its mistake and permitted the\r\nemployee to convert his policy retroactively to the actual date of\r\ntermination of the group policy.  See id.  Since the employee had\r\nalready received the full amount due to him under the conversion\r\npolicy, none of his panoply of claims against his former employer\r\nand the insurer sought benefits under that policy.  See id. at 815. \r\nThe relevant portions of Greany merely apply the first part of the\r\nMimbs rule, finding state law claims related to conversion rights\r\nto be preempted by ERISA.  See, e.g., id. at 818 (rejecting a\r\nnegligence count against the employer for its actions in procuring\r\nthe conversion policy because conversion rights are subject to\r\nERISA regulation).\r\nGreany is nevertheless cited for the proposition that\r\nconversion policies themselves are subject to ERISA regulation and\r\npreemption.  See, e.g., White, 114 F.3d at 28; Glass v. United of\r\nOmaha Life Ins. Co., 33 F.3d 1341, 1346 (11th Cir. 1994).  This\r\nseems to us to be a misreading of Greany -- an understandable\r\nmisreading in light of two problematic aspects of the opinion. \r\nFirst, the opinion uses confusing language to refer to conversion\r\nrights.  Compare Greany, 973 F.2d at 817 (referring repeatedly to\r\n\"conversion benefits\"), with id. at 823 (summarizing holding as one\r\nregarding \"conversion rights\").  Second, Greany discusses the\r\nplaintiffs' unfair claims settlement practices claim without making\r\nclear that this claim was for benefits under the group policy, not\r\nthe conversion policy.  See id. at 819.  Because the opinion does\r\nnot make this point clear, and because of its misleading use of the\r\nphrase \"conversion benefits\" to refer to conversion rights, it has\r\nbeen incorrectly interpreted -- and \"headnoted\" -- as a decision\r\nabout whether conversion policies are subject to ERISA regulation.\r\nSome decisions have squarely held that ERISA regulation\r\nextends to conversion policies, but we do not find their reasoning\r\npersuasive.  Several courts, for example, have assumed that ERISA\r\nregulation must extend to conversion policies based on an argument\r\nsimilar to the \"relates to\" argument rejected above, while failing\r\nto consider whether conversion policies implicate any of ERISA's\r\nunderlying purposes.  See, e.g., Painter v. Golden Rule Ins. Co.,\r\n121 F.3d 436, 439-40 (8th Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he Conversion Policy came\r\ninto being as a result of Painter exercising her right under the\r\ngroup policy to obtain this specific insurance policy. . . . As\r\nsuch, the Conversion Policy is a component of [the employer's]\r\nERISA plan.\"), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1516 (1998); Beal v.\r\nJefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 798 F. Supp. 673, 675 (S.D. Ala.\r\n1992) (\"[P]laintiffs' right to the converted policy as well as a\r\ndesignation of the benefits to be contained therein existed solely\r\nby virtue of an ERISA employee benefit plan. . . . The Court . . .\r\nfinds that the policy at issue is an 'employee benefit plan' under\r\nERISA.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\nA faulty analogy to COBRA coverage led the Sixth Circuit\r\nto decide that a certain type of conversion policy must be subject\r\nto ERISA.  See Massachusetts Casualty Ins. Co. v. Reynolds, 113\r\nF.3d 1450, 1453 (6th Cir. 1997).  The employer in Reynolds had\r\nprovided ERISA-governed benefits to its employees by purchasing\r\nindividual disability insurance policies for them.  See id. \r\nReynolds's individual conversion policy was therefore essentially\r\nthe same policy he had had while an employee, except that after\r\nconversion it was Reynolds, rather than the employer, who was\r\nresponsible for paying the premiums and maintaining a relationship\r\nwith the insurer.  See id. at 1452.  \r\nThe Reynolds court found it critical that Reynolds did\r\nnot switch from group to individual coverage and that the terms of\r\nhis policy remained the same; these facts, said the court, made\r\nReynolds's conversion coverage akin to COBRA continuation coverage. \r\nSee id. (citing Mimbs's discussion of COBRA).  But the court's\r\nconclusion fails to reflect the actual logic behind ERISA\r\nregulation of COBRA continuation coverage.  COBRA coverage is not\r\nsubject to ERISA regulation merely because the terms of the\r\ncoverage \"continue\" the specific terms of the employer's ERISA plan;\r\nrather, COBRA coverage is subject to ERISA regulation because it\r\nimplicates both of ERISA's cardinal purposes.\r\nThe Eleventh Circuit also, we believe, misread Mimbs when\r\nit held in Glass v. United of Omaha Life Insurance Co., 33 F.3d\r\n1341 (11th Cir. 1994), that a conversion policy that provided\r\ncoverage to a group of ex-employees was \"distinguishable from Mimbsin this respect,\" id. at 1346, and therefore subject to ERISA\r\nregulation.  The court reasoned:\r\nThe conversion in the instant case, unlike that in Mimbs,\r\ndid not actually create an individual policy. It removed\r\n[the employee's] coverage from a group policy consisting\r\nof actively employed Silk Greenhouse employees and moved\r\nthe coverage to a group policy of ex-Silk Greenhouse\r\nemployees. . . . Clearly, [the employee's] ability to\r\nobtain the converted life insurance policy arose from the\r\nERISA plan, and the converted policy itself continued to\r\nbe integrally linked with the ERISA plan.  In this case,\r\nconversion . . . did not defeat ERISA regulation.\r\n\nId. at 1346-47.  By attempting to distinguish between group and\r\nindividual conversion policies, the Glass decision misunderstands\r\nthe logic of Mimbs.  Both types of conversion policy fall outside\r\nthe reach of ERISA, since what matters for ERISA purposes is not\r\nthe nature of the conversion policy but rather the nature of the\r\nemployer's ongoing administrative and financial ties to the policy. \r\nIf no such ties exist, the policy should not be subject to ERISA\r\nregulation.\r\nFinally, we note our disagreement with another frequently\r\ncited decision holding that conversion policies are subject to\r\nERISA.  The court in Nechero v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Insurance\r\nCo., 795 F. Supp. 374 (D.N.M. 1992), also focused on the issue that\r\nwe consider central:  the extent to which conversion policies\r\nimplicate ERISA's purpose of shielding employers from inconsistent\r\nstate regulations.  See id. at 378-79.  However, contrary to what\r\nwe have concluded, the Nechero court found that conversion policies\r\ndo place a significant administrative burden on employers, because\r\nthese policies require the employer to \"track[] the insurance\r\nexpiration of departing employees, timely inform[] them of their\r\nconversion option, and assist[] in their conversion to an\r\nindividual policy if they so choose.  [The employer's] involvement\r\nis ongoing as to its employees as a whole, and requires an\r\nadministrative scheme.\"  Id. at 379.  \r\nWe agree that the administrative burdens noted in Necheroare real.  Yet because these burdens are all tied to the conversion\r\nright, rather than the conversion policy, they do not support the\r\nconclusion that conversion policies are subject to ERISA\r\nregulation.  In the end, the reasoning in Nechero supports the\r\ndistinction recognized in Mimbs between conversion rights, which\r\nare subject to ERISA, and conversion policies, which are not.\r\n                         III\r\nWe hold that Demars's conversion policy is not an\r\n\"employee welfare benefit plan\" and that Demars's state law claims\r\nrelating to the conversion policy are not preempted under\r\n1144(a).  We express no opinion, of course, as to the merits of\r\nDemars's claims against CIGNA and ICNA.\r\nReversed and remanded.  Costs to appellant.\n",

Jeanne B. Demars brought this suit\r\nagainst the Insurance Company of North America (\"ICNA\"), the\r\nprovider of her long-term disability insurance, and ICNA's parent\r\ncorporation CIGNA Corporation (\"CIGNA\"), after CIGNA -- upon\r\nreviewing the accuracy of information on a conversion application\r\nDemars had submitted seven years earlier -- recalculated her\r\ndisability benefit level and demanded that she remit alleged\r\noverpayments totaling more than $70,000.  Demars brought state law\r\nclaims of unfair trade practices, breach of contract, intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress, bad faith breach of contract, and\r\nbad faith refusal to pay an insurance claim, as well as a claim for\r\ndisability benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security\r\nAct of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C.  1001 et seq.\r\nThe sole question on appeal is whether ERISA preempts all\r\nstate law claims related to an individual insurance policy obtained\r\nby an employee after termination of employment through the exercise\r\nof conversion rights granted by an employee welfare benefit plan. \r\nIn other words, we consider whether ERISA regulation extends to\r\n\"conversion policies.\"  The district court found that it does and\r\ntherefore granted defendants' motion to dismiss Demars's state law\r\nclaims.  We reverse.\r\n                          I\r\nFor the purposes of a motion to dismiss, we accept as\r\ntrue the facts alleged in the complaint.  See Duckworth v. Pratt &amp;\r\nWhitney, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757017\"><a href=\"/opinion/757017/mark-duckworth-v-pratt-whitney-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1998).  Demars began working\r\nas an agent for National Life of Vermont (\"National Life\") in 1983. \r\nAs a National Life employee, she was entitled to enroll in a group\r\nlong-term disability policy underwritten by ICNA.  National Life's\r\ngroup policy included a \"conversion clause\" that permitted employees\r\nto convert from group disability coverage to individual policies\r\nwhen their employment with National Life came to an end.  Demars\r\ninitially enrolled in the group disability policy.  In 1990, when\r\nshe left National Life, she elected to convert her group coverage\r\nto an individual ICNA policy.\r\nICNA's conversion application consisted of two pages. \r\nThe first page, to be filled out by the applicant, asked for\r\ngeneral information.  The second page was to be completed by\r\nDemars's employer.  Since Demars had already left National Life,\r\nshe considered her employer to be Demars Financial Services, Inc.,\r\na business that she and her husband ran.  Accordingly, in response\r\nto a question about her earnings at the time of termination, she\r\ndid not report her final National Life salary; instead, she\r\nreported the gross annual commissions she earned as an employee of\r\nDemars Financial Services. \r\nIn August 1990, ICNA notified Demars that her application\r\nhad been approved, sent her a certificate of insurance for the\r\nconversion policy, and requested an initial premium payment. \r\nDemars paid the initial premium and the quarterly premiums\r\nthereafter.\r\nIn November 1993, Demars filed a claim with ICNA for long\r\nterm disability benefits.  Her claim was approved in April 1994,\r\nand ICNA commenced monthly payments of $1,972 ($3,000 less Social\r\nSecurity disability benefits) in May 1994.\r\nIn March 1997, CIGNA requested that Demars forward\r\nfinancial information pertaining to the years 1990 through 1996. \r\nAfter examining this information, CIGNA concluded that Demars had\r\nincorrectly reported her income on the conversion application, that\r\nshe was actually entitled only to a $100 minimum monthly benefit,\r\nand that ICNA had therefore overpaid her by more than $70,000\r\nbetween May 1994 and June 1997.  CIGNA sent Demars a letter dated\r\nJune 26, 1997 that explained these conclusions and informed her\r\nthat CIGNA would withhold all further monthly benefit payments (now\r\nset at $100) until she had repaid the sums allegedly owed.  Demars\r\nhas not received any benefit payments since that date.\r\nRather than repaying CIGNA the allegedly excessive\r\nbenefits and accepting the reduction in future benefits, Demars\r\nbrought suit against CIGNA and ICNA, asserting both diversity and\r\nfederal question jurisdiction.  After Demars stipulated to the\r\ndismissal of her ERISA claim and the district court granted the\r\ndefendants' motion to dismiss her state law claims, judgment was\r\nentered against Demars, who now appeals.\r\n                           II  We review de novo the legal question whether ERISA\r\npreemption applies to claims arising from a conversion policy, seeDegnan v.

We do not disagree with this point; there is\r\nobviously a type of \"but for\" relationship linking Demars's\r\nconversion policy and National Life's ERISA plan.  But \"infinite\r\nrelations cannot be the measure of pre-emption.\"  New York State\r\nConference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117928\"><a href=\"/opinion/117928/new-york-state-conference-of-blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-v-travelers/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (1995).  If a chain of \"relates to\" links could\r\nestablish ERISA preemption, then ERISA preemption and ERISA\r\nregulation could be separated in an anomalous way.  The proper\r\nquestion to ask under  1144(a) is not whether Demars's claims\r\nrelate to her conversion policy, which relates in turn to an ERISA\r\nplan, but rather whether the conversion policy is itself subject to\r\nERISA regulation as an ERISA plan.\r\nThe statute defines an \"employee welfare benefit plan\"\r\n(the type of ERISA plan at issue here, see 29 U.S.C.  1002(3)) as:\r\nany plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is\r\nhereafter established or maintained by an employer . . .\r\nfor the purpose of providing for its participants or\r\ntheir beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or\r\notherwise, . . . benefits in the event of sickness,\r\naccident, disability, death or unemployment.  \r\n\n29 U.S.C.  1002(1).  \r\nThis nearly tautological definition offers little\r\nguidance.  The key phrase for present purposes is \"established or\r\nmaintained by an employer.\"  Demars's conversion policy was\r\ncertainly \"established\" in some sense by her former employer -- but\r\nwas it \"established\" in the relevant sense?  Case law provides no\r\ndefinitive answers.  \"[N]o single act in itself necessarily\r\nconstitutes the establishment of the plan, fund, or program,\"\r\nDonovan v.

See McMahon, 162 F.3d\r\nat 35-36.  Congress wanted to safeguard employee interests by\r\nreducing the threat of abuse or mismanagement of funds that had\r\nbeen accumulated to finance employee benefits, see Fort Halifax\r\nPacking Co. v. Coyne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111901\"><a href=\"/opinion/111901/fort-halifax-packing-co-v-coyne/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1987), while at the same time\r\nsafeguarding employer interests by eliminating \"the threat of\r\nconflicting and inconsistent State and local regulation\" of\r\nemployee benefit plans, Travelers, 514 U.S. at 657 (quoting 120\r\nCong. Rec. 29197 (1974)).\r\nNeither concern seems to be strongly implicated here. \r\nThere is little threat of abuse of funds in the ERISA sense.  While\r\nthere is a risk that funds accumulated to finance benefits under\r\nthe conversion policy could be mismanaged or abused, there is no\r\nrisk of Demars's former employer abusing or mismanaging these\r\nfunds, since it does not control them, or indeed have any tie to\r\nthem.  Rather, it is the insurers who issued the policy --\r\ndefendants here -- who are in a position to possibly abuse or\r\nmismanage the funds.  Yet Congress placed into ERISA an express\r\ndisavowal of any intent to regulate insurers qua insurers.  See 29\r\nU.S.C.  1144(b)(2).\r\nThe uniformity of regulations concern is equally\r\nattenuated.  While conversion policies like Demars's undoubtedly\r\nimpose an administrative burden, that burden lies on the insurers\r\nwho provide the policy, not on the former employer.  As Fort\r\nHalifax noted, \"Congress intended pre-emption to afford employers\r\nthe advantages of a uniform set of administrative procedures\r\ngoverned by a single set of regulations.  This concern only arises\r\n. . . with respect to benefits whose provision by nature requires\r\nan ongoing administrative program to meet the employer's\r\nobligation.\"  Fort Halifax, 482 U.S. at 11.  Thus, \"an employee\r\nbenefit may be considered a plan for purposes of ERISA only if it\r\ninvolves the undertaking of continuing administrative and financial\r\nobligations by the employer.\"  Belanger, 71 F.3d at 454.  Under\r\nthis analysis, conversion policies are not ERISA plans, because\r\nemployers do not bear any administrative or financial\r\nresponsibility for them.\r\nDefendants argue that there is a residual uniformity\r\ninterest affecting employers.  They point out that if different\r\nstates can regulate conversion policies, then there will be\r\ndifferential costs associated with the provision of conversion\r\npolicies in the different states.  These differential costs could\r\ndrive up the costs of granting conversion rights and thus reduce\r\nthe incentive of employers with employee welfare benefit plans to\r\ngrant those rights.  This may or may not be true, but it does not,\r\nin any event, argue for ERISA preemption of state law claims\r\nrelating to conversion policies.  That is because \"cost uniformity\r\nwas almost certainly not an object of [ERISA] pre-emption.\" \r\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 662.  ERISA preemption was intended to\r\nguarantee regulatory uniformity, not intrastate or interstate cost\r\nuniformity.  See id. (rejecting argument that ERISA demands the\r\nequalization of \"relative costs of various health insurance\r\npackages in a given state\"); De Buono, 520 U.S. at 816 (noting that\r\nERISA does not attempt to equalize the cost of benefits across\r\nstates).  \r\nOther arguments bolster the conclusion that conversion\r\npolicies are not subject to ERISA.  A Department of Labor\r\nregulation interpreting the term \"employee welfare benefit plan,\"\r\nwhile not directly on point, provides a useful analogy.  Section\r\n2510.3-1(j) creates a \"safe harbor\" for certain \"group or group-type\r\ninsurance programs\": a group or group-type insurance program\r\noffered by an employer will not be considered to be an employee\r\nwelfare benefit plan if the employer does not make contributions to\r\nand receives no consideration from the insurer, employee\r\nparticipation in the program is voluntary, and the employer's sole\r\nfunctions are to permit the insurer to publicize the program to\r\nemployees and to collect and remit premiums to the insurer.  See 29\r\nC.F.R.  2510.3-1(j) (1998).  The regulation is not directly\r\napplicable to Demars's conversion policy, since hers is not a group\r\npolicy or even a \"group-type\" policy, and since granting a\r\nconversion right is not identical to \"publicizing\" an insurance\r\nprogram.  But the logic of ERISA suggests that a conversion policy\r\nlike Demars's would be even more securely anchored in a safe harbor\r\nthan the type of policy addressed by  2510.3-1(j), since her\r\npolicy does not require any ongoing employer involvement.\r\nMoving from analogy to contrast, the \"continuation\r\ncoverage\" mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget\r\nReconciliation Act (\"COBRA\"), 29 U.S.C.  1161 et seq., provides an\r\ninstructive counterpoint to the conversion policy considered here. \r\nCOBRA amended ERISA in 1985 to require employers to permit an\r\nemployee to continue group coverage for up to eighteen months after\r\ntermination of employment, if the employee elects to do so and\r\nagrees to reimburse the employer for up to 102% of the average per-\r\nemployee cost of that group coverage.  See 29 U.S.C.  1162. \r\nUnlike coverage under a conversion policy, COBRA continuation\r\ncoverage does place ongoing administrative burdens on the employer\r\n(since the ex-employee continues to belong to the employer's group\r\nplan), as well as ongoing financial obligations (since COBRA\r\ncoverage may in fact cost the employer more than the permitted\r\nreimbursement amount).  Given employers' ongoing administrative and\r\nfinancial involvement, courts have found that claims related to\r\nCOBRA coverage are preempted by ERISA.  See Mimbs v. Commercial\r\nLife Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491306\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491306/mimbs-v-commercial-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1560-61 (S.D. Ga. 1993)\r\n(explaining why COBRA continuation coverage is subject to ERISA\r\nregulation).\r\nCertain practical concerns -- not present in the COBRA\r\ncontext -- also suggest that state law claims related to conversion\r\npolicies should not be preempted by ERISA.  Consider, for example,\r\nthe effect on insurers if conversion policies were found to be\r\nERISA plans:  as ERISA plan administrators, insurers would be\r\nrequired to file plan descriptions and detailed annual reports with\r\nthe Department of Labor, see 29 U.S.C.  1023, 1024, and to\r\nprovide regularly updated plan summaries to the plan beneficiaries,\r\nsee 29 U.S.C.  1022.  Given the individual nature of the typical\r\nconversion policy, the insurer would presumably be required to meet\r\nthese extensive requirements separately for each individual\r\nconversion policy.  An even more unwarranted outcome would result\r\nif former employers, rather than insurers, were deemed to be ERISA\r\nplan administrators for conversion policies, since employers would\r\nthen have to meet ERISA's reporting and disclosure requirements for\r\nall of the policies issued, perhaps by a bevy of different\r\ninsurers, to an ever-growing collection of difficult-to-locate\r\nformer employees. \r\nFinally, many other courts appear to agree with our\r\nconclusion regarding the status of conversion policies, although\r\nthe compatibility of certain decisions is apparent only upon close\r\nreading.  A small set of decisions clearly reach the contrary\r\nconclusion -- but based, we believe, on unpersuasive reasoning.\r\nSeveral district courts have adopted the careful\r\ndistinction between conversion rights and conversion policies that\r\nwe drew at the outset and that was first drawn in Mimbs.  Mimbsfound that state law claims involving the right to convert are\r\npreempted by ERISA, but that claims related to the conversion\r\npolicy itself are not.  See Mimbs, 818 F. Supp. at 1561-62 (finding\r\nthat \"[a]ny claim that Defendant failed to offer proper conversion\r\nplan options . . . relates to the ERISA plan and is pre-empted by\r\nERISA,\" but that \"[t]he concerns behind ERISA pre-emption are not\r\nimplicated by state-law claims arising from obligations incurred\r\nunder the conversion policy itself\"); see also Barringer-Willis v.\r\nHealthsource North Carolina Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519489\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519489/barringer-willis-v-healthsource-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Western Farm Bureau Life Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589783\"><a href=\"/opinion/589783/patrick-d-greany-v-western-farm-bureau-life-insurance-company-a-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\r\nCir. 1992), has proven far more difficult to interpret.  The\r\ndispute underlying Greany arose when an employee was mistakenly\r\ntold that his group health insurance would terminate on a date\r\nlater than it actually did, causing a gap between his group\r\ncoverage and the conversion coverage he obtained.  See id. at 814-\r\n15.  The insurer quickly admitted its mistake and permitted the\r\nemployee to convert his policy retroactively to the actual date of\r\ntermination of the group policy.  See id.  Since the employee had\r\nalready received the full amount due to him under the conversion\r\npolicy, none of his panoply of claims against his former employer\r\nand the insurer sought benefits under that policy.  See id. at 815. \r\nThe relevant portions of Greany merely apply the first part of the\r\nMimbs rule, finding state law claims related to conversion rights\r\nto be preempted by ERISA.  See, e.g., id. at 818 (rejecting a\r\nnegligence count against the employer for its actions in procuring\r\nthe conversion policy because conversion rights are subject to\r\nERISA regulation).\r\nGreany is nevertheless cited for the proposition that\r\nconversion policies themselves are subject to ERISA regulation and\r\npreemption.  See, e.g., White, 114 F.3d at 28; Glass v. United of\r\nOmaha Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677154\"><a href=\"/opinion/677154/richard-c-glass-of-the-estate-of-execr-maxwell-c-hostetter-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1346 (11th Cir. 1994).  This\r\nseems to us to be a misreading of Greany -- an understandable\r\nmisreading in light of two problematic aspects of the opinion. \r\nFirst, the opinion uses confusing language to refer to conversion\r\nrights.  Compare Greany, 973 F.2d at 817 (referring repeatedly to\r\n\"conversion benefits\"), with id. at 823 (summarizing holding as one\r\nregarding \"conversion rights\").  Second, Greany discusses the\r\nplaintiffs' unfair claims settlement practices claim without making\r\nclear that this claim was for benefits under the group policy, not\r\nthe conversion policy.  See id. at 819.  Because the opinion does\r\nnot make this point clear, and because of its misleading use of the\r\nphrase \"conversion benefits\" to refer to conversion rights, it has\r\nbeen incorrectly interpreted -- and \"headnoted\" -- as a decision\r\nabout whether conversion policies are subject to ERISA regulation.\r\nSome decisions have squarely held that ERISA regulation\r\nextends to conversion policies, but we do not find their reasoning\r\npersuasive.  Several courts, for example, have assumed that ERISA\r\nregulation must extend to conversion policies based on an argument\r\nsimilar to the \"relates to\" argument rejected above, while failing\r\nto consider whether conversion policies implicate any of ERISA's\r\nunderlying purposes.  See, e.g., Painter v. Golden Rule Ins. Co.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744666\"><a href=\"/opinion/744666/ana-painter-v-golden-rule-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439-40 (8th Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he Conversion Policy came\r\ninto being as a result of Painter exercising her right under the\r\ngroup policy to obtain this specific insurance policy. . . .

The Court . . .\r\nfinds that the policy at issue is an 'employee benefit plan' under\r\nERISA.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\nA faulty analogy to COBRA coverage led the Sixth Circuit\r\nto decide that a certain type of conversion policy must be subject\r\nto ERISA.  See Massachusetts Casualty Ins. Co. v. Reynolds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740990\"><a href=\"/opinion/740990/massachusetts-casualty-insurance-company-v-ronald-a-reynolds/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1453 (6th Cir. 1997).  The employer in Reynolds had\r\nprovided ERISA-governed benefits to its employees by purchasing\r\nindividual disability insurance policies for them.  See id. \r\nReynolds's individual conversion policy was therefore essentially\r\nthe same policy he had had while an employee, except that after\r\nconversion it was Reynolds, rather than the employer, who was\r\nresponsible for paying the premiums and maintaining a relationship\r\nwith the insurer.  See id. at 1452.  \r\nThe Reynolds court found it critical that Reynolds did\r\nnot switch from group to individual coverage and that the terms of\r\nhis policy remained the same; these facts, said the court, made\r\nReynolds's conversion coverage akin to COBRA continuation coverage. \r\nSee id. (citing Mimbs's discussion of COBRA).  But the court's\r\nconclusion fails to reflect the actual logic behind ERISA\r\nregulation of COBRA continuation coverage.  COBRA coverage is not\r\nsubject to ERISA regulation merely because the terms of the\r\ncoverage \"continue\" the specific terms of the employer's ERISA plan;\r\nrather, COBRA coverage is subject to ERISA regulation because it\r\nimplicates both of ERISA's cardinal purposes.\r\nThe Eleventh Circuit also, we believe, misread Mimbs when\r\nit held in Glass v. United of Omaha Life Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677154\"><a href=\"/opinion/677154/richard-c-glass-of-the-estate-of-execr-maxwell-c-hostetter-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1994), that a conversion policy that provided\r\ncoverage to a group of ex-employees was \"distinguishable from Mimbsin this respect,\" id. at 1346, and therefore subject to ERISA\r\nregulation.  The court reasoned:\r\nThe conversion in the instant case, unlike that in Mimbs,\r\ndid not actually create an individual policy. It removed\r\n[the employee's] coverage from a group policy consisting\r\nof actively employed Silk Greenhouse employees and moved\r\nthe coverage to a group policy of ex-Silk Greenhouse\r\nemployees. . . . Clearly, [the employee's] ability to\r\nobtain the converted life insurance policy arose from the\r\nERISA plan, and the converted policy itself continued to\r\nbe integrally linked with the ERISA plan.  In this case,\r\nconversion . . . did not defeat ERISA regulation.\r\n\nId. at 1346-47.  By attempting to distinguish between group and\r\nindividual conversion policies, the Glass decision misunderstands\r\nthe logic of Mimbs.  Both types of conversion policy fall outside\r\nthe reach of ERISA, since what matters for ERISA purposes is not\r\nthe nature of the conversion policy but rather the nature of the\r\nemployer's ongoing administrative and financial ties to the policy. \r\nIf no such ties exist, the policy should not be subject to ERISA\r\nregulation.\r\nFinally, we note our disagreement with another frequently\r\ncited decision holding that conversion policies are subject to\r\nERISA.  The court in Nechero v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Insurance\r\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596430\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596430/nechero-v-provident-life-acc-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.N.M. 1992), also focused on the issue that\r\nwe consider central:  the extent to which conversion policies\r\nimplicate ERISA's purpose of shielding employers from inconsistent\r\nstate regulations.  See id. at 378-79.  However, contrary to what\r\nwe have concluded, the Nechero court found that conversion policies\r\ndo place a significant administrative burden on employers, because\r\nthese policies require the employer to \"track[] the insurance\r\nexpiration of departing employees, timely inform[] them of their\r\nconversion option, and assist[] in their conversion to an\r\nindividual policy if they so choose.  [The employer's] involvement\r\nis ongoing as to its employees as a whole, and requires an\r\nadministrative scheme.\"  Id. at 379.  \r\nWe agree that the administrative burdens noted in Necheroare real.  Yet because these burdens are all tied to the conversion\r\nright, rather than the conversion policy, they do not support the\r\nconclusion that conversion policies are subject to ERISA\r\nregulation.  In the end, the reasoning in Nechero supports the\r\ndistinction recognized in Mimbs between conversion rights, which\r\nare subject to ERISA, and conversion policies, which are not.\r\n                         III\r\nWe hold that Demars's conversion policy is not an\r\n\"employee welfare benefit plan\" and that Demars's state law claims\r\nrelating to the conversion policy are not preempted under\r\n1144(a).  We express no opinion, of course, as to the merits of\r\nDemars's claims against CIGNA and ICNA.\r\nReversed and remanded.  Costs to appellant.\n</pre>",
