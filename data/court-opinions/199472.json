After carefully\n\nreviewing the record and the briefs of the parties, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court for essentially\n\nthe reasons stated in the magistrate judge's Report and\n\nRecommendation   and   in   the   district   judge's   Opinion   and\n\nOrder.   Specifically, petitioner's double jeopardy argument\n\nis meritless because the Double Jeopardy Clause does not\n\napply in prison disciplinary proceedings.         Any due process\n\nargument also lacks merit because, even assuming, without\n\ndeciding, that petitioner possessed some kind of liberty\n\ninterest, he received all the process he was due under Wolff\n\nv.
