Rubinovitz (\"the Rubinovitzes\") brought  this action\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.    1983 and 1985 against various officials of\r\n\nthe    City    of    Lynn,    Massachusetts    (collectively,\r\n\n\"defendants\"),1 claiming  a violation  of their civil  rights\r\n\nby the  apparent revocation  of a previously  granted zoning-\r\n\nvariance  application and  by  the  commencement of  numerous\r\n\ncode-enforcement actions against  them.   The district  court\r\n\ngranted  defendants'  motion  for  summary  judgment.   After\r\n\ncareful  review of the record, we conclude that, as to two of\r\n\nthe   defendants,  summary  judgment  should  not  have  been\r\n\ngranted.  \r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          The  facts  leading to  this  appeal  center around\r\n\nproperty  owned by  the  Rubinovitzes that  includes an  out-\r\n\nbuilding containing an apartment  over a one-car garage (\"the\r\n\nproperty\").   On January 1, 1989, the Rubinovitzes leased the\r\n\napartment  to Laurie  A.  Lussier.   On  the same  day,  they\r\n\nreceived  a check for $500  from defendant Grace  Rogato -- a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The defendants are city purchasing director Grace Rogato,\r\nhealth inspector  Robert M.  Barrett, gas inspector  Henry P.\r\nBaron,  Board  of Appeals  chairman John  J. Burke,  Jr., and\r\nBoard  of Appeals  members Dennis  Tobin and  John Volo.   In\r\nFebruary  1993, Rogato died and her estate was substituted as\r\na party in the action.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfriend of  Lussier -- to  cover the first month's  rent and a\r\n\n$100 installment toward a $300 security deposit.  \r\n\n          Two  days  later,  on  January  3,  1989, defendant\r\n\nRobert M.  Barrett, a code inspector for  the Lynn Department\r\n\nof  Public Health,  notified the  Rubinovitzes that  the city\r\n\nrequired a certificate of occupancy before the dwelling could\r\n\nbe legally  inhabited.    Three days  later,  upon  a  visual\r\n\ninspection of the apartment, Barrett advised the Rubinovitzes\r\n\nthat  city  health regulations  required  a  second means  of\r\n\negress before the city would issue the occupancy permit.  The\r\n\ncity building department then advised the Rubinovitzes that a\r\n\nzoning  variance  was required  before  they  could obtain  a\r\n\nbuilding permit for the second means of egress.\r\n\n          Several   months   later,   in   April   1989,  the\r\n\nRubinovitzes  discovered  that  Lussier  had  a  cat  in  the\r\n\napartment,  in  violation of  the  lease.    Acting  on  that\r\n\nviolation,  on  April  10,  1989,  the  Rubinovitzes notified\r\n\nLussier that  her tenancy  would terminate effective  May 31,\r\n\n1989.  On  April 20,  1989, Rogato went  to Mr.  Rubinovitz's\r\n\nbusiness,  an   office  supply   store,  and   asked  whether\r\n\nRubinovitz intended  to give Lussier  a \"hard time.\"   Rogato\r\n\nfurther asked whether the  security deposit would be returned\r\n\nto her.\r\n\n          On May  2, 1989, the  Rubinovitzes' application for\r\n\nthe zoning variance came  before a hearing of the  Lynn Board\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nof  Appeals (\"the  Board\").   By  a  vote of  4-1, the  Board\r\n\napproved the variance.  Two or three days later, Rogato spoke\r\n\nwith  Nancy Amenta, the clerk  for the Board,  and asked what\r\n\nhad transpired as to the property at the May 2 hearing.  \r\n\n          At  some   point,   after  Lussier   occupied   the\r\n\napartment,  defendant  Barrett  apparently   reinspected  the\r\n\nproperty.   On May  4, 1989, Barrett  at a  meeting with  Mr.\r\n\nRubinovitz,  presented  him with  an  order  to make  various\r\n\nrepairs within seven days.  Barrett also told Rubinovitz that\r\n\nRogato had been calling the health  department \"every hour on\r\n\nthe  hour\"  regarding the  property  and  was pressuring  the\r\n\ndepartment to bring enforcement actions.\r\n\n          Later that day, the  Rubinovitzes wrote a letter to\r\n\nthe director of public health, Gerald M. Carpinella (the \"May\r\n\n4 letter\"), in which they requested a hearing on the order to\r\n\nrepair.  The letter also stated:\r\n\n          [We] request that the type  of harassment\r\n          that  [we] have  been subjected  to cease\r\n          immediately, as  [we] are well  aware and\r\n          have  been informed that  this stems from\r\n          cronyism  and blatant misuse of power and\r\n          authority  brought  on by  the Purchasing\r\n          Director, Grace Rogato.\r\n\n          Carpinella  discussed  the   letter  with   Rogato.\r\n\nSubsequent to  the May  2 variance hearing,  the Rubinovitzes\r\n\nreceived two  post cards from  the Board notifying  them that\r\n\nthe  Board  had approved  their request.    On May  11, 1989,\r\n\nhowever, the  Rubinovitzes received  a letter from  the Board\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nnotifying  them  that  the  May  2 hearing  (at  which  their\r\n\nvariance request had been  approved) had been continued until\r\n\nMay  16, 1989.   At  the continued  hearing, defendant  Board\r\n\nchairman  John J. Burke, Jr.,  moved to reconsider  the May 2\r\n\nvote, and Burke and defendant  Board member Dennis Tobin then\r\n\nreversed  their  earlier  votes to  grant  the  Rubinovitzes'\r\n\npetition.     Thus,  on  reconsideration,  the  Rubinovitzes'\r\n\npetition failed by a 3-2 vote.\r\n\n          On June 2, 1989, defendant Henry P. Baron, the city\r\n\ngas  inspector, wrote  to  public health  director Carpinella\r\n\nadvising  that gas  service  to the  Rubinovitz apartment  be\r\n\ndiscontinued because  of alleged safety problems.   Five days\r\n\nlater, Carpinella wrote to  the Rubinovitzes advising them of\r\n\nnumerous violations of state plumbing and gas codes.  On July\r\n\n12, 1989, the city plumbing inspector, Gerald Capano, ordered\r\n\nthe  Rubinovitzes   to   disconnect  the   water  and   sewer\r\n\nconnections to  the apartment because  they lacked  requisite\r\n\npermits.   On  July 14,  1989, Baron  ordered the  Boston Gas\r\n\nCompany  to  disconnect the  gas  service  to the  Rubinovitz\r\n\napartment because of the lack of a permit.  Later, Baron told\r\n\na  contractor hired  by the  Rubinovitzes to  stay away  from\r\n\nthem,  characterizing  the Rubinovitzes  as \"bad  people\" and\r\n\ncalling Mrs. Rubinovitz \"a bitch.\"\r\n\n          Meanwhile,  the  Rubinovitzes   had  appealed   the\r\n\nBoard's variance order  to the Massachusetts  Superior Court.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nOn January 10, 1991,  the Superior Court vacated  the Board's\r\n\nreconsideration vote, thereby  reinstating the  Rubinovitzes'\r\n\nvariance.\r\n\n          The  Rubinovitzes filed the present action under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983 against  defendants alleging violation of their\r\n\nequal  protection rights,  their rights  to free  speech, and\r\n\ntheir  property   rights.    The  Rubinovitzes   also  allege\r\n\nviolation  of  42  U.S.C.      1985.    Following  discovery,\r\n\ndefendants moved  to dismiss.  The district court treated the\r\n\nmotion as one for summary judgment  and, following a hearing,\r\n\nruled from  the bench  that the Rubinovitzes'  claims, though\r\n\nstyled   under   different    theories,   amounted   to   one\r\n\nconstitutional claim:  that they were denied equal protection\r\n\nunder  the law  by being  singled out  by Lynn  officials for\r\n\nexercising their property  rights (in  evicting Lussier)  and\r\n\nfor exercising their  rights to free  speech (in sending  the\r\n\nMay  4  letter).    The  district  court  determined  that  a\r\n\nlandlord's right  to evict  a tenant  is  \"a matter  uniquely\r\n\ngrounded  in  state  property  law  and  does  not  implicate\r\n\nconstitutional rights triggering the  protections of   1983.\"\r\n\nAs to  free speech,  the district  court determined  that the\r\n\nRubinovitzes \"failed to  show any  causal connection  between\r\n\nthe  May 4  letter and  Miss Rogato's  alleged conspiratorial\r\n\ncampaign against  them.\"  In  fact, the district  court said,\r\n\nRogato's  motivation  appeared   to  be  malice   toward  the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nRubinovitzes  because of  their eviction  proceedings against\r\n\nLussier rather  than retaliation for their  exercise of their\r\n\nfree speech rights.   Accordingly, the district court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment as to all counts.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.

We resolve  all reasonable\r\n\ninferences in  that party's  favor, but  \"we need  not credit\r\n\npurely conclusory allegations,  indulge in rank  speculation,\r\n\nor draw improbable inferences.\"  National Amusements, Inc. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nTown  of Dedham, 43 F.3d  731, 736 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n115 S.

The Rubinovitzes charge  defendants with improper\r\n\nselective enforcement  of  lawful  local  regulations.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nLeClair  v. Saunders, 627 F.2d 606, 608 (2d Cir. 1980), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 450 U.S. 959  (1981).  Specifically, the Rubinovitzes\r                  \r\n\nargue  that   the  Board's  about-face   on  their   variance\r\n\napplication as well as the litany of code-enforcement actions\r\n\nwere  retaliatory   and  singled   them  out  for   disparate\r\n\ntreatment.  As we have stated before:\r\n\n          Liability  in the  instant type  of equal\r\n          protection  case  should depend  on proof\r\n          that (1) the person, compared with others\r\n          similarly   situated,   was   selectively\r\n          treated;  and  (2)  that  such  selective\r\n          treatment  was   based  on  impermissible\r\n          considerations  such  as race,  religion,\r\n          intent to inhibit  or punish the exercise\r\n          of constitutional rights, or malicious or\r\n          bad faith intent to injure a person.\r\n\nYerardi's  Moody St. Restaurant  &amp; Lounge,  Inc. v.  Board of\r                                                                         \r\n\nSelectmen, 878 F.2d 16,  21 (1st Cir. 1989) (citing  LeClair,\r                                                                        \r\n\n627 F.2d at 609-610).  The  Rubinovitzes argue that liability\r\n\narises because:   first, defendants treated them selectively;\r\n\nsecond, the  selective treatment was based  upon the exercise\r\n\nof  their  property  and   free  speech  rights;  and  third,\r\n\ndefendants'  actions  constituted  \"malicious  or  bad  faith\r\n\nintent to injure.\" \r\n\n          To facilitate the analysis  of this case, we divide\r\n\nthe  events described above  into two broad  categories:  the\r\n\nzoning-variance approval revocation and  the code-enforcement\r\n\nactions.    Turning  first to  the  zoning-variance  approval\r\n\nissue, we conclude  that the Rubinovitzes have not  offered a\r\n\nsufficient  basis   for  us   to  conclude  that   they  were\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nselectively treated.  Plaintiffs claiming an equal protection\r\n\nviolation must first \"identify and relate  specific instances\r\n\nwhere persons  situated similarly `in  all relevant  aspects'\r\n\nwere treated differently,  instances which have  the capacity\r\n\nto  demonstrate that [plaintiffs] were `singled . . . out for\r\n\nunlawful  oppression.'\"     Dartmouth  Review   v.

In   opposition   to  summary   judgment,  Mr.\r\n\nRubinovitz's affidavit states: \"there are at least [thirteen]\r\n\nproperties in  the neighborhood  in which  I live  which have\r\n\nstructures to the rear of the main dwelling which are used as\r\n\ndwelling  units .  . .  . All  of the  properties are  within\r\n\napproximately two  blocks of my  property.\"  Appended  to the\r\n\naffidavit were pictures of  the property and thirteen similar\r\n\nstructures.     From   this  submission,   the   Rubinovitzes\r\n\napparently  ask us  to infer  that the Board  readily granted\r\n\ntheir neighbors variance requests.  However, the Rubinovitzes\r\n\nfail to present any evidence that any of their neighbors were\r\n\neither  required to seek a  variance or actually  made such a\r\n\nrequest of the Board.  Thus, there is no basis  in the record\r\n\nby  which  we  can   determine  that  the  Rubinovitzes  were\r\n\n\"`singled  . . . out for  unlawful oppression,'\" id. (quoting\r                                                                \r\n\n(Burt  v.

For\r\n\nexample,  the Rubinovitzes  point  to the  affidavit of  city\r\n\nplumbing inspector Capano, in which he states that (1) he had\r\n\nencountered other  instances where there was  plumbing but no\r\n\npermits and (2) he did  not order the plumbing  disconnected,\r\n\nas  he had with the Rubinovitzes.  As to code-enforcement, we\r\n\nthink the  record contains sufficient  evidence of  selective\r\n\ntreatment  to forestall  summary judgment.   Accordingly, the\r\n\nbalance  of our  analysis  focuses on  the defendants'  code-\r\n\nenforcement efforts against the Rubinovitzes.  \r\n\n          The second prong of the Yerardi's analysis requires\r                                                       \r\n\nus   to   determine  whether   defendants  singled   out  the\r\n\nRubinovitzes for  an improper  purpose.  The  Rubinovitzes do\r\n\nnot  allege  that  the  disparate treatment  flowed  from  an\r\n\ninvidious classification involving race or religion.  Rather,\r\n\nthe Rubinovitzes argue that  defendants sought to punish them\r\n\nfor  the  exercise  of  fundamental   constitutional  rights.\r\n\nFirst, although not entirely clear from their arguments below\r\n\nand  to this  court, the Rubinovitzes  appear to  allege that\r\n\ndefendants  punished  them  for  exercising  their \"right  to\r\n\nevict\"  Lussier.   The  Rubinovitzes  rely  on language  from\r\n\nCorrea-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,  903 F.2d 49,  53 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nCir. 1990) (quoting Board  of Regents v. Roth, 408  U.S. 564,\r                                                         \r\n\n577  (1972)), holding  that, in  a deprivation-of-due-process\r\n\nanalysis,  protected   property  interests  \"`stem   from  an\r\n\nindependent source such as state law.'\"  Even assuming that a\r\n\nright  to  evict  a  tenant would  be  a  protected  property\r\n\ninterest under Roth for  purposes of a due process  claim, it\r                               \r\n\ndoes not follow that  there is a fundamental right  to evict,\r\n\nthe  exercise of which  is protected by  the Equal Protection\r\n\nClause.    In  fact,  the Constitution  establishes  no  such\r\n\nfundamental right.\r\n\n          The Rubinovitzes mount another argument grounded in\r\n\nfundamental constitutional rights.  Specifically, they allege\r\n\nthat defendants' code-enforcement actions  were an attempt to\r\n\npunish  the Rubinovitzes for the May 4 letter.  This argument\r\n\nalso falls short, but for a different reason.  Free speech is\r\n\na  fundamental right  but, to  survive summary  judgment, the\r\n\nRubinovitzes must offer some proof that defendants' allegedly\r\n\nretaliatory actions were  motivated by the  protected speech.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Cloutier v. Town  of Epping, 714  F.2d 1184, 1192\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1983); Packish  v. McMurtrie, 697 F.2d 23,  26 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir.  1983).  The Rubinovitzes  point to ten  facts that they\r\n\ncontend constitute  evidence of  retaliatory motive.   We are\r\n\nunconvinced.   The  Rubinovitzes adduce  no  direct  evidence\r\n\nestablishing retaliatory motive.  Instead, they rely entirely\r\n\non circumstantial  evidence:   that  is, enforcement  actions\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nfollowed the  May 4 letter.   Indeed, the facts  to which the\r\n\nRubinovitzes point  do nothing  more than lay  out the  basic\r\n\nrubric of the case:  e.g., the Board approved the variance on\r                                     \r\n\nMay  2; Rogato  contacted  the Board  regarding the  variance\r\n\nafter  May  2;  the May  4  letter  was  sent to  Carpinella;\r\n\nCarpinella  discussed  the  May  4 letter  with  Rogato;  the\r\n\nRubinovitzes  received  notice  that the  variance  had  been\r\n\napproved; on May 16,  the Board reversed its decision  on the\r\n\nvariance  and  various  code  enforcement  actions  had  been\r\n\ncommenced against the property beginning in January 1989.\r\n\n          This  recitation  is  insufficient  to  support  an\r\n\ninference of improper motive.  As the Rubinovitzes themselves\r\n\npoint out, the city's code-enforcement activity had been well\r\n\nunderway for four months prior to the May 4 letter.  In fact,\r\n\nthe Rubinovitzes wrote the May 4 letter immediately following\r\n\nBarrett's  meeting with Mr.  Rubinovitz during  which Barrett\r\n\nboth presented an order to  repair and related Rogato's  pre-\r\n\nMay  4 pressure to bring code-enforcement actions.  The May 4\r\n\nletter  itself complained  about the  \"harassment\"  from city\r\n\nofficials.    Although  the  Rubinovitzes  contend  that  the\r\n\n\"principal  wrongful  actions\" took  place  after  the May  4\r\n\nletter, they offer  no basis upon  which to distinguish  pre-\r\n\nand post-May 4  harassment.  Of course,  on summary judgment,\r\n\nwe must  draw  all  reasonable  inferences in  favor  of  the\r\n\nnonmoving  party.    However,  those  inferences  \"must  flow\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nrationally from  the underlying  facts; that is,  a suggested\r\n\ninference  must  ascend  to   what  common  sense  and  human\r\n\nexperience indicates is an acceptable level of  probability.\"\r\n\nNational  Amusements, 43  F.3d at 743.   The  record suggests\r                                \r\n\nthat  although the  city  had focused  its  attention on  the\r\n\nproperty  prior  to  the  Lussier  eviction,  the  heightened\r\n\nattention began after  the eviction notice but before the May\r\n\n4  letter.    We  think   the  inference  suggested  by   the\r\n\nRubinovitzes rests on a \"`tenuous insinuation,'\" id. (quoting\r                                                                \r\n\nMesnick v.

Accordingly, we  conclude\r\n\nthat  the record  fails  to  support  an inference  that  the\r\n\nofficials' post-May 4 conduct was  in retaliation for the May\r\n\n4 letter.  \r\n\n          Finally,   as  noted  above,   in  the  absence  of\r\n\ninvidious discrimination or the abuse of a fundamental right,\r\n\na  party may  establish  an equal  protection violation  with\r\n\nevidence  of  bad  faith   or  malicious  intent  to  injure.\r\n\nYerardi's, 878  F.2d  at 21;  see  also Yerardi's  Moody  St.\r                                                                         \r\n\nRestaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. v.

Cf. Esmail v.  Macrane, 53  F.3d 176\r                                                           \r\n\n(7th Cir.  1995) (campaign of severe  harassment orchestrated\r\n\nby mayor).  But we need  not resolve such issues in this case\r\n\nbeyond  cautioning that routine  claims that  some individual\r\n\naction was malicious are  likely to have rough sailing.   For\r\n\nhere  we think  there  is enough  indication  of a  malicious\r\n\norchestrated campaign causing  substantial harm--though  only\r\n\nbarely enough  evidence--that the case cannot  be resolved on\r\n\nsummary judgment.\r\n\n          Although Rogato had  no official  authority in  the\r\n\nmatter, there  is certainly evidence that  she was personally\r\n\nhostile  to   the  Rubinovitzes  based   on  her   resentment\r\n\nconcerning   Lussier's  eviction,  that  she  had  sought  to\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nintervene  with  the  Rubinovitzes  personally  on  Lussier's\r\n\nbehalf,   that  she  had   repeatedly  pressured  the  health\r\n\ndepartment to  bring enforcement  actions, that she  had kept\r\n\ntrack  of  the Board  proceedings, and  that  in May  she had\r\n\nconferred with  Carpinella, the  public health director,  not\r\n\nlong  before the cut-off orders.   Rogato was  an official of\r\n\nthe  city  and, in  a  relatively small  unit  of government,\r\n\nalmost certainly had access and  influence beyond that of  an\r\n\nordinary outsider.\r\n\n          Putting  aside  the  Board's reconsideration  vote,\r\n\nthese  actions by Rogato  were followed by  Baron's advice to\r\n\nCarpinella   that  gas   service  to   the   Rubinovitzes  be\r\n\ndiscontinued   (June   2),   Carpinella's   notice   to   the\r\n\nRubinovitzes advising  them of numerous violations  (June 7),\r\n\nCapano's order to disconnect water and sewer hook-ups  to the\r\n\napartment  (July  12), and  Baron's  order to  Boston  Gas to\r\n\ndisconnect gas service (July 14).  Baron thereafter sought to\r\n\ninterfere  with  the Rubinovitzes'  hiring  of a  contractor,\r\n\nusing language about them (\"bad people,\" \"bitch\") redolent of\r\n\nmalice.    In  the case  of  both  cut-offs,  there was  some\r                                             \r\n\nevidence  that other  residents  similarly  situated did  not\r\n\nsuffer the same penalty.\r\n\n          Under  these circumstances, we  think that although\r\n\nthe  case  might be  a difficult  one  for the  plaintiffs, a\r\n\nreasonable jury might well be able to conclude that there was\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nan orchestrated conspiracy  involving a number of  officials,\r\n\nselective enforcement,  malice,  and substantial  harm.    Of\r\n\ncourse, the full presentation of evidence on both sides might\r\n\nalter this judgment  and show that  the plaintiffs fell  just\r\n\nshort and would be subject to a directed verdict.  But at the\r\n\nsummary  judgment  stage, with  the  obligation  to draw  all\r\n\nreasonable inferences in favor  of the party opposing summary\r\n\njudgment, we  think  that this  case could  not be  dismissed\r\n\nagainst all defendants.\r\n\n          We think  that Barrett, also named  as a defendant,\r\n\nwas  properly granted summary judgment; his own investigation\r\n\nof   code   violations   began  well   before   the  eviction\r\n\ncontroversy, and  --while his report of  Rogato's pressure is\r\n\nhighly pertinent evidence--there is  no evidence that Barrett\r\n\nwas himself involved in either of the cut-off directives.  As\r\n\nfor  Carpinella  and Capano,  there  is no  need  to consider\r\n\nwhether  the evidence might  be sufficient as  to them, since\r\n\nthey  were not named as defendants and it is almost certainly\r\n\ntoo  late  in  the day  to  consider  any  expansion of  this\r\n\nlawsuit.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          For the  foregoing  reasons, the  judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court is vacated as to  defendants Rogato and Baron\r                                      \r\n\nand  the case remanded as  to them for proceedings consistent\r                                  \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nwith  this opinion.

On January 1, 1989, the Rubinovitzes leased the apartment to Laurie A. Lussier.  On the same day, they received a check for $500 from defendant Grace Rogato--a friend of Lussier--to cover the first month's rent and a $100 installment toward a $300 security deposit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days later, on January 3, 1989, defendant Robert M. Barrett, a code inspector for the Lynn Department of Public Health, notified the Rubinovitzes that the city required a certificate of occupancy before the dwelling could be legally inhabited.  Three days later, upon a visual inspection of the apartment, Barrett advised the Rubinovitzes that city health regulations required a second means of egress before the city would issue the occupancy permit.  The city building department then advised the Rubinovitzes that a zoning variance was required before they could obtain a building permit for the second means of egress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, in April 1989, the Rubinovitzes discovered that Lussier had a cat in the apartment, in violation of the lease.  Acting on that violation, on April 10, 1989, the Rubinovitzes notified Lussier that her tenancy would terminate effective May 31, 1989.  On April 20, 1989, Rogato went to Mr. Rubinovitz's business, an office supply store, and asked whether Rubinovitz intended to give Lussier a \"hard time.\"   Rogato further asked whether the security deposit would be returned to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1989, the Rubinovitzes' application for the zoning variance came before a hearing of the Lynn Board of Appeals (\"the Board\").  By a vote of 4-1, the Board approved the variance.  Two or three days later, Rogato spoke with Nancy Amenta, the clerk for the Board, and asked what had transpired as to the property at the May 2 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point, after Lussier occupied the apartment, defendant Barrett apparently reinspected the property.  On May 4, 1989, Barrett at a meeting with Mr. Rubinovitz, presented him with an order to make various repairs within seven days.  Barrett also told Rubinovitz that Rogato had been calling the health department \"every hour on the hour\" regarding the property and was pressuring the department to bring enforcement actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, the Rubinovitzes wrote a letter to the director of public health, Gerald M. Carpinella (the \"May 4 letter\"), in which they requested a hearing on the order to repair.  The letter also stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[We] request that the type of harassment that [we] have been subjected to cease immediately, as [we] are well aware and have been informed that this stems from cronyism and blatant misuse of power and authority brought on by the Purchasing Director, Grace Rogato.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpinella discussed the letter with Rogato.  Subsequent to the May 2 variance hearing, the Rubinovitzes received two post cards from the Board notifying them that the Board had approved their request.  On May 11, 1989, however, the Rubinovitzes received a letter from the Board notifying them that the May 2 hearing (at which their variance request had been approved) had been continued until May 16, 1989.  At the continued hearing, defendant Board chairman John J. Burke, Jr., moved to reconsider the May 2 vote, and Burke and defendant Board member Dennis Tobin then reversed their earlier votes to grant the Rubinovitzes' petition.  Thus, on reconsideration, the Rubinovitzes' petition failed by a 3-2 vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1989, defendant Henry P. Baron, the city gas inspector, wrote to public health director Carpinella advising that gas service to the Rubinovitz apartment be discontinued because of alleged safety problems.  Five days later, Carpinella wrote to the Rubinovitzes advising them of numerous violations of state plumbing and gas codes.  On July 12, 1989, the city plumbing inspector, Gerald Capano, ordered the Rubinovitzes to disconnect the water and sewer connections to the apartment because they lacked requisite permits.  On July 14, 1989, Baron ordered the Boston Gas Company to disconnect the gas service to the Rubinovitz apartment because of the lack of a permit.  Later, Baron told a contractor hired by the Rubinovitzes to stay away from them, characterizing the Rubinovitzes as \"bad people\" and calling Mrs. Rubinovitz \"a bitch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Rubinovitzes had appealed the Board's variance order to the Massachusetts Superior Court.  On January 10, 1991, the Superior Court vacated the Board's reconsideration vote, thereby reinstating the Rubinovitzes' variance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rubinovitzes filed the present action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 against defendants alleging violation of their equal protection rights, their rights to free speech, and their property rights.  The Rubinovitzes also allege violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985.  Following discovery, defendants moved to dismiss.  The district court treated the motion as one for summary judgment and, following a hearing, ruled from the bench that the Rubinovitzes' claims, though styled under different theories, amounted to one constitutional claim:  that they were denied equal protection under the law by being singled out by Lynn officials for exercising their property rights (in evicting Lussier) and for exercising their rights to free speech (in sending the May 4 letter).  The district court determined that a landlord's right to evict a tenant is \"a matter uniquely grounded in state property law and does not implicate constitutional rights triggering the protections of Sec. 1983.\"   As to free speech, the district court determined that the Rubinovitzes \"failed to show any causal connection between the May 4 letter and Miss Rogato's alleged conspiratorial campaign against them.\"   In fact, the district court said, Rogato's motivation appeared to be malice toward the Rubinovitzes because of their eviction proceedings against Lussier rather than retaliation for their exercise of their free speech rights.  Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment as to all counts.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, considering the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See, e.g., Udo v. Tomes, 54 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1995).  We resolve all reasonable inferences in that party's favor, but \"we need not credit purely conclusory allegations, indulge in rank speculation, or draw improbable inferences.\"  National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 736 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2247, 132 L.Ed.2d 255 (1995).  Summary judgment should be granted when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first set out the analytical framework for our decision.  The Rubinovitzes charge defendants with improper selective enforcement of lawful local regulations.  See LeClair v. Saunders, 627 F.2d 606, 608 (2d Cir.1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S.Ct. 1418, 67 L.Ed.2d 383 (1981).  Specifically, the Rubinovitzes argue that the Board's about-face on their variance application as well as the litany of code-enforcement actions were retaliatory and singled them out for disparate treatment.  As we have stated before:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Liability in the instant type of equal protection case should depend on proof that (1) the person, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively treated;  and (2) that such selective treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yerardi's Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen, 878 F.2d 16, 21 (1st Cir.1989) (citing LeClair, 627 F.2d at 609-610).   The Rubinovitzes argue that liability arises because:  first, defendants treated them selectively;  second, the selective treatment was based upon the exercise of their property and free speech rights;  and third, defendants' actions constituted \"malicious or bad faith intent to injure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To facilitate the analysis of this case, we divide the events described above into two broad categories:  the zoning-variance approval revocation and the code-enforcement actions.  Turning first to the zoning-variance approval issue, we conclude that the Rubinovitzes have not offered a sufficient basis for us to conclude that they were selectively treated.  Plaintiffs claiming an equal protection violation must first \"identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly 'in all relevant aspects' were treated differently, instances which have the capacity to demonstrate that [plaintiffs] were 'singled ... out for unlawful oppression.' \"  Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir.1989) (citations omitted).  The Rubinovitzes neither identify others who were similarly situated, nor do they identify any instances of disparate treatment.  In opposition to summary judgment, Mr. Rubinovitz's affidavit states:  \"there are at least [thirteen] properties in the neighborhood in which I live which have structures to the rear of the main dwelling which are used as dwelling units....  All of the properties are within approximately two blocks of my property.\"   Appended to the affidavit were pictures of the property and thirteen similar structures.  From this submission, the Rubinovitzes apparently ask us to infer that the Board readily granted their neighbors variance requests.  However, the Rubinovitzes fail to present any evidence that any of their neighbors were either required to seek a variance or actually made such a request of the Board.  Thus, there is no basis in the record by which we can determine that the Rubinovitzes were \" 'singled ... out for unlawful oppression,' \" id.  (quoting Burt v. City of New York, 156 F.2d 791, 791 (2d Cir.1946) (L. Hand, J.)), or that they \"suffered what others in general have escaped,\" Burt, 156 F.2d at 791.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rubinovitzes' complaint of selective code-enforcement actions stands on far firmer ground.  For example, the Rubinovitzes point to the affidavit of city plumbing inspector Capano, in which he states that (1) he had encountered other instances where there was plumbing but no permits and (2) he did not order the plumbing disconnected, as he had with the Rubinovitzes.  As to code-enforcement, we think the record contains sufficient evidence of selective treatment to forestall summary judgment.  Accordingly, the balance of our analysis focuses on the defendants' code-enforcement efforts against the Rubinovitzes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the Yerardi's analysis requires us to determine whether defendants singled out the Rubinovitzes for an improper purpose.  The Rubinovitzes do not allege that the disparate treatment flowed from an invidious classification involving race or religion.  Rather, the Rubinovitzes argue that defendants sought to punish them for the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights.  First, although not entirely clear from their arguments below and to this court, the Rubinovitzes appear to allege that defendants punished them for exercising their \"right to evict\" Lussier.  The Rubinovitzes rely on language from Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 53 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)), holding that, in a deprivation-of-due-process analysis, protected property interests \" 'stem from an independent source such as state law.' \"   Even assuming that a right to evict a tenant would be a protected property interest under Roth for purposes of a due process claim, it does not follow that there is a fundamental right to evict, the exercise of which is protected by the Equal Protection Clause.  In fact, the Constitution establishes no such fundamental right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rubinovitzes mount another argument grounded in fundamental constitutional rights.  Specifically, they allege that defendants' code-enforcement actions were an attempt to punish the Rubinovitzes for the May 4 letter.  This argument also falls short, but for a different reason.  Free speech is a fundamental right but, to survive summary judgment, the Rubinovitzes must offer some proof that defendants' allegedly retaliatory actions were motivated by the protected speech.  See, e.g., Cloutier v. Town of Epping, 714 F.2d 1184, 1192 (1st Cir.1983);  Packish v. McMurtrie, 697 F.2d 23, 26 (1st Cir.1983).  The Rubinovitzes point to ten facts that they contend constitute evidence of retaliatory motive.  We are unconvinced.  The Rubinovitzes adduce no direct evidence establishing retaliatory motive.  Instead, they rely entirely on circumstantial evidence:  that is, enforcement actions followed the May 4 letter.  Indeed, the facts to which the Rubinovitzes point do nothing more than lay out the basic rubric of the case:  e.g., the Board approved the variance on May 2;  Rogato contacted the Board regarding the variance after May 2;  the May 4 letter was sent to Carpinella;  Carpinella discussed the May 4 letter with Rogato;  the Rubinovitzes received notice that the variance had been approved;  on May 16, the Board reversed its decision on the variance and various code enforcement actions had been commenced against the property beginning in January 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This recitation is insufficient to support an inference of improper motive.  As the Rubinovitzes themselves point out, the city's code-enforcement activity had been well underway for four months prior to the May 4 letter.  In fact, the Rubinovitzes wrote the May 4 letter immediately following Barrett's meeting with Mr. Rubinovitz during which Barrett both presented an order to repair and related Rogato's pre-May 4 pressure to bring code-enforcement actions.  The May 4 letter itself complained about the \"harassment\" from city officials.  Although the Rubinovitzes contend that the \"principal wrongful actions\" took place after the May 4 letter, they offer no basis upon which to distinguish pre- and post-May 4 harassment.  Of course, on summary judgment, we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  However, those inferences \"must flow rationally from the underlying facts;  that is, a suggested inference must ascend to what common sense and human experience indicates is an acceptable level of probability.\"  National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 743.   The record suggests that although the city had focused its attention on the property prior to the Lussier eviction, the heightened attention began after the eviction notice but before the May 4 letter.  We think the inference suggested by the Rubinovitzes rests on a \" 'tenuous insinuation,' \" id.  (quoting Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 820 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992)), rather than an acceptable level of probability.  Accordingly, we conclude that the record fails to support an inference that the officials' post-May 4 conduct was in retaliation for the May 4 letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as noted above, in the absence of invidious discrimination or the abuse of a fundamental right, a party may establish an equal protection violation with evidence of bad faith or malicious intent to injure.  Yerardi's, 878 F.2d at 21;  see also Yerardi's Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen, 932 F.2d 89, 94 (1st Cir.1991) (hereinafter, \"Yerardi's II \").   We start with two related observations.  First, bad-faith or malicious-intent-to-injure cases are infrequent.  Yerardi's II, 932 F.2d at 94 (citing PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rene Alberto Rodriguez, 928 F.2d 28, 33 (1st Cir.1991) (noting in the zoning context that \"[e]very appeal ... from an adverse ruling ... necessarily involves some claim that the board exceeded, abused or distorted its legal authority in some manner\") (quotations and citations omitted), cert. dismissed, 503 U.S. 257, 112 S.Ct. 1151, 117 L.Ed.2d 400 (1992)).  Second, \" 'the malice/bad faith standard should be scrupulously met.' \"  Yerardi's II, 932 F.2d at 94 (quoting LeClair, 627 F.2d at 611).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, despite the general language of Yerardi's, at least one member of this panel believes that something substantially more than a single act of malice underlying some routine administrative action is necessary to make out a constitutional claim.  Cf. Esmail v. Macrane, 53 F.3d 176 (7th Cir.1995) (campaign of severe harassment orchestrated by mayor).  But we need not resolve such issues in this case beyond cautioning that routine claims that some individual action was malicious are likely to have rough sailing.  For here we think there is enough indication of a malicious orchestrated campaign causing substantial harm--though only barely enough evidence--that the case cannot be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rogato had no official authority in the matter, there is certainly evidence that she was personally hostile to the Rubinovitzes based on her resentment concerning Lussier's eviction, that she had sought to intervene with the Rubinovitzes personally on Lussier's behalf, that she had repeatedly pressured the health department to bring enforcement actions, that she had kept track of the Board proceedings, and that in May she had conferred with Carpinella, the public health director, not long before the cut-off orders.  Rogato was an official of the city and, in a relatively small unit of government, almost certainly had access and influence beyond that of an ordinary outsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside the Board's reconsideration vote, these actions by Rogato were followed by Baron's advice to Carpinella that gas service to the Rubinovitzes be discontinued (June 2), Carpinella's notice to the Rubinovitzes advising them of numerous violations (June 7), Capano's order to disconnect water and sewer hook-ups to the apartment (July 12), and Baron's order to Boston Gas to disconnect gas service (July 14).  Baron thereafter sought to interfere with the Rubinovitzes' hiring of a contractor, using language about them (\"bad people,\" \"bitch\") redolent of malice.  In the case of both cut-offs, there was some evidence that other residents similarly situated did not suffer the same penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we think that although the case might be a difficult one for the plaintiffs, a reasonable jury might well be able to conclude that there was an orchestrated conspiracy involving a number of officials, selective enforcement, malice, and substantial harm.  Of course, the full presentation of evidence on both sides might alter this judgment and show that the plaintiffs fell just short and would be subject to a directed verdict.  But at the summary judgment stage, with the obligation to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment, we think that this case could not be dismissed against all defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that Barrett, also named as a defendant, was properly granted summary judgment;  his own investigation of code violations began well before the eviction controversy, and--while his report of Rogato's pressure is highly pertinent evidence--there is no evidence that Barrett was himself involved in either of the cut-off directives.  As for Carpinella and Capano, there is no need to consider whether the evidence might be sufficient as to them, since they were not named as defendants and it is almost certainly too late in the day to consider any expansion of this lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is vacated as to defendants Rogato and Baron and the case remanded as to them for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  As to all other defendants, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendants are city purchasing director Grace Rogato, health inspector Robert M.

Rubinovitz (\"the Rubinovitzes\") brought this action under 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1983 and 1985 against various officials of the City of Lynn, Massachusetts (collectively, \"defendants\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> claiming a violation of their civil rights by the apparent revocation of a previously granted zoning-variance application and by the commencement of numerous code-enforcement actions against them.  The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.  After careful review of the record, we conclude that, as to two of the defendants, summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts leading to this appeal center around property owned by the Rubinovitzes that includes an out-building containing an apartment over a one-car garage (\"the property\").  On January 1, 1989, the Rubinovitzes leased the apartment to Laurie A. Lussier.  On the same day, they received a check for $500 from defendant Grace Rogato--a friend of Lussier--to cover the first month's rent and a $100 installment toward a $300 security deposit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days later, on January 3, 1989, defendant Robert M. Barrett, a code inspector for the Lynn Department of Public Health, notified the Rubinovitzes that the city required a certificate of occupancy before the dwelling could be legally inhabited.  Three days later, upon a visual inspection of the apartment, Barrett advised the Rubinovitzes that city health regulations required a second means of egress before the city would issue the occupancy permit.  The city building department then advised the Rubinovitzes that a zoning variance was required before they could obtain a building permit for the second means of egress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, in April 1989, the Rubinovitzes discovered that Lussier had a cat in the apartment, in violation of the lease.  Acting on that violation, on April 10, 1989, the Rubinovitzes notified Lussier that her tenancy would terminate effective May 31, 1989.  On April 20, 1989, Rogato went to Mr. Rubinovitz's business, an office supply store, and asked whether Rubinovitz intended to give Lussier a \"hard time.\"   Rogato further asked whether the security deposit would be returned to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1989, the Rubinovitzes' application for the zoning variance came before a hearing of the Lynn Board of Appeals (\"the Board\").  By a vote of 4-1, the Board approved the variance.  Two or three days later, Rogato spoke with Nancy Amenta, the clerk for the Board, and asked what had transpired as to the property at the May 2 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point, after Lussier occupied the apartment, defendant Barrett apparently reinspected the property.  On May 4, 1989, Barrett at a meeting with Mr. Rubinovitz, presented him with an order to make various repairs within seven days.  Barrett also told Rubinovitz that Rogato had been calling the health department \"every hour on the hour\" regarding the property and was pressuring the department to bring enforcement actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, the Rubinovitzes wrote a letter to the director of public health, Gerald M. Carpinella (the \"May 4 letter\"), in which they requested a hearing on the order to repair.  The letter also stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[We] request that the type of harassment that [we] have been subjected to cease immediately, as [we] are well aware and have been informed that this stems from cronyism and blatant misuse of power and authority brought on by the Purchasing Director, Grace Rogato.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpinella discussed the letter with Rogato.  Subsequent to the May 2 variance hearing, the Rubinovitzes received two post cards from the Board notifying them that the Board had approved their request.  On May 11, 1989, however, the Rubinovitzes received a letter from the Board notifying them that the May 2 hearing (at which their variance request had been approved) had been continued until May 16, 1989.  At the continued hearing, defendant Board chairman John J. Burke, Jr., moved to reconsider the May 2 vote, and Burke and defendant Board member Dennis Tobin then reversed their earlier votes to grant the Rubinovitzes' petition.  Thus, on reconsideration, the Rubinovitzes' petition failed by a 3-2 vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1989, defendant Henry P. Baron, the city gas inspector, wrote to public health director Carpinella advising that gas service to the Rubinovitz apartment be discontinued because of alleged safety problems.  Five days later, Carpinella wrote to the Rubinovitzes advising them of numerous violations of state plumbing and gas codes.  On July 12, 1989, the city plumbing inspector, Gerald Capano, ordered the Rubinovitzes to disconnect the water and sewer connections to the apartment because they lacked requisite permits.  On July 14, 1989, Baron ordered the Boston Gas Company to disconnect the gas service to the Rubinovitz apartment because of the lack of a permit.  Later, Baron told a contractor hired by the Rubinovitzes to stay away from them, characterizing the Rubinovitzes as \"bad people\" and calling Mrs. Rubinovitz \"a bitch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Rubinovitzes had appealed the Board's variance order to the Massachusetts Superior Court.  On January 10, 1991, the Superior Court vacated the Board's reconsideration vote, thereby reinstating the Rubinovitzes' variance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rubinovitzes filed the present action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 against defendants alleging violation of their equal protection rights, their rights to free speech, and their property rights.  The Rubinovitzes also allege violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985.  Following discovery, defendants moved to dismiss.  The district court treated the motion as one for summary judgment and, following a hearing, ruled from the bench that the Rubinovitzes' claims, though styled under different theories, amounted to one constitutional claim:  that they were denied equal protection under the law by being singled out by Lynn officials for exercising their property rights (in evicting Lussier) and for exercising their rights to free speech (in sending the May 4 letter).  The district court determined that a landlord's right to evict a tenant is \"a matter uniquely grounded in state property law and does not implicate constitutional rights triggering the protections of Sec. 1983.\"   As to free speech, the district court determined that the Rubinovitzes \"failed to show any causal connection between the May 4 letter and Miss Rogato's alleged conspiratorial campaign against them.\"   In fact, the district court said, Rogato's motivation appeared to be malice toward the Rubinovitzes because of their eviction proceedings against Lussier rather than retaliation for their exercise of their free speech rights.  Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment as to all counts.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first set out the analytical framework for our decision.  The Rubinovitzes charge defendants with improper selective enforcement of lawful local regulations.  See LeClair v. Saunders, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380956\"><a href=\"/opinion/380956/harmasse-leclair-and-elizabeth-leclair-appellees-cross-appellants-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>, 608 (2d Cir.1980), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span> (1981).  Specifically, the Rubinovitzes argue that the Board's about-face on their variance application as well as the litany of code-enforcement actions were retaliatory and singled them out for disparate treatment.  As we have stated before:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Liability in the instant type of equal protection case should depend on proof that (1) the person, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively treated;  and (2) that such selective treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yerardi's Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525274\"><a href=\"/opinion/525274/yerardis-moody-street-restaurant-lounge-inc-v-board-of-selectmen-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1989) (citing LeClair, 627 F.2d at 609-610).   The Rubinovitzes argue that liability arises because:  first, defendants treated them selectively;  second, the selective treatment was based upon the exercise of their property and free speech rights;  and third, defendants' actions constituted \"malicious or bad faith intent to injure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To facilitate the analysis of this case, we divide the events described above into two broad categories:  the zoning-variance approval revocation and the code-enforcement actions.  Turning first to the zoning-variance approval issue, we conclude that the Rubinovitzes have not offered a sufficient basis for us to conclude that they were selectively treated.  Plaintiffs claiming an equal protection violation must first \"identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly 'in all relevant aspects' were treated differently, instances which have the capacity to demonstrate that [plaintiffs] were 'singled ... out for unlawful oppression.' \"  Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1989) (citations omitted).  The Rubinovitzes neither identify others who were similarly situated, nor do they identify any instances of disparate treatment.  In opposition to summary judgment, Mr. Rubinovitz's affidavit states:  \"there are at least [thirteen] properties in the neighborhood in which I live which have structures to the rear of the main dwelling which are used as dwelling units....  All of the properties are within approximately two blocks of my property.\"   Appended to the affidavit were pictures of the property and thirteen similar structures.  From this submission, the Rubinovitzes apparently ask us to infer that the Board readily granted their neighbors variance requests.  However, the Rubinovitzes fail to present any evidence that any of their neighbors were either required to seek a variance or actually made such a request of the Board.  Thus, there is no basis in the record by which we can determine that the Rubinovitzes were \" 'singled ... out for unlawful oppression,' \" id.  (quoting Burt v. City of New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1548090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1548090/burt-v-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 791 (2d Cir.1946) (L. Hand, J.)), or that they \"suffered what others in general have escaped,\" Burt, 156 F.2d at 791.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rubinovitzes' complaint of selective code-enforcement actions stands on far firmer ground.  For example, the Rubinovitzes point to the affidavit of city plumbing inspector Capano, in which he states that (1) he had encountered other instances where there was plumbing but no permits and (2) he did not order the plumbing disconnected, as he had with the Rubinovitzes.  As to code-enforcement, we think the record contains sufficient evidence of selective treatment to forestall summary judgment.  Accordingly, the balance of our analysis focuses on the defendants' code-enforcement efforts against the Rubinovitzes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the Yerardi's analysis requires us to determine whether defendants singled out the Rubinovitzes for an improper purpose.  The Rubinovitzes do not allege that the disparate treatment flowed from an invidious classification involving race or religion.  Rather, the Rubinovitzes argue that defendants sought to punish them for the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights.  First, although not entirely clear from their arguments below and to this court, the Rubinovitzes appear to allege that defendants punished them for exercising their \"right to evict\" Lussier.  The Rubinovitzes rely on language from Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting Board of Regents v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span> (1972)), holding that, in a deprivation-of-due-process analysis, protected property interests \" 'stem from an independent source such as state law.' \"   Even assuming that a right to evict a tenant would be a protected property interest under Roth for purposes of a due process claim, it does not follow that there is a fundamental right to evict, the exercise of which is protected by the Equal Protection Clause.  In fact, the Constitution establishes no such fundamental right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rubinovitzes mount another argument grounded in fundamental constitutional rights.  Specifically, they allege that defendants' code-enforcement actions were an attempt to punish the Rubinovitzes for the May 4 letter.  This argument also falls short, but for a different reason.  Free speech is a fundamental right but, to survive summary judgment, the Rubinovitzes must offer some proof that defendants' allegedly retaliatory actions were motivated by the protected speech.  See, e.g., Cloutier v. Town of Epping, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423649\"><a href=\"/opinion/423649/wilfred-cloutier-v-the-town-of-epping-wilfred-cloutier-v-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1192 (1st Cir.1983);  Packish v. McMurtrie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"412700\"><a href=\"/opinion/412700/george-w-packish-v-heather-mcmurtrie/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1983).  The Rubinovitzes point to ten facts that they contend constitute evidence of retaliatory motive.  We are unconvinced.  The Rubinovitzes adduce no direct evidence establishing retaliatory motive.  Instead, they rely entirely on circumstantial evidence:  that is, enforcement actions followed the May 4 letter.  Indeed, the facts to which the Rubinovitzes point do nothing more than lay out the basic rubric of the case:  e.g., the Board approved the variance on May 2;  Rogato contacted the Board regarding the variance after May 2;  the May 4 letter was sent to Carpinella;  Carpinella discussed the May 4 letter with Rogato;  the Rubinovitzes received notice that the variance had been approved;  on May 16, the Board reversed its decision on the variance and various code enforcement actions had been commenced against the property beginning in January 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This recitation is insufficient to support an inference of improper motive.  As the Rubinovitzes themselves point out, the city's code-enforcement activity had been well underway for four months prior to the May 4 letter.  In fact, the Rubinovitzes wrote the May 4 letter immediately following Barrett's meeting with Mr. Rubinovitz during which Barrett both presented an order to repair and related Rogato's pre-May 4 pressure to bring code-enforcement actions.  The May 4 letter itself complained about the \"harassment\" from city officials.  Although the Rubinovitzes contend that the \"principal wrongful actions\" took place after the May 4 letter, they offer no basis upon which to distinguish pre- and post-May 4 harassment.  Of course, on summary judgment, we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  However, those inferences \"must flow rationally from the underlying facts;  that is, a suggested inference must ascend to what common sense and human experience indicates is an acceptable level of probability.\"  National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 743.   The record suggests that although the city had focused its attention on the property prior to the Lussier eviction, the heightened attention began after the eviction notice but before the May 4 letter.  We think the inference suggested by the Rubinovitzes rests on a \" 'tenuous insinuation,' \" id.  (quoting Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 820 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></span> (1992)), rather than an acceptable level of probability.  Accordingly, we conclude that the record fails to support an inference that the officials' post-May 4 conduct was in retaliation for the May 4 letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as noted above, in the absence of invidious discrimination or the abuse of a fundamental right, a party may establish an equal protection violation with evidence of bad faith or malicious intent to injure.  Yerardi's, 878 F.2d at 21;  see also Yerardi's Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560461\"><a href=\"/opinion/560461/yerardis-moody-street-restaurant-lounge-inc-v-board-of-selectmen-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.1991) (hereinafter, \"Yerardi's II \").   We start with two related observations.  First, bad-faith or malicious-intent-to-injure cases are infrequent.  Yerardi's II, 932 F.2d at 94 (citing PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rene Alberto Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557363\"><a href=\"/opinion/557363/pfz-properties-inc-v-rene-alberto-rodriguez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.1991) (noting in the zoning context that \"[e]very appeal ... from an adverse ruling ... necessarily involves some claim that the board exceeded, abused or distorted its legal authority in some manner\") (quotations and citations omitted), cert. dismissed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112707\"><a href=\"/opinion/112707/pfz-properties-inc-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112707\"><a href=\"/opinion/112707/pfz-properties-inc-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span> (1992)).  Second, \" 'the malice/bad faith standard should be scrupulously met.' \"  Yerardi's II, 932 F.2d at 94 (quoting LeClair, 627 F.2d at 611).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, despite the general language of Yerardi's, at least one member of this panel believes that something substantially more than a single act of malice underlying some routine administrative action is necessary to make out a constitutional claim.  Cf. Esmail v. Macrane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694640\"><a href=\"/opinion/694640/basim-esmail-zabco-enterprises-incorporated-and-nazco-enterprises/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1995) (campaign of severe harassment orchestrated by mayor).  But we need not resolve such issues in this case beyond cautioning that routine claims that some individual action was malicious are likely to have rough sailing.  For here we think there is enough indication of a malicious orchestrated campaign causing substantial harm--though only barely enough evidence--that the case cannot be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rogato had no official authority in the matter, there is certainly evidence that she was personally hostile to the Rubinovitzes based on her resentment concerning Lussier's eviction, that she had sought to intervene with the Rubinovitzes personally on Lussier's behalf, that she had repeatedly pressured the health department to bring enforcement actions, that she had kept track of the Board proceedings, and that in May she had conferred with Carpinella, the public health director, not long before the cut-off orders.  Rogato was an official of the city and, in a relatively small unit of government, almost certainly had access and influence beyond that of an ordinary outsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside the Board's reconsideration vote, these actions by Rogato were followed by Baron's advice to Carpinella that gas service to the Rubinovitzes be discontinued (June 2), Carpinella's notice to the Rubinovitzes advising them of numerous violations (June 7), Capano's order to disconnect water and sewer hook-ups to the apartment (July 12), and Baron's order to Boston Gas to disconnect gas service (July 14).  Baron thereafter sought to interfere with the Rubinovitzes' hiring of a contractor, using language about them (\"bad people,\" \"bitch\") redolent of malice.  In the case of both cut-offs, there was some evidence that other residents similarly situated did not suffer the same penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we think that although the case might be a difficult one for the plaintiffs, a reasonable jury might well be able to conclude that there was an orchestrated conspiracy involving a number of officials, selective enforcement, malice, and substantial harm.  Of course, the full presentation of evidence on both sides might alter this judgment and show that the plaintiffs fell just short and would be subject to a directed verdict.  But at the summary judgment stage, with the obligation to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment, we think that this case could not be dismissed against all defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that Barrett, also named as a defendant, was properly granted summary judgment;  his own investigation of code violations began well before the eviction controversy, and--while his report of Rogato's pressure is highly pertinent evidence--there is no evidence that Barrett was himself involved in either of the cut-off directives.  As for Carpinella and Capano, there is no need to consider whether the evidence might be sufficient as to them, since they were not named as defendants and it is almost certainly too late in the day to consider any expansion of this lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is vacated as to defendants Rogato and Baron and the case remanded as to them for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  As to all other defendants, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendants are city purchasing director Grace Rogato, health inspector Robert M.
