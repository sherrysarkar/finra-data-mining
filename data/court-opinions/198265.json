PEREZ,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n        COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n     [Hon. Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Melba N. Rivera Camacho and Melba N. Rivera Camacho &amp; Assocs.on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza Toro,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Donna McCarthy, Assistant\r\nRegional Counsel, on brief for appellee. \r\n\nDECEMBER 29, 1998\r\n\n  Per Curiam.  Claimant Carmen Perez appeals from a district\r\ncourt judgment affirming a decision of the Commissioner of\r\nSocial Security that denied her claim for disability benefits. \r\nHaving reviewed the record in full, we find that substantial\r\nevidence supports the Commissioner's ruling and that claimant's\r\nchallenges thereto are otherwise unavailing.  For example, we\r\nthink that the administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted a\r\nproper inquiry into claimant's subjective complaints of pain,\r\nwith all relevant factors considered.  That a superseded Social\r\nSecurity Ruling was cited is without significance under the\r\ncircumstances.  And the absence of muscle atrophy was properly\r\nmentioned as one pertinent factor in this regard.  We further\r\nfind that the ALJ was warranted in concluding that the report\r\nof claimant's treating psychiatrist was inconsistent with other\r\nsubstantial evidence, and that the \"RFC\" assessments were based\r\non all relevant information.  For these reasons and the others\r\nset forth by the magistrate judge and the district court judge,\r\nthe judgment is affirmed.\r\n    Affirmed.\n",
