ORTIZ-MEDINA, a/k/a FLATTOP,\r\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n       [Hon. Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Marlene Aponte Cabrera on brief for appellant.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jose A. Quiles-\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, Camille Velez-Rive, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United\r\nStates Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 16, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Daniel Ortiz-Medina\r\nappeals from his conviction and sentence on several grounds. \r\nBased upon a thorough  review of the record and the briefs, we\r\nconclude for the following reasons that \"no substantial\r\nquestion is presented\" by this appeal. See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n          I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r\n          \"The rule in this circuit is that a fact-specific\r\nclaim of ineffective assistance cannot be raised initially on\r\ndirect review of a criminal conviction but must originally be\r\npresented to the district court.\" United States v. Hunnewell,\r\n891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989).  Although Ortiz presented his\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claims in his motion for new\r\ntrial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, the district court properly\r\nconstrued the claims as appropriately brought pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C  2255. See United States v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561, 566 (1st\r\nCir. 1990)(holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel is not newly discovered for the purposes of Rule 33\r\nwhen based on facts known to the defendant at the time of\r\ntrial).  The district court also properly dismissed the claims\r\n(without prejudice), because this appeal was pending at the\r\ntime and Ortiz failed to make a showing of extraordinary\r\ncircumstances.  See United States v. Buckley, 847 F.2d 991, 993\r\nn.1 (1st Cir. 1988).  Ortiz' ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nclaims are denied without prejudice to his presenting them to\r\nthe district court in a  2255 motion.   \r\n          II. Rule 33 Motion\r\n          \"The district court's denial of the motion for a new\r\ntrial is reviewable only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\"\r\nUnited States v. Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d 1060, 1064 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  \"A motion for new trial based on newly discovered\r\nevidence will not be allowed unless the movant establishes that\r\nthe evidence was: i) unknown or unavailable at the time of\r\ntrial, (ii) despite due diligence, (iii) material, and (iv)\r\nlikely to result in an acquittal upon retrial.\" United States\r\nv. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 971 (1st Cir. 1995).  Under the fourth\r\nrequirement, \"the evidence must create an actual probability\r\nthat an acquittal would have resulted if the evidence had been\r\navailable.\" United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1216, 1220 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).\r\n          Ortiz' motion was based upon \"new evidence of\r\nuntruthfulness\" on the part of one of the government witnesses. \r\n\"Neither our decisions nor those of other circuits have been\r\nsympathetic to new trial claims based solely on the discovery\r\nof additional information useful for impeaching a government\r\nwitness.\" Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1220, n.5; see also United\r\nStates v. Formanczyk, 949 F.2d 526, 531 (1st Cir. 1991).  As the\r\ndistrict court emphasized, the argument for granting a new\r\ntrial on the basis of such evidence is particularly weak here\r\nbecause the witness in question admitted at Ortiz' trial to\r\nhaving lied to federal authorities.  Ortiz has failed to show\r\nthat the denial of the Rule 33 motion amounted to a \"manifest\r\nabuse of discretion.\"\r\n          III. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)\r\n          Because Ortiz failed to object at trial to the\r\nevidence that he now argues was evidence of \"other crimes,\r\nwrongs or acts,\" this court reviews the admission of the\r\nevidence for plain error only. See United States v. Carrillo-\r\nFigueroa, 34 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 1994).  \"Under the plain\r\nerror standard of review, 'appellant bears the burden of\r\npersuasion to establish that there was an error, that the error\r\nwas clear or obvious, and that the error affected substantial\r\nrights.'\" United States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(citation omitted), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 119 S.Ct. 1781\r\n(1999).\r\n          Ortiz specifically objects to questioning of the\r\ngovernment witnesses from which, Ortiz argues, the jury could\r\nhave inferred that Ortiz participated in murders.  The\r\ntranscript of the trial, however, reveals that the government\r\nand the court successfully kept the witnesses from referring to\r\nthe murders in their testimony. There is no suggestion from the\r\ntranscripts of an \"error so obvious that it could rise to the\r\nlevel of substantial and fundamental prejudice required by\r\nplain error review.\" United States v. Graham, 146 F.3d 6, 11\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).\r\n          IV. Sentencing\r\n          Ortiz argues that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 was violated in\r\nhis case because the district court failed to 1) provide\r\ndefendant with a copy of the PSR until the day of sentencing,\r\nand 2) verify that defendant and defendant's counsel had read \r\nand discussed the PSR. Ortiz also contends that the probation\r\nofficer abandoned her neutrality in the positions she took in\r\nhis PSR, in violation of Rule 32. \r\n          The transcript of the sentencing hearing reveals that\r\nneither Ortiz nor his attorney indicated to the court that more\r\ntime was needed to review the PSR.  \"[T]he failure to invoke\r\n[the section of Rule 32 setting forth the time frame within\r\nwhich the defendant must be provided with a copy of the PSR] or\r\nrequest a continuance effectively waives the claim, absent a\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\" United States v. Barrows, 996 F.2d 12,\r\n14 (1st Cir. 1993).  Ortiz has failed to make a showing that a\r\nmiscarriage of justice resulted from his receipt of the PSR on\r\nthe day of sentencing.\r\n          Ortiz argues that the court's failure to inquire at\r\nsentencing whether he had read the report and discussed it with\r\nhis attorney \"is itself sufficient to have the case remanded\r\nfor resentencing.\"  Appellant's Brief, p. 20.  \"However,\r\nbinding precedent in this circuit has directed that if it is\r\nabundantly clear from the sentencing hearing that both\r\ndefendant and his counsel are familiar with the report, a new\r\nsentencing hearing will not be mandated, even if the court\r\nfailed to directly inquire whether defendant had an opportunity\r\nto review the report.\" United States v. Manrique, 959 F.2d\r\n1155, 1157 (1st Cir. 1992).  \r\n          The sentencing transcript demonstrates that Ortiz and\r\nhis attorney were familiar with the PSR.  Defense counsel\r\nobjected to several aspects of the PSR which were discussed in\r\ndetail.  The transcript includes references by defense counsel\r\nto discussion of aspects of the PSR with Ortiz.  On this\r\nrecord, it appears that the standard of demonstrated\r\nfamiliarity with the PSR was met. See Manrique, supra, p. 1158\r\n(noting that counsel's specific reference to the PSR \"clearly\r\nindicat[ed] that he read the report\").  Moreover, Ortiz does\r\nnot allege on appeal that he did not receive a copy of the PSR,\r\ninstead objecting to the district court's failure to verify the\r\nreceipt.  Under like circumstances, this court has found that\r\nthe requirements of Rule 32(c)(3)(A) were met. See United\r\nStates v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 620 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n          Finally, Ortiz argues that the probation officer who\r\nprepared the PSR violated Rule 32 by engaging in advocacy and\r\nabandoning her proscribed role as a neutral arm of the court. \r\nThis court has interpreted the role of the probation officer\r\nunder the guidelines to include the \"exercise [of] his\r\nindependent judgment as to the application of the guidelines.\r\n. . . Anything less would be a dereliction of duty.\" United\r\nStates v. Fraza, 106 F.3d 1050, 1056 (1st Cir. 1997).  None of\r\nthe aspects of the PSR which Ortiz relies upon as\r\ndemonstrations of the probation officer's \"advocacy\" evince\r\nmore than \"exercise [of the probation officer's] independent\r\njudgment as to the application of the guidelines.\" Id.\r\n          Ortiz' conviction and sentence are affirmed. See Loc.\r\nR. 27.1.  This affirmance is without prejudice to Ortiz' right\r\nto present his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\r\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255.  \r\n",
