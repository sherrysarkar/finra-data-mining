Claimant-appellant Angel M. Diaz-Zayas\r                                \r\n\nappeals  from a decision of  the district court affirming the\r\n\ndecision  of  the  Secretary  of Health  and  Human  Services\r\n\ndenying him social security disability benefits.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Appellant applied for disability insurance benefits\r\n\nalleging  disability since November 15, 1979 due to nerves, a\r\n\nheart  condition,  and  sinusitis.     After  a  hearing,  an\r\n\nAdministrative Law  Judge (ALJ)  concluded that prior  to the\r\n\nexpiration of his coverage--on March 31,  1983--appellant had\r\n\npreventricular  contractions,  sinusal  tachycardia,  chronic\r\n\nanxiety disorder, and  Ativan dependence.   These conditions,\r\n\nthe ALJ found, were severe  but not equal to a listing.   The\r\n\nALJ  also  found  that   appellant  possibly  had  occasional\r\n\ndiscomfort associated  to these  conditions, but that  he did\r\n\nnot  have  disabling  physical   or  mental  distress  for  a\r\n\ncontinuous period of twelve months.  Based on these findings,\r\n\nand a finding  that appellant could  perform light work,  the\r\n\nALJ concluded  that appellant was  not disabled prior  to the\r\n\nexpiration of  his coverage  because he could  have performed\r\n\nhis former jobs as a machine operator or production helper.\r\n\n          Appellant  does not  argue  that the  ALJ erred  in\r\n\nfinding that he has the capacity for light work.  Instead, he\r\n\nargues  that   the  ALJ  erred  in   his  findings  regarding\r\n\nappellant's  mental condition.    We review  the  Secretary's\r\n\ndecision under  a \"substantial  evidence\"  standard; we  will\r\r\n\naffirm that decision  if it is  supported by \"'such  relevant\r\n\nevidence as  a reasonable  mind might accept  as adequate  to\r\n\nsupport a conclusion.'\"  Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389,\r                                                          \r\n\n401 (1971) (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n197,  229 (1938));  see  also Manso-Pizarro  v. Secretary  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nHealth &amp; Human Servs., 76 F.3d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r                                 \r\n\n          Contrary to appellant's suggestion, the ALJ was not\r\n\nrequired to  accept  the opinion  of Dr.  Garcia Saliva  that\r\n\nappellant's  mental  condition  disabled  him  from  working.\r\n\nAssuming solely for the sake of argument that Dr. Garcia, who\r\n\nsaw appellant  on only  one occasion, could  be considered  a\r\n\ntreating  physician,  we  note  that  there  was  conflicting\r\n\nevidence  from other  treating sources  regarding appellant's\r\n\nability  to  work.   Indeed,  appellant's  therapists at  the\r\n\nMental  Health  Center  encouraged  him,  on  more  than  one\r\n\noccasion, to look for a job.  In any event, the determination\r\n\nof disability is reserved to the Secretary.   See 20 C.F.R.  \r                                                             \r\n\n404.1527(e).    We think  the  ALJ  adequately explained  his\r\n\nreasons for finding that appellant's mental condition did not\r\n\npreclude him  from  performing his  past  jobs as  a  machine\r\n\noperator or production assistant.1\r                                             1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1We add that it  is not obvious that Dr.  Garcia's opinion\r               1\r\nis inconsistent  with this finding.   Dr. Garcia  opined that\r\nappellant  was  disabled  from performing  his  \"usual work.\"\r\nRead in context, \"usual work\" appears to refer to appellant's\r\npast job as  a service  station attendant (the  only job  Dr.\r\nGarcia mentions).   Dr.  Garcia did not  specifically address\r\nwhether appellant was able  to work as a machine  operator or\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Similarly, the  ALJ was not required  to accept the\r\n\ndiagnoses of schizophrenia made by Dr. Carlos J. Nogueras and\r\n\nDr. Luis Lozada Rivera, or the more specific findings made by\r\n\nDr.  Lozada regarding  appellant's mental impairment.   These\r\n\ndiagnoses and findings were  made in 1992, approximately nine\r\n\nyears  after appellant's  insurance  coverage  expired.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nDeblois v.

Moreover,  the\r\n\nonly mental residual  functional capacity assessments in  the\r\n\nrecord  which focus on the  critical period support the ALJ's\r\n\nfinding of no disability.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nproduction helper.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
