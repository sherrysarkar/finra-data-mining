Miguel Tejeda Jr.\r\n(\"Tejeda\") has filed a 28 U.S.C.  2254 (\"Section 2254\") petition\r\nfor a writ of habeas corpus (\"Petition\") that challenges his state\r\ncourt conviction on three related criminal charges.  Tejeda\r\ncontends that his conviction must be overturned because he did not\r\nreceive constitutionally effective counsel at trial as required by\r\nthe Sixth Amendment.  That claim was rejected by the district\r\ncourt, but for the reasons set forth below we reverse that\r\ndecision, vacate Tejeda's conviction and remand the case for entry\r\nof an appropriate order.\r\n                       Background  Tejeda was arrested on July 11, 1991 and charged with\r\ntrafficking in cocaine, unlawful possession of a firearm and\r\nunlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition without an\r\nidentification card.  Shortly thereafter he was indicted by a\r\nHampden County, Massachusetts grand jury on those charges and was\r\nbrought to trial in Hampden Superior Court.  After Tejeda lost two\r\nmotions to suppress evidence, the trial commenced on December 9,\r\n1991. \r\nAt trial the prosecution relied on five police witnesses\r\nto build its case against Tejeda.  What follows in the next three\r\nparagraphs is the officers' account of events, set out as factual\r\nnarrative without stating the qualification that it reflects their\r\ntestimony as the jury could be entitled to credit it.\r\nOn the date of Tejeda's arrest Sergeant Charles Cook\r\n(\"Cook\") had supervised police surveillance of a house at 37 James\r\nStreet in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Tejeda lived in an apartment\r\non the first floor of the house.  After Cook learned that the\r\npolice had obtained a search warrant for the house (a warrant based\r\non a tip provided by a confidential informant), Cook observed\r\nTejeda leave the house, open the trunk of a car parked outside and\r\nlean inside the trunk.  Tejeda then drove away in the car.  \r\nCook followed Tejeda for a short distance and then\r\nradioed Detective John O'Mara (\"O'Mara\") to stop the car.  O'Mara\r\nstopped Tejeda several blocks away and searched the car.  O'Mara's\r\npartner, Detective Dennis Kirby (\"Kirby\"), found a plastic bag in\r\nthe trunk that contained about 30 grams of white powder, which\r\nproved to be cocaine, and $366 on Tejeda's person.  Kirby took\r\nTejeda to the police station after conducting the search.\r\nShortly after the arrest, Cook and several other officers\r\nsearched Tejeda's apartment.  They found a loaded .38 caliber\r\nrevolver under a mattress, ammunition for the gun, personal papers\r\nindicating that Tejeda lived in the apartment and a \"drug ledger\"\r\ncontaining names and addresses of prospective drug clients.  Tejeda\r\ndid not have the requisite identification card for the firearm and\r\nammunition.\r\nIn the face of such testimony, Tejeda's defense lawyer\r\nEdelmiro Martnez, Jr. (\"Martnez\") concluded that Tejeda's only\r\ndefense was to argue that the police had fabricated the case\r\nagainst Tejeda.  Martnez began his defense by trying to expose\r\ninconsistencies in the police testimony during his cross-\r\nexaminations, but his efforts were completely unavailing because\r\nthe trial judge sustained numerous objections to Martnez'\r\nquestions suggesting potential police fraud.  Those rulings\r\nhampered Martnez' pursuit of that line of inquiry.\r\nMartnez complained bitterly about the adverse rulings,\r\narguing that they prevented him from presenting his defense.  In\r\nresponse the judge harshly warned Martnez not to present a police\r\nfabrication defense supported only by Tejeda's word.  Those\r\ncontentious encounters generated an obvious hostility between\r\nMartnez and the judge that poisoned their relationship for the\r\nremainder of the trial.  Martnez, incensed by the judge's\r\nconsistently unfavorable rulings, acted out his frustration by\r\nattacking the integrity of the judge.  Martnez' petulance in turn\r\nantagonized the judge to the point that he fined Martnez $300 for\r\ncontempt of court after one outburst.\r\nThat ongoing conflict discouraged Martnez' pursuit of\r\nthe police-fabrication line of defense.  He stopped trying to\r\ncross-examine prosecution witnesses on that subject and\r\nconsequently failed to uncover significant inconsistencies that did\r\nexist in Cook's and O'Mara's testimony.   \r\nIn the end, the only evidence of police fabrication that\r\nMartnez presented coherently came from Tejeda and one other\r\ndefense witness.  Tejeda vigorously denied having either drugs or\r\na gun in his car or apartment.  On the contrary, he testified that\r\nhe was going in his car to pay some bills when he was stopped at\r\ngunpoint by the police.  Tejeda contradicted O'Mara, stating that\r\nthe car was not searched in Tejeda's presence.  Instead Tejeda said\r\nthat the police took him to the police station immediately and did\r\nnot inform him of the charges against him until the next day. \r\nTejeda stuck to his story during the prosecution's cross-\r\nexamination, repeatedly insisting that the officers were lying.\r\nTejeda's only substantive defense witness, Alejandro\r\nBonilla (\"Bonilla\"), claimed that he was Tejeda's roommate and that\r\nhe never saw drug trafficking or the gun in their apartment.  But\r\nBonilla's credibility was undermined when he admitted that he had\r\nprovided a different home address to the police (in the course of\r\na separate incident) two weeks before Tejeda's arrest.\r\nDespite Martnez' frenetic attempts to elicit evidence of\r\npolice fabrication, the trial judge concluded that there was no\r\nevidence to support the inference that the police were lying. \r\nAccordingly, he explicitly prohibited Martnez from arguing that\r\ntheory in his closing statement.  While Martnez did not adhere to\r\nthat order with total strictness, his oblique references to\r\npotential police fabrication were scattered and unsupported by\r\nobjective evidence of police misconduct.\r\nNot surprisingly, Martnez' failure to argue fully what\r\nhe had candidly admitted to be Tejeda's only line of defense\r\nresulted in guilty verdicts against his client.  Tejeda was\r\nconvicted on all three charges and sentenced to a state prison term\r\nof not less than five nor more than seven years.\r\nAfter filing a timely notice of appeal, Tejeda moved for\r\na new trial--a motion that was denied without a hearing.  When he\r\nthen appealed both his conviction and the denial of a new trial,\r\nnew counsel was appointed to handle the appeals.  Both his appeals\r\nwere consolidated for hearing before the Massachusetts Appeals\r\nCourt, and on February 18, 1994 the consolidated appeal was\r\nrejected (Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 629 N.E.2d 370 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1994)).  Tejeda's application to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\r\nCourt for further appellate review was denied on March 29, 1994\r\n(Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 634 N.E.2d 121 (Mass. 1994)).\r\nUndeterred, Tejeda filed a petition for federal habeas\r\ncorpus relief on December 5, 1994.  Then he alleged in an amended\r\npetition that he had received constitutionally ineffective\r\nassistance at trial from Martnez and that the trial judge had\r\nviolated his right to counsel and due process by prohibiting\r\nMartnez from arguing the police fabrication theory in his closing\r\nargument.  On May 12, 1997 the district court issued a memorandum\r\nopinion denying both claims.\r\nTejeda then filed a Motion for Certificate of\r\nAppealability as to both claims.  On July 23, 1997 the district\r\ncourt issued a certificate of appealability for Tejeda's\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, but refused to grant a\r\ncertificate for the restricted summation claim.  This appeal\r\nresulted from the issuance of the certificate.\r\n                  Standard of Review\r\nAs n.4 has indicated, Tejeda filed his federal habeas\r\npetition on December 5, 1994, well before the April 24, 1996\r\neffective date of the Act's amendments to Section 2254.  Lindh v. Murphy, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 2063 (1997) holds that the Act's more\r\nstringent limitations on the federal courts' review of state court\r\ndeterminations via habeas proceedings do not apply to petitions\r\npending before the Act became law.  Hence Tejeda is entitled to de\r\nnovo review of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Curtisv. Duval, 124 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997)).\r\n      Ineffective-Assistance-of-Counsel Standards Tejeda claims that Martnez' performance at trial was so\r\ndeficient that it violated Tejeda's Sixth Amendment right to the\r\neffective assistance of counsel.  To establish such a violation,\r\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-96 (1984) requires that\r\nTejeda show (1) that Martnez' performance fell below an objective\r\nstandard of reasonableness and (2) that prejudice resulted.\r\nIn evaluating Strickland's first component, we review\r\nMartnez' actions with the strong presumption \"that, under the\r\ncircumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound\r\ntrial strategy'\" (id. at 689, quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S.\r\n91, 101 (1955)).  Accordingly, Tejeda must show that \"in light of\r\nall the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were\r\noutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\" (id.at 690).  \r\nAs for the second element--prejudice flowing from\r\nMartnez' substandard performance--Tejeda must demonstrate that\r\nthere was a reasonable probability that but for Martnez' errors\r\nthe outcome of the trial would have been different (id. at 694). \r\nFor that purpose a reasonable probability is defined as \"a\r\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\"\r\n(id.).  And in that respect our analysis is not limited to outcome\r\ndetermination--we must also contemplate \"whether the result of the\r\nproceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable\" (Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 1994), quoting Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369 (1993)).  That consideration reflects\r\nthe fact that at its root the right to effective counsel exists \"in\r\norder to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial\"\r\n(Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684).                  Application of the Standards\r\nTejeda contends that Martnez' performance at trial\r\neffectively deprived the jury of the chance to address his theory\r\nthat the police fabricated the evidence against him.  More\r\nspecifically, Tejeda argues that Martnez' inflammatory statements\r\nand actions during trial led to a critical deterioration in the\r\nlawyer's relationship with the trial judge, and that the\r\nconsequence of that mutual hostility between those two key players\r\nwas that Martnez failed to provide more than a fragmentary and\r\ndisjointed defense to the jury.\r\nOur review of the trial transcript confirms that Martnez\r\nand the trial judge were like immiscible liquids:  They simply\r\ncould not tolerate each other.  Their relationship began to break\r\ndown from the moment that Martnez suggested in his opening\r\nstatement that the police had fabricated evidence against Tejeda,\r\nand it ruptured completely when Martnez began to cross-examine\r\nprosecution witnesses in ways that (if he had completed the line of\r\ninquiry) could have raised doubts about the veracity of the\r\nofficers.  Those fledgling attempts to raise the idea of police\r\nfabrication to the jury excited the wrath of the judge, who\r\npromptly sustained prosecutorial objections to Martnez' line of\r\ninquiry.  Martnez responded to those adverse rulings by\r\nchallenging the integrity of the judge and complaining that he was\r\nnot being treated fairly.  In turn, those attacks prompted the\r\njudge to chastise Martnez about his behavior and to question the\r\npropriety of the police fabrication defense itself.  \r\nOne exchange that exemplifies the hostile dynamic between\r\nMartnez and the trial judge took place during Martnez' cross-\r\nexamination of O'Mara, the first prosecution witness.  Martnez\r\nasked O'Mara questions that implied that the officer had no reason\r\nto stop Tejeda's car when he did--in turn implying that O'Mara\r\nplanted the evidence to cover his own mistake--but the judge\r\nsustained a series of objections that allowed O'Mara to avoid\r\nanswering Martnez' questions.  Martnez criticized those rulings,\r\nfirst asking \"What kind of justice is that?\" and then complaining\r\n\"your [sic] limiting me, I can't ask any questions.\"  Those attacks\r\nprompted the judge to demand that Martnez outline the evidence he\r\nthought supported his fabrication defense.  When Martnez suggested\r\nthat Tejeda's account alone would support an inference that the\r\npolice were lying, the judge retorted \"You better have something\r\nmore than that.\"  After characterizing Martnez' proffer as\r\n\"absolutely outrageous,\" the judge warned Martnez \"don't push\r\nme...you overstep the bounds with me and you will know it.\"\r\nMartnez became incensed by the judge's attitude and\r\nfrequent rulings against him.  He repeatedly protested that the\r\njudge was favoring the prosecution, even moving for a mistrial\r\nbecause \"I can't ask any questions. [The prosecutor] can ask\r\nquestions....I believe that I am not in the mood to continue this\r\ncase this way.\"  Martnez' remarks to the judge grew increasingly\r\nacerbic as the lawyer's mood blackened.  Later rulings against\r\nMartnez prompted him to make snide comments such as \"I believe\r\nthat the best thing is for you to ask the jury to find him guilty\r\nand that's it,\" and \"It seems everything I do is improper.\"\r\nMartnez accompanied his acrimonious commentary with\r\noutward displays of anger.  Parsing the trial transcript (a paper\r\nrecord that cannot reproduce Martnez' hostile tone, manner and\r\nbody language, although those things plainly emerge from the\r\ndisputants' statements) reveals numerous occasions when Martnez\r\nhad to be told to lower his voice or to refrain from shouting,\r\nincluding one instance where the judge exasperatedly asked that the\r\nrecord reflect the fact that Martnez was yelling.  Nor was\r\nMartnez' misconduct limited to the tone of his voice.  After one\r\nadverse ruling the judge remonstrated Martnez, saying \"I'm sick\r\nand tired of you prancing around here, making all kinds of facial\r\nexpressions, raising your arms, throwing your papers.\" \r\nPredictably, Martnez' comments and behavior further\r\nantagonized the trial judge, whose loss of all patience with\r\nMartnez' attitude was evidenced by the $300 contempt fine.  More\r\nimportantly, the judge's tolerance for the fabrication defense\r\ndwindled as well.  By the end of the trial the judge began to\r\ndismiss Martnez' police perjury arguments with out-of-hand\r\ncomments like \"Mr. Martnez, argue with your brain\" and \"Don't\r\ninsult my intelligence.\"  \r\nThere is no question that the disintegration of the\r\nrelationship between the trial judge and Martnez had a corrosive\r\neffect on the presentation of Tejeda's fabrication defense to the\r\njury.  Martnez stopped trying to corroborate Tejeda's testimony\r\nthrough cross-examination of the police witnesses, instead devoting\r\nhis energy to expressing his displeasure with the judge's rulings. \r\nAs a result Martnez failed to make effective use of such internal\r\ninconsistencies in the officers' testimony as these:\r\n     1.  Cook included the cocaine and money in his search\r\nwarrant return for the apartment, despite the fact that\r\nKirby testified at trial that both items were found\r\ninstead in the search of Tejeda's car.\r\n     2.  Cook testified at trial that the police found a\r\ndrug ledger in Tejeda's apartment, but Cook had made no\r\nmention of any such ledger in either his search warrant\r\nreturn or in his grand jury testimony.\r\n     3.  Cook's grand jury testimony and the police arrest\r\nreport placed the location of Tejeda's arrest at three\r\ndifferent street intersections (including one non-\r\nexistent address).\r\nTo be sure, each of those differences (and one or two\r\nother matters that we do not itemize) might be viewed instead as\r\nreflecting sloppy police work, and the prosecutor would have been\r\nentitled to urge that in closing argument to the jury.  But Tejeda\r\ntoo was entitled to have his lawyer urge to the jury that the\r\ndiscrepancies supported the graver conclusion of police misconduct. \r\nDefense counsel's argument drawing that inference from the evidence\r\ncould have lent critical support to Tejeda's otherwise\r\nunsubstantiated version of the facts.\r\nTejeda's cause also suffered as the trial judge's\r\ncontempt for Martnez and the fabrication defense grew.  By the end\r\nof the trial, the judge mocked Martnez' attempts to use police\r\nfabrication arguments.  One manifestation of that disdain was the\r\njudge's conclusion that the \"facts\" presented at trial left \"no\r\nreasonable inference that the police fabricated any of the stories\r\nthat they testified to on the stand.\"  That led the judge\r\nexplicitly to forbid Martnez from arguing in his closing statement\r\nthat the police had planted evidence or were otherwise lying on the\r\nstand.\r\nThus hampered by the judge's warning (which was backed up\r\nby the judge's oft-demonstrated willingness to sustain objections\r\nto Martnez' advocacy), Martnez' final presentation of the\r\nfabrication defense in his closing statement was neither coherent\r\nnor complete.  In addition, Martnez' earlier failure to expose any\r\nchinks in the police version of the facts left him with almost no\r\nammunition at the close.  As a result, his fabrication argument\r\ndepended heavily on Tejeda's testimony and on the naked assertion\r\nthat policemen sometimes lie in order to win cases.  Not\r\nsurprisingly, that impotent presentation of Tejeda's position fell\r\nshort of raising a reasonable doubt as to Tejeda's guilt in the\r\nminds of the jury.\r\nOur extensive review of the trial transcript places us,\r\nin cause-and-effect terms, in much the same position as a\r\nbasketball referee who sees a player throw an elbow at an adversary\r\nbut cannot tell if the blow was the initial foul or a retaliatory\r\nstrike.  Both Martnez and the trial judge clearly provoked each\r\nother, making it difficult to unravel whether Martnez' petulance\r\nor the trial judge's hostility first poisoned their relationship\r\nand consequently made it impossible for Martnez to present\r\nTejeda's fabrication defense.\r\nBut unlike the basketball referee, we have no need to\r\ndecide whether to assess a single foul or a double foul.  Instead\r\nour constitutional focus is on defendant Tejeda--and he lost\r\nregardless of which of the combatants initiated contact.  Either\r\nway, Tejeda was deprived of his chance to present an effective\r\nfabrication defense to the jury.\r\nIt is thus unnecessary for us to attempt to divide the\r\nblame between lawyer and judge.  What matters is that lawyer\r\nMartnez failed to present Tejeda's primary line of defense to\r\neither the judge or the jury.  It is not an answer to observe that\r\nthe trial judge's own actions appeared to contribute to that\r\nfailure.  Martnez' anger over the judge's rulings and attitude\r\nsimply prevented him from serving his client's interests.  That\r\ncannot be characterized as trial strategy.  In sum, Martnez'\r\nrepresentation was so deficient that it falls below even the\r\nminimal standard for professionally competent assistance\r\nestablished by Strickland and its progeny, and it thus satisfies\r\nthe first half of the Strickland test.\r\nIn terms of the second branch of the Strickland analysis,\r\nit is impossible to conclude at any level of certainty whether, but\r\nfor Martnez' conduct, the jury would have decided that there was\r\nenough evidence of police fabrication to raise a reasonable doubt\r\nas to Tejeda's guilt.  Martnez' failure to present a coherent\r\nargument on that score took the question away from the jury and\r\ndeprived Tejeda of his only defense.  Depriving a criminal\r\ndefendant of his only viable defense certainly renders the\r\nresultant trial \"fundamentally unfair or unreliable\" as demanded by\r\nLockhart.  Hence Martnez' inadequate performance created\r\nsufficient prejudice to satisfy Strickland's second requirement as\r\nwell, and his habeas petition must be granted.\r\n                       Conclusion  Tejeda has demonstrated that Martnez' performance failed\r\nto satisfy any objective standard of reasonableness and that Tejeda\r\nsuffered prejudice from that substandard performance.  That being\r\nthe case, Tejeda was deprived of his constitutional right to\r\neffective assistance of counsel during his trial.  That renders it\r\nunnecessary to address Tejeda's added claim based on an allegedly\r\nrestricted summation by Martnez.\r\nIn terms of the appropriate remedy, the present record--\r\nnecessarily limited as it is to matters bearing on the issues\r\naddressed in our opinion--provides no information as to such\r\nquestions as when Tejeda actually began to serve his five to seven\r\nyear sentence and, thus, what his anticipated out date is (giving\r\neffect (1) to time spent in custody before the sentence itself\r\ncommenced and (2) to any good time credits Tejeda has earned while\r\nin custody).  Because the nature of Tejeda's constitutional\r\ndeprivation was the absence of effective representation by counsel\r\nrather than some incurable flaw, the usual relief granted to a\r\nsuccessful habeas petitioner such as Tejeda would be to give the\r\nCommonwealth the choice of affording him a prompt new trial or\r\nreleasing him.  But in this instance the district judge is in the\r\nbest position on remand to determine the most appropriate relief. \r\nThat may include a determination of what time period would be\r\nrequired for the appropriate scheduling of a new trial, taking into\r\naccount both the reasonable preparation needs of the prosecution\r\nand (more critically) the time needed for new defense counsel to\r\nstart from scratch and to prepare an effective defense.  It may\r\nalso be relevant for the district judge to consider whether\r\nbalancing (1) the timetable referred to in the preceding sentence\r\nagainst (2) the time of Tejeda's presumptive release from custody\r\nas things now stand might call for a straightforward order of his\r\ncurrent release, rather than affording the Commonwealth the more\r\ncommon alternative described earlier in this paragraph.\r\nWe therefore REVERSE the district judge's order, VACATE\r\nTejeda's conviction and REMAND for further proceedings consistent\r\nwith this opinion.\n",

What follows in the next three paragraphs is the officers' account of events, set out as factual narrative without stating the qualification that it reflects their testimony as the jury could be entitled to credit it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the date of Tejeda's arrest Sergeant Charles Cook (\"Cook\") had supervised police surveillance of a house at 37 James Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Tejeda lived in an apartment on the first floor of the house.  After Cook learned that the police had obtained a search warrant for the house (a warrant based on a tip provided by a confidential informant), Cook observed Tejeda leave the house, open the trunk of a car parked outside and lean inside the trunk.  Tejeda then drove away in the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cook followed Tejeda for a short distance and then radioed Detective John O'Mara (\"O'Mara\") to stop the car.  O'Mara stopped Tejeda several blocks away and searched the car.  O'Mara's partner, Detective Dennis Kirby (\"Kirby\"), found a plastic bag in the trunk that contained about 30 grams of white powder, which proved to be cocaine, and $366 on Tejeda's person.  Kirby took Tejeda to the police station after conducting the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the arrest, Cook and several other officers searched Tejeda's apartment.  They found a loaded .38 caliber revolver under a mattress, ammunition for the gun, personal papers indicating that Tejeda lived in the apartment and a \"drug ledger\" containing names and addresses of prospective drug clients.  Tejeda did not have the requisite identification card for the firearm and ammunition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of such testimony, Tejeda's defense lawyer Edelmiro Martnez, Jr.  (\"Martnez\") concluded that Tejeda's only defense was to argue that the police had fabricated the case against Tejeda.  Martnez began his defense by trying to expose inconsistencies in the police testimony during his cross-examinations, but his efforts were completely unavailing because the trial judge sustained numerous objections to Martnez' questions suggesting potential police fraud.  Those rulings hampered Martnez' pursuit of that line of inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez complained bitterly about the adverse rulings, arguing that they prevented him from presenting his defense.  In response the judge harshly warned Martnez not to present a police fabrication defense supported only by Tejeda's word.  Those contentious encounters generated an obvious hostility between Martnez and the judge that poisoned their relationship for the remainder of the trial.  Martnez, incensed by the judge's consistently unfavorable rulings, acted out his frustration by attacking the integrity of the judge.  Martnez' petulance in turn antagonized the judge to the point that he fined Martnez $300 for contempt of court after one outburst.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ongoing conflict discouraged Martnez' pursuit of the police-fabrication line of defense.  He stopped trying to cross-examine prosecution witnesses on that subject and consequently failed to uncover significant inconsistencies that did exist in Cook's and O'Mara's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the only evidence of police fabrication that Martnez presented coherently came from Tejeda and one other defense witness.  Tejeda vigorously denied having either drugs or a gun in his car or apartment.  On the contrary, he testified that he was going in his car to pay some bills when he was stopped at gunpoint by the police.  Tejeda contradicted O'Mara, stating that the car was not searched in Tejeda's presence.  Instead Tejeda said that the police took him to the police station immediately and did not inform him of the charges against him until the next day.  Tejeda stuck to his story during the prosecution's cross-examination, repeatedly insisting that the officers were lying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda's only substantive defense witness, Alejandro Bonilla (\"Bonilla\"), claimed that he was Tejeda's roommate and that he never saw drug trafficking or the gun in their apartment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  But Bonilla's credibility was undermined when he admitted that he had provided a different home address to the police (in the course of a separate incident) two weeks before Tejeda's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Martnez' frenetic attempts to elicit evidence of police fabrication, the trial judge concluded that there was no evidence to support the inference that the police were lying.  Accordingly, he explicitly prohibited Martnez from arguing that theory in his closing statement.  While Martnez did not adhere to that order with total strictness, his oblique references to potential police fabrication were scattered and unsupported by objective evidence of police misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Martnez' failure to argue fully what he had candidly admitted to be Tejeda's only line of defense resulted in guilty verdicts against his client.  Tejeda was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to a state prison term of not less than five nor more than seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After filing a timely notice of appeal, Tejeda moved for a new trial--a motion that was denied without a hearing.  When he then appealed both his conviction and the denial of a new trial, new counsel was appointed to handle the appeals.  Both his appeals were consolidated for hearing before the Massachusetts Appeals Court, and on February 18, 1994 the consolidated appeal was rejected (Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 36 Mass.App.Ct.1105, 629 N.E.2d 370 (1994)).  Tejeda's application to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for further appellate review was denied on March 29, 1994 (Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 417 Mass.1104, 634 N.E.2d 121 (1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undeterred, Tejeda filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief on December 5, 1994.  Then he alleged in an amended petition that he had received constitutionally ineffective assistance at trial from Martnez and that the trial judge had violated his right to counsel and due process by prohibiting Martnez from arguing the police fabrication theory in his closing argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On May 12, 1997 the district court issued a memorandum opinion denying both claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda then filed a Motion for Certificate of Appealability as to both claims.  On July 23, 1997 the district court issued a certificate of appealability for Tejeda's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but refused to grant a certificate for the restricted summation claim.  This appeal resulted from the issuance of the certificate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As n.4 has indicated, Tejeda filed his federal habeas petition on December 5, 1994, well before the April 24, 1996 effective date of the Act's amendments to Section 2254.  Lindh v. Murphy, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 2063, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997) holds that the Act's more stringent limitations on the federal courts' review of state court determinations via habeas proceedings do not apply to petitions pending before the Act became law.  Hence Tejeda is entitled to de novo review of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Curtis v. Duval, 124 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>Ineffective-Assistance-of-Counsel Standards</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda claims that Martnez' performance at trial was so deficient that it violated Tejeda's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  To establish such a violation, Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-69, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) requires that Tejeda show (1) that Martnez' performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) that prejudice resulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating Strickland 's first component, we review Martnez' actions with the strong presumption \"that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy' \" (id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 164, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955)).  Accordingly, Tejeda must show that \"in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\" (id. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the second element--prejudice flowing from Martnez' substandard performance--Tejeda must demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability that but for Martnez' errors the outcome of the trial would have been different (id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068).   For that purpose a reasonable probability is defined as \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\" (id.).   And in that respect our analysis is not limited to outcome determination--we must also contemplate \"whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable\" (Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.1994), quoting Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369, 113 S.Ct. 838, 842, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993)).  That consideration reflects the fact that at its root the right to effective counsel exists \"in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial\" (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684, 104 S.Ct. at 2063).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Application of the Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda contends that Martnez' performance at trial effectively deprived the jury of the chance to address his theory that the police fabricated the evidence against him.  More specifically, Tejeda argues that Martnez' inflammatory statements and actions during trial led to a critical deterioration in the lawyer's relationship with the trial judge, and that the consequence of that mutual hostility between those two key players was that Martnez failed to provide more than a fragmentary and disjointed defense to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the trial transcript confirms that Martnez and the trial judge were like immiscible liquids:  They simply could not tolerate each other.  Their relationship began to break down from the moment that Martnez suggested in his opening statement that the police had fabricated evidence against Tejeda, and it ruptured completely when Martnez began to cross-examine prosecution witnesses in ways that (if he had completed the line of inquiry) could have raised doubts about the veracity of the officers.  Those fledgling attempts to raise the idea of police fabrication to the jury excited the wrath of the judge, who promptly sustained prosecutorial objections to Martnez' line of inquiry.  Martnez responded to those adverse rulings by challenging the integrity of the judge and complaining that he was not being treated fairly.  In turn, those attacks prompted the judge to chastise Martnez about his behavior and to question the propriety of the police fabrication defense itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One exchange that exemplifies the hostile dynamic between Martnez and the trial judge took place during Martnez' cross-examination of O'Mara, the first prosecution witness.  Martnez asked O'Mara questions that implied that the officer had no reason to stop Tejeda's car when he did--in turn implying that O'Mara planted the evidence to cover his own mistake--but the judge sustained a series of objections that allowed O'Mara to avoid answering Martnez' questions.  Martnez criticized those rulings, first asking \"What kind of justice is that?\" and then complaining \"your [sic] limiting me, I can't ask any questions.\"   Those attacks prompted the judge to demand that Martnez outline the evidence he thought supported his fabrication defense.  When Martnez suggested that Tejeda's account alone would support an inference that the police were lying, the judge retorted \"You better have something more than that.\"   After characterizing Martnez' proffer as \"absolutely outrageous,\" the judge warned Martnez \"don't push me ... you overstep the bounds with me and you will know it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez became incensed by the judge's attitude and frequent rulings against him.  He repeatedly protested that the judge was favoring the prosecution, even moving for a mistrial because \"I can't ask any questions.  [The prosecutor] can ask questions....I  believe that I am not in the mood to continue this case this way.\"   Martnez' remarks to the judge grew increasingly acerbic as the lawyer's mood blackened.  Later rulings against Martnez prompted him to make snide comments such as \"I believe that the best thing is for you to ask the jury to find him guilty and that's it,\" and \"It seems everything I do is improper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez accompanied his acrimonious commentary with outward displays of anger.  Parsing the trial transcript (a paper record that cannot reproduce Martnez' hostile tone, manner and body language, although those things plainly emerge from the disputants' statements) reveals numerous occasions when Martnez had to be told to lower his voice or to refrain from shouting, including one instance where the judge exasperatedly asked that the record reflect the fact that Martnez was yelling.  Nor was Martnez' misconduct limited to the tone of his voice.  After one adverse ruling the judge remonstrated Martnez, saying \"I'm sick and tired of you prancing around here, making all kinds of facial expressions, raising your arms, throwing your papers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Predictably, Martnez' comments and behavior further antagonized the trial judge, whose loss of all patience with Martnez' attitude was evidenced by the $300 contempt fine.  More importantly, the judge's tolerance for the fabrication defense dwindled as well.  By the end of the trial the judge began to dismiss Martnez' police perjury arguments with out-of-hand comments like \"Mr. Martnez, argue with your brain\" and \"Don't insult my intelligence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the disintegration of the relationship between the trial judge and Martnez had a corrosive effect on the presentation of Tejeda's fabrication defense to the jury.  Martnez stopped trying to corroborate Tejeda's testimony through cross-examination of the police witnesses, instead devoting his energy to expressing his displeasure with the judge's rulings.  As a result Martnez failed to make effective use of such internal inconsistencies in the officers' testimony as these:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Cook included the cocaine and money in his search warrant return for the apartment, despite the fact that Kirby testified at trial that both items were found instead in the search of Tejeda's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Cook testified at trial that the police found a drug ledger in Tejeda's apartment, but Cook had made no mention of any such ledger in either his search warrant return or in his grand jury testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Cook's grand jury testimony and the police arrest report placed the location of Tejeda's arrest at three different street intersections (including one non-existent address).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, each of those differences (and one or two other matters that we do not itemize) might be viewed instead as reflecting sloppy police work, and the prosecutor would have been entitled to urge that in closing argument to the jury.  But Tejeda too was entitled to have his lawyer urge to the jury that the discrepancies supported the graver conclusion of police misconduct.  Defense counsel's argument drawing that inference from the evidence could have lent critical support to Tejeda's otherwise unsubstantiated version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda's cause also suffered as the trial judge's contempt for Martnez and the fabrication defense grew.  By the end of the trial, the judge mocked Martnez' attempts to use police fabrication arguments.  One manifestation of that disdain was the judge's conclusion that the \"facts\" presented at trial left \"no reasonable inference that the police fabricated any of the stories that they testified to on the stand.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  That led the judge explicitly to forbid Martnez from arguing in his closing statement that the police had planted evidence or were otherwise lying on the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus hampered by the judge's warning (which was backed up by the judge's oft-demonstrated willingness to sustain objections to Martnez' advocacy), Martnez' final presentation of the fabrication defense in his closing statement was neither coherent nor complete.  In addition, Martnez' earlier failure to expose any chinks in the police version of the facts left him with almost no ammunition at the close.  As a result, his fabrication argument depended heavily on Tejeda's testimony and on the naked assertion that policemen sometimes lie in order to win cases.  Not surprisingly, that impotent presentation of Tejeda's position fell short of raising a reasonable doubt as to Tejeda's guilt in the minds of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our extensive review of the trial transcript places us, in cause-and-effect terms, in much the same position as a basketball referee who sees a player throw an elbow at an adversary but cannot tell if the blow was the initial foul or a retaliatory strike.  Both Martnez and the trial judge clearly provoked each other, making it difficult to unravel whether Martnez' petulance or the trial judge's hostility first poisoned their relationship and consequently made it impossible for Martnez to present Tejeda's fabrication defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But unlike the basketball referee, we have no need to decide whether to assess a single foul or a double foul.  Instead our constitutional focus is on defendant Tejeda--and he lost regardless of which of the combatants initiated contact.  Either way, Tejeda was deprived of his chance to present an effective fabrication defense to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus unnecessary for us to attempt to divide the blame between lawyer and judge.  What matters is that lawyer Martnez failed to present Tejeda's primary line of defense to either the judge or the jury.  It is not an answer to observe that the trial judge's own actions appeared to contribute to that failure.  Martnez' anger over the judge's rulings and attitude simply prevented him from serving his client's interests.  That cannot be characterized as trial strategy.  In sum, Martnez' representation was so deficient that it falls below even the minimal standard for professionally competent assistance established by Strickland and its progeny, and it thus satisfies the first half of the Strickland test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the second branch of the Strickland analysis, it is impossible to conclude at any level of certainty whether, but for Martnez' conduct, the jury would have decided that there was enough evidence of police fabrication to raise a reasonable doubt as to Tejeda's guilt.  Martnez' failure to present a coherent argument on that score took the question away from the jury and deprived Tejeda of his only defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Depriving a criminal defendant of his only viable defense certainly renders the resultant trial \"fundamentally unfair or unreliable\" as demanded by Lockhart.   Hence Martnez' inadequate performance created sufficient prejudice to satisfy Strickland 's second requirement as well, and his habeas petition must be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda has demonstrated that Martnez' performance failed to satisfy any objective standard of reasonableness and that Tejeda suffered prejudice from that substandard performance.  That being the case, Tejeda was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel during his trial.  That renders it unnecessary to address Tejeda's added claim based on an allegedly restricted summation by Martnez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the appropriate remedy, the present record--necessarily limited as it is to matters bearing on the issues addressed in our opinion--provides no information as to such questions as when Tejeda actually began to serve his five to seven year sentence and, thus, what his anticipated out date is (giving effect (1) to time spent in custody before the sentence itself commenced and (2) to any good time credits Tejeda has earned while in custody).  Because the nature of Tejeda's constitutional deprivation was the absence of effective representation by counsel rather than some incurable flaw, the usual relief granted to a successful habeas petitioner such as Tejeda would be to give the Commonwealth the choice of affording him a prompt new trial or releasing him.  But in this instance the district judge is in the best position on remand to determine the most appropriate relief.  That may include a determination of what time period would be required for the appropriate scheduling of a new trial, taking into account both the reasonable preparation needs of the prosecution and (more critically) the time needed for new defense counsel to start from scratch and to prepare an effective defense.  It may also be relevant for the district judge to consider whether balancing (1) the timetable referred to in the preceding sentence against (2) the time of Tejeda's presumptive release from custody as things now stand might call for a straightforward order of his current release, rather than affording the Commonwealth the more common alternative described earlier in this paragraph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore REVERSE the district judge's order, VACATE Tejeda's conviction and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As always, this opinion adheres to the conventional and convenient (though technically imprecise) practice of referring to the underlying Bill of Rights provision (which of course imposes limitations only on the federal government) rather than to the Fourteenth Amendment (which applies to state actors and has been construed to embody such Bill of Rights guaranties)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Tejeda's sister Miguelina also testified briefly for the defense, but she could not corroborate any detail of Tejeda's version of the facts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Tejeda's original petition had also asserted that the trial judge's hostility towards Martnez deprived Tejeda of due process of law, but Tejeda elected to drop that claim after a magistrate judge ruled that he had not exhausted that claim in state court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because Tejeda's habeas petition antedated the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"Act\"), he should have applied instead for a certificate of probable cause, the pre-Act nomenclature under Section 2254.  Although the older certificate of probable cause and the new certificate of appealability have identical substantive requirements, issuance of the former places the entire case before the Court of Appeals, while the latter specifies which issues satisfy the required \"substantial showing\" for appellate review (Herrera v. United States, 96 F.3d 1010, 1012 (7th Cir.1996);  see Byrd v. Henderson, 119 F.3d 34, 36 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1997)(per curiam) and other cases cited there).  That distinction is not material here, because we resolve Tejeda's petition solely on the basis of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Those comments--which really applied a preconceived notion of credibility to take that determination from the jury--reflect the trial judge's dislike of the police fabrication defense as such.  It is surely worth noting that the same judge's comparable display of overt hostility toward another defense counsel's attempt to use the same defense caused the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Murchison, 418 Mass. 58, 634 N.E.2d 561 (1994) to overturn a conviction because of the strong likelihood that the judge's comments had prejudiced the jury.  And parenthetically, one of the prosecution's police witnesses as to whom the same judge gave an impermissibly pro-police-biased instruction to the jury in Murchison was identified as Springfield, Massachusetts Officer John O'Mara (id. at 564 n. 2)--presumably the same person as Springfield Detective John O'Mara, one of the police witnesses whose testimony in Tejeda's case the same judge would not permit to be the target of a police fabrication defense advanced by Martnez</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We should not be misunderstood as suggesting that the judge prejudiced the jury with those (or many of the other) negative comments, because virtually all of the infighting between the judge and Martnez took place at bench conferences, presumably outside of the hearing of the jury (although Martnez' propensity to shout might raise at least some doubt as to that assumption).  We focus only on the effect that the acrimonious exchanges had on Martnez' performance before the jury</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> That conclusion was clearly erroneous under Massachusetts law.

Tejeda contends that his conviction must be overturned because he did not receive constitutionally effective counsel at trial as required by the Sixth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  That claim was rejected by the district court, but for the reasons set forth below we reverse that decision, vacate Tejeda's conviction and remand the case for entry of an appropriate order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda was arrested on July 11, 1991 and charged with trafficking in cocaine, unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition without an identification card.  Shortly thereafter he was indicted by a Hampden County, Massachusetts grand jury on those charges and was brought to trial in Hampden Superior Court.  After Tejeda lost two motions to suppress evidence, the trial commenced on December 9, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the prosecution relied on five police witnesses to build its case against Tejeda.  What follows in the next three paragraphs is the officers' account of events, set out as factual narrative without stating the qualification that it reflects their testimony as the jury could be entitled to credit it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the date of Tejeda's arrest Sergeant Charles Cook (\"Cook\") had supervised police surveillance of a house at 37 James Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Tejeda lived in an apartment on the first floor of the house.  After Cook learned that the police had obtained a search warrant for the house (a warrant based on a tip provided by a confidential informant), Cook observed Tejeda leave the house, open the trunk of a car parked outside and lean inside the trunk.  Tejeda then drove away in the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cook followed Tejeda for a short distance and then radioed Detective John O'Mara (\"O'Mara\") to stop the car.  O'Mara stopped Tejeda several blocks away and searched the car.  O'Mara's partner, Detective Dennis Kirby (\"Kirby\"), found a plastic bag in the trunk that contained about 30 grams of white powder, which proved to be cocaine, and $366 on Tejeda's person.  Kirby took Tejeda to the police station after conducting the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the arrest, Cook and several other officers searched Tejeda's apartment.  They found a loaded .38 caliber revolver under a mattress, ammunition for the gun, personal papers indicating that Tejeda lived in the apartment and a \"drug ledger\" containing names and addresses of prospective drug clients.  Tejeda did not have the requisite identification card for the firearm and ammunition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of such testimony, Tejeda's defense lawyer Edelmiro Martnez, Jr.  (\"Martnez\") concluded that Tejeda's only defense was to argue that the police had fabricated the case against Tejeda.  Martnez began his defense by trying to expose inconsistencies in the police testimony during his cross-examinations, but his efforts were completely unavailing because the trial judge sustained numerous objections to Martnez' questions suggesting potential police fraud.  Those rulings hampered Martnez' pursuit of that line of inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez complained bitterly about the adverse rulings, arguing that they prevented him from presenting his defense.  In response the judge harshly warned Martnez not to present a police fabrication defense supported only by Tejeda's word.  Those contentious encounters generated an obvious hostility between Martnez and the judge that poisoned their relationship for the remainder of the trial.  Martnez, incensed by the judge's consistently unfavorable rulings, acted out his frustration by attacking the integrity of the judge.  Martnez' petulance in turn antagonized the judge to the point that he fined Martnez $300 for contempt of court after one outburst.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ongoing conflict discouraged Martnez' pursuit of the police-fabrication line of defense.  He stopped trying to cross-examine prosecution witnesses on that subject and consequently failed to uncover significant inconsistencies that did exist in Cook's and O'Mara's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the only evidence of police fabrication that Martnez presented coherently came from Tejeda and one other defense witness.  Tejeda vigorously denied having either drugs or a gun in his car or apartment.  On the contrary, he testified that he was going in his car to pay some bills when he was stopped at gunpoint by the police.  Tejeda contradicted O'Mara, stating that the car was not searched in Tejeda's presence.  Instead Tejeda said that the police took him to the police station immediately and did not inform him of the charges against him until the next day.  Tejeda stuck to his story during the prosecution's cross-examination, repeatedly insisting that the officers were lying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda's only substantive defense witness, Alejandro Bonilla (\"Bonilla\"), claimed that he was Tejeda's roommate and that he never saw drug trafficking or the gun in their apartment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  But Bonilla's credibility was undermined when he admitted that he had provided a different home address to the police (in the course of a separate incident) two weeks before Tejeda's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Martnez' frenetic attempts to elicit evidence of police fabrication, the trial judge concluded that there was no evidence to support the inference that the police were lying.  Accordingly, he explicitly prohibited Martnez from arguing that theory in his closing statement.  While Martnez did not adhere to that order with total strictness, his oblique references to potential police fabrication were scattered and unsupported by objective evidence of police misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Martnez' failure to argue fully what he had candidly admitted to be Tejeda's only line of defense resulted in guilty verdicts against his client.  Tejeda was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to a state prison term of not less than five nor more than seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After filing a timely notice of appeal, Tejeda moved for a new trial--a motion that was denied without a hearing.  When he then appealed both his conviction and the denial of a new trial, new counsel was appointed to handle the appeals.  Both his appeals were consolidated for hearing before the Massachusetts Appeals Court, and on February 18, 1994 the consolidated appeal was rejected (Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 36 Mass.App.Ct.1105, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></span> (1994)).  Tejeda's application to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for further appellate review was denied on March 29, 1994 (Commonwealth v. Tejeda, 417 Mass.1104, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span> (1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undeterred, Tejeda filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief on December 5, 1994.  Then he alleged in an amended petition that he had received constitutionally ineffective assistance at trial from Martnez and that the trial judge had violated his right to counsel and due process by prohibiting Martnez from arguing the police fabrication theory in his closing argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  On May 12, 1997 the district court issued a memorandum opinion denying both claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda then filed a Motion for Certificate of Appealability as to both claims.  On July 23, 1997 the district court issued a certificate of appealability for Tejeda's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but refused to grant a certificate for the restricted summation claim.  This appeal resulted from the issuance of the certificate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As n.4 has indicated, Tejeda filed his federal habeas petition on December 5, 1994, well before the April 24, 1996 effective date of the Act's amendments to Section 2254.  Lindh v. Murphy, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118135\"><a href=\"/opinion/118135/lindh-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence Tejeda is entitled to de novo review of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Curtis v. Duval, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197507\"><a href=\"/opinion/197507/curtis-v-duval-harshbarger/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>Ineffective-Assistance-of-Counsel Standards</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda claims that Martnez' performance at trial was so deficient that it violated Tejeda's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984) requires that Tejeda show (1) that Martnez' performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) that prejudice resulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating Strickland 's first component, we review Martnez' actions with the strong presumption \"that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy' \" (id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, quoting Michel v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span>, 101, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span> (1955)).  Accordingly, Tejeda must show that \"in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\" (id. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the second element--prejudice flowing from Martnez' substandard performance--Tejeda must demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability that but for Martnez' errors the outcome of the trial would have been different (id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068).   For that purpose a reasonable probability is defined as \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\" (id.).   And in that respect our analysis is not limited to outcome determination--we must also contemplate \"whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable\" (Scarpa v. Dubois, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1994), quoting Lockhart v. Fretwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112807\"><a href=\"/opinion/112807/lockhart-v-fretwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 369, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112807\"><a href=\"/opinion/112807/lockhart-v-fretwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span> (1993)).  That consideration reflects the fact that at its root the right to effective counsel exists \"in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial\" (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684, 104 S.Ct. at 2063).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Application of the Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda contends that Martnez' performance at trial effectively deprived the jury of the chance to address his theory that the police fabricated the evidence against him.  More specifically, Tejeda argues that Martnez' inflammatory statements and actions during trial led to a critical deterioration in the lawyer's relationship with the trial judge, and that the consequence of that mutual hostility between those two key players was that Martnez failed to provide more than a fragmentary and disjointed defense to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the trial transcript confirms that Martnez and the trial judge were like immiscible liquids:  They simply could not tolerate each other.  Their relationship began to break down from the moment that Martnez suggested in his opening statement that the police had fabricated evidence against Tejeda, and it ruptured completely when Martnez began to cross-examine prosecution witnesses in ways that (if he had completed the line of inquiry) could have raised doubts about the veracity of the officers.  Those fledgling attempts to raise the idea of police fabrication to the jury excited the wrath of the judge, who promptly sustained prosecutorial objections to Martnez' line of inquiry.  Martnez responded to those adverse rulings by challenging the integrity of the judge and complaining that he was not being treated fairly.  In turn, those attacks prompted the judge to chastise Martnez about his behavior and to question the propriety of the police fabrication defense itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One exchange that exemplifies the hostile dynamic between Martnez and the trial judge took place during Martnez' cross-examination of O'Mara, the first prosecution witness.  Martnez asked O'Mara questions that implied that the officer had no reason to stop Tejeda's car when he did--in turn implying that O'Mara planted the evidence to cover his own mistake--but the judge sustained a series of objections that allowed O'Mara to avoid answering Martnez' questions.  Martnez criticized those rulings, first asking \"What kind of justice is that?\" and then complaining \"your [sic] limiting me, I can't ask any questions.\"   Those attacks prompted the judge to demand that Martnez outline the evidence he thought supported his fabrication defense.  When Martnez suggested that Tejeda's account alone would support an inference that the police were lying, the judge retorted \"You better have something more than that.\"   After characterizing Martnez' proffer as \"absolutely outrageous,\" the judge warned Martnez \"don't push me ... you overstep the bounds with me and you will know it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez became incensed by the judge's attitude and frequent rulings against him.  He repeatedly protested that the judge was favoring the prosecution, even moving for a mistrial because \"I can't ask any questions.  [The prosecutor] can ask questions....I  believe that I am not in the mood to continue this case this way.\"   Martnez' remarks to the judge grew increasingly acerbic as the lawyer's mood blackened.  Later rulings against Martnez prompted him to make snide comments such as \"I believe that the best thing is for you to ask the jury to find him guilty and that's it,\" and \"It seems everything I do is improper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martnez accompanied his acrimonious commentary with outward displays of anger.  Parsing the trial transcript (a paper record that cannot reproduce Martnez' hostile tone, manner and body language, although those things plainly emerge from the disputants' statements) reveals numerous occasions when Martnez had to be told to lower his voice or to refrain from shouting, including one instance where the judge exasperatedly asked that the record reflect the fact that Martnez was yelling.  Nor was Martnez' misconduct limited to the tone of his voice.  After one adverse ruling the judge remonstrated Martnez, saying \"I'm sick and tired of you prancing around here, making all kinds of facial expressions, raising your arms, throwing your papers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Predictably, Martnez' comments and behavior further antagonized the trial judge, whose loss of all patience with Martnez' attitude was evidenced by the $300 contempt fine.  More importantly, the judge's tolerance for the fabrication defense dwindled as well.  By the end of the trial the judge began to dismiss Martnez' police perjury arguments with out-of-hand comments like \"Mr. Martnez, argue with your brain\" and \"Don't insult my intelligence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the disintegration of the relationship between the trial judge and Martnez had a corrosive effect on the presentation of Tejeda's fabrication defense to the jury.  Martnez stopped trying to corroborate Tejeda's testimony through cross-examination of the police witnesses, instead devoting his energy to expressing his displeasure with the judge's rulings.  As a result Martnez failed to make effective use of such internal inconsistencies in the officers' testimony as these:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Cook included the cocaine and money in his search warrant return for the apartment, despite the fact that Kirby testified at trial that both items were found instead in the search of Tejeda's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Cook testified at trial that the police found a drug ledger in Tejeda's apartment, but Cook had made no mention of any such ledger in either his search warrant return or in his grand jury testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Cook's grand jury testimony and the police arrest report placed the location of Tejeda's arrest at three different street intersections (including one non-existent address).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, each of those differences (and one or two other matters that we do not itemize) might be viewed instead as reflecting sloppy police work, and the prosecutor would have been entitled to urge that in closing argument to the jury.  But Tejeda too was entitled to have his lawyer urge to the jury that the discrepancies supported the graver conclusion of police misconduct.  Defense counsel's argument drawing that inference from the evidence could have lent critical support to Tejeda's otherwise unsubstantiated version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda's cause also suffered as the trial judge's contempt for Martnez and the fabrication defense grew.  By the end of the trial, the judge mocked Martnez' attempts to use police fabrication arguments.  One manifestation of that disdain was the judge's conclusion that the \"facts\" presented at trial left \"no reasonable inference that the police fabricated any of the stories that they testified to on the stand.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  That led the judge explicitly to forbid Martnez from arguing in his closing statement that the police had planted evidence or were otherwise lying on the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus hampered by the judge's warning (which was backed up by the judge's oft-demonstrated willingness to sustain objections to Martnez' advocacy), Martnez' final presentation of the fabrication defense in his closing statement was neither coherent nor complete.  In addition, Martnez' earlier failure to expose any chinks in the police version of the facts left him with almost no ammunition at the close.  As a result, his fabrication argument depended heavily on Tejeda's testimony and on the naked assertion that policemen sometimes lie in order to win cases.  Not surprisingly, that impotent presentation of Tejeda's position fell short of raising a reasonable doubt as to Tejeda's guilt in the minds of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our extensive review of the trial transcript places us, in cause-and-effect terms, in much the same position as a basketball referee who sees a player throw an elbow at an adversary but cannot tell if the blow was the initial foul or a retaliatory strike.  Both Martnez and the trial judge clearly provoked each other, making it difficult to unravel whether Martnez' petulance or the trial judge's hostility first poisoned their relationship and consequently made it impossible for Martnez to present Tejeda's fabrication defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But unlike the basketball referee, we have no need to decide whether to assess a single foul or a double foul.  Instead our constitutional focus is on defendant Tejeda--and he lost regardless of which of the combatants initiated contact.  Either way, Tejeda was deprived of his chance to present an effective fabrication defense to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus unnecessary for us to attempt to divide the blame between lawyer and judge.  What matters is that lawyer Martnez failed to present Tejeda's primary line of defense to either the judge or the jury.  It is not an answer to observe that the trial judge's own actions appeared to contribute to that failure.  Martnez' anger over the judge's rulings and attitude simply prevented him from serving his client's interests.  That cannot be characterized as trial strategy.  In sum, Martnez' representation was so deficient that it falls below even the minimal standard for professionally competent assistance established by Strickland and its progeny, and it thus satisfies the first half of the Strickland test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the second branch of the Strickland analysis, it is impossible to conclude at any level of certainty whether, but for Martnez' conduct, the jury would have decided that there was enough evidence of police fabrication to raise a reasonable doubt as to Tejeda's guilt.  Martnez' failure to present a coherent argument on that score took the question away from the jury and deprived Tejeda of his only defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Depriving a criminal defendant of his only viable defense certainly renders the resultant trial \"fundamentally unfair or unreliable\" as demanded by Lockhart.   Hence Martnez' inadequate performance created sufficient prejudice to satisfy Strickland 's second requirement as well, and his habeas petition must be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda has demonstrated that Martnez' performance failed to satisfy any objective standard of reasonableness and that Tejeda suffered prejudice from that substandard performance.  That being the case, Tejeda was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel during his trial.  That renders it unnecessary to address Tejeda's added claim based on an allegedly restricted summation by Martnez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the appropriate remedy, the present record--necessarily limited as it is to matters bearing on the issues addressed in our opinion--provides no information as to such questions as when Tejeda actually began to serve his five to seven year sentence and, thus, what his anticipated out date is (giving effect (1) to time spent in custody before the sentence itself commenced and (2) to any good time credits Tejeda has earned while in custody).  Because the nature of Tejeda's constitutional deprivation was the absence of effective representation by counsel rather than some incurable flaw, the usual relief granted to a successful habeas petitioner such as Tejeda would be to give the Commonwealth the choice of affording him a prompt new trial or releasing him.  But in this instance the district judge is in the best position on remand to determine the most appropriate relief.  That may include a determination of what time period would be required for the appropriate scheduling of a new trial, taking into account both the reasonable preparation needs of the prosecution and (more critically) the time needed for new defense counsel to start from scratch and to prepare an effective defense.  It may also be relevant for the district judge to consider whether balancing (1) the timetable referred to in the preceding sentence against (2) the time of Tejeda's presumptive release from custody as things now stand might call for a straightforward order of his current release, rather than affording the Commonwealth the more common alternative described earlier in this paragraph.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore REVERSE the district judge's order, VACATE Tejeda's conviction and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As always, this opinion adheres to the conventional and convenient (though technically imprecise) practice of referring to the underlying Bill of Rights provision (which of course imposes limitations only on the federal government) rather than to the Fourteenth Amendment (which applies to state actors and has been construed to embody such Bill of Rights guaranties)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Tejeda's sister Miguelina also testified briefly for the defense, but she could not corroborate any detail of Tejeda's version of the facts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Tejeda's original petition had also asserted that the trial judge's hostility towards Martnez deprived Tejeda of due process of law, but Tejeda elected to drop that claim after a magistrate judge ruled that he had not exhausted that claim in state court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because Tejeda's habeas petition antedated the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"Act\"), he should have applied instead for a certificate of probable cause, the pre-Act nomenclature under Section 2254.  Although the older certificate of probable cause and the new certificate of appealability have identical substantive requirements, issuance of the former places the entire case before the Court of Appeals, while the latter specifies which issues satisfy the required \"substantial showing\" for appellate review (Herrera v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726720\"><a href=\"/opinion/726720/axel-herrera-v-united-states-of-america-lonnie-green-v-augustus-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span>, 1012 (7th Cir.1996);  see Byrd v. Henderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744048\"><a href=\"/opinion/744048/gary-e-byrd-v-john-s-henderson-and-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 36 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1997)(per curiam) and other cases cited there).  That distinction is not material here, because we resolve Tejeda's petition solely on the basis of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Those comments--which really applied a preconceived notion of credibility to take that determination from the jury--reflect the trial judge's dislike of the police fabrication defense as such.  It is surely worth noting that the same judge's comparable display of overt hostility toward another defense counsel's attempt to use the same defense caused the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Murchison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243338\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243338/commonwealth-v-murchison/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243338\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243338/commonwealth-v-murchison/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span> (1994) to overturn a conviction because of the strong likelihood that the judge's comments had prejudiced the jury.  And parenthetically, one of the prosecution's police witnesses as to whom the same judge gave an impermissibly pro-police-biased instruction to the jury in Murchison was identified as Springfield, Massachusetts Officer John O'Mara (id. at 564 n. 2)--presumably the same person as Springfield Detective John O'Mara, one of the police witnesses whose testimony in Tejeda's case the same judge would not permit to be the target of a police fabrication defense advanced by Martnez</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We should not be misunderstood as suggesting that the judge prejudiced the jury with those (or many of the other) negative comments, because virtually all of the infighting between the judge and Martnez took place at bench conferences, presumably outside of the hearing of the jury (although Martnez' propensity to shout might raise at least some doubt as to that assumption).  We focus only on the effect that the acrimonious exchanges had on Martnez' performance before the jury</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> That conclusion was clearly erroneous under Massachusetts law.  As Murchison, 634 N.E.2d at 563 quoted from United States v. Molina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562308\"><a href=\"/opinion/562308/united-states-v-hector-francisco-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1440</span></a></span>, 1445 (9th Cir.1991):</p>\n        <p>In a case that essentially reduces to which of two conflicting stories is true, it may be reasonable to infer, and hence to argue, that one of the two sides is lying.</p>\n        <p>Thus Tejeda's testimony alone would have allowed Martnez to challenge the credibility of the police in his closing argument.  But we stress that here we are applying the federal constitutional standard, not simply a doctrine of state law.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> As noted earlier, Martnez told the judge several times that the police fabrication theory was the only defense Tejeda had.  Our review of the record provides no reason to question that assessment of Tejeda's potential lines of defense</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
