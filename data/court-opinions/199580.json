Defendant-appellant Kenneth J.\n\nEirby complains that the district court impermissibly attributed\n\nto him, for sentencing purposes, a quantity of crack cocaine\n\n(cocaine base) greater than that described in the indictment and\n\nplea agreement.        In his view, the resultant sentence and the\n\nmethodology used to arrive at it intrude upon the prerogative of\n\nthe   grand    jury    and,   in   the    bargain,    offend     the   principles\n\nenunciated in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).                       In\n\na more global attack on his sentence, he also asseverates that\n\nthe federal criminal statutes and sentencing guidelines are\n\nunconstitutional to the extent that they afford widely disparate\n\ntreatment to cocaine in its base and powder forms.                     Discerning\n\nno reversible error, we affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n                                   Background\n\n              The facts are virtually undisputed.              In late 1999, law\n\nenforcement      officers     caught     the     appellant   red-handed    as    he\n\nendeavored to peddle cocaine base.               A federal grand jury sitting\n\nin    the   District    of    Maine      thereafter    returned    a    two-count\n\nindictment against him.            The appellant eventually agreed to\n\nplead guilty to the first count of the indictment (which charged\n\nhim    with    conspiracy     to   distribute        cocaine    base)    and    the\n\ngovernment agreed to dismiss the second count (which charged a\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fspecific distribution offense).            Like the indictment itself, a\n\nnon-binding plea agreement (the Agreement), entered into between\n\nthe appellant and the government under the aegis of Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), mentioned 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) and\n\ndescribed the \"penalty which may be imposed upon conviction\" as\n\n\"a term of imprisonment of not less than five years or more than\n\nforty   years\"     (the    precise    parameters    limned     in   section\n\n841(b)(1)(B)).\n\n          Based on the presentence investigation report, the\n\ndistrict court, over objection, found the appellant responsible\n\nfor 147 grams of crack cocaine (enough to subject him to a\n\ndifferent penalty provision — that contained in 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A)).1     Because the indictment and the Agreement each\n\nreferenced       section     841(b)(1)(B)       rather    than      section\n\n841(b)(1)(A),     the     district   court    recessed   the   disposition\n\n\n\n\n    1In general, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) sets out a type-and-\nquantity-driven sentencing regime for violations of 21 U.S.C. §\n841(a).   While section 841(b)(1)(C) prescribes penalties for\nviolations of section 841(a) when no drug quantities are\nspecified, sections 841(b)(1)(A) and 841(b)(1)(B) prescribe\ndiffering penalties for violations of section 841(a) depending\nupon, inter alia, drug type and drug quantity.     Pertinently,\nsection 841(b)(1)(A) prescribes a minimum sentence of 10 years\nand a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for offenses\ninvolving 50 grams or more (but less than 150 grams) of cocaine\nbase. Section 841(b)(1)(B) prescribes a minimum sentence of 5\nand a maximum sentence of 40 years for offenses involving five\ngrams or more (but less than 50 grams) of cocaine base.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fhearing and offered the appellant an opportunity to withdraw his\n\nplea.\n\n            After considering the court's offer for approximately\n\nfive weeks, the appellant decided to proceed, but reserved the\n\nright to appeal the determination that section 841(b)(1)(A)\n\napplied.    The parties subsequently stipulated, for sentencing\n\npurposes, that the appellant \"[was] responsible for at least 50\n\ngrams, but less than 150 grams, of cocaine base,\" and that his\n\nbase offense level was 32.\n\n            When the district court reconvened the disposition\n\nhearing, it rejected the appellant's constitutional challenge to\n\nthe disparity between cocaine base and cocaine powder.                    Moving\n\nfrom the general to the specific, the court found that the\n\nappellant's relevant criminal conduct consisted of distributing\n\n147 grams of crack cocaine (cocaine base).                    After applying an\n\nappropriate        three-level          reduction       for     acceptance      of\n\nresponsibility,       see   USSG    §3E1.1,      the    court   arrived   at    an\n\nadjusted    offense     level      of    29.     In    conjunction     with    the\n\nappellant's criminal history category (II), the adjusted offense\n\nlevel yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 97-121\n\nmonths.      The    court's     drug-quantity          determination    and    its\n\ninvocation of section 841(b)(1)(A) brought into play a mandatory\n\nminimum    sentence    of   120    months      (which,    coincidentally,      was\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fwithin      the    GSR).     Starting      from   that   baseline,      the   court\n\ndeparted downward for substantial assistance, USSG §5K1.1, and\n\nsentenced the appellant to serve a 66-month incarcerative term.\n\nThis appeal followed.2\n\n                                           II.\n\n                                     Discussion\n\n                 The appellant's best argument is that the district\n\ncourt      usurped    the    grand       jury's   province    by   impermissibly\n\nsubstituting         21    U.S.C.    §    841(b)(1)(A)       for   21   U.S.C.    §\n\n841(b)(1)(B).        While this argument obliquely involves Apprendi,\n\nhe places his next three arguments squarely under the Apprendi\n\numbrella.          He asserts that, post-Apprendi, drug quantity no\n\nlonger can be treated as a sentencing factor, but, rather, must\n\nbe treated as an element of the offense — and therefore must be\n\ncharged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt;\n\nthat       the    lower    court's   drug-quantity       determination,       made\n\npursuant to a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, exposed\n\nhim to a higher mandatory minimum sentence (and, thus, offended\n\n\n       2\n     The government attempts to stall this appeal at the\nstarting gate on the basis that the appellant's guilty plea,\ncoupled with his decision not to withdraw that plea after the\ndistrict court announced its intention to sentence him under 21\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), constituted a waiver of any rights\narising out of the grand jury's failure to specify the\nappropriate drug weight in the indictment.           Given our\ndisposition of the appellant's asseverational array, see text\ninfra, we need not delve into the question of waiver.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fApprendi); and that Apprendi requires a distinction, not drawn\n\nby the court below, between the quantity of drugs \"involved\" in\n\nan offense (for the purpose of ascertaining the applicable\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum sentence) and the quantity of drugs\n\nfor which a defendant is \"responsible\" (for the purpose of\n\ndetermining the applicable GSR).        The appellant's last argument\n\nassails, on constitutional grounds, what he deems the draconian\n\nnature of the criminal penalties that Congress has attached to\n\ncrack cocaine.\n\n                                   A.\n\n                         Standards of Review\n\n           We pause at the onset to delineate the standard of\n\nreview.    The appellant squarely challenged the district court's\n\ninvocation of section 841(b)(1)(A) and argued below that he\n\nshould have been sentenced under section 841(b)(1)(B).              Since\n\nthat argument presents an abstract legal question, our review is\n\nplenary.    United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).     The   same   holds   true    for   the   appellant's   cocaine\n\nbase/cocaine powder \"disparity\" argument.           See United States v.\n\nGifford, 17 F.3d 462, 471-72 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that\n\nquestions involving the constitutionality of statutes engender\n\nplenary review).    In contrast, the appellant's three Apprendi-\n\nbased claims are raised for the first time on appeal.             As such,\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\four review of those claims is for plain error.              This entails a\n\nquadripartite showing:       \"(1) that there was error; (2) that it\n\nwas plain; (3) that the error affect[ed] substantial rights; and\n\n(4) that the error affected the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"            United States v. Gomez,\n\n255 F.3d 31, 42 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                    B.\n\n                           Necessary Background\n\n            Before grappling with the appellant's contentions, we\n\noffer some background.        Pre-Apprendi, this court had held that\n\nthe   drug-quantity    delineations      contained     in     21     U.S.C.   §\n\n841(b)(1) were not elements of the corresponding offense, but,\n\nrather, sentencing factors \"relevant only for determining the\n\npenalty.\"     United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   Under that holding, specific drug quantities did not\n\nhave to be charged in the indictment and the drug weights\n\nnecessary to implement section 841(b)(1)'s penalty scheme could\n\nbe determined by the sentencing judge under a preponderance-of-\n\nthe-evidence standard.        Id. at 1161.      The Court's decision in\n\nApprendi requires some rethinking of this approach.                 See United\n\nStates   v.    Robinson,    241   F.3d   115,    123   (1st        Cir.   2001)\n\n(explaining that Apprendi \"shifted the tectonic plates insofar\n\nas criminal sentencing is concerned\").\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            The core holding of Apprendi is that, apart from the\n\nfact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty\n\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must both be\n\ncharged    in   the   indictment   and    submitted   to    a   jury   for   a\n\ndetermination     under    the   beyond-a-reasonable-doubt        standard.\n\nApprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.         Under this holding, a finding of\n\ndrug quantity which increases a defendant's sentence beyond the\n\notherwise applicable statutory maximum must be proved to the\n\njury beyond a reasonable doubt.          United States v. Westmoreland,\n\n240 F.3d 618, 631-32 (7th Cir. 2001).         To that extent, then, the\n\nnotion that the quantity determinations demanded by section\n\n841(b)(1) are merely sentencing factors is no longer completely\n\ntrue.     See United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Doggett, 230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5th Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n            Still, Apprendi does not call for full abrogation of\n\nour prior practice.       In particular, the Apprendi doctrine offers\n\nno advantage to a defendant who is sentenced to a term less than\n\nthe otherwise applicable statutory maximum.                We expounded on\n\nthis point in     United States v.        Caba, 241 F.3d 98 (1st Cir.\n\n2001):\n\n            By its own terms, the holding in Apprendi\n            applies only when the disputed \"fact\"\n            enlarges the applicable statutory maximum\n            and the defendant's sentence exceeds the\n\n                                    -9-\n\f            original maximum. For this reason, Apprendi\n            simply does not apply to guideline findings\n            (including,   inter   alia,   drug   weight\n            calculations) that increase the defendant's\n            sentence, but do not elevate the sentence\n            beyond the lowest applicable statutory\n            maximum.\n\nId.   at   101    (citations   omitted).      This      means   that   when    a\n\ndefendant    is    sentenced   to   less   than   the    default   statutory\n\nmaximum for violating section 841(a) — twenty years in prison,\n\nsee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) — Apprendi is irrelevant.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2001).                      In\n\nsuch circumstances, judicial determination of drug quantity\n\nunder a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard remains a viable\n\noption.    See Caba, 241 F.3d at 101; United States v. Baltas, 236\n\nF.3d 27, 41 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                     C.\n\n                     The Indictment-Based Argument\n\n            Apprendi bears only a glancing relationship to the\n\nappellant's first argument.         The count of conviction — the text\n\nof which is annexed as an appendix to this opinion — charged the\n\nappellant with participation in a drug-trafficking conspiracy in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.          That statute, as pleaded here,\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\flooks to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) as the source of applicable\n\npenalties.     Since the appellant actually received a sentence\n\nbelow the default statutory maximum (i.e., a sentence less than\n\nthe 20-year maximum delineated in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C)), the\n\nsentence would withstand Apprendi scrutiny even if the count of\n\nconviction mentioned no drug weight at all.            See, e.g., Caba,\n\n241 F.3d at 101; Baltas, 236 F.3d at 41.           That being so, it is\n\nsurpassingly difficult to see how the inclusion of a wrong drug\n\nweight — a mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) rather\n\nthan section 841(b)(1)(A) — would constitute reversible error\n\nunder Apprendi.        See United States v. Shepard, 235 F.3d 1295,\n\n1296-97 (11th Cir. 2000) (finding Apprendi violation, but no\n\nprejudice, in similar circumstances, and therefore upholding the\n\ndefendant's conviction and sentence).\n\n          The appellant, however, has a plausible non-Apprendi-\n\nbased argument that gets at the same point.             The grand jury\n\nchose to include a specific reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) in\n\nthe count of conviction, and the appellant suggests that, given\n\nthe   grand   jury's    action,   the   court's   decision   to   supplant\n\nsection 841(b)(1)(B) with section 841(b)(1)(A) both usurped the\n\ngrand jury's institutional prerogative and abridged his rights\n\nunder the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.             This was a structural\n\nerror, the appellant says, warranting relief even though \"it is\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fnot certain that [he] would have received a different sentence\n\nif   the    district         court   had    applied   section    841(b)(1)(B).\"\n\nAppellant's Brief at 10.\n\n            Although cleverly constructed, this argument fails.\n\nIn general, an indictment is sufficient if it specifies the\n\nelements of the offense charged, fairly apprises the defendant\n\nof the charge against which he must defend, and allows him to\n\ncontest it without fear of double jeopardy.                Hamling v. United\n\nStates, 418 U.S. 87, 117 (1974); United States v. Yefsky, 994\n\nF.2d 885, 893 (1st Cir. 1993).               In an indictment for conspiring\n\nto commit an offense, however, the conspiracy is the gist of the\n\ncrime,     and    it    is    therefore     unnecessary   to    allege   all   the\n\nelements essential to the commission of the offense which is the\n\nobject of the conspiracy.             Wong Tai v. United States, 273 U.S.\n\n77, 81 (1927); Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 893.                The specification of a\n\npenalty provision for the underlying offense was, therefore, not\n\nessential to the validity of the conspiracy count.\n\n            This leads to two conclusions.                First, because the\n\ncourt's     use    of    section      841(b)(1)(A)     rather     than   section\n\n841(b)(1)(B) left the substance of the charge unaffected, the\n\nswitch did not usurp the prerogative of the grand jury.                        See\n\nUnited States v. Kegler, 724 F.2d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\n\nSecond, since the mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) was\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fobviously intended to give the appellant notice of the potential\n\npunishment that awaited him, the switch to section 841(b)(1)(A)\n\ndid not constitute reversible error unless it deprived the\n\nappellant of notice or otherwise misled him to his detriment.\n\nCf. United States v. Burnett, 582 F.2d 436, 438 (8th Cir. 1976)\n\n(stating that \"[p]rejudice to the defendant must be present\n\nbefore an amendment [to an indictment] is held impermissible\").\n\n             The latter conclusion is reinforced by Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 7(c)(1), which requires that an indictment be\n\n\"a   plain,    concise    and    definite      written     statement    of    the\n\nessential facts constituting the offense charged.\" (emphasis\n\nsupplied).     Pertinently, the rule goes on to state that whereas\n\nan   indictment      \"shall    state   for    each   count   the   official    or\n\ncustomary citation of the statute . . . which the defendant is\n\nalleged therein to have violated,\" nonetheless, \"[e]rror in the\n\ncitation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of\n\nthe indictment . . . or for reversal of a conviction if the\n\nerror   or    omission    did    not    mislead      the   defendant    to    his\n\nprejudice.\"        Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1).         The question, then, is\n\nwhether      the    mistaken     reference      to    section      841(b)(1)(B)\n\nprejudiced the appellant.\n\n             The answer to this question plainly is in the negative.\n\nWhen the district court determined that section 841(b)(1)(B) was\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fnot the appropriate penalty provision for this case, the court\n\npromptly advised the appellant of that fact and offered him an\n\nopportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.              After deliberation and\n\nconsultation with counsel, the appellant declined.                  His decision\n\nto go forward was fully informed; he knew at that point that the\n\ncourt   planned      to   employ    the    penalty    provision      of    section\n\n841(b)(1)(A).         Because      the    court   gave    the    appellant    what\n\namounted to amended notice, the indictment's mistaken reference\n\nto section 841(b)(1)(B) did not mislead him.3\n\n                                          D.\n\n                  The Remaining Apprendi Arguments\n\n             The appellant's remaining Apprendi arguments need not\n\ndetain us.     His assertion that Apprendi required the district\n\ncourt   to   apply    section      841(b)(1)(B)      in   this    case    founders\n\nbecause that statute provides for sentences of up to 40 years,\n\nand the district court actually sentenced the appellant to serve\n\n66 months — a figure well below the statute's maximum.                     Indeed,\n\nthe sentence imposed is considerably less than the default\n\n\n    3The repetition of the mistake in the Agreement does not\nprofit the appellant's cause. The most that can be said is that\nthe court failed to honor the parties' agreement as to what\npenalty provision was appropriate — and the essence of a non-\nbinding plea agreement is that the judge may override the\nparties' agreements. See, e.g., United States v. Teeter, ___\nF.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 00-2332, slip op. at 26].\nThis is especially true of stipulations as to the matters of\nlaw. See id. at ___ [slip op. at 27].\n\n                                         -14-\n\fstatutory maximum of 20 years found in section 841(b)(1)(C)\n\n(which       applies        to    detectable,       but    otherwise      unquantified,\n\namounts of cocaine base).                  Thus, no Apprendi violation inheres.4\n\n                 The appellant attempts to parry this thrust by means\n\nof his third argument:               he contends that the sentencing court's\n\ndrug-quantity           determination          exposed       him   to   an   increased\n\nmandatory minimum sentence and an increased potential maximum\n\nsentence.         We recently rejected a comparable set of contentions\n\nin Robinson, where the defendant had been convicted of one count\n\nof   possessing         cocaine       base     with       intent   to   distribute    in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and one count of conspiracy\n\nto possess cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 846.                 Despite the fact that no specific drug\n\nquantity was charged in the indictment (and, consequently, the\n\njury       had   made   no       finding    anent    quantity),     the    trial   court\n\ndetermined by a preponderance of the evidence that 35.33 grams\n\nof cocaine base was the relevant drug weight for sentencing\n\npurposes.         Robinson, 241 F.3d at 117.                On appeal, the defendant\n\nclaimed, inter alia, that this determination violated Apprendi\n\nby   triggering         a    higher    minimum        mandatory     sentence    and   by\n\n\n       4\n      To the extent, if at all, that the court's pre-departure\nbase — 120 months — may be germane here, that figure too is well\nbelow the default statutory maximum contained in 21 U.S.C. §\n841(b)(1)(C).   It is even further removed from the maximum\npenalty permissible under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n                                             -15-\n\fexposing her to a significantly higher maximum sentence.                       Id. at\n\n119.\n\n            We rejected the first half of this claim, noting that\n\nthe Apprendi Court, 530 U.S. at 487 n.13, had taken pains to\n\npreserve the authority of McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79,\n\n81-84    (1986)   (upholding     a    state        statute      that   required    a\n\nmandatory     minimum   sentence           based     solely      on    a   judge's\n\npreponderance-of-the-evidence findings).                  Robinson, 241 F.3d at\n\n122.     We explained that \"since McMillan clearly allows a fact\n\nthat triggers a mandatory minimum sentence to be found by a\n\njudge using a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard as long as\n\nthe mandatory minimum does not exceed the otherwise applicable\n\nstatutory    maximum,   it     forecloses          [any    argument     that    such\n\nmandatory minimums violate Apprendi].\"                  Id.\n\n            We also rebuffed the second half of the defendant's\n\nclaim.     In ruling that mere exposure to a higher potential\n\nsentence does not violate Apprendi, we made it pellucid that the\n\nApprendi doctrine was concerned with actual sentences as opposed\n\nto   potential    sentences.         See    id.    at     121   (explaining     that\n\n\"theoretical exposure to a higher sentence, unaccompanied by the\n\nimposition of a sentence that in fact exceeds the otherwise-\n\napplicable statutory maximum, is of no consequence\").\n\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f                Although the appellant labels his fourth argument as\n\nApprendi-based and we have accepted his taxonomy, we are at a\n\nloss to fathom how Apprendi figures into it — and the Apprendi\n\nlink is not developed in the appellant's brief.                    The argument\n\nderives from the district court's imposition of a sentence based\n\non a drug quantity for which the appellant admitted he was\n\n\"responsible.\"         Refined to bare essence, the appellant asserts\n\nthat       a   drug-quantity   stipulation     made    for   the    purpose    of\n\ndetermining        a   defendant's   base    offense   level   (BOL)    is    not\n\ncompetent proof of the amount of drugs \"involved\" in the offense\n\nof conviction for the purpose of fixing the applicable mandatory\n\nminimum under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).\n\n                This argument runs contrary to circuit precedent:              we\n\ngenerally have allowed a single drug-quantity calculation to\n\nserve as the basis for determining both the BOL and the level of\n\npenalty to be imposed.         See Lindia, 82 F.3d at 1160 (citing USSG\n\n§2D1.1 cmt. (n.12)); United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 39-40\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (similar); United States v. Pion, 25 F.3d 18, 25\n\nn.12 (1st Cir. 1994) (similar).5              Apprendi has no discernible\n\n\n       5\n      Use of the same drug-quantity calculation for determining\nboth a mandatory minimum sentence and the defendant's BOL has\nbeen approved without discussion in a long list of cases. E.g.,\nRobinson, 241 F.3d at 117-18; United States v. Alicea-Cardoza,\n132 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Miranda-\nSantiago, 96 F.3d 517, 520, 525 (1st Cir. 1996); United States\nv. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                      -17-\n\fbearing on the validity of this line of cases, and we are bound\n\nto follow them.     See United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (discussing duty of newly-constituted panel in\n\na multi-panel circuit to adhere to rulings of prior panels,\n\nabsent special circumstances).\n\n            To be sure, there may be instances in which we might\n\nconsider requiring separate drug-quantity determinations.                       In\n\nUnited States v.     Winston, 37 F.3d 235 (6th Cir. 1994), for\n\nexample, the court was concerned with whether it could aggregate\n\nmultiple    drug   counts    when    considering       whether   21    U.S.C.    §\n\n841(b)(1)(A) demanded the imposition of a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence.     To   cope     with    this    peculiar    problem,      the   court\n\nrequired disaggregation (and, hence, separate determinations).\n\nId. at 241 n.10.      But Winston — the only case cited by the\n\nappellant on this point — is clearly inapposite here:                         the\n\nappellant was convicted and sentenced on only a single count,\n\nand this case presents no comparable question of aggregation.\n\n            Another possible exception to the general rule might\n\narise where the sentencing guidelines and the statute that fixes\n\na mandatory minimum sentence provide differing mandates.                     For\n\nexample, the method of determining the amount of lysergic acid\n\ndiethylamide (LSD) necessary to trigger a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence differs from the method specified by the guidelines for\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdetermining a defendant's BOL.        See Neal v. United States, 516\n\nU.S. 284, 295-96 (1996); United States v. Boot, 25 F.3d 52, 53-\n\n54 (1st Cir. 1994); cf. United States v. Scalia, 993 F.2d 984,\n\n988 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining divergent treatment of marijuana\n\ndue to a distinction between the use of the number of plants to\n\ndetermine the statutory mandatory minimum and the use of the\n\ntotal weight of the plants to determine the BOL).             Once again,\n\nthe appellant's case does not involve such discrepant standards.\n\n             We have said enough on this score.          We adhere to our\n\ngeneral rule that, absent special circumstances, drug-quantity\n\ndeterminations can be used interchangeably for both statutory\n\npenalty and guideline sentencing purposes.         As the appellant has\n\nfailed to bring his case within any recognized exception to this\n\nrule,   we   reject   his   claim   that   the   lower   court   erred   in\n\neschewing an entirely separate drug-quantity determination for\n\nthe purpose of identifying the applicable statutory penalty\n\nprovision.\n\n                                     E.\n\n                      The Equal Protection Claim\n\n             This leaves the appellant's constitutional challenge.\n\nThe statutes criminalizing drug trafficking and the ancillary\n\nsentencing guidelines admittedly attach much harsher penalties\n\nto the distribution of cocaine base than to the distribution of\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\flike quantities of powdered cocaine.               Compare, e.g., 21 U.S.C.\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (setting penalties for trafficking in five\n\nkilograms      or   more    of   cocaine        powder),    with,     e.g.,      id.\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(iii)      (setting      the   same    level    of    penalties      for\n\ntrafficking in 50 grams or more of cocaine base).                  The appellant\n\nasseverates that this tiered treatment has an impermissible\n\ndisparate impact on African-Americans, thereby violating the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.\n\n            We addressed this precise issue in United States v.\n\nSingleterry, 29 F.3d 733 (1st Cir. 1994), in which we rejected\n\nthe   claim    of   unconstitutional           treatment    because       we   found\n\n\"insufficient       evidence     that    the    distinction       drawn    between\n\ncocaine base and cocaine was motivated by any racial animus or\n\ndiscriminatory intent on the part of either Congress or the\n\nSentencing Commission.\"            Id. at 741 (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted).          The appellant has offered us nothing\n\nnew, and we are thus bound to follow our earlier ruling.                         See\n\nWogan,   938    F.2d   at   1449    (discussing      \"law    of    the    circuit\"\n\ndoctrine).     Consequently, although we recognize the severity of\n\nthe penalty paradigm vis-à-vis crack cocaine, we must uphold it.\n\n                                        III.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f            We need go no further.

Eirby complains that the district court impermissibly attributed to him, for sentencing purposes, a quantity of crack cocaine (cocaine base) greater than that described in the indictment and plea agreement. In his view, the resultant sentence and the methodology used to arrive at it intrude upon the prerogative of the grand jury and, in the bargain, offend the principles enunciated in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). In a more global attack on his sentence, he also asseverates that the federal criminal statutes and sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional to the extent that they afford widely disparate treatment to cocaine in its base and powder forms. Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are virtually undisputed. In late 1999, law enforcement officers caught the appellant red-handed as he endeavored to peddle cocaine base. A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Maine thereafter returned a two-count indictment against him. The appellant eventually agreed to plead guilty to the first count of the indictment (which charged him with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base) and the government agreed to dismiss the second count (which charged a specific distribution offense). Like the indictment itself, a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement), entered into between the appellant and the government under the aegis of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), mentioned 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) and described the \"penalty which may be imposed upon conviction\" as \"a term of imprisonment of not less than five years or more than forty years\" (the precise parameters limned in section 841(b)(1)(B)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the presentence investigation report, the district court, over objection, found the appellant responsible for 147 grams of crack cocaine (enough to subject him to a different penalty provision -- that contained in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because the indictment and the Agreement each referenced section 841(b)(1)(B) rather than section 841(b)(1)(A), the district court recessed the disposition hearing and offered the appellant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the court's offer for approximately five weeks, the appellant decided to proceed, but reserved the right to appeal the determination that section 841(b)(1)(A) applied. The parties subsequently stipulated, for sentencing purposes, that the appellant \"[was] responsible for at least 50 grams, but less than 150 grams, of cocaine base,\" and that his base offense level was 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court reconvened the disposition hearing, it rejected the appellant's constitutional challenge to the disparity between cocaine base and cocaine powder. Moving from the general to the specific, the court found that the appellant's relevant criminal conduct consisted of distributing 147 grams of crack cocaine (cocaine base). After applying an appropriate three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, see USSG &#167;3E1.1, the court arrived at an adjusted offense level of 29. In conjunction with the appellant's criminal history category (II), the adjusted offense level yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 97-121 months. The court's drug-quantity determination and its invocation of section 841(b)(1)(A) brought into play a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months (which, coincidentally, was within the GSR). Starting from that baseline, the court departed downward for substantial assistance, USSG &#167;5K1.1, and sentenced the appellant to serve a 66-month incarcerative term. This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's best argument is that the district court usurped the grand jury's province by impermissibly substituting 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) for 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). While this argument obliquely involves Apprendi, he places his next three arguments squarely under the Apprendi umbrella. He asserts that, post-Apprendi, drug quantity no longer can be treated as a sentencing factor, but, rather, must be treated as an element of the offense--and therefore must be charged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; that the lower court's drug-quantity determination, made pursuant to a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, exposed him to a higher mandatory minimum sentence (and, thus, offended Apprendi); and that Apprendi requires a distinction, not drawn by the court below, between the quantity of drugs \"involved\" in an offense (for the purpose of ascertaining the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence) and the quantity of drugs for which a defendant is \"responsible\" (for the purpose of determining the applicable GSR). The appellant's last argument assails, on constitutional grounds, what he deems the draconian nature of the criminal penalties that Congress has attached to crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Standards of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause at the onset to delineate the standard of review. The appellant squarely challenged the district court's invocation of section 841(b)(1)(A) and argued below that he should have been sentenced under section 841(b)(1)(B). Since that argument presents an abstract legal question, our review is plenary. United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 1998). The same holds true for the appellant's cocaine base/cocaine powder \"disparity\" argument. See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 471-72 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that questions involving the constitutionality of statutes engender plenary review). In contrast, the appellant's three Apprendi-based claims are raised for the first time on appeal. As such, our review of those claims is for plain error. This entails a quadripartite showing: \"(1) that there was error; (2) that it was plain; (3) that the error affect[ed] substantial rights; and (4) that the error affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" United States v. Gomez, 255 F.3d 31, 42 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Necessary Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before grappling with the appellant's contentions, we offer some background. Pre-Apprendi, this court had held that the drug-quantity delineations contained in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1) were not elements of the corresponding offense, but, rather, sentencing factors \"relevant only for determining the penalty.\" United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160 (1st Cir. 1996). Under that holding, specific drug quantities did not have to be charged in the indictment and the drug weights necessary to implement section 841(b)(1)'s penalty scheme could be determined by the sentencing judge under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Id. at 1161. The Court's decision in Apprendi requires some rethinking of this approach. See United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 123 (1st Cir. 2001) (explaining that Apprendi \"shifted the tectonic plates insofar as criminal sentencing is concerned\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The core holding of Apprendi is that, apart from the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must both be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury for a determination under the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490. Under this holding, a finding of drug quantity which increases a defendant's sentence beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Westmoreland, 240 F.3d 618, 631-32 (7th Cir. 2001). To that extent, then, the notion that the quantity determinations demanded by section 841(b)(1) are merely sentencing factors is no longer completely true. See United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Doggett, 230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Apprendi does not call for full abrogation of our prior practice. In particular, the Apprendi doctrine offers no advantage to a defendant who is sentenced to a term less than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum. We expounded on this point in United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98 (1st Cir. 2001):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the holding in Apprendi applies only when the disputed \"fact\" enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and the defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum. For this reason, Apprendi simply does not apply to guideline findings (including, inter alia, drug weight calculations) that increase the defendant's sentence, but do not elevate the sentence beyond the lowest applicable statutory maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 101 (citations omitted). This means that when a defendant is sentenced to less than the default statutory maximum for violating section 841(a) -- twenty years in prison, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) -- Apprendi is irrelevant. See United States v. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2001). In such circumstances, judicial determination of drug quantity under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard remains a viable option. See Caba, 241 F.3d at 101; United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 41 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Indictment-Based Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apprendi bears only a glancing relationship to the appellant's first argument. The count of conviction -- the text of which is annexed as an appendix to this opinion -- charged the appellant with participation in a drug-trafficking conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. That statute, as pleaded here, looks to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1) as the source of applicable penalties. Since the appellant actually received a sentence below the default statutory maximum (i.e., a sentence less than the 20-year maximum delineated in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C)), the sentence would withstand Apprendi scrutiny even if the count of conviction mentioned no drug weight at all. See, e.g., Caba, 241 F.3d at 101; Baltas, 236 F.3d at 41. That being so, it is surpassingly difficult to see how the inclusion of a wrong drug weight -- a mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) rather than section 841(b)(1)(A) -- would constitute reversible error under Apprendi. See United States v. Shepard, 235 F.3d 1295, 1296-97 (11th Cir. 2000) (finding Apprendi violation, but no prejudice, in similar circumstances, and therefore upholding the defendant's conviction and sentence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant, however, has a plausible non-Apprendi-based argument that gets at the same point. The grand jury chose to include a specific reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) in the count of conviction, and the appellant suggests that, given the grand jury's action, the court's decision to supplant section 841(b)(1)(B) with section 841(b)(1)(A) both usurped the grand jury's institutional prerogative and abridged his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. This was a structural error, the appellant says, warranting relief even though \"it is not certain that [he] would have received a different sentence if the district court had applied section 841(b)(1)(B).\" Appellant's Brief at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although cleverly constructed, this argument fails. In general, an indictment is sufficient if it specifies the elements of the offense charged, fairly apprises the defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and allows him to contest it without fear of double jeopardy. Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117 (1974); United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 893 (1st Cir. 1993). In an indictment for conspiring to commit an offense, however, the conspiracy is the gist of the crime, and it is therefore unnecessary to allege all the elements essential to the commission of the offense which is the object of the conspiracy. Wong Tai v. United States, 273 U.S. 77, 81 (1927); Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 893. The specification of a penalty provision for the underlying offense was, therefore, not essential to the validity of the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to two conclusions. First, because the court's use of section 841(b)(1)(A) rather than section 841(b)(1)(B) left the substance of the charge unaffected, the switch did not usurp the prerogative of the grand jury. See United States v. Kegler, 724 F.2d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Second, since the mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) was obviously intended to give the appellant notice of the potential punishment that awaited him, the switch to section 841(b)(1)(A) did not constitute reversible error unless it deprived the appellant of notice or otherwise misled him to his detriment. Cf. United States v. Burnett, 582 F.2d 436, 438 (8th Cir. 1976) (stating that \"[p]rejudice to the defendant must be present before an amendment [to an indictment] is held impermissible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter conclusion is reinforced by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1), which requires that an indictment be \"a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\" (emphasis supplied). Pertinently, the rule goes on to state that whereas an indictment \"shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute . . . which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated,\" nonetheless, \"[e]rror in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment . . . or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). The question, then, is whether the mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) prejudiced the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to this question plainly is in the negative. When the district court determined that section 841(b)(1)(B) was not the appropriate penalty provision for this case, the court promptly advised the appellant of that fact and offered him an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. After deliberation and consultation with counsel, the appellant declined. His decision to go forward was fully informed; he knew at that point that the court planned to employ the penalty provision of section 841(b)(1)(A). Because the court gave the appellant what amounted to amended notice, the indictment's mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) did not mislead him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Remaining Apprendi Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's remaining Apprendi arguments need not detain us. His assertion that Apprendi required the district court to apply section 841(b)(1)(B) in this case founders because that statute provides for sentences of up to 40 years, and the district court actually sentenced the appellant to serve 66 months -- a figure well below the statute's maximum. Indeed, the sentence imposed is considerably less than the default statutory maximum of 20 years found in section 841(b)(1)(C) (which applies to detectable, but otherwise unquantified, amounts of cocaine base). Thus, no Apprendi violation inheres.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant attempts to parry this thrust by means of his third argument: he contends that the sentencing court's drug-quantity determination exposed him to an increased mandatory minimum sentence and an increased potential maximum sentence. We recently rejected a comparable set of contentions in Robinson, where the defendant had been convicted of one count of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. Despite the fact that no specific drug quantity was charged in the indictment (and, consequently, the jury had made no finding anent quantity), the trial court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that 35.33 grams of cocaine base was the relevant drug weight for sentencing purposes. Robinson, 241 F.3d at 117. On appeal, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that this determination violated Apprendi by triggering a higher minimum mandatory sentence and by exposing her to a significantly higher maximum sentence. Id. at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rejected the first half of this claim, noting that the Apprendi Court, 530 U.S. at 487 n.13, had taken pains to preserve the authority of McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 81-84 (1986) (upholding a state statute that required a mandatory minimum sentence based solely on a judge's preponderance-of-the-evidence findings). Robinson, 241 F.3d at 122. We explained that \"since McMillan clearly allows a fact that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence to be found by a judge using a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard as long as the mandatory minimum does not exceed the otherwise applicable statutory maximum, it forecloses [any argument that such mandatory minimums violate Apprendi].\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also rebuffed the second half of the defendant's claim. In ruling that mere exposure to a higher potential sentence does not violate Apprendi, we made it pellucid that the Apprendi doctrine was concerned with actual sentences as opposed to potential sentences. See id. at 121 (explaining that \"theoretical exposure to a higher sentence, unaccompanied by the imposition of a sentence that in fact exceeds the otherwise-applicable statutory maximum, is of no consequence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellant labels his fourth argument as Apprendi-based and we have accepted his taxonomy, we are at a loss to fathom how Apprendi figures into it -- and the Apprendi link is not developed in the appellant's brief. The argument derives from the district court's imposition of a sentence based on a drug quantity for which the appellant admitted he was \"responsible.\" Refined to bare essence, the appellant asserts that a drug-quantity stipulation made for the purpose of determining a defendant's base offense level (BOL) is not competent proof of the amount of drugs \"involved\" in the offense of conviction for the purpose of fixing the applicable mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument runs contrary to circuit precedent: we generally have allowed a single drug-quantity calculation to serve as the basis for determining both the BOL and the level of penalty to be imposed. See Lindia, 82 F.3d at 1160 (citing USSG &#167;2D1.1 cmt. (n.12)); United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 39-40 (1st Cir. 1995) (similar); United States v. Pion, 25 F.3d 18, 25 n.12 (1st Cir. 1994) (similar).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Apprendi has no discernible bearing on the validity of this line of cases, and we are bound to follow them. See United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing duty of newly-constituted panel in a multi-panel circuit to adhere to rulings of prior panels, absent special circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there may be instances in which we might consider requiring separate drug-quantity determinations. In United States v. Winston, 37 F.3d 235 (6th Cir. 1994), for example, the court was concerned with whether it could aggregate multiple drug counts when considering whether 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) demanded the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence. To cope with this peculiar problem, the court required disaggregation (and, hence, separate determinations). Id. at 241 n.10. But Winston -- the only case cited by the appellant on this point -- is clearly inapposite here: the appellant was convicted and sentenced on only a single count, and this case presents no comparable question of aggregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another possible exception to the general rule might arise where the sentencing guidelines and the statute that fixes a mandatory minimum sentence provide differing mandates. For example, the method of determining the amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) necessary to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence differs from the method specified by the guidelines for determining a defendant's BOL. See Neal v. United States, 516 U.S. 284, 295-96 (1996); United States v. Boot, 25 F.3d 52, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1994); cf. United States v. Scalia, 993 F.2d 984, 988 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining divergent treatment of marijuana due to a distinction between the use of the number of plants to determine the statutory mandatory minimum and the use of the total weight of the plants to determine the BOL). Once again, the appellant's case does not involve such discrepant standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. We adhere to our general rule that, absent special circumstances, drug-quantity determinations can be used interchangeably for both statutory penalty and guideline sentencing purposes. As the appellant has failed to bring his case within any recognized exception to this rule, we reject his claim that the lower court erred in eschewing an entirely separate drug-quantity determination for the purpose of identifying the applicable statutory penalty provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Protection Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the appellant's constitutional challenge. The statutes criminalizing drug trafficking and the ancillary sentencing guidelines admittedly attach much harsher penalties to the distribution of cocaine base than to the distribution of like quantities of powdered cocaine. Compare, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (setting penalties for trafficking in five kilograms or more of cocaine powder), with, e.g., id. 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (setting the same level of penalties for trafficking in 50 grams or more of cocaine base). The appellant asseverates that this tiered treatment has an impermissible disparate impact on African-Americans, thereby violating the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We addressed this precise issue in United States v. Singleterry, 29 F.3d 733 (1st Cir. 1994), in which we rejected the claim of unconstitutional treatment because we found \"insufficient evidence that the distinction drawn between cocaine base and cocaine was motivated by any racial animus or discriminatory intent on the part of either Congress or the Sentencing Commission.\" Id. at 741 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The appellant has offered us nothing new, and we are thus bound to follow our earlier ruling. See Wogan, 938 F.2d at 1449 (discussing \"law of the circuit\" doctrine). Consequently, although we recognize the severity of the penalty paradigm vis-a-vis crack cocaine, we must uphold it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Pertinently, section 841(b)(1)(A) prescribes a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for offenses involving 50 grams or more (but less than 150 grams) of cocaine base.

In a more global attack on his sentence, he also asseverates that the federal criminal statutes and sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional to the extent that they afford widely disparate treatment to cocaine in its base and powder forms. Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are virtually undisputed. In late 1999, law enforcement officers caught the appellant red-handed as he endeavored to peddle cocaine base. A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Maine thereafter returned a two-count indictment against him. The appellant eventually agreed to plead guilty to the first count of the indictment (which charged him with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base) and the government agreed to dismiss the second count (which charged a specific distribution offense). Like the indictment itself, a non-binding plea agreement (the Agreement), entered into between the appellant and the government under the aegis of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), mentioned 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) and described the \"penalty which may be imposed upon conviction\" as \"a term of imprisonment of not less than five years or more than forty years\" (the precise parameters limned in section 841(b)(1)(B)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the presentence investigation report, the district court, over objection, found the appellant responsible for 147 grams of crack cocaine (enough to subject him to a different penalty provision -- that contained in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because the indictment and the Agreement each referenced section 841(b)(1)(B) rather than section 841(b)(1)(A), the district court recessed the disposition hearing and offered the appellant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the court's offer for approximately five weeks, the appellant decided to proceed, but reserved the right to appeal the determination that section 841(b)(1)(A) applied. The parties subsequently stipulated, for sentencing purposes, that the appellant \"[was] responsible for at least 50 grams, but less than 150 grams, of cocaine base,\" and that his base offense level was 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court reconvened the disposition hearing, it rejected the appellant's constitutional challenge to the disparity between cocaine base and cocaine powder. Moving from the general to the specific, the court found that the appellant's relevant criminal conduct consisted of distributing 147 grams of crack cocaine (cocaine base). After applying an appropriate three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, see USSG &#167;3E1.1, the court arrived at an adjusted offense level of 29. In conjunction with the appellant's criminal history category (II), the adjusted offense level yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 97-121 months. The court's drug-quantity determination and its invocation of section 841(b)(1)(A) brought into play a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months (which, coincidentally, was within the GSR). Starting from that baseline, the court departed downward for substantial assistance, USSG &#167;5K1.1, and sentenced the appellant to serve a 66-month incarcerative term. This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's best argument is that the district court usurped the grand jury's province by impermissibly substituting 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) for 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B). While this argument obliquely involves Apprendi, he places his next three arguments squarely under the Apprendi umbrella. He asserts that, post-Apprendi, drug quantity no longer can be treated as a sentencing factor, but, rather, must be treated as an element of the offense--and therefore must be charged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; that the lower court's drug-quantity determination, made pursuant to a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, exposed him to a higher mandatory minimum sentence (and, thus, offended Apprendi); and that Apprendi requires a distinction, not drawn by the court below, between the quantity of drugs \"involved\" in an offense (for the purpose of ascertaining the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence) and the quantity of drugs for which a defendant is \"responsible\" (for the purpose of determining the applicable GSR). The appellant's last argument assails, on constitutional grounds, what he deems the draconian nature of the criminal penalties that Congress has attached to crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Standards of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause at the onset to delineate the standard of review. The appellant squarely challenged the district court's invocation of section 841(b)(1)(A) and argued below that he should have been sentenced under section 841(b)(1)(B). Since that argument presents an abstract legal question, our review is plenary. United States v. Conley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198112\"><a href=\"/opinion/198112/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir. 1998). The same holds true for the appellant's cocaine base/cocaine powder \"disparity\" argument. See United States v. Gifford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 471-72 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that questions involving the constitutionality of statutes engender plenary review). In contrast, the appellant's three Apprendi-based claims are raised for the first time on appeal. As such, our review of those claims is for plain error. This entails a quadripartite showing: \"(1) that there was error; (2) that it was plain; (3) that the error affect[ed] substantial rights; and (4) that the error affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" United States v. Gomez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199484\"><a href=\"/opinion/199484/united-states-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Necessary Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before grappling with the appellant's contentions, we offer some background. Pre-Apprendi, this court had held that the drug-quantity delineations contained in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1) were not elements of the corresponding offense, but, rather, sentencing factors \"relevant only for determining the penalty.\" United States v. Lindia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196710\"><a href=\"/opinion/196710/united-states-v-lindia/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span>, 1160 (1st Cir. 1996). Under that holding, specific drug quantities did not have to be charged in the indictment and the drug weights necessary to implement section 841(b)(1)'s penalty scheme could be determined by the sentencing judge under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Id. at 1161. The Court's decision in Apprendi requires some rethinking of this approach. See United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199304\"><a href=\"/opinion/199304/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir. 2001) (explaining that Apprendi \"shifted the tectonic plates insofar as criminal sentencing is concerned\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The core holding of Apprendi is that, apart from the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must both be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury for a determination under the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490. Under this holding, a finding of drug quantity which increases a defendant's sentence beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Westmoreland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772112\"><a href=\"/opinion/772112/united-states-v-guy-j-westmoreland/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 631-32 (7th Cir. 2001). To that extent, then, the notion that the quantity determinations demanded by section 841(b)(1) are merely sentencing factors is no longer completely true. See United States v. Duarte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Doggett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"22036\"><a href=\"/opinion/22036/united-states-v-doggett/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span>, 164-65 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Apprendi does not call for full abrogation of our prior practice. In particular, the Apprendi doctrine offers no advantage to a defendant who is sentenced to a term less than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum. We expounded on this point in United States v. Caba, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199298\"><a href=\"/opinion/199298/united-states-v-caba/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2001):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the holding in Apprendi applies only when the disputed \"fact\" enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and the defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum. For this reason, Apprendi simply does not apply to guideline findings (including, inter alia, drug weight calculations) that increase the defendant's sentence, but do not elevate the sentence beyond the lowest applicable statutory maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 101 (citations omitted). This means that when a defendant is sentenced to less than the default statutory maximum for violating section 841(a) -- twenty years in prison, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) -- Apprendi is irrelevant. See United States v. Terry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772069\"><a href=\"/opinion/772069/united-states-v-kenneth-b-terry-aka-kenny-polo/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir. 2001). In such circumstances, judicial determination of drug quantity under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard remains a viable option. See Caba, 241 F.3d at 101; United States v. Baltas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199221\"><a href=\"/opinion/199221/united-states-v-baltas/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Indictment-Based Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apprendi bears only a glancing relationship to the appellant's first argument. The count of conviction -- the text of which is annexed as an appendix to this opinion -- charged the appellant with participation in a drug-trafficking conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. That statute, as pleaded here, looks to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1) as the source of applicable penalties. Since the appellant actually received a sentence below the default statutory maximum (i.e., a sentence less than the 20-year maximum delineated in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C)), the sentence would withstand Apprendi scrutiny even if the count of conviction mentioned no drug weight at all. See, e.g., Caba, 241 F.3d at 101; Baltas, 236 F.3d at 41. That being so, it is surpassingly difficult to see how the inclusion of a wrong drug weight -- a mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) rather than section 841(b)(1)(A) -- would constitute reversible error under Apprendi. See United States v. Shepard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771567\"><a href=\"/opinion/771567/united-states-v-alphonso-shepard/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1295</span></a></span>, 1296-97 (11th Cir. 2000) (finding Apprendi violation, but no prejudice, in similar circumstances, and therefore upholding the defendant's conviction and sentence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant, however, has a plausible non-Apprendi-based argument that gets at the same point. The grand jury chose to include a specific reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) in the count of conviction, and the appellant suggests that, given the grand jury's action, the court's decision to supplant section 841(b)(1)(B) with section 841(b)(1)(A) both usurped the grand jury's institutional prerogative and abridged his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. This was a structural error, the appellant says, warranting relief even though \"it is not certain that [he] would have received a different sentence if the district court had applied section 841(b)(1)(B).\" Appellant's Brief at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although cleverly constructed, this argument fails. In general, an indictment is sufficient if it specifies the elements of the offense charged, fairly apprises the defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and allows him to contest it without fear of double jeopardy. Hamling v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109084\"><a href=\"/opinion/109084/hamling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 117 (1974); United States v. Yefsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 893 (1st Cir. 1993). In an indictment for conspiring to commit an offense, however, the conspiracy is the gist of the crime, and it is therefore unnecessary to allege all the elements essential to the commission of the offense which is the object of the conspiracy. Wong Tai v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100986\"><a href=\"/opinion/100986/wong-tai-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 81 (1927); Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 893. The specification of a penalty provision for the underlying offense was, therefore, not essential to the validity of the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to two conclusions. First, because the court's use of section 841(b)(1)(A) rather than section 841(b)(1)(B) left the substance of the charge unaffected, the switch did not usurp the prerogative of the grand jury. See United States v. Kegler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429379\"><a href=\"/opinion/429379/united-states-v-angela-m-kegler/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 194 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Second, since the mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) was obviously intended to give the appellant notice of the potential punishment that awaited him, the switch to section 841(b)(1)(A) did not constitute reversible error unless it deprived the appellant of notice or otherwise misled him to his detriment. Cf. United States v. Burnett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358943\"><a href=\"/opinion/358943/united-states-v-joseph-louis-burnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 438 (8th Cir. 1976) (stating that \"[p]rejudice to the defendant must be present before an amendment [to an indictment] is held impermissible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter conclusion is reinforced by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1), which requires that an indictment be \"a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\" (emphasis supplied). Pertinently, the rule goes on to state that whereas an indictment \"shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute . . . which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated,\" nonetheless, \"[e]rror in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment . . . or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). The question, then, is whether the mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) prejudiced the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to this question plainly is in the negative. When the district court determined that section 841(b)(1)(B) was not the appropriate penalty provision for this case, the court promptly advised the appellant of that fact and offered him an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. After deliberation and consultation with counsel, the appellant declined. His decision to go forward was fully informed; he knew at that point that the court planned to employ the penalty provision of section 841(b)(1)(A). Because the court gave the appellant what amounted to amended notice, the indictment's mistaken reference to section 841(b)(1)(B) did not mislead him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Remaining Apprendi Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's remaining Apprendi arguments need not detain us. His assertion that Apprendi required the district court to apply section 841(b)(1)(B) in this case founders because that statute provides for sentences of up to 40 years, and the district court actually sentenced the appellant to serve 66 months -- a figure well below the statute's maximum. Indeed, the sentence imposed is considerably less than the default statutory maximum of 20 years found in section 841(b)(1)(C) (which applies to detectable, but otherwise unquantified, amounts of cocaine base). Thus, no Apprendi violation inheres.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant attempts to parry this thrust by means of his third argument: he contends that the sentencing court's drug-quantity determination exposed him to an increased mandatory minimum sentence and an increased potential maximum sentence. We recently rejected a comparable set of contentions in Robinson, where the defendant had been convicted of one count of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. Despite the fact that no specific drug quantity was charged in the indictment (and, consequently, the jury had made no finding anent quantity), the trial court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that 35.33 grams of cocaine base was the relevant drug weight for sentencing purposes. Robinson, 241 F.3d at 117. On appeal, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that this determination violated Apprendi by triggering a higher minimum mandatory sentence and by exposing her to a significantly higher maximum sentence. Id. at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rejected the first half of this claim, noting that the Apprendi Court, 530 U.S. at 487 n.13, had taken pains to preserve the authority of McMillan v. Pennsylvania, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 81-84 (1986) (upholding a state statute that required a mandatory minimum sentence based solely on a judge's preponderance-of-the-evidence findings). Robinson, 241 F.3d at 122. We explained that \"since McMillan clearly allows a fact that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence to be found by a judge using a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard as long as the mandatory minimum does not exceed the otherwise applicable statutory maximum, it forecloses [any argument that such mandatory minimums violate Apprendi].\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also rebuffed the second half of the defendant's claim. In ruling that mere exposure to a higher potential sentence does not violate Apprendi, we made it pellucid that the Apprendi doctrine was concerned with actual sentences as opposed to potential sentences. See id. at 121 (explaining that \"theoretical exposure to a higher sentence, unaccompanied by the imposition of a sentence that in fact exceeds the otherwise-applicable statutory maximum, is of no consequence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellant labels his fourth argument as Apprendi-based and we have accepted his taxonomy, we are at a loss to fathom how Apprendi figures into it -- and the Apprendi link is not developed in the appellant's brief. The argument derives from the district court's imposition of a sentence based on a drug quantity for which the appellant admitted he was \"responsible.\" Refined to bare essence, the appellant asserts that a drug-quantity stipulation made for the purpose of determining a defendant's base offense level (BOL) is not competent proof of the amount of drugs \"involved\" in the offense of conviction for the purpose of fixing the applicable mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument runs contrary to circuit precedent: we generally have allowed a single drug-quantity calculation to serve as the basis for determining both the BOL and the level of penalty to be imposed.

But Winston -- the only case cited by the appellant on this point -- is clearly inapposite here: the appellant was convicted and sentenced on only a single count, and this case presents no comparable question of aggregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another possible exception to the general rule might arise where the sentencing guidelines and the statute that fixes a mandatory minimum sentence provide differing mandates. For example, the method of determining the amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) necessary to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence differs from the method specified by the guidelines for determining a defendant's BOL. See Neal v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117994\"><a href=\"/opinion/117994/neal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 295-96 (1996); United States v. Boot, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670675\"><a href=\"/opinion/670675/united-states-v-christopher-lee-boot/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1994); cf. United States v. Scalia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607107\"><a href=\"/opinion/607107/united-states-v-rickie-albert-scalia/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 988 (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining divergent treatment of marijuana due to a distinction between the use of the number of plants to determine the statutory mandatory minimum and the use of the total weight of the plants to determine the BOL). Once again, the appellant's case does not involve such discrepant standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. We adhere to our general rule that, absent special circumstances, drug-quantity determinations can be used interchangeably for both statutory penalty and guideline sentencing purposes. As the appellant has failed to bring his case within any recognized exception to this rule, we reject his claim that the lower court erred in eschewing an entirely separate drug-quantity determination for the purpose of identifying the applicable statutory penalty provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Protection Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the appellant's constitutional challenge. The statutes criminalizing drug trafficking and the ancillary sentencing guidelines admittedly attach much harsher penalties to the distribution of cocaine base than to the distribution of like quantities of powdered cocaine. Compare, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (setting penalties for trafficking in five kilograms or more of cocaine powder), with, e.g., id. 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (setting the same level of penalties for trafficking in 50 grams or more of cocaine base). The appellant asseverates that this tiered treatment has an impermissible disparate impact on African-Americans, thereby violating the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We addressed this precise issue in United States v. Singleterry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674592\"><a href=\"/opinion/674592/united-states-v-daryl-e-singleterry/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1994), in which we rejected the claim of unconstitutional treatment because we found \"insufficient evidence that the distinction drawn between cocaine base and cocaine was motivated by any racial animus or discriminatory intent on the part of either Congress or the Sentencing Commission.\" Id. at 741 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The appellant has offered us nothing new, and we are thus bound to follow our earlier ruling. See Wogan, 938 F.2d at 1449 (discussing \"law of the circuit\" doctrine). Consequently, although we recognize the severity of the penalty paradigm vis-a-vis crack cocaine, we must uphold it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

While section 841(b)(1)(C) prescribes penalties for violations of section 841(a) when no drug quantities are specified, sections 841(b)(1)(A) and 841(b)(1)(B) prescribe differing penalties for violations of section 841(a) depending upon, inter alia, drug type and drug quantity. Pertinently, section 841(b)(1)(A) prescribes a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for offenses involving 50 grams or more (but less than 150 grams) of cocaine base. Section 841(b)(1)(B) prescribes a minimum sentence of 5 and a maximum sentence of 40 years for offenses involving five grams or more (but less than 50 grams) of cocaine base.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The government attempts to stall this appeal at the starting gate on the basis that the appellant's guilty plea, coupled with his decision not to withdraw that plea after the district court announced its intention to sentence him under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), constituted a waiver of any rights arising out of the grand jury's failure to specify the appropriate drug weight in the indictment. Given our disposition of the appellant's asseverational array, see text infra, we need not delve into the question of waiver.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The repetition of the mistake in the Agreement does not profit the appellant's cause. The most that can be said is that the court failed to honor the parties' agreement as to what penalty provision was appropriate -- and the essence of a non-binding plea agreement is that the judge may override the parties' agreements. See, e.g., United States v. Teeter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 2001). This is especially true of stipulations as to the matters of law. See id. at 22.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To the extent, if at all, that the court's pre-departure base -- 120 months -- may be germane here, that figure too is well below the default statutory maximum contained in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). It is even further removed from the maximum penalty permissible under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Use of the same drug-quantity calculation for determining both a mandatory minimum sentence and the defendant's BOL has been approved without discussion in a long list of cases.
