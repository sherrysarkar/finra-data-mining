Appellant Maryann Hall,  former spouse of\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\ndefendant-appellee Lawrence  Hall, appeals from a  district court\r\n\njudgment  dismissing  her  diversity  suit for  breach  of  their\r\n\nagreement  for  an equal  division  of any  remaining  capital in\r\n\nMerlin Machinery, a Massachusetts corporation in which each owned\r\n\nshares.1  Maryann claims  that the adverse jury verdict  on which\r\n\nthe  district court based its  judgment is against  the weight of\r\n\nthe evidence and  that the court erred in denying  her motion for\r\n\nnew trial.2  We affirm.\r\n\n          Maryann's timeous  motion for  new trial under  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P. 59(b)  requires that  we review  the sufficiency  of the\r\n\nevidence, see  Velazquez v. Figueroa-Gomez, 996  F.2d 425, 426-27\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 993 (1993), but only for abuse\r                                  \r\n\nof  discretion.  Id.  at 427.   Following  careful review  of the\r                             \r\n\nentire  record, we  are satisfied  that the district  court acted\r\n\nwell  within its broad discretion  in denying the  motion for new\r\n\ntrial.  We add only these brief comments.  \r\n\n          The district court submitted two questions to the jury.\r\n\nThe  first  inquired  whether  Maryann had  proven  that  capital\r\n\nremained  or should have remained  in Merlin Machinery  as of the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  evidence is  viewed,  and every  reasonable  inference\r\ndrawn, in the light most favorable to the verdict.  J.D.  Havinga\r                                                                           \r\nv. Crowley Towing and Transp.  Co., 24 F.3d 1480, 1483  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n1994).\r\n\n     2As Maryann filed no motion for judgment as a matter of law,\r\nsee Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50(a), (b), we cannot  entertain the Rule 50\r             \r\nclaim.   Hammond v.  T.J. Litle &amp;  Co., Inc., 82  F.3d 1166, 1171\r                                                      \r\n(1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nagreed settlement date.3  The jury responded in the negative.  \r\n\n          Unlike Larry, Maryann presented  no expert testimony on\r\n\nthis accounting question.   Moreover, although Maryann  presented\r\n\nother  evidence which, if credited by the jury, may have sufficed\r\n\nto demonstrate undistributed capital in the corporation,  nothing\r\n\nin  the  record suggests  that the  jury  need have  accepted her\r\n\nevidence   over  the   competing  evidence   offered   by  Larry.\r\n\nConsequently, we must credit Larry's version, see J.D. Havinga v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCrowley  Towing and  Transp.

Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed.  \r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3We do not reach the second question.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n",
