Steven J.

Appellant Eileen Kirk appeals the\n\ndecision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nappellees The Hitchcock Clinic, Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital,\n\nDartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Dartmouth College, Dartmouth\n\nMedical School, Lisabeth Maloney, Barry Smith, Thomas Colacchio, and\n\nEllen Hubbell (collectively, \"Hitchcock\") as to her claims of sex\n\ndiscrimination and retaliatory and discriminatory discharge. Kirk v.\n\nHitchcock Clinic, No. CIV. 98-700-M, 2000 WL 1513715 (D.N.H. Sept. 29,\n\n2000) (Summ. J. Order).     We affirm.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          Kirk brought this discrimination action against her former\n\nemployer pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. Because the district court order provides a\n\nwell-summarized factual background, Kirk, 2000 WL 1513715, at *1-*3, we\n\nlimit our chronology to the key events.\n\n          Kirk was hired by Hitchcock in September of 1992 to work as\n\na doctor in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department. Her continued\n\nemployment was subject to annual review. After five years, she was to\n\nbe eligible for \"voting membership,\" a status akin to tenure in an\n\nacademic institution. For Kirk's annual appointments in 1993, 1994,\n\nand 1995, she was recommended without reservation and reappointed\n\nwithout incident. Sometime in 1995, Kirk became concerned about the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fquality of care in the labor and delivery ward,1 and became something\n\nof a crusader in raising these quality assurance issues. This caused\n\na strain in her relationships with some of the nurses and/or the\n\nnursing leadership.\n\n          In 1996, Hitchcock began negotiating with neighboring Alice\n\nPeck Day Hospital (\"APD\") to provide APD with obstetrical services.\n\nHoping to escape the tense working environment at Hitchcock, Kirk\n\nvolunteered to be one of the doctors assigned to APD. The chairperson\n\nof the department at the time, Dr. John Currie, told her that he was\n\nnot going to send a woman to APD. Interpreting this comment as sex\n\ndiscrimination, Kirk reported Currie to the Medical Director.\n\nFollowing an internal investigation that concluded that the remark,\n\nwhile poorly phrased, represented a business decision and not\n\ndiscrimination,2 the matter was for the most part resolved with an\n\napology by Currie to Kirk.\n\n          During this time, Kirk continued to voice her concerns\n\nregarding alleged quality control issues, which resulted in more bad\n\nfeelings between Kirk and several individuals at Hitchcock. Prior to\n\nher reappointment in 1996, Kirk agreed to work on improving the\n\n\n1 Kirk's concerns allegedly came to the fore in the fall of 1994\nfollowing a birth that she handled in which medical complications\nresulted in brain damage to the infant.\n2 Currie explained that his comment related to the general high demand\nfor female ob/gyns and was intended to express his unwillingness to\nloan Kirk to Hitchcock's competitor, APD.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fsituation in several ways. Nevertheless, not much changed in the\n\nsubsequent year, and Kirk was denied reappointment and tenure in 1997\n\ndue to \"lack of collegiality.\" After failing to have this decision\n\noverturned by Hitchcock's internal appeals process, and losing her\n\nclaim brought under New Hampshire's \"Whistleblower's Act,\" this lawsuit\n\nproceeded in the federal district court of New Hampshire.\n\n          The district court's order in response to Hitchcock's Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment held the following: (1) Kirk had not produced\n\nevidence that the alleged hostile work environment to which she was\n\nsubject was based on sex; (2) Kirk's discrimination claim based on the\n\n1996 comment made by Currie that he was not sending a female ob/gyn to\n\nAPD was time-barred since it was not brought within the 300-day filing\n\ndeadline prescribed by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e); (3) the failure to\n\ntimely file was not excused by any exceptional circumstance that would\n\nwarrant tolling the time limit; (4) the 1996 comment was not part of a\n\npattern of ongoing discrimination that culminated in her 1997 firing\n\nunder any \"continuing violation\" theory; and (5) Kirk had not offered\n\nevidence that her termination was the result of her reporting the 1996\n\nCurrie comment or of disparate treatment. Kirk, 2000 WL 1513715.3 In\n\nthis appeal, Kirk focuses on the issues of timeliness and wrongful\n\ntermination. Specifically, she first argues that the 1996 Currie\n\n3 The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\nover the remaining state law claims and dismissed them without\nprejudice for refiling in the state court. Id. at *7.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fremark should be considered under either the \"serial\" or \"systematic\"\n\ncontinuing violation theory. In the alternative, she requests that we\n\ntoll the 300-day time limit based on principles of equitable estoppel.\n\nSecond, she appeals the holding that her termination was neither\n\nretaliatory nor motivated by sex discrimination.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          Our review is de novo. Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R.\n\nWireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2000); Landrau-Romero v.\n\nBanco Popular de P.R., 212 F.3d 607, 611 (1st Cir. 2000). However,\n\nafter careful review of the record, briefs, and filings of the parties,\n\nas well as of the district court order, we conclude that the opinion of\n\nthe district court is \"comprehensive[ and] well-reasoned.\" Lawton v.\n\nState Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.\n\n1996). We affirm, therefore, based in substantial part on the district\n\ncourt judgment and offer only a few brief comments.         See, e.g., id.\n\nA.   Waiver of Equitable Estoppel Argument\n\n          In the district court, Kirk argued that the delay in filing\n\nher claim of sex discrimination should be excused because \"she was\n\nafraid she would lose her job if she filed earlier.\" Kirk, 2000 WL\n\n1513715, at *5. This excuse was properly rejected by the district\n\ncourt. Now, for the first time, she claims that she failed to file a\n\nclaim in reliance on deliberately false representations by Hitchcock\n\nthat the matter was resolved and that her job was secure. According to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fKirk, Hitchcock reappointed her in 1996 solely due to fear of Title VII\n\nliability and intended to fire her as soon as the risk of litigation\n\nhad passed.   Although we suspect that this excuse too would have\n\nfailed, Kirk has precluded its consideration in this Court by\n\nneglecting to make the argument before the district court. United\n\nStates v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 554 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Issues not\n\nsquarely raised in the district court will not be entertained on\n\nappeal.\"). The lack of evidentiary support for Kirk's allegation of\n\nmisrepresentation by Hitchcock, moreover, takes this instance beyond\n\nthe scope of the narrow exception to the raise-or-waive rule. Id. at\n\n554 n.8 (exception reserved for \"exceptional cases involving a gross\n\nmiscarriage of justice\").\n\nB.   Pretext v. Mixed-Motive Approach\n\n          While we fully support the district court's conclusion that\n\nKirk has provided insufficient evidence to support her claim of\n\nretaliatory and/or discriminatory discharge, we wish to clarify the\n\nproper analytical approach. The district court held that Kirk's claim\n\nfailed under either the \"mixed-motive,\" Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,\n\n490 U.S. 228, 241-42 (1989) (plurality opinion), or the \"pretext,\"\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973), approach.\n\nRegarding the mixed-motive approach, the district court assumed that\n\nKirk had met her evidentiary burden of showing than an illicit motive\n\nplayed a substantial factor in the termination decision; it\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fnevertheless granted summary judgment against her on the ground that\n\nHitchcock had successfully demonstrated another adequate and non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for terminating her.\n\n          We doubt, however, that Kirk actually proffered sufficient\n\nevidence to proceed under a mixed-motive approach. First Circuit\n\nprecedent dictates that the mixed-motive test is reserved solely for\n\ncases in which direct evidence of unlawful activity has been submitted.\n\nFebres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., 214 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 2000);\n\nFernándes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   Evidence is considered to be direct if \"it consists of\n\nstatements by a decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus\n\nand bear squarely on the contested employment decision.\" Febres, 214\n\nF.3d at 60.\n\n          Kirk offers the statement made by Currie in 1996 that he was\n\nnot sending a woman ob/gyn to APD as direct evidence of her wrongful\n\ntermination claim. This comment may be direct evidence of Hitchcock's\n\ndiscriminatory refusal to send Kirk to APD, but that claim is now time-\n\nbarred. As to the termination decision, the statement is not direct\n\nevidence at all: it is not direct evidence of retaliatory termination\n\nbecause it does not reflect a retaliatory motive, and it is not direct\n\nevidence or discriminatory termination because it does nothing to show\n\nthat Currie's alleged animus influenced the decision not to reappoint.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          Under the pretext approach, Kirk must first prove a prima\n\nfacie case of either retaliation or disparate treatment. Tex. Dep't of\n\nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1980); Provencher v.\n\nCVS Pharmacy, 145 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 1998).          Assuming this\n\nrequirement is met, Hitchcock then must supply a legitimate and\n\nnondiscriminatory justification for the decision not to reappoint.\n\nProvencher, 145 F.3d at 10. \"Then, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\n[Kirk] must show that the proffered reason is pretextual.\" Id. It is\n\nat this third stage that the district court held that Kirk's claim\n\nfailed. Kirk, 2000 WL 1513715, at *6-*7. We are satisfied with the\n\nexplanations provided by the district court for this conclusion and\n\nincorporate them as the basis for our affirmance in this regard.\n\n          Having nothing more to offer, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Evidence is considered to be direct if \"it consists of\n\nstatements by a decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus\n\nand bear squarely on the contested employment decision.\" Febres, 214\n\nF.3d at 60.\n\n          Kirk offers the statement made by Currie in 1996 that he was\n\nnot sending a woman ob/gyn to APD as direct evidence of her wrongful\n\ntermination claim. This comment may be direct evidence of Hitchcock's\n\ndiscriminatory refusal to send Kirk to APD, but that claim is now time-\n\nbarred. As to the termination decision, the statement is not direct\n\nevidence at all: it is not direct evidence of retaliatory termination\n\nbecause it does not reflect a retaliatory motive, and it is not direct\n\nevidence or discriminatory termination because it does nothing to show\n\nthat Currie's alleged animus influenced the decision not to reappoint.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          Under the pretext approach, Kirk must first prove a prima\n\nfacie case of either retaliation or disparate treatment.
