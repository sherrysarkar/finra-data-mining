RONDEAU,\r\n       Individually and as Father and Next Friend\r\n                o/b/o Sarah Ann Rondeau,\r\n\n                 Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n            STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, ET AL.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n    [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Kevin R. Rondeau on brief pro se.\r\n\nFEBRUARY 26, 1999\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  We have carefully reviewed the brief\r\nfiled by appellant, Kevin Rondeau, and the record on appeal. \r\nWe reject, as insubstantial, Rondeau's complaints about the\r\naccuracy of the factual background of the underlying matter, as\r\nrecited by the magistrate-judge in his report and\r\nrecommendation.  We affirm essentially for the reasons stated\r\nin that report and recommendation, dated June 11, 1998, that\r\nwas approved by the district court in a judgment, entered on\r\nJune 25, 1998.  We have considered all of Rondeau's arguments\r\non appeal and find no need to address them in detail.  We add\r\nonly the following comment.\r\n          Rondeau complains that the magistrate-judge and the\r\ndistrict court wrongfully treated his complaint as a prisoner\r\nfiling, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1915A.  Although Rondeau\r\nconcedes that he is incarcerated at the New Hampshire State\r\nHospital, he argues that he is not a \"prisoner\" within the\r\nmeaning of  1915A because, he says, contrary to the\r\nmagistrate-judge's contention, the criminal charges are not\r\npending, but rather the charges have been dismissed.  We note\r\nthat Rondeau has been unclear and inconsistent in his own\r\ndescription of the status of the criminal charges.  In a\r\nprevious habeas action, Rondeau initially claimed that he had\r\nbeen convicted of the charges and then claimed that, rather\r\nthan his having been convicted of the charges, the charges had\r\nbeen dismissed.  In the instant civil rights action, Rondeau\r\nvariously claimed that (i) the charges were dismissed or (ii)\r\nthe charges were dismissed, reinstated, and then \"never\r\nadjudicated in court.\"  Whether \"never adjudicated in court\"\r\nmeans that the charges were dismissed again or simply deferred\r\nbecause of Rondeau's civil commitment to the State Hospital is\r\nnot clear.\r\n          However, regardless whether Rondeau is a prisoner for\r\npurposes of  1915A, a complaint filed by a non-prisoner may be\r\ndismissed pursuant to  1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) if it fails to state\r\na claim on which relief may be granted.  See, e.g., McGore v.\r\nWrigglesworth, 114 F.3d 601, 608-09 (6th Cir. 1997); Bell v.\r\nDobbs Int'l Serv., 6 F. Supp. 2d 863, 864 (E.D. Mo. 1998);\r\nPowell v. Hoover, 956 F. Supp. 564, 566 (M.D. Pa. 1997).  A\r\ndismissal under  1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a\r\nclaim on which relief may be granted entails the same analysis\r\nas a dismissal under  1915(A) for failure to state a claim on\r\nwhich relief may be granted.  See McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114\r\nF.3d at 604.  Although the magistrate-judge cited  1915A, we\r\ncan affirm on any basis supported by the record.  See Helveringv. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245 (1937); Willhauck v. Halpin, 953\r\nF.2d 689, 704 (1st Cir. 1991).  The court's conclusion that\r\ncertain of Rondeau's claims stated no claim upon which relief\r\nmay be granted is correct, even if the recited basis, i.e., \r\n1915(A), is inaccurate.  The court's conclusion that the\r\nremaining claims were subject to dismissal for lack of subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction or because they were not properly brought\r\nas claims under 42 U.S.C.  1983 is likewise correct.\r\n          The motion for an evidentiary hearing is denied.\r\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n",
