Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Theodus Jordan on brief pro se.\n     Maureen A. MacFarlane on brief for appellees Boston Public\nSchools and School Committee for the City of Boston.\n     A. Van C. Lanckton and Craig and Macauley on brief for\nappellee Tremont Credit Union (f/k/a Boston Teachers Federal\nCredit Union).\n\n\n\n\n                      December 18, 2000\n\f           Per   Curiam.    Plaintiff    appeals    from    an   order\n\ngranting   defendants'     unopposed    motions    to    dismiss   the\n\ncomplaint or for summary judgment, and the denial of his\n\nbelated motion to reconsider the dismissal.             Reviewing the\n\ndismissal of the complaint de novo in light of the record\n\nand the briefs on appeal, we see no error.               Plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint failed to state any cognizable claim for relief\n\nand he offered no reason to believe that an amendment might\n\ncure the defects in the complaint.         There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the denial of his motion to reconsider the\n\ndismissal.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\f",
