Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\nBoudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nCoffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Dowd, Senior District Judge.\r\n\n   Alan J. Rich with whom Farber &amp; Rich LLP, Sarah S. Geer, Marc P. Charmatz, National Association of the Deaf Law Center, Paul F. Kelly and Segal, Roitman &amp; Coleman were on brief for appellant.\r\n   Thomas C. Federico with whom Lee Stephen MacPhee, Edward W. Murphy and Morrison, Mahoney &amp; Miller were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 25, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  David Schultz brought suit in the\r\ndistrict court against the Young Men's Christian Association of the\r\nUnited States of America (\"the national YMCA\") charging that it had\r\ndiscriminated against him because of his hearing disability.  The\r\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of the national\r\nYMCA and Schultz now appeals.  We affirm.\r\nThe background events are largely undisputed.  Schultz is\r\ndeaf unless he makes use of a hearing aid.  He is also an\r\naccomplished swimmer and swimming instructor with many years'\r\nexperience as a lifeguard; he obtained lifeguard certification from\r\nthe American Red Cross in 1979.  In 1993, Schultz was hired as the\r\naquatics director for the Hockomock YMCA in North Attleboro,\r\nMassachusetts, an organization that is independent of the national\r\nYMCA.\r\nIn 1994, Schultz decided to seek lifeguard certification\r\nfrom the national YMCA.  Such certification was neither required\r\nnor suggested by the Hockomock YMCA.  Schultz took the necessary\r\ncourse from one of his own subordinates, Carol Wilson, who happened\r\nto have lifeguard certification from the national YMCA.  When\r\nSchultz completed the course, Wilson concluded that he met all of\r\nthe national YMCA criteria for certification except for a hearing\r\nrequirement.\r\nAmong other criteria, the national YMCA requires for its\r\ncertification that a lifeguard be able to hear noises and distress\r\nsignals.  Wilson asked Schultz for an audiologist's report, and\r\nSchultz furnished one saying that he would have no difficulty\r\nhearing sounds of normal intensity with his hearing aid in place. \r\nAssuming that Schultz would wear his hearing aid while\r\nlifeguarding, Wilson recommended that the national YMCA certify\r\nhim, and it did so in early 1995.\r\nSoon thereafter, Wilson noticed that Schultz did not\r\nalways wear his hearing aid while lifeguarding and observed that\r\nSchultz was unable to hear noises without the hearing aid.  Wilson\r\nwas further concerned, she said, because she saw Schultz doing pool\r\nmaintenance tasks while lifeguarding and turning his back on\r\nswimmers in the pool, including children.  In mid-1995, Wilson\r\nasked the national YMCA to remove her name from Schultz's\r\ncertification record because of the hearing requirement; the\r\norganization did so in July 1995, thereby revoking Schultz's\r\ncertification.\r\nSeveral weeks before this revocation, Schultz resigned as\r\naquatics director and accepted a lower-paid position at the\r\nHockomock YMCA.  This change was due to evaluations of Schultz's\r\njob performance and was unrelated to his loss of national YMCA\r\ncertification.  Schultz later resigned from his new job but, so far\r\nas appears, Schultz continued to hold Red Cross lifeguard\r\ncertification.\r\nIn December 1995, Schultz sued both the national YMCA and\r\nthe Hockomock YMCA, setting forth a number of federal and state\r\nclaims and seeking $20 million in damages as well as injunctive\r\nrelief.  However, Schultz confines his appeal solely to his claim\r\nfor damages for emotional distress against the national YMCA under\r\nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.  794.  Its\r\ncentral provision reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n   No otherwise qualified individual with a\r\ndisability . . . shall, solely by reason of\r\nher or his disability, be excluded from the\r\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of,\r\nor be subjected to discrimination under any\r\nprogram or activity receiving Federal\r\nfinancial assistance . . . .\r\nAfter extensive discovery, the national YMCA moved for\r\nsummary judgment, primarily arguing that the ability to hear\r\ndistress signals was a reasonable requirement for lifeguard\r\ncertification.  Schultz countered with evidence purporting to show\r\nthat a deaf lifeguard was capable of performing lifeguard duties. \r\nAt a pretrial conference, the court granted summary judgment in\r\nfavor of the national YMCA, but not upon the main ground urged in\r\nthe defendant's summary judgment motion.\r\nInstead, the district court assumed--correctly, so far as\r\nwe know--that the national YMCA did not cause Schultz to lose his\r\njob or otherwise cause him economic damages.  Then, focusing upon\r\nthe claim of emotional distress, the court said that it knew of no\r\n\"precedent that supports the kind of emotional damages that is\r\nbeing asserted in relation to the cause of action in this setting.\" \r\nAlternatively, the court expressed doubt as to whether Schultz's\r\nown testimony as to emotional distress was an adequate basis for\r\nhis damage claim.\r\nSchultz has now appealed to this court, focusing upon the\r\nRehabilitation Act and his claim for damages for emotional\r\ndistress.  By contrast, the national YMCA, while defending the\r\ndistrict court's grounds of decision, also urges--as it is entitled\r\nto do, Doe v. Anrig, 728 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1984)--that the\r\njudgment is supported by Schultz's lack of qualification.  Our\r\nreview on the grant of the summary judgment is de novo.  Preferred\r\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Travellers Cos., 127 F.3d 136, 137 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act broadly prohibits\r\ndiscrimination on grounds of disability under \"any program or\r\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"  The national\r\nYMCA concedes that its lifeguard certification program falls within\r\nthis quoted language.  Deafness makes Schultz an \"individual with\r\na disability\" under the statute.  45 C.F.R.  84.3(j).  And the\r\ndefendant has chosen not to contest the proposition that Schultz's\r\ncertification was revoked \"solely by reason of . . . his\r\ndisability.\"  \r\nNevertheless, the \"otherwise qualified\" language of\r\nsection 504 has been read, ungrammatically but persuasively, to\r\nmean that Schultz could not show a violation of the section if\r\nhearing was an essential function of lifeguarding and thus an\r\nappropriate requirement for lifeguard certification.  School Bd. of\r\nNassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.7 (1987).  Doubtless\r\nit is widely supposed that the ability to hear a distress call is\r\na qualification for lifeguarding:  one has in mind the dramatic\r\npicture of the child in a lake waving her arms and calling \"help.\" \r\nWhether the supposition is correct is a different question.  \r\nThe disability statutes were meant to counter mistaken\r\nassumptions, no matter how dramatic or widespread.  Arline, 480\r\nU.S. at 279.  And Schultz offered in opposition to summary judgment\r\nthe detailed reports of two arguably expert witnesses to support\r\nhis position that the ability to hear contributes little, if\r\nanything, to the performance of lifeguarding functions.  It was\r\nprobably this evidence, more potent than one might expect, that\r\nsteered the district court to a different ground of decision.\r\nOne expert report was from Anita Marchitelli, who managed\r\nthe aquatics program and the training of lifeguards at Gallaudet\r\nUniversity.  She had certified well over 400 deaf lifeguards for\r\nthe Red Cross, which has no hearing requirement, and gave several\r\npages of detailed explanations as to why deafness was not a\r\nhandicap for a lifeguard.  \"In all of my 22 years in working with\r\ndeaf individuals,\" she added, \"I have never even heard [from\r\nextensive sources] of any incident or accident causing injury\r\ninvolving a deaf lifeguard.\"\r\nThe second opinion, provided by Frank Pia, a consultant\r\non drowning accident causation, asserted that drowning victims are\r\nalmost never in a position to call for help.  Pia concluded:  \"I\r\nknow of no scientific research, any documentation, anecdotal\r\ninformation or expert documentation that tends to show lifeguards\r\nwho are deaf or who have a hearing loss are any higher risk than\r\nhearing people as pool lifeguards.\"  Although somewhat more guarded\r\nthan Marchitelli--Pia gave some attention to possible \"reasonable\r\naccommodations\" for the deaf lifeguard--Pia's report generally\r\nsupported Schultz's position.\r\nThis evidence is only one side's version of the matter,\r\nand its experts have not been cross-examined.  But in the face of\r\nthese reports we are not certain that the safety issue could be\r\nresolved on summary judgment, at least on this record.  Schultz\r\nalso claimed that the national YMCA had made no serious effort to\r\ntest or verify whether its \"common sense\" assumption was true. \r\nWere this a conventional employment discrimination case, in which\r\nSchultz had been denied a lifeguard job because of deafness, he\r\nmight have enough to reach a jury. \r\nOf course, in granting certifications the national YMCA\r\nis not hiring employees, nor does it appear that its certification\r\nis either a legal or a practical condition for obtaining work as a\r\nlifeguard.  The national YMCA has simply announced criteria that it\r\nthinks appropriate for a lifeguard and offered certification to\r\nthose who meet its qualifications.  One might even think that there\r\nare free-speech interests at stake or that, at the very least,\r\nthere should be greater latitude for a certifying organization to\r\nmake judgments about its endorsement than where employment is being\r\noffered, withheld, or substantially affected.\r\nOn the other hand, by choosing to seek federal funds for\r\nits program, the national YMCA has subjected itself to section\r\n504's rather broadly framed obligation not to discriminate against\r\nthe disabled.  Whether its requirements in granting certification\r\nmust be fully correct, and not merely colorable, is a difficult\r\nquestion.  It has not been briefed here or decided elsewhere.  We\r\nwill thus assume arguendo that at trial its ability-to-hear\r\ncriterion might be shown to constitute impermissible\r\ndiscrimination, whatever that showing might entail.\r\nThis brings us to the district court's actual grounds of\r\ndecision.  We start with the question whether there was evidence of\r\nemotional damage or, to put the matter technically, whether Schultz\r\nhad proffered evidence in a form adequate under the federal and\r\nlocal rules to present an issue for a jury to consider.  To support\r\nhis claim, Schultz points to his own deposition testimony of\r\nemotional distress and to a therapist's report indicating that he\r\nsuffered depression and anxiety in connection with his loss of\r\ncertification.  \r\nSchultz's own deposition testimony was obviously\r\ncompetent under the formal requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). \r\nThe more dramatic and detailed version of harm provided by the\r\ntherapist's letter was not properly before the court because the\r\nreport was not in affidavit form under Rule 56(e) and was not\r\nappended to Schultz's opposition to the motion for summary judgment\r\nas required by local rules. D. Mass. R. 56.1.  Yet, without the\r\nreport from the therapist, Schultz's own testimony would likely be\r\nevidence enough of emotional damage to avoid summary judgment, even\r\nif a jury might find it self-serving or not worth a significant\r\naward.\r\nIn addition, the summary judgment motion did not, in our\r\nview, give fair warning that the national YMCA was seeking summary\r\njudgment for lack of proof of damage.  See Hayes v. Douglas\r\nDynamics, Inc., 8 F.3d 88, 90 (1st Cir. 1993).  While the district\r\njudge was entitled to raise the issue himself at oral argument, it\r\nwould be harsh to insist that the plaintiff then and there go\r\nbeyond an informal proffer--here, supported by the therapist's\r\nletter--when Schultz had no prior notice that a formal opposition\r\nto summary judgment was required on the issue.\r\nThe district court's main ground of decision was that\r\ndamages solely for emotional injury would be inappropriate in this\r\ncase.  The problem is complicated because the Rehabilitation Act\r\ndoes not itself contain any express remedy for section 504\r\nviolations.  It does incorporate the remedies provided under Title\r\nVI of the Civil Rights Act--but Title VI's only express remedy is\r\na cutoff of federal funding to the affected program.  29 U.S.C. \r\n794a(a)(2); 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1.  Nevertheless, by judicial\r\nconstruction a private cause of action for injunctive relief and\r\ndamages now exists under section 504, qualified by the general\r\nassertion that the remedy must be \"appropriate.\"  See Franklin v.\r\nGwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992).\r\n  Whether damages can be awarded for emotional injury is,\r\nat least nominally, a closer question, because the Supreme Court\r\nhas not spoken directly on this point, and the case law reflects a\r\nsplit of authority.  Burgdorf, Disability Discrimination in\r\nEmployment Law 554-55 (1995) (collecting cases).  Nevertheless,\r\nFranklin was written with considerable breadth, and as a matter of\r\nprediction, it may be a fair guess--we need not rule--that the\r\nSupreme Court might well allow damages for emotional distress under\r\nsection 504 in some circumstances.  Whether this case is\r\n\"appropriate\" for such an award is a much closer question.\r\n  Along with its pleasures, life involves many unintended\r\nslights and embarrassments.  We have no reason to doubt that\r\nSchultz felt deeply hurt by what he took to be a reflection on his\r\nability to perform his vocation.  But traditionally the courts have\r\nrarely permitted recovery solely for unintended emotional distress\r\nwithout any attendant physical or economic damage; on the contrary,\r\nsuch recovery has usually been limited to cases of egregious\r\nbehavior presenting a high likelihood of substantial mental injury. \r\nSee Restatement (Second), Torts  436A and comment b (1965); W.\r\nKeeton, Prosser and Keeton on Torts  54, at 361-62 (5th Cir.\r\n1984).\r\n  This limitation is only one of a number of court-crafted\r\ndoctrines, seeking to assure that damage remedies do not get\r\ncompletely out of hand.  Other examples include concepts of\r\nproximate cause in tort law, Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 162\r\nN.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928); standing limitations, Illinois Brick Co. v.\r\nIllinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746 (1977); and restrictions under maritime\r\nlaw on economic damages, Barber Lines A/S v. M/V Donau Maru, 764\r\nF.2d 50, 51-52 (1st Cir. 1985).  Here, the Supreme Court's\r\nreference in Franklin to \"appropriate\" remedies makes us all the\r\nmore cautious in exceeding the bounds of past practice.\r\n  In this case, Schultz has made no claim that he has\r\nsuffered any direct economic loss, either from the national YMCA's\r\nstandards or from withdrawal of his certification.  Nor has he\r\nsuggested that certification is either in legal or practical terms\r\na condition of obtaining lifeguard employment.  Compare Allied Tube\r\n&amp; Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492 (1988).  He says\r\nonly that he is entitled to several million dollars for emotional\r\ndistress because under the national YMCA's standards, he is not\r\nentitled to certification.\r\n  Schultz's position is very little different from that of\r\nany deaf lifeguard who could claim at large to be offended or\r\ndistressed by what may be an over-rigid criterion adopted by one\r\ncertifying organization (the national YMCA) but not by others\r\n(e.g., the Red Cross).  It happens that Schultz did obtain\r\ncertification and later had it withdrawn.  But certification was\r\nobtained, and then lost, based upon Schultz's indirect\r\nrepresentation that he would wear a hearing aid.  Otherwise,\r\nSchultz remains someone who simply does not meet the national YMCA\r\ncriteria.\r\n  There is not the slightest hint that the national YMCA\r\nwas prompted by malice or hostility toward him or toward the\r\ndisabled.  On the contrary, whether or not it erred in its\r\njudgment, its concerns--for the safety of swimmers and the\r\nreliability of its endorsement--were legitimate.  This is not a\r\ncase where damages for emotional distress can be justified to\r\npunish patent misbehavior or the deliberate infliction of\r\nhumiliation.\r\nWe do not hold that damages for emotional injury are\r\nprecluded in all cases under section 504.  The situation might be\r\ndifferent if there were some sign of actual animus toward the\r\ndisabled; to call the defendant's action \"intentional,\" as Schultz\r\ndoes, is hardly the same thing.  A claim for injunctive relief to\r\nsecure certification might also have been available if Schultz had\r\nchosen to pursue it, instead of narrowing his action into a test\r\ncase for damages.\r\nThe Rehabilitation Act, like similar federal and state\r\ndisability statutes, deserves sympathetic enforcement by the\r\ncourts.  But, as in all things, a balance must be struck.  The\r\nnational YMCA's standards are not automatically immune simply\r\nbecause they were adopted in good faith or based on widespread\r\nassumptions.  But an award of damages for emotional distress, in a\r\ndebatable case on the merits with no animus or other concrete\r\nimpact, strikes us as a distortion of remedial relief.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

And Schultz offered in opposition to summary judgment\r\nthe detailed reports of two arguably expert witnesses to support\r\nhis position that the ability to hear contributes little, if\r\nanything, to the performance of lifeguarding functions.  It was\r\nprobably this evidence, more potent than one might expect, that\r\nsteered the district court to a different ground of decision.\r\nOne expert report was from Anita Marchitelli, who managed\r\nthe aquatics program and the training of lifeguards at Gallaudet\r\nUniversity.  She had certified well over 400 deaf lifeguards for\r\nthe Red Cross, which has no hearing requirement, and gave several\r\npages of detailed explanations as to why deafness was not a\r\nhandicap for a lifeguard.  \"In all of my 22 years in working with\r\ndeaf individuals,\" she added, \"I have never even heard [from\r\nextensive sources] of any incident or accident causing injury\r\ninvolving a deaf lifeguard.\"\r\nThe second opinion, provided by Frank Pia, a consultant\r\non drowning accident causation, asserted that drowning victims are\r\nalmost never in a position to call for help.  Pia concluded:  \"I\r\nknow of no scientific research, any documentation, anecdotal\r\ninformation or expert documentation that tends to show lifeguards\r\nwho are deaf or who have a hearing loss are any higher risk than\r\nhearing people as pool lifeguards.\"  Although somewhat more guarded\r\nthan Marchitelli--Pia gave some attention to possible \"reasonable\r\naccommodations\" for the deaf lifeguard--Pia's report generally\r\nsupported Schultz's position.\r\nThis evidence is only one side's version of the matter,\r\nand its experts have not been cross-examined.  But in the face of\r\nthese reports we are not certain that the safety issue could be\r\nresolved on summary judgment, at least on this record.  Schultz\r\nalso claimed that the national YMCA had made no serious effort to\r\ntest or verify whether its \"common sense\" assumption was true. \r\nWere this a conventional employment discrimination case, in which\r\nSchultz had been denied a lifeguard job because of deafness, he\r\nmight have enough to reach a jury. \r\nOf course, in granting certifications the national YMCA\r\nis not hiring employees, nor does it appear that its certification\r\nis either a legal or a practical condition for obtaining work as a\r\nlifeguard.  The national YMCA has simply announced criteria that it\r\nthinks appropriate for a lifeguard and offered certification to\r\nthose who meet its qualifications.  One might even think that there\r\nare free-speech interests at stake or that, at the very least,\r\nthere should be greater latitude for a certifying organization to\r\nmake judgments about its endorsement than where employment is being\r\noffered, withheld, or substantially affected.\r\nOn the other hand, by choosing to seek federal funds for\r\nits program, the national YMCA has subjected itself to section\r\n504's rather broadly framed obligation not to discriminate against\r\nthe disabled.  Whether its requirements in granting certification\r\nmust be fully correct, and not merely colorable, is a difficult\r\nquestion.  It has not been briefed here or decided elsewhere.  We\r\nwill thus assume arguendo that at trial its ability-to-hear\r\ncriterion might be shown to constitute impermissible\r\ndiscrimination, whatever that showing might entail.\r\nThis brings us to the district court's actual grounds of\r\ndecision.  We start with the question whether there was evidence of\r\nemotional damage or, to put the matter technically, whether Schultz\r\nhad proffered evidence in a form adequate under the federal and\r\nlocal rules to present an issue for a jury to consider.  To support\r\nhis claim, Schultz points to his own deposition testimony of\r\nemotional distress and to a therapist's report indicating that he\r\nsuffered depression and anxiety in connection with his loss of\r\ncertification.  \r\nSchultz's own deposition testimony was obviously\r\ncompetent under the formal requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). \r\nThe more dramatic and detailed version of harm provided by the\r\ntherapist's letter was not properly before the court because the\r\nreport was not in affidavit form under Rule 56(e) and was not\r\nappended to Schultz's opposition to the motion for summary judgment\r\nas required by local rules. D. Mass. R. 56.1.  Yet, without the\r\nreport from the therapist, Schultz's own testimony would likely be\r\nevidence enough of emotional damage to avoid summary judgment, even\r\nif a jury might find it self-serving or not worth a significant\r\naward.\r\nIn addition, the summary judgment motion did not, in our\r\nview, give fair warning that the national YMCA was seeking summary\r\njudgment for lack of proof of damage.  See Hayes v. Douglas\r\nDynamics, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656105\"><a href=\"/opinion/656105/prodliabrep-cch-p-13686-mary-hayes-administrator-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (1st Cir. 1993).  While the district\r\njudge was entitled to raise the issue himself at oral argument, it\r\nwould be harsh to insist that the plaintiff then and there go\r\nbeyond an informal proffer--here, supported by the therapist's\r\nletter--when Schultz had no prior notice that a formal opposition\r\nto summary judgment was required on the issue.\r\nThe district court's main ground of decision was that\r\ndamages solely for emotional injury would be inappropriate in this\r\ncase.  The problem is complicated because the Rehabilitation Act\r\ndoes not itself contain any express remedy for section 504\r\nviolations.  It does incorporate the remedies provided under Title\r\nVI of the Civil Rights Act--but Title VI's only express remedy is\r\na cutoff of federal funding to the affected program.  29 U.S.C. \r\n794a(a)(2); 42 U.S.C.  2000d-1.  Nevertheless, by judicial\r\nconstruction a private cause of action for injunctive relief and\r\ndamages now exists under section 504, qualified by the general\r\nassertion that the remedy must be \"appropriate.\"  See Franklin v.\r\nGwinnett County Public Schools, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112696\"><a href=\"/opinion/112696/franklin-v-gwinnett-county-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992).\r\n  Whether damages can be awarded for emotional injury is,\r\nat least nominally, a closer question, because the Supreme Court\r\nhas not spoken directly on this point, and the case law reflects a\r\nsplit of authority.  Burgdorf, Disability Discrimination in\r\nEmployment Law 554-55 (1995) (collecting cases).  Nevertheless,\r\nFranklin was written with considerable breadth, and as a matter of\r\nprediction, it may be a fair guess--we need not rule--that the\r\nSupreme Court might well allow damages for emotional distress under\r\nsection 504 in some circumstances.  Whether this case is\r\n\"appropriate\" for such an award is a much closer question.\r\n  Along with its pleasures, life involves many unintended\r\nslights and embarrassments.  We have no reason to doubt that\r\nSchultz felt deeply hurt by what he took to be a reflection on his\r\nability to perform his vocation.  But traditionally the courts have\r\nrarely permitted recovery solely for unintended emotional distress\r\nwithout any attendant physical or economic damage; on the contrary,\r\nsuch recovery has usually been limited to cases of egregious\r\nbehavior presenting a high likelihood of substantial mental injury. \r\nSee Restatement (Second), Torts  436A and comment b (1965); W.\r\nKeeton, Prosser and Keeton on Torts  54, at 361-62 (5th Cir.\r\n1984).\r\n  This limitation is only one of a number of court-crafted\r\ndoctrines, seeking to assure that damage remedies do not get\r\ncompletely out of hand.  Other examples include concepts of\r\nproximate cause in tort law, Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.Y. 1928); standing limitations, Illinois Brick Co. v.\r\nIllinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109680\"><a href=\"/opinion/109680/illinois-brick-co-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746 (1977); and restrictions under maritime\r\nlaw on economic damages, Barber Lines A/S v. M/V Donau Maru, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453334\"><a href=\"/opinion/453334/barber-lines-as-v-mv-donau-maru/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51-52 (1st Cir. 1985).  Here, the Supreme Court's\r\nreference in Franklin to \"appropriate\" remedies makes us all the\r\nmore cautious in exceeding the bounds of past practice.\r\n  In this case, Schultz has made no claim that he has\r\nsuffered any direct economic loss, either from the national YMCA's\r\nstandards or from withdrawal of his certification.  Nor has he\r\nsuggested that certification is either in legal or practical terms\r\na condition of obtaining lifeguard employment.  Compare Allied Tube\r\n&amp; Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112091\"><a href=\"/opinion/112091/allied-tube-conduit-corp-v-indian-head-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).  He says\r\nonly that he is entitled to several million dollars for emotional\r\ndistress because under the national YMCA's standards, he is not\r\nentitled to certification.\r\n  Schultz's position is very little different from that of\r\nany deaf lifeguard who could claim at large to be offended or\r\ndistressed by what may be an over-rigid criterion adopted by one\r\ncertifying organization (the national YMCA) but not by others\r\n(e.g., the Red Cross).  It happens that Schultz did obtain\r\ncertification and later had it withdrawn.  But certification was\r\nobtained, and then lost, based upon Schultz's indirect\r\nrepresentation that he would wear a hearing aid.  Otherwise,\r\nSchultz remains someone who simply does not meet the national YMCA\r\ncriteria.\r\n  There is not the slightest hint that the national YMCA\r\nwas prompted by malice or hostility toward him or toward the\r\ndisabled.  On the contrary, whether or not it erred in its\r\njudgment, its concerns--for the safety of swimmers and the\r\nreliability of its endorsement--were legitimate.  This is not a\r\ncase where damages for emotional distress can be justified to\r\npunish patent misbehavior or the deliberate infliction of\r\nhumiliation.\r\nWe do not hold that damages for emotional injury are\r\nprecluded in all cases under section 504.  The situation might be\r\ndifferent if there were some sign of actual animus toward the\r\ndisabled; to call the defendant's action \"intentional,\" as Schultz\r\ndoes, is hardly the same thing.  A claim for injunctive relief to\r\nsecure certification might also have been available if Schultz had\r\nchosen to pursue it, instead of narrowing his action into a test\r\ncase for damages.\r\nThe Rehabilitation Act, like similar federal and state\r\ndisability statutes, deserves sympathetic enforcement by the\r\ncourts.  But, as in all things, a balance must be struck.  The\r\nnational YMCA's standards are not automatically immune simply\r\nbecause they were adopted in good faith or based on widespread\r\nassumptions.  But an award of damages for emotional distress, in a\r\ndebatable case on the merits with no animus or other concrete\r\nimpact, strikes us as a distortion of remedial relief.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
