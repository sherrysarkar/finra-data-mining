Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Richard LaBombard on brief pro se.\n     Paula M. Junghans, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Ann\nB. Durney and Regina S. Moriarty, Attorneys, Tax Division,\nDepartment of Justice, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       December 7, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam.      Appellant, Richard LaBombard, appeals\n\na decision of the district court denying his motion to\n\ndismiss and granting summary judgment in favor of the United\n\nStates and the court's subsequent entry of a judgment in\n\nfavor of the United States in the amount of $138,857.75 plus\n\nstatutory interest and penalties accrued since October 19,\n\n1998.   LaBombard complains that the district court unfairly\n\nconsidered what LaBombard alleges was an untimely filing\n\nsubmitted by the government and failed to consider what\n\nLaBombard alleges was his own timely response.\n\n           Although        it     appears      that   the      government's\n\nsupplemental memorandum was tardy, see district court's\n\norder of February 15, 2000, setting a deadline of 21 days,\n\nit   was   within    the        court's     discretion    to    excuse   the\n\ntardiness,    if    any.         As   for   LaBombard's     own   response,\n\ncontrary to his assertion, it appears that that response was\n\nalso tardy.        The mailing rule to which LaBombard refers\n\n(adding 3 days to the prescribed period) applies when a\n\nparty is required to respond after service of a paper by the\n\nopposing party.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e).                The district\n\ncourt's February 15 order recited that LaBombard had 14 days\n\nto respond after the government's filing of its supplemental\n\nmemorandum.    See also Dist. Ct. Loc. R. 7.1(B) (reciting\n\fthat a party opposing a motion shall file an opposition\n\nwithin 14 days and \"[t]he fourteen day period is intended to\n\ninclude the period specified by the civil rules for mailing\n\ntime\").     Because LaBombard's response was entered on the\n\ndocket on the same day as the date of the court's memorandum\n\nand order, however, it appears that LaBombard's response\n\nsimply was not brought to the district court's attention.\n\nHaving excused the lateness of the government's filing, we\n\nassume that the court would have similarly excused any\n\ntardiness on LaBombard's part, if that filing had been\n\nbrought to its attention.\n\n            In any event, we review both the denial of a motion\n\nto dismiss and the grant of summary judgment de novo.      See\n\nSouza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 424 (1st Cir. 1995) (motion to\n\ndismiss); Nichols v. Land Transport Corp., 223 F.3d 21, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (summary judgment).      We have reviewed the\n\nparties' briefs and the record on appeal.      The allegations\n\nin the government's complaint sufficed to state a claim for\n\nwhich relief can be granted and there existed no genuine\n\nissue of material fact precluding entry of summary judgment\n\nin its favor.    We affirm essentially for the reasons stated\n\nin the district court's memorandum and order, dated March\n\n31, 2000.\n\n\n                              -3-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -4-\n\f",
