Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n     Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nAndrew D. Dunn with whom Daniel E. Will was on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nWilliam L. Chapman with whom Pamela E. Phelan was on brief for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nApril 12, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. Appellant Max Hugel\r\ncontends that he was defamed by allegations in a complaint filed in\r\na federal securities fraud lawsuit (the \"Presstek litigation\") to\r\nwhich he was not a party.  He brought suit in state court seeking\r\ndamages for defamation and legal malpractice.  The defendants, four\r\nlaw firms, removed the case to federal court and then moved to\r\ndismiss.  Concluding that neither of Hugel's claims was viable, the\r\ndistrict court granted the motion.  The court wrote a thoughtful\r\nopinion recognizing that certain aspects of the defamation claim\r\nwere close, but explaining that the privilege given by New\r\nHampshire law to statements made in judicial proceedings protected\r\nthe challenged allegations.  We agree with the court's reasoning on\r\nthat issue, and see no need to reiterate its analysis.  We add only\r\na few brief comments.  We also hold that, because the privilege\r\nbars any civil damages based on protected statements, the district\r\ncourt properly dismissed the malpractice claim as well.\r\nA. Defamation Claim\r\nAs the district court recognized, New Hampshire law\r\nprovides \"very broad protection\" to statements made in the course\r\nof judicial proceedings.  See Order at 9.  A statement falls\r\noutside the privilege only if it is \"'so palpably irrelevant to the\r\nsubject matter of the controversy that no reasonable man can doubt\r\nits irrelevancy or impropriety,'\" McGranahan v. Dahar, 408 A.2d\r\n121, 126 (N.H. 1979) (citation omitted), and all doubts are to be\r\nresolved in favor of pertinency and application of the privilege,\r\nid. at 127.  It is the breadth of this protection that persuaded\r\nthe district court that the privilege applied to all of the\r\nchallenged statements, though some of them \"approach the protective\r\nlimit of the privilege.\" Order at 8.\r\nWe agree with the district court that certain of the \r\nobjectionable statements   in particular, those alleging organized\r\ncrime links   were connected only obliquely to the underlying fraud\r\ncharges.  These allegations, however, were contained in a\r\nbackground description of the intimate association between Hugel\r\nand a key Presstek litigation defendant, Robert Howard.  The two\r\nmen served together as president and vice president of Howard's\r\ncompany, Centronics, and they allegedly engaged in reciprocal stock\r\nmanipulations for each other's benefit on five occasions.  The\r\nadditional allegation that Hugel was involved in organized crime\r\nreasonably may be viewed as more than an attempt to establish\r\n\"guilt by association.\"  In light of Hugel's close relationship\r\nwith Howard, the allegation that Hugel had serious criminal ties,\r\ncombined with the assertions that Centronics had dealings with Las\r\nVegas casinos that were linked to organized crime or \"frequently\r\nsubject to federal organized crime investigations,\" reinforces an\r\ninference that Howard was involved in ongoing, illegal activities. \r\nSuch an inference is relevant to whether Howard knowingly\r\nparticipated in the securities fraud charged in the Presstek \r\nlawsuit.  Though characterizing Hugel as an organized crime figure\r\nmay have been at the margin of relevance, we cannot say that the\r\nstatements were so \"palpably irrelevant\" that, giving them the\r\nbenefit of any doubt, they fell outside the privilege.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that, in rejecting appellant's\r\ndefamation claim, we do not condone quick resort to reputation-\r\nharming allegations at the far reaches of relevancy.  Here, the\r\ndefendants' decision to file an amended complaint deleting all\r\nreferences to Hugel raises some question as to their level of\r\ncertainty regarding the original statements.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11\r\n(b)(3) imposes a duty on attorneys to certify that, \"to the best of\r\n[their] knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry\r\nreasonable under the circumstances,\" the allegations and other\r\nfactual contentions in a pleading have evidentiary support.  \r\nEnsuring the integrity of their representations is a serious\r\nresponsibility that attorneys may not take lightly, and we caution\r\nagainst the deliberate or careless use of unsubstantiated\r\nallegations, notwithstanding their relevance.\r\nB. Legal Malpractice Claim \r\nAlthough the absolute privilege for statements made in\r\njudicial proceedings was recognized in McGranahan in the context of\r\na defamation claim, the language of that opinion, subsequent case\r\nlaw, and policy considerations make it clear that the privilege\r\nbars any civil claim for damages based on statements protected by\r\nthe privilege.  In McGranahan, the court noted \"the general rule .\r\n. . that statements made in the course of judicial proceedings are\r\nabsolutely privileged from civil actions, provided they are\r\npertinent to the subject of the proceeding,\" 408 A.2d at 124\r\n(emphasis added).  The court reiterated this general statement of\r\nthe rule in another defamation case, Pickering v. Frink, 461 A.2d\r\n117, 119 (N.H. 1983), and recently confirmed it in a case raising\r\nclaims of, inter alia, negligence, fraud, and intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress, see Provencher v. Buzzell-Plourde\r\nAss., 711 A.2d 251, 255 (N.H. 1998) (citing McGranahan and\r\nPickering).  We thus think it clear that the Supreme Court of New\r\nHampshire views the privilege to extend to any civil claim arising\r\nfrom statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding.\r\nIn addition to the explicit language to that effect, the\r\npolicy underlying the privilege requires that civil claims other\r\nthan for defamation also be extinguished.  The rule's absolute bar\r\n\"reflects a determination that the potential harm to an individual\r\nis far outweighed by the need to encourage participants in\r\nlitigation, parties, attorneys, and witnesses, to speak freely in\r\nthe course of judicial proceedings.\"  McGranahan, 408 A.2d at 124. \r\nThis policy would be nullified if individuals barred from bringing\r\ndefamation claims could seek damages under other theories of\r\nliability.  Moreover, as the district court observed, Hugel's\r\nmalpractice claim is, in essence, a claim that he was defamed by\r\nallegations in the Presstek complaint.  In these circumstances,\r\nHugel's malpractice claim unquestionably is barred by the\r\nprivilege.  Compare Blanchette v. Cataldo, 734 F.2d 869, 877 (lst\r\nCir. 1984) (holding that similar privilege under Massachusetts law\r\nbars any civil action based on the statements); Correllas v.\r\nViveiros, 572 N.E.2d 7, 17-19 (Mass. 1991) (\"A privilege which\r\nprotected an individual from liability for defamation would be of\r\nlittle value if the individual were subject to liability under a\r\ndifferent theory of tort.\").\r\nC. Certification\r\nHugel moved to certify both the defamation and legal\r\nmalpractice issues to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, claiming\r\nthat each implicates an unresolved question of state law.  We\r\ndisagree that there is any uncertainty warranting certification. \r\nAs discussed in Section A on the defamation issue, the\r\nstandard for evaluating statements made during the course of\r\njudicial proceedings is clear: an absolute privilege attaches if\r\nthe statements are \"pertinent to the subject of the proceeding,\"\r\nsee McGranahan, 408 A.2d at 124.  Hugel's assertion that\r\ncertification is necessary because the New Hampshire Supreme Court\r\nhas not had occasion to provide further guidance on the standard\r\nmisses the mark.  As the district court recognized, \"[w]hen state\r\nlaw is sufficiently clear to allow [a federal court] to predict its\r\ncourse, certification is both inappropriate and an unwarranted\r\nburden on the state court.\"  Order at 11 n.2 (citing Armacost v.\r\nAmica Mut. Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 267, 269 (lst Cir. 1993)).  See alsoMarbucco Corp. v. Suffolk Construction Co., 165 F.3d 103, 105 (lst\r\nCir. 1999) (\"It is inappropriate . . . to use certification 'when\r\nthe course state courts would take is reasonably clear.'\") (quoting\r\nPorter v. Nutter, 913 F.2d 37, 41 n.4 (lst Cir. 1990)). The New\r\nHampshire court cannot be charged with failure to make its standard\r\nreasonably clear.  Although we may err in applying that standard,\r\nwe act within the range of discretion entrusted to us.\r\nThe malpractice issue as we have resolved it involves a\r\nsimilarly straightforward application of unambiguous state case\r\nlaw.  There is no need for certification.\r\nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is\r\naffirmed.\n",

In Nguyen v. Proton Technology Corp., 69 Cal.App.4th 140, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 392 (Cal.Ct.App.1999), a pre-litigation letter from a law firm concerning potential unfair competition claims reported that one of the employees allegedly engaged in the unfair acts had been in prison \"for repeatedly and violently assaulting his wife.\"   Hugel's alleged ongoing involvement in criminal activities against a backdrop of securities fraud perpetrated by Hugel and Howard is a far cry from such an extraneous statement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Hugel asserts that the district court applied an incorrect standard because it found only that the allegations concerning Hugel \"might be\" or \"could be\" pertinent to the claims in the underlying securities litigation, rather than determining unconditionally that they were relevant.  The findings conform to the McGranahan standard, which requires a court to determine whether a reasonable person \"can \" doubt their irrelevancy or impropriety.  The court's conclusion that the statements \"might be\" or \"could be\" pertinent is equivalent to a conclusion that a reasonable person \"can\" find them to be so.  The ruling also reflects the directive in McGranahan to resolve doubts in favor of applying the privilege.

A statement falls outside the privilege only if it is \" 'so palpably irrelevant to the subject matter of the controversy that no reasonable man can doubt its irrelevancy or impropriety,' \" McGranahan v. Dahar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2295379\"><a href=\"/opinion/2295379/mcgranahan-v-dahar/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span>, 126 (N.H.1979) (citation omitted),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and all doubts are to be resolved in favor of pertinency and application of the privilege, id. at 127.   It is the breadth of this protection that persuaded the district court that the privilege applied to all of the challenged statements, though some of them \"approach the protective limit of the privilege.\"   Order at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that certain of the objectionable statements--in particular, those alleging organized crime links--were connected only obliquely to the underlying fraud charges.  These allegations, however, were contained in a background description of the intimate association between Hugel and a key Presstek litigation defendant, Robert Howard.  The two men served together as president and vice president of Howard's company, Centronics, and they allegedly engaged in reciprocal stock manipulations for each other's benefit on five occasions.  The additional allegation that Hugel was involved in organized crime reasonably may be viewed as more than an attempt to establish \"guilt by association.\"   In light of Hugel's close relationship with Howard, the allegation that Hugel had serious criminal ties, combined with the assertions that Centronics had dealings with Las Vegas casinos that were linked to organized crime or \"frequently subject to federal organized crime investigations,\" reinforces an inference that Howard was involved in ongoing, illegal activities.  Such an inference is relevant to whether Howard knowingly participated in the securities fraud charged in the Presstek lawsuit.  Though characterizing Hugel as an organized crime figure may have been at the margin of relevance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we cannot say that the statements were so \"palpably irrelevant\" that, giving them the benefit of any doubt, they fell outside the privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We wish to emphasize that, in rejecting appellant's defamation claim, we do not condone quick resort to reputation-harming allegations at the far reaches of relevancy.  Here, the defendants' decision to file an amended complaint deleting all references to Hugel raises some question as to their level of certainty regarding the original statements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b)(3) imposes a duty on attorneys to certify that, \"to the best of [their] knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\" the allegations and other factual contentions in a pleading have evidentiary support.  Ensuring the integrity of their representations is a serious responsibility that attorneys may not take lightly, and we caution against the deliberate or careless use of unsubstantiated allegations, notwithstanding their relevance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal Malpractice Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the absolute privilege for statements made in judicial proceedings was recognized in McGranahan in the context of a defamation claim, the language of that opinion, subsequent case law, and policy considerations make it clear that the privilege bars any civil claim for damages based on statements protected by the privilege.  In McGranahan, the court noted \"the general rule ... that statements made in the course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged from civil actions, provided they are pertinent to the subject of the proceeding,\" 408 A.2d at 124 (emphasis added).  The court reiterated this general statement of the rule in another defamation case, Pickering v. Frink, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2404516\"><a href=\"/opinion/2404516/pickering-v-frink/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span>, 119 (N.H.1983),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and recently confirmed it in a case raising claims of, inter alia, negligence, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, see Provencher v. Buzzell-Plourde Associates, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></span>, 255 (N.H.1998) (citing McGranahan and Pickering ).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We thus think it clear that the Supreme Court of New Hampshire views the privilege to extend to any civil claim arising from statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the explicit language to that effect, the policy underlying the privilege requires that civil claims other than for defamation also be extinguished.  The rule's absolute bar \"reflects a determination that the potential harm to an individual is far outweighed by the need to encourage participants in litigation, parties, attorneys, and witnesses, to speak freely in the course of judicial proceedings.\"  McGranahan, 408 A.2d at 124.   This policy would be nullified if individuals barred from bringing defamation claims could seek damages under other theories of liability.  Moreover, as the district court observed, Hugel's malpractice claim is, in essence, a claim that he was defamed by allegations in the Presstek complaint.  In these circumstances, Hugel's malpractice claim unquestionably is barred by the privilege.  Compare Blanchette v. Cataldo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435920\"><a href=\"/opinion/435920/robert-w-blanchette-trustees-of-the-penn-central-transportation-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span>, 877 (lst Cir.1984) (holding that similar privilege under Massachusetts law bars any civil action based on the statements);  Correllas v. Viveiros, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068761\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068761/correllas-v-viveiros/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068761\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068761/correllas-v-viveiros/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 17-19 (Mass.1991) (\"A privilege which protected an individual from liability for defamation would be of little value if the individual were subject to liability under a different theory of tort.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Certification</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hugel moved to certify both the defamation and legal malpractice issues to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, claiming that each implicates an unresolved question of state law.  We disagree that there is any uncertainty warranting certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed in Section A on the defamation issue, the standard for evaluating statements made during the course of judicial proceedings is clear:  an absolute privilege attaches if the statements are \"pertinent to the subject of the proceeding,\" see McGranahan, 408 A.2d at 124.   Hugel's assertion that certification is necessary because the New Hampshire Supreme Court has not had occasion to provide further guidance on the standard misses the mark.  As the district court recognized, \"[w]hen state law is sufficiently clear to allow [a federal court] to predict its course, certification is both inappropriate and an unwarranted burden on the state court.\"   Order at 11 n. 2 (citing Armacost v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195082\"><a href=\"/opinion/195082/armacost-v-amica/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 269 (lst Cir.1993)).

The New Hampshire court cannot be charged with failure to make its standard reasonably clear.  Although we may err in applying that standard, we act within the range of discretion entrusted to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The malpractice issue as we have resolved it involves a similarly straightforward application of unambiguous state case law.  There is no need for certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The standard is expressly \"not conditioned on the actor's good faith,\" McGranahan, 408 A.2d at 124, because the public's interest in judicial proceedings \" 'is so vital and apparent that it mandates complete freedom of expression without inquiry into a defendant's motives,' \" id.  (quoting Supry v. Bolduc, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2341217\"><a href=\"/opinion/2341217/supry-v-bolduc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></span>, 769 (N.H.1972)).  The court noted that the pertinence standard would have the effect of excluding from protection \"statements made needlessly and wholly in bad faith,\" see id., but occasionally would protect malicious statements because they were pertinent to the proceeding, see id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In seeking to support his argument that the challenged statements were irrelevant to the Presstek litigation, Hugel cites a case that presents a useful contrast because--unlike the allegations here--the statements clearly fell into the \"palpably irrelevant\" category.  In Nguyen v. Proton Technology Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2297999\"><a href=\"/opinion/2297999/nguyen-v-proton-technology-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (Cal.Ct.App.1999), a pre-litigation letter from a law firm concerning potential unfair competition claims reported that one of the employees allegedly engaged in the unfair acts had been in prison \"for repeatedly and violently assaulting his wife.\"   Hugel's alleged ongoing involvement in criminal activities against a backdrop of securities fraud perpetrated by Hugel and Howard is a far cry from such an extraneous statement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Hugel asserts that the district court applied an incorrect standard because it found only that the allegations concerning Hugel \"might be\" or \"could be\" pertinent to the claims in the underlying securities litigation, rather than determining unconditionally that they were relevant.  The findings conform to the McGranahan standard, which requires a court to determine whether a reasonable person \"can \" doubt their irrelevancy or impropriety.  The court's conclusion that the statements \"might be\" or \"could be\" pertinent is equivalent to a conclusion that a reasonable person \"can\" find them to be so.  The ruling also reflects the directive in McGranahan to resolve doubts in favor of applying the privilege.

The decision to withdraw the allegations therefore may not have reflected lack of confidence in them but simply a judgment that their usefulness was offset by the greater risk and/or costs of litigation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Pickering court stated:  \"New Hampshire law recognizes that certain communications are absolutely privileged and therefore immune from civil suit.\"  461 A.2d at 119.   The opinion also repeated, almost verbatim, the statement of the rule specifically with respect to statements made in the course of judicial proceedings, as quoted above from McGranahan.
