For the\r\n\nreasons stated herein, we affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Irizarry-Sanabria  was indicted  in  March of  1993 and\r\n\npled not guilty  at his  arraignment.  His  motion to dismiss  on\r\n\ndouble jeopardy  grounds, premised  on a  previous conviction  of\r\n\nconspiracy to import  marijuana,1 was denied.   In October  1993,\r\n\nIrizarry-Sanabria entered a change of  plea to guilty pursuant to\r\n\na plea  agreement.  In  December 1993, he  filed a pro  se motion\r                                                                    \r\n\nseeking a  withdrawal of that plea; his counsel filed a motion in\r\n\nsupport of  the pro se motion  and memorandum of law  in February\r                                \r\n\n1994.   The district  court denied the  motion to  withdraw plea,\r\n\nwithout an  evidentiary hearing.  Irizarry-Sanabria was sentenced\r\n\nto 121 months imprisonment.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n                A.  Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\r                          A.  Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\r                                                            \r\n\n          We  review the  court's refusal  of Irizarry-Sanabria's\r\n\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea, made prior to sentencing, for\r\n\nabuse of discretion.   See United States v. Tilley,  964 F.2d 66,\r                                                            \r\n\n72 (1st Cir. 1992).  To prevail,  Irizarry-Sanabria must persuade\r\n\nthe  court that  he has shown  a \"fair  and just reason\"  for his\r\n\nrequest.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e).   We follow an establishedtest:\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  His conviction for the  first conspiracy was affirmed by  this\r\ncourt in United States v. And jar, 49 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                           \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n            A court must  consider several factors in\r\n            weighing whether  a defendant  meets this\r\n            burden,\r\n               the  most significant  of which  is\r\n               whether  the   plea  was   knowing,\r\n               voluntary  and  intelligent  within\r\n               the  meaning  of [Federal  Rule  of\r\n               Criminal Procedure] 11.   The other\r\n               factors include:  1) the force  and\r\n               plausibility   of   the   proffered\r\n               reason;  2)   the  timing   of  the\r\n               request; 3)  whether the  defendant\r\n               has asserted  his legal  innocence;\r\n               and  4)  whether  the  parties  had\r\n               reached a plea agreement. \r\n\nUnited States v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 834 (1st Cir. 1996)  (quoting\r                               \r\n\nUnited States v.  Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 3-4  (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied,    U.S.   , 116 S. Ct. 94 (1995) (citation omitted)).  If\r                \r\n\ndefendant meets the rigors of  this test, we evaluate whether the\r\n\ngovernment will suffer any demonstrable prejudice.  See id. \r                                                                     \r\n\n          First, we find,  and counsel for defendant  admitted at\r\n\noral argument,  that the Rule  11 plea colloquy was  thorough and\r\n\ncomprehensive.    Irizarry-Sanabria  argues  that  his  plea  was\r\n\nnonetheless not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because it was\r\n\nmade under duress, due to the pressure of his attorney.  However,\r\n\nduring  the colloquy, Irizarry-Sanabria  denied that he  had been\r\n\ncoerced  to accept  the  plea bargain,  acknowledged that  he had\r\n\ndiscussed its  terms  with  counsel, and  affirmed  that  he  was\r\n\nsatisfied with  his legal  representation.   \"Such statements  in\r\n\nopen court during  a plea hearing 'carry a  strong presumption of\r\n\nverity.'\"  United  States v.  Mart nez-Molina, 64  F.3d 719,  733\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995)  (quoting Blackledge v. Allison, 431  U.S. 63, 74\r                                                         \r\n\n(1977)).  The pro se motion offers nothing more than a conclusory\r                              \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nstatement  that the  plea  was  \"made under  duress,  due to  the\r\n\nurgency and  pressure of  all the  [co-defendants'] attorneys  of\r\n\nthis case,\"  including Irizarry-Sanabria's  counsel.   In denying\r\n\nthe motion, the  district court noted that  Irizarry-Sanabria was\r\n\ninformed at the change  of plea hearing that he could  proceed to\r\n\ntrial that  same  day if  he  chose, and  commented  that he  was\r\n\n\"alert, calm,  confident and  knowledgeable of  his rights,\"  and\r\n\n\"never showed  any hesitancy or  reservation about his  desire to\r\n\nplead guilty.\"   Order at  6.  In  these circumstances, where  we\r\n\nhave a thorough, comprehensive Rule  11 colloquy on one hand, and\r\n\na naked conclusory claim of duress unsupported by any allegations\r\n\nof fact on  the other, we find that Irizarry-Sanabria's eleventh-\r\n\nhour claim of  duress lacks merit, and accordingly  find that his\r\n\nplea was made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently within the\r\n\nmeaning of Rule 11.\r\n\n          Our  second factor weighs the force and plausibility of\r\n\nthe proffered reasons.  We have already weighed the duress claim;\r\n\nwe briefly  examine Irizarry-Sanabria's  other asserted  reasons.\r\n\nFirst, Irizarry-Sanabria claims he is innocent, and that he could\r\n\nprove it,  without specifying  anything regarding  the nature  of\r\n\nsuch proof.  At the same time,  during the change of plea hearing\r\n\nhe corrected the court's account  of the events of the conspiracy\r\n\nseveral times,  clarifying what his  participation had been.   In\r\n\nsuch circumstances, we find that the district court did not abuse\r\n\nits discretion  by \"refusing  to give weight  to a  self-serving,\r\n\nunsupported claim  of innocence.\"   United  States v.  Ramos, 810\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nF.2d 308, 313 (1st Cir.  1987) (finding that defendant's claim of\r\n\ninnocence  lacked merit  where  he did  not  assert innocence  at\r\n\nchange  of plea  hearing and  did not  substantiate his  claim of\r\n\nexculpatory  evidence); see  Isom,  85  F.2d  at  837  (rejecting\r                                           \r\n\ndefendant's  pro   se   motion  asserting   innocence  where   no\r                               \r\n\ninformation was provided regarding  alleged exculpatory evidence,\r\n\nand  defendant provided specific information regarding the events\r\n\nof the crime at Rule 11 hearing).  \r\n\n          Second, Irizarry-Sanabria's claim that  he did not have\r\n\naccess to the files on the case gives us little pause,  given the\r\n\nthoroughness of the  Rule 11 hearing and the  fact that Irizarry-\r\n\nSanabria does not offer any indication of what he expects to find\r\n\nin the files, or what prejudice  he has suffered.  Similarly, his\r\n\nclaim that his requests for  legal assistance \"in this matter\" --\r\n\npresumably, his motion  and claim of innocence and  duress -- had\r\n\nbeen to no avail is unconvincing, as his attorney followed up the\r\n\npro se motion with a motion in support and memorandum of law.  \r                \r\n\n          As for  the timing  of  the motion,  almost two  months\r\n\nelapsed between the  change of plea hearing on  October 21, 1993,\r\n\nand Irizarry-Sanabria's pro  se motion of December 15,  1993.  We\r                                         \r\n\nhave   previously  found  that   such  a  delay   weighs  against\r\n\ndefendant's position.2   See,  e.g., Isom, 85  F.3d at  839 (two-\r                                                   \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Appellant  argues that  this  measure ignores  the fact  that\r\nIrizarry-Sanabria's  change of heart undoubtedly occurred at some\r\ntime prior to the date of service.  Nonetheless, in such cases we\r\ntake as our measure the date of  the motion to withdraw the plea,\r\nregardless  of  when  the  defendant's  subjective  decision  was\r\nactually made.  See Isom, 85 F.3d at 838-39 (collecting cases).\r                                  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nmonth delay);  United States  v. Pellerito,  878 F.2d  1535, 1541\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (eight week  delay); United States v. Crosby, 714\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 185, 192  (1st Cir. 1983) (eight week  delay), cert. denied,\r                                                                          \r\n\n464 U.S. 1045 (1984).\r\n\n          As for  the final  two factors,  we  note, first,  that\r\n\nIrizarry-Sanabria has  claimed his innocence.   Nonetheless, \"the\r\n\nmere protestation of  legal innocence cannot in and  of itself be\r\n\nissue-determinative.\"  United  States v. Kobrosky, 711  F.2d 449,\r                                                           \r\n\n455  (1st  Cir.  1983).    Second, the  parties  reached  a  plea\r\n\nagreement, which neither alleges has been broken.\r\n\n          As our  analysis of all  the factors weighs  heavily in\r\n\nfavor  of  the district  court's  decision, we  need  not address\r\n\nwhether granting  the  motion would  result in  prejudice to  the\r\n\ngovernment before affirming the decision below.\r\n\n          Irizarry-Sanabria asserts that the district court erred\r\n\nin  denying him an  evidentiary hearing to  factually bolster his\r\n\nclaims.  However, we note that\r\n\n            evidentiary hearings  on motions  are the\r\n            exception,  not   the  rule.     We  have\r\n            repeatedly  stated  that,   even  in  the\r\n            criminal  context,  a  defendant  is  not\r\n            entitled as  of right  to an  evidentiary\r\n            hearing  on   a  pretrial   or  posttrial\r\n            motion.    Thus,   a  party  seeking   an\r\n            evidentiary hearing  must carry  a fairly\r\n            heavy burden of  demonstrating a need for\r\n            special treatment.\r\n\nUnited  States  v. McGill,  11  F.3d  223,  225 (1st  Cir.  1993)\r                                   \r\n\n(citations  omitted).     Irizarry-Sanabria's   naked  conclusory\r\n\nstatements offer us no basis  for finding that the district court\r\n\nabused  its discretion in  not holding an  evidentiary hearing on\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nhis  claims.   See, e.g., Ramos,  810 F.2d at  314; Kobrosky, 711\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 457; see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 838 (collecting cases).\r                                    \r\n\n          On  appeal, counsel  for  defendant  argues that  \"most\r\n\nindividuals\" are too intimidated by  the circumstances of a  Rule\r\n\n11 plea colloquy to stop and  tell the court that they have  been\r\n\ncoerced  into pleading  guilty.    Such  generalizations  do  not\r\n\npersuade  us that  the district  court  abused its  discretion in\r\n\nmaking its decision -- a  decision \"facilitated because the judge\r\n\nhas  overseen   pretrial  proceedings,  conducted  the   Rule  11\r\n\ninquiries, accepted the original guilty  plea, and heard at first\r\n\nhand the  reasons bearing upon  its withdrawal.\"   Pellerito, 878\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 1538.  Indeed, the fact  that during the Rule 11 colloquy\r\n\nIrizarry-Sanabria  corrected the court's account of the events on\r\n\nseveral points belies the image of a timid defendant.\r\n\n          We are given more pause by appellant's contention, made\r\n\nat  oral argument, that  a potential conflict  arises because the\r\n\ncounsel who Irizarry-Sanabria  alleges put him under  duress also\r\n\nhelped him litigate the motion for withdrawal of his guilty plea.\r\n\nHowever,  in this  circumstance,  where we  have  a complete  and\r\n\ndetailed plea colloquy, a detailed order denying the  motion, and\r\n\nonly  the  most sparse  allegations  on  the  part  of  Irizarry-\r\n\nSanabria, we  cannot  find that  the  district court  abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion,  even taking  into  account  the  pro  se  nature  of\r                                                               \r\n\nIrizarry-Sanabria's motion.\r\n\n                    B.

Double Jeopardy Claims\r                                                        \r\n\n          Irizarry-Sanabria next  argues that the  district court\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nerred in failing to dismiss the indictment against him because he\r\n\nhad previously  been found  guilty in a  case involving  the same\r\n\nconspiracy.  He alleges that  the indictment in this case amounts\r\n\nto  prosecuting a single conspiracy as two separate conspiracies,\r\n\nin violation of his double  jeopardy guarantee.  However, we find\r\n\nthat under Local Rule  510.2 of the  District of Puerto Rico,  he\r\n\nhas waived this  argument by failing to object  to the magistrate\r\n\njudge's report and recommendation in  writing within ten days, as\r\n\nthe  report and  recommendation warned.

For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria was indicted in March of 1993 and pled not guilty at his arraignment.  His motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, premised on a previous conviction of conspiracy to import marijuana,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was denied.  In October 1993, Irizarry-Sanabria entered a change of plea to guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.  In December 1993, he filed a pro se motion seeking a withdrawal of that plea;  his counsel filed a motion in support of the pro se motion and memorandum of law in February 1994.  The district court denied the motion to withdraw plea, without an evidentiary hearing.  Irizarry-Sanabria was sentenced to 121 months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's refusal of Irizarry-Sanabria's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, made prior to sentencing, for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Tilley, 964 F.2d 66, 72 (1st Cir.1992).  To prevail, Irizarry-Sanabria must persuade the court that he has shown a \"fair and just reason\" for his request.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e).  We follow an established test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>A court must consider several factors in weighing whether a defendant meets this burden, the most significant of which is whether the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent within the meaning of [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 11.  The other factors include:  1) the force and plausibility of the proffered reason;  2) the timing of the request;  3) whether the defendant has asserted his legal innocence;  and 4) whether the parties had reached a plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 834 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting  United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 94 (1995) (citation omitted)).  If defendant meets the rigors of this test, we evaluate whether the government will suffer any demonstrable prejudice.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we find, and counsel for defendant admitted at oral argument, that the Rule 11 plea colloquy was thorough and comprehensive.  Irizarry-Sanabria argues that his plea was nonetheless not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because it was made under duress, due to the pressure of his attorney.  However, during the colloquy, Irizarry-Sanabria denied that he had been coerced to accept the plea bargain, acknowledged that he had discussed its terms with counsel, and affirmed that he was satisfied with his legal representation.  \"Such statements in open court during a plea hearing 'carry a strong presumption of verity.' \"   United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 733 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting  Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 74 (1977)).  The pro se motion offers nothing more than a conclusory statement that the plea was \"made under duress, due to the urgency and pressure of all the [co-defendants'] attorneys of this case,\" including Irizarry-Sanabria's counsel.  In denying the motion, the district court noted that Irizarry-Sanabria was informed at the change of plea hearing that he could proceed to trial that same day if he chose, and commented that he was \"alert, calm, confident and knowledgeable of his rights,\" and \"never showed any hesitancy or reservation about his desire to plead guilty.\"   Order at 6. In these circumstances, where we have a thorough, comprehensive Rule 11 colloquy on one hand, and a naked conclusory claim of duress unsupported by any allegations of fact on the other, we find that Irizarry-Sanabria's eleventh-hour claim of duress lacks merit, and accordingly find that his plea was made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently within the meaning of Rule 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our second factor weighs the force and plausibility of the proffered reasons.  We have already weighed the duress claim;  we briefly examine Irizarry-Sanabria's other asserted reasons.  First, Irizarry-Sanabria claims he is innocent, and that he could prove it, without specifying anything regarding the nature of such proof.  At the same time, during the change of plea hearing he corrected the court's account of the events of the conspiracy several times, clarifying what his participation had been.  In such circumstances, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by \"refusing to give weight to a self-serving, unsupported claim of innocence.\"   United States v. Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 313 (1st Cir.1987) (finding that defendant's claim of innocence lacked merit where he did not assert innocence at change of plea hearing and did not substantiate his claim of exculpatory evidence);  see Isom, 85 F.2d at 837 (rejecting defendant's pro se motion asserting innocence where no information was provided regarding alleged exculpatory evidence, and defendant provided specific information regarding the events of the crime at Rule 11 hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Irizarry-Sanabria's claim that he did not have access to the files on the case gives us little pause, given the thoroughness of the Rule 11 hearing and the fact that Irizarry-Sanabria does not offer any indication of what he expects to find in the files, or what prejudice he has suffered.  Similarly, his claim that his requests for legal assistance \"in this matter\"--presumably, his motion and claim of innocence and duress--had been to no avail is unconvincing, as his attorney followed up the pro se motion with a motion in support and memorandum of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the timing of the motion, almost two months elapsed between the change of plea hearing on October 21, 1993, and Irizarry-Sanabria's pro se motion of December 15, 1993.  We have previously found that such a delay weighs against defendant's position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., Isom, 85 F.3d at 839 (two-month delay);   United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1541 (1st Cir.1989) (eight week delay);   United States v. Crosby, 714 F.2d 185, 192 (1st Cir.1983) (eight week delay), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1045 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the final two factors, we note, first, that Irizarry-Sanabria has claimed his innocence.  Nonetheless, \"the mere protestation of legal innocence cannot in and of itself be issue-determinative.\"   United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 455 (1st Cir.1983).  Second, the parties reached a plea agreement, which neither alleges has been broken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our analysis of all the factors weighs heavily in favor of the district court's decision, we need not address whether granting the motion would result in prejudice to the government before affirming the decision below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria asserts that the district court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing to factually bolster his claims.  However, we note that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>evidentiary hearings on motions are the exception, not the rule.  We have repeatedly stated that, even in the criminal context, a defendant is not entitled as of right to an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion.  Thus, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing must carry a fairly heavy burden of demonstrating a need for special treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).  Irizarry-Sanabria's naked conclusory statements offer us no basis for finding that the district court abused its discretion in not holding an evidentiary hearing on his claims.  See, e.g., Ramos, 810 F.2d at 314;   Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 457;  see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 838 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, counsel for defendant argues that \"most individuals\" are too intimidated by the circumstances of a Rule 11 plea colloquy to stop and tell the court that they have been coerced into pleading guilty.  Such generalizations do not persuade us that the district court abused its discretion in making its decision--a decision \"facilitated because the judge has overseen pretrial proceedings, conducted the Rule 11 inquiries, accepted the original guilty plea, and heard at first hand the reasons bearing upon its withdrawal.\"   Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1538.   Indeed, the fact that during the Rule 11 colloquy Irizarry-Sanabria corrected the court's account of the events on several points belies the image of a timid defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are given more pause by appellant's contention, made at oral argument, that a potential conflict arises because the counsel who Irizarry-Sanabria alleges put him under duress also helped him litigate the motion for withdrawal of his guilty plea.  However, in this circumstance, where we have a complete and detailed plea colloquy, a detailed order denying the motion, and only the most sparse allegations on the part of Irizarry-Sanabria, we cannot find that the district court abused its discretion, even taking into account the pro se nature of Irizarry-Sanabria's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Double Jeopardy Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria next argues that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment against him because he had previously been found guilty in a case involving the same conspiracy.  He alleges that the indictment in this case amounts to prosecuting a single conspiracy as two separate conspiracies, in violation of his double jeopardy guarantee.  However, we find that under Local Rule 510.2 of the District of Puerto Rico, he has waived this argument by failing to object to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation in writing within ten days, as the report and recommendation warned.  See United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1986) (after proper notice, failure to file a specific objection to magistrate's report will waive the right to appeal);  see, e.g., Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 151 (1st Cir.1994);   Borden v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we acknowledge an appellate court's discretion to excuse waiver \"in the interests of justice,\" see Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155 &amp; n. 15 (1986), in this case we find no basis for such action because we conclude that Irizarry-Sanabria's arguments likely would not prevail on the merits.  We weigh five factors in determining whether two charged conspiracy are actually one for double jeopardy purposes:  the timing;  the personnel;  the locations involved;  the evidence used;  and whether the same statutes were implicated.  See United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 860 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1074 (1991).  The only facts Irizarry-Sanabria points to in arguing that there are two distinct conspiracies here are that they both involve the same amount of marijuana, and that they occurred within several weeks of each other.  However, given that it was not the same shipment of marijuana, that it was not the same Colombian supplier, that the only common participants were the defendant and a confidential informant Irizarry-Sanabria introduced to his co-conspirators, and that the importation route was different, see Andujar, 49 F.3d at 18-19 (setting out facts), we are hard pressed to see how these two conspiracies would be viewed as one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria also alleges that the government should have been collaterally estopped from relitigating these issues.  However, he does not specify what ultimate fact he contends has been resolved in his favor.  Similarly, he argues that his substantive due process rights were violated by prosecution for conduct that he was already convicted of, and that the totality of the trial court's errors and the cumulative effect thereof constituted prejudicial error, depriving him of his due process, both without pointing to any error.  To the extent that these arguments have not already been deemed waived under our double jeopardy holding, we now find them waived, as \"[i]t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\"   United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990);  see, e.g., Damon v. Sun Co., 87 F.3d 1467, 1485 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons presented above, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> His conviction for the first conspiracy was affirmed by this court in  United States v.

Nonetheless, in such cases we take as our measure the date of the motion to withdraw the plea, regardless of when the defendant's subjective decision was actually made.

For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria was indicted in March of 1993 and pled not guilty at his arraignment.  His motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, premised on a previous conviction of conspiracy to import marijuana,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was denied.  In October 1993, Irizarry-Sanabria entered a change of plea to guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.  In December 1993, he filed a pro se motion seeking a withdrawal of that plea;  his counsel filed a motion in support of the pro se motion and memorandum of law in February 1994.  The district court denied the motion to withdraw plea, without an evidentiary hearing.  Irizarry-Sanabria was sentenced to 121 months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's refusal of Irizarry-Sanabria's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, made prior to sentencing, for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Tilley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583578\"><a href=\"/opinion/583578/united-states-v-ronald-e-tilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.1992).  To prevail, Irizarry-Sanabria must persuade the court that he has shown a \"fair and just reason\" for his request.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e).  We follow an established test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>A court must consider several factors in weighing whether a defendant meets this burden, the most significant of which is whether the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent within the meaning of [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 11.  The other factors include:  1) the force and plausibility of the proffered reason;  2) the timing of the request;  3) whether the defendant has asserted his legal innocence;  and 4) whether the parties had reached a plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Isom, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196807\"><a href=\"/opinion/196807/united-states-v-isom/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 834 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting  United States v. Cotal-Crespo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195871\"><a href=\"/opinion/195871/united-states-v-cotal-crespo/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></span> (1995) (citation omitted)).  If defendant meets the rigors of this test, we evaluate whether the government will suffer any demonstrable prejudice.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we find, and counsel for defendant admitted at oral argument, that the Rule 11 plea colloquy was thorough and comprehensive.  Irizarry-Sanabria argues that his plea was nonetheless not knowing, voluntary and intelligent because it was made under duress, due to the pressure of his attorney.  However, during the colloquy, Irizarry-Sanabria denied that he had been coerced to accept the plea bargain, acknowledged that he had discussed its terms with counsel, and affirmed that he was satisfied with his legal representation.  \"Such statements in open court during a plea hearing 'carry a strong presumption of verity.' \"   United States v. Martinez-Molina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196268\"><a href=\"/opinion/196268/united-states-v-martinez-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 733 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting  Blackledge v. Allison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109648\"><a href=\"/opinion/109648/blackledge-v-allison/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 74 (1977)).  The pro se motion offers nothing more than a conclusory statement that the plea was \"made under duress, due to the urgency and pressure of all the [co-defendants'] attorneys of this case,\" including Irizarry-Sanabria's counsel.  In denying the motion, the district court noted that Irizarry-Sanabria was informed at the change of plea hearing that he could proceed to trial that same day if he chose, and commented that he was \"alert, calm, confident and knowledgeable of his rights,\" and \"never showed any hesitancy or reservation about his desire to plead guilty.\"   Order at 6. In these circumstances, where we have a thorough, comprehensive Rule 11 colloquy on one hand, and a naked conclusory claim of duress unsupported by any allegations of fact on the other, we find that Irizarry-Sanabria's eleventh-hour claim of duress lacks merit, and accordingly find that his plea was made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently within the meaning of Rule 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our second factor weighs the force and plausibility of the proffered reasons.  We have already weighed the duress claim;  we briefly examine Irizarry-Sanabria's other asserted reasons.  First, Irizarry-Sanabria claims he is innocent, and that he could prove it, without specifying anything regarding the nature of such proof.  At the same time, during the change of plea hearing he corrected the court's account of the events of the conspiracy several times, clarifying what his participation had been.  In such circumstances, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by \"refusing to give weight to a self-serving, unsupported claim of innocence.\"   United States v. Ramos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482471\"><a href=\"/opinion/482471/united-states-v-hector-acevedo-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir.1987) (finding that defendant's claim of innocence lacked merit where he did not assert innocence at change of plea hearing and did not substantiate his claim of exculpatory evidence);  see Isom, 85 F.2d at 837 (rejecting defendant's pro se motion asserting innocence where no information was provided regarding alleged exculpatory evidence, and defendant provided specific information regarding the events of the crime at Rule 11 hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Irizarry-Sanabria's claim that he did not have access to the files on the case gives us little pause, given the thoroughness of the Rule 11 hearing and the fact that Irizarry-Sanabria does not offer any indication of what he expects to find in the files, or what prejudice he has suffered.  Similarly, his claim that his requests for legal assistance \"in this matter\"--presumably, his motion and claim of innocence and duress--had been to no avail is unconvincing, as his attorney followed up the pro se motion with a motion in support and memorandum of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the timing of the motion, almost two months elapsed between the change of plea hearing on October 21, 1993, and Irizarry-Sanabria's pro se motion of December 15, 1993.  We have previously found that such a delay weighs against defendant's position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., Isom, 85 F.3d at 839 (two-month delay);   United States v. Pellerito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526038\"><a href=\"/opinion/526038/united-states-v-giuseppe-pellerito-aka-joseph-el-italiano-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1535</span></a></span>, 1541 (1st Cir.1989) (eight week delay);   United States v. Crosby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423493\"><a href=\"/opinion/423493/united-states-v-peter-f-crosby/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 192 (1st Cir.1983) (eight week delay), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1045</span></span> (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the final two factors, we note, first, that Irizarry-Sanabria has claimed his innocence.  Nonetheless, \"the mere protestation of legal innocence cannot in and of itself be issue-determinative.\"   United States v. Kobrosky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421132\"><a href=\"/opinion/421132/united-states-v-milton-l-kobrosky/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 455 (1st Cir.1983).  Second, the parties reached a plea agreement, which neither alleges has been broken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our analysis of all the factors weighs heavily in favor of the district court's decision, we need not address whether granting the motion would result in prejudice to the government before affirming the decision below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria asserts that the district court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing to factually bolster his claims.  However, we note that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>evidentiary hearings on motions are the exception, not the rule.  We have repeatedly stated that, even in the criminal context, a defendant is not entitled as of right to an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion.  Thus, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing must carry a fairly heavy burden of demonstrating a need for special treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted).  Irizarry-Sanabria's naked conclusory statements offer us no basis for finding that the district court abused its discretion in not holding an evidentiary hearing on his claims.  See, e.g., Ramos, 810 F.2d at 314;   Kobrosky, 711 F.2d at 457;  see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 838 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, counsel for defendant argues that \"most individuals\" are too intimidated by the circumstances of a Rule 11 plea colloquy to stop and tell the court that they have been coerced into pleading guilty.  Such generalizations do not persuade us that the district court abused its discretion in making its decision--a decision \"facilitated because the judge has overseen pretrial proceedings, conducted the Rule 11 inquiries, accepted the original guilty plea, and heard at first hand the reasons bearing upon its withdrawal.\"   Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1538.   Indeed, the fact that during the Rule 11 colloquy Irizarry-Sanabria corrected the court's account of the events on several points belies the image of a timid defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are given more pause by appellant's contention, made at oral argument, that a potential conflict arises because the counsel who Irizarry-Sanabria alleges put him under duress also helped him litigate the motion for withdrawal of his guilty plea.  However, in this circumstance, where we have a complete and detailed plea colloquy, a detailed order denying the motion, and only the most sparse allegations on the part of Irizarry-Sanabria, we cannot find that the district court abused its discretion, even taking into account the pro se nature of Irizarry-Sanabria's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Double Jeopardy Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria next argues that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment against him because he had previously been found guilty in a case involving the same conspiracy.  He alleges that the indictment in this case amounts to prosecuting a single conspiracy as two separate conspiracies, in violation of his double jeopardy guarantee.  However, we find that under Local Rule 510.2 of the District of Puerto Rico, he has waived this argument by failing to object to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation in writing within ten days, as the report and recommendation warned.  See United States v. Valencia-Copete, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471042\"><a href=\"/opinion/471042/united-states-v-emiliano-valencia-copete/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1986) (after proper notice, failure to file a specific objection to magistrate's report will waive the right to appeal);  see, e.g., Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195619\"><a href=\"/opinion/195619/henley-v-marine-transportion/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 151 (1st Cir.1994);   Borden v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499435\"><a href=\"/opinion/499435/james-borden-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we acknowledge an appellate court's discretion to excuse waiver \"in the interests of justice,\" see Thomas v. Arn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111545\"><a href=\"/opinion/111545/thomas-v-arn/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 155 &amp; n. 15 (1986), in this case we find no basis for such action because we conclude that Irizarry-Sanabria's arguments likely would not prevail on the merits.  We weigh five factors in determining whether two charged conspiracy are actually one for double jeopardy purposes:  the timing;  the personnel;  the locations involved;  the evidence used;  and whether the same statutes were implicated.  See United States v. Gomez-Pabon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546890\"><a href=\"/opinion/546890/united-states-v-luis-e-gomez-pabon-united-states-v-wilfredo/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 860 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></span> (1991).  The only facts Irizarry-Sanabria points to in arguing that there are two distinct conspiracies here are that they both involve the same amount of marijuana, and that they occurred within several weeks of each other.  However, given that it was not the same shipment of marijuana, that it was not the same Colombian supplier, that the only common participants were the defendant and a confidential informant Irizarry-Sanabria introduced to his co-conspirators, and that the importation route was different, see Andujar, 49 F.3d at 18-19 (setting out facts), we are hard pressed to see how these two conspiracies would be viewed as one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry-Sanabria also alleges that the government should have been collaterally estopped from relitigating these issues.  However, he does not specify what ultimate fact he contends has been resolved in his favor.  Similarly, he argues that his substantive due process rights were violated by prosecution for conduct that he was already convicted of, and that the totality of the trial court's errors and the cumulative effect thereof constituted prejudicial error, depriving him of his due process, both without pointing to any error.  To the extent that these arguments have not already been deemed waived under our double jeopardy holding, we now find them waived, as \"[i]t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\"   United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span> (1990);  see, e.g., Damon v. Sun Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721298\"><a href=\"/opinion/721298/roy-r-damon-and-eleanor-m-damon-v-sun-company-inc-roy-r-damon-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1467</span></a></span>, 1485 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons presented above, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> His conviction for the first conspiracy was affirmed by this court in  United States v. Andujar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellant argues that this measure ignores the fact that Irizarry-Sanabria's change of heart undoubtedly occurred at some time prior to the date of service.  Nonetheless, in such cases we take as our measure the date of the motion to withdraw the plea, regardless of when the defendant's subjective decision was actually made.
