Appellant Andrew Lore appeals from the\r                                \r\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Marvin Runyon, Jr., the\r\n\nUnited  States  Postmaster  General, and  Vincent  Sombrotto,\r\n\nPresident  of  the National  Association  of Letter  Carriers\r\n\n(NALC).  We affirm for the following reasons.  \r\n\n     1.  To  the extent Lore's  suit was  based on the  claim\r\n\nthat the United States Postal Service failed to pay him fully\r\n\nfor  his  military leave  in 1993  and  that NALC  refused to\r\n\narbitrate  that issue,  it was  time-barred, as  the district\r\n\ncourt correctly  explained in  its order dated  September 15,\r\n\n1995.  We note as well  that Lore offered no evidence showing\r\n\nthat   NALC's    refusal   to   arbitrate    was   arbitrary,\r\n\ndiscriminatory  or undertaken  in bad faith.   See  Miller v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. Postal Service, 985 F.2d 9,  11 (1st Cir. 1993) (a union\r                               \r\n\nbreaches its duty of fair representation only if  its conduct\r\n\nis arbitrary,  discriminatory  or in  bad  faith)  (quotation\r\n\nmarks and citation omitted).  To the contrary, NALC submitted\r\n\nevidence  showing  that its  decision  not  to arbitrate  was\r\n\nreasonable  and  undertaken in  good  faith.   Hence,  Lore's\r\n\nclaims  against  appellees  were   meritless.    See  id.  (a\r                                                                     \r\n\nplaintiff's   failure  to   establish   the  union's   unfair\r\n\nrepresentation defeats his connected breach of contract claim\r\n\nagainst his employer).\r\n\n     2.  To the  extent Lore's suit asserted that  the Postal\r\n\nService had breached  its collective bargaining  agreement by\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndeducting time spent on military leave  from his annual leave\r\n\nwithout  his prior consent  and that NALC  had not vigorously\r\n\narbitrated   that issue,  it was  dismissable for  failure to\r\n\nexhaust  available contractual  remedies.   See Hayes  v. New\r                                                                         \r\n\nEngland  Millwork Distributors,  Inc., 602  F.2d 15,  18 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1979).  At the time Lore  filed suit, arbitration on the\r\n\nannual  leave issue was pending.   Lore has  not described or\r\n\ndocumented  any specific  action  or inaction  by NALC  which\r\n\nunreasonably  delayed the arbitration  and which might excuse\r\n\nhis obligation to exhaust his contractual remedies.\r\n\n     3.     Lore's claim  of  discrimination did  not  assert\r\n\ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of a  protected  status,  but\r\n\namounted essentially  to a claim that the  Postal Service had\r\n\ntreated him differently than it had treated another employee.\r\n\nSuch a claim  is not actionable.   See Jensen  v. Frank,  912\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 517, 520-21 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          Affirmed. \r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
