Petitioner Sulay Jobe failed to\n\nappear at his deportation hearing and was ordered deported in\n\nabsentia.         More than eight months later, Jobe filed a motion to\n\nreopen asking that his                    deportation order be rescinded.               In\n\nsupport of the motion, Jobe alleged that ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel had caused him to miss the deportation hearing.                              An\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") denied the motion as untimely because,\n\nby statute, such motions must be filed within 180 days of the\n\ndeportation order.                Jobe appealed, contending that the same\n\nattorney incompetence that caused him to miss his hearing also\n\ncaused him to miss the deadline for filing his motion to reopen.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed the appeal.\n\nJobe then sought review of the BIA's decision in this court.                            On\n\nMay   24,    2000,        a   divided      panel       vacated   the   BIA's   order   and\n\nremanded for a hearing to determine whether the running of the\n\n180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably\n\ntolled      on    the     facts      of   this    case.       Thereafter,      respondent\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") petitioned for and\n\nwas   granted        en       banc    review      of    the   panel's    holding.       We\n\nsimultaneously withdrew the panel opinion. We now dismiss Jobe's\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f            In June 1994, Jobe, a native and citizen of Gambia,\n\nentered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for business.\n\nHe was authorized to remain in the United States until July 18,\n\n1994, but remained beyond that date without authorization from\n\nthe INS.    On September 9, 1994, Jobe contacted the INS and filed\n\nan application for political asylum.        On February 6, 1996, the\n\nINS informed Jobe that his application had been denied and his\n\ncase referred to an IJ for a hearing.\n\n            On February 14, 1996, the INS served Jobe with an order\n\nto show cause (\"OSC\"), which charged him with remaining in the\n\nUnited     States   longer   than   permitted,   in   violation   of   §\n\n241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n\ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994).1         A hearing on the\n\n\n\n     1On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n(\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546\n(1996), which redesignated former INA § 241 as § 237,\ntransferred it to a different section of the United States Code,\nand otherwise brought significant changes to the country's\nimmigration laws.    But because petitioner was in deportation\nproceedings before April 1, 1997 (IIRIRA's \"Title III-A\neffective date\") and had his final order of deportation entered\nmore than 30 days thereafter, he is subject only to the IIRIRA's\nso-called \"transitional rules.\" See IIRIRA § 309(c)(1),(4) (as\namended) (\"transitional rules\").    And under the transitional\nrules, the IIRIRA's permanent new rules do not apply unless a\ncase meets one of the enumerated exceptions set forth in IIRIRA\n§ 309(c)(4). All agree that none of these exceptions applies to\nthis case.   Thus, we evaluate Jobe's petition under the \"old\nrules,\" such as INA § 241(a)(1)(B), even though they have since\nbeen repealed or redesignated.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fOSC   was   scheduled   in    Boston   on   May   22,   1996.   The   OSC\n\nspecifically advised Jobe that, if he failed to appear for his\n\nhearing and his deportability were established, he would be\n\ndeported in absentia.        The OSC also advised Jobe that, if were\n\ndeported in absentia, he could not have the order rescinded\n\nexcept that he \"may file a motion to reopen the hearing within\n\n180 days after the date of the [deportation] order if [the alien\n\nis] able to show that [his] failure to appear was because of\n\nexceptional circumstances . . . .\"2 In March or early April of\n\n1996, Jobe moved to New York City to live with his friend,\n\nSulayman Bah.     Jobe does not write or speak English, and thus\n\nused Bah as an intermediary to retain attorney Earl S. David to\n\nrepresent him.\n\n            The crucial facts of this case, which we derive from\n\nJobe's own submissions during the administrative proceedings, are\n\nas follows.      On April 12, 1996, Attorney David wrote to the\n\n\n      2\n     The OSC also advised Jobe of his entitlement to file a\nmotion to reopen an in absentia deportation order\n\n      at any time if [the alien] can show that [he] did not\n      receive written notice of [the hearing on the OSC] and\n      [he] had provided [his] address and telephone number\n      (and any changes of [his] address and telephone\n      number) as required . . . and did not appear at [his]\n      hearing through no fault of [his] own.\n\nIn the administrative proceedings, Jobe claimed that he received\ninadequate notice of the hearing on his OSC, but he has\nabandoned that claim in this court.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fImmigration Court in Boston, requesting a change in venue to New\n\nYork because Jobe now lived there.                Subsequently, Jobe, again\n\nusing Bah as an intermediary, contacted Attorney David to inform\n\nhim that he would be unable to attend the May 22 hearing because\n\nof a back injury.      According to affidavits submitted by Bah and\n\nJobe (and disputed by Attorney David), David informed Bah that\n\nthe case already had been transferred to New York and that Jobe\n\nwould be contacted when the court set a new hearing date.                         The\n\ncase never was transferred.          Neither Jobe nor David attended the\n\nMay 22 hearing, and Jobe was ordered deported in absentia.                         In\n\nhis brief, Jobe suggests that he only learned that he had been\n\nordered deported in absentia when he received a December 4, 1996\n\nnotice   from    the   INS   denying    his      application        to    renew   his\n\nemployment authorization.           At that time, the 180-day statutory\n\nwindow   for    seeking   rescission        on   the    basis   of       exceptional\n\ncircumstances – a statutory window of which Jobe had been advised\n\nin the OSC – had closed, but only by a couple of weeks.\n\n          Nonetheless,       Jobe    failed      to    take   any    action    until\n\nFebruary 11, 1997, when, acting through new counsel, he moved to\n\nreopen and stay the deportation proceedings.                  Insofar as is here\n\nrelevant, he argued that his failure to appear was the result of\n\n\"exceptional circumstances\" – i.e., ineffective assistance of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcounsel3   –   and    that   his   deportation    order   thus    should   be\n\nrescinded.      See    INA   §   242B(c)(3)(A),   codified   at    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994)4 (permitting the rescission of an                  in\n\nabsentia deportation order \"only . . . upon a motion to reopen\n\nfiled within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation\n\nif the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because\n\nof exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (f)(2) of\n\nthis section)\").5      On February 12, 1997, an IJ denied the motion\n\nas untimely, noting that it was brought well outside the 180-day\n\nwindow provided in the statute.        On March 10, 1997, Jobe appealed\n\n\n\n     3Because deportation proceedings are civil, the Sixth\nAmendment guarantee of effective counsel in criminal proceedings\nis inapplicable. Nonetheless, we have recognized that \"there is\na due process violation if [a deportation proceeding] was so\nfundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from\nreasonably presenting his case.\"    Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195\nF.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir. 1999) (collecting cases). It is in this\nsense that the phrase \"ineffective assistance of counsel\" has\nmade its way into immigration cases, and it is in this sense\nthat we use the term in this opinion.\n     4\n     Although INA § 242B(c)(3)(A), codified at 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994), has been repealed, Congress replaced\nthe provision with one that is in all respects identical except\nthat what formerly was called \"deportation\" is now referred to\nas \"removal.\" See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(i), codified at 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229a (b)(5)(C)(i).\n     5\n     Former INA § 242B(f)(2), codified at 8 U.S.C. §\n1252b(f)(2), provided: \"The term 'exceptional circumstances'\nrefers to exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of\nthe alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but\nnot including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control\nof the alien.\"\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe IJ's decision to the BIA.     He argued that the IJ erred in\n\ndenying his motion to reopen because his failure to file the\n\nmotion within the 180-day statutory period was caused by the same\n\nineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to miss his\n\ndeportation hearing in the first instance.   On December 15, 1998,\n\nthe BIA dismissed Jobe's appeal because Jobe was \"statutorily\n\nbarred [by the 180-day statutory window] from rescinding the\n\ndeportation order on the basis of exceptional circumstances.\"\n\n         Jobe then petitioned us to review the BIA's order.     In\n\nhis brief, Jobe argued that the BIA violated his due process\n\nrights by applying the 180-day statutory period in circumstances\n\nwhere the same ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him\n\nto miss his hearing also caused him to miss the deadline for\n\nfiling his motion to reopen.      A divided panel of this court\n\ngranted the petition.   The majority construed Jobe's brief as\n\nsetting forth an argument that the 180-day time period prescribed\n\nin INA § 242B(c)(3)(A) is subject to equitable tolling, and,\n\nafter noting that the issue has split the circuits,6 agreed with\n\n\n     6\n     Compare Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999)\n(holding that INA § 242B(c)(3)(A) sets forth a \"mandatory and\njurisdictional\" time bar) with Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100\n(9th Cir. 1999) (holding that INA § 242B(c)(3)(A)'s time bar is\nnot jurisdictional and thus subject to equitable tolling); cf.\nIavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that the\nequitable tolling doctrine applies to the 90-day period provided\nin 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1)(2000) for filing motions to reopen\nbased on \"new facts\").\n\n                                -8-\n\fJobe's argument on the merits.      The majority also determined that\n\nJobe's submissions were sufficient to warrant further inquiry, at\n\nthe agency level, into whether the statute should be equitably\n\ntolled in the circumstances of this case.         The dissent argued,\n\ninter alia, that the majority should not have decided whether the\n\nstatute is subject to equitable tolling because, even if it were,\n\nJobe had failed to establish possible entitlement to equitable\n\nrelief.   Thereafter, the INS sought and was granted rehearing en\n\nbanc, and the panel opinion was withdrawn.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          In its petition for rehearing en banc, the INS makes a\n\npowerful argument that INA § 242B(c)(3)(A) should be regarded as\n\nmandatory and jurisdictional and thus not subject to equitable\n\ntolling – an argument that is skillfully countered not only by\n\nour dissenting brothers, but also by the Massachusetts Law Reform\n\nInstitute, which filed a well argued amicus brief on behalf of\n\nitself and the following interested parties: the Political Asylum\n\nImmigration   Representation       Project;   Greater   Boston     Legal\n\nServices; the International Institute of Boston; the Community\n\nLegal Services and Counseling Center; the Harvard Immigration and\n\nRefugee   Clinic;   the   Boston   College    Immigration   and   Asylum\n\nProject; the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers\n\nGuild; and the American Immigration Lawyers Association.              We\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fappreciate the importance of the issue and the effort that has\n\nbeen expended in framing it for us in a most helpful way.                            But\n\nbecause Jobe has not made a prima facie showing of entitlement to\n\nequitable tolling or otherwise convinced us that application of\n\nINA § 242B(c)(3)(A)'s time limit violates his due process rights\n\non the facts of this case, we dismiss the petition without\n\ndeciding whether the equitable tolling doctrine may apply to this\n\nstatutory provision.\n\n            Even   when        it     applies,      equitable        tolling    is     a\n\n\"sparingly\"    invoked     doctrine.              Irwin   v.    Dep't    of   Veterans\n\nAffairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990).              We have identified five factors\n\nthat should guide courts in evaluating a claimant's entitlement\n\nto such tolling: (1) a lack of actual notice of a time limit; (2)\n\na lack of constructive notice of a time limit; (3) diligence in\n\nthe pursuit of one's rights; (4) an absence of prejudice to a\n\nparty   opponent;    and       (5)     the    claimant's        reasonableness        in\n\nremaining ignorant of the time limit.                          See Benitez-Pons v.\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 61 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(deciding     whether     to        toll    the    running      of   a   statute      of\n\nlimitations) (citing Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 861 F.2d 746, 752\n\n(1st Cir. 1988)).       The fundamental principle is that equitable\n\ntolling \"is appropriate only when the circumstances that cause a\n\n[party] to miss a filing deadline are out of his hands.\"                        Salois\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fv. Dime Savings Bank, 128 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation\n\nand    internal       quotation      marks      omitted).             For   this    reason,\n\n\"[e]quitable         tolling    is     unavailable       where    a     party      fails    to\n\nexercise due diligence.\"               Benitez-Pons, 136 F.3d at 61.\n\n                 In this case, the evidence submitted by Jobe in support\n\nof his equitable tolling argument7 undermines his claim to have\n\nbeen sufficiently diligent to warrant an equitable tolling of the\n\nstatute.         In paragraph 4 of his August 4, 1997 affidavit, Bah\n\nlargely corroborates the allegation which is at the heart of\n\nJobe's claim that attorney dereliction caused him to miss the May\n\n22, 1996 deportation hearing:\n\n                 Attorney David promised to transfer the case\n                 to New York. Attorney David told me that he\n                 had written for the case to be transferred\n                 from Boston to New York. I believed him and\n                 told [petitioner] to disregard the hearing\n                 date   scheduled   for  Boston.      I   told\n                 [petitioner] that Immigration will inform him\n                 of his new Court date in New York.\n\nBut then, in paragraph 5 of the same affidavit, Bah states: \"The\n\nnext    letter      addressed     to    Sulay     Jobe     was    a    ruling      from    the\n\nImmigration Court that was done in Sulay’s absence.                              I advised\n\nSulay       of    this   letter      and    told     him     to       see   an     Attorney\n\nimmediately.\" (Emphasis added.).                  Moreover, in his September 11,\n\n\n        7\n     For purposes of this analysis, we shall assume arguendo\nthat Jobe has presented a preserved and sufficiently developed\nargument in favor of equitably tolling the running of the 180-\nday time period in INA § 242B(c)(3)(A).\n\n                                           -11-\n\f1997 sworn \"correction\" to his August 4 affidavit, Bah makes\n\nclear two crucial facts: (1) the notice of the IJ’s in absentia\n\ndeportation order was in Bah's hands within a month of the IJ's\n\n\n\n\n                             -12-\n\fruling;8 and (2) Bah \" immediately\" told Jobe about the arrival of\n\n\n     8In his sworn correction, Bah states: \"When the notice of\ndecision came to the New York address, on or about May - June,\n1997, I received the notice of decision from the Court at 933 E.\n224th Street, Bronx, NY 10466.\"     It is clear from context,\nhowever, that Bah intended to state that the notice of decision\narrived in May - June 1996.\n     First, both Bah's affidavit (in paragraph 6) and his sworn\ncorrection to the affidavit state that Bah told Jobe about the\nnotice from the Immigration Court prior to Jobe's arrest. The\nexact date of Jobe's arrest is not in the record, but Jobe's\nMarch 10, 1997 appeal to the BIA quite clearly indicates that\nJobe was detained at that time.    It is thus evident that Bah\nreceived the notice well before the May-June 1997 time-frame\nreferenced in the sworn correction.\n     Second, throughout these proceedings, there never has been\nany suggestion that the notice of deportation was lost in the\nmail for nearly a year and arrived at a time when the BIA\nalready had under advisement Jobe's appeal of the denial of the\nmotion to reopen.   Indeed, there never has been a suggestion\nthat the arrival of the notice was in any way untimely, as there\nsurely would have been had that in fact been the case. Thus,\nalready knowing (as we do) that (1) Bah's sworn correction is\nmistaken insofar as it refers to May-June 1997; and (2) notice\nof a ruling handed down in Boston on May 22, 1996 is likely to\nreach New York by mail sometime around May-June 1996, the\nlogical inference is that Bah (who swore out the correction in\nSeptember 1997) inadvertently substituted \"1997\" for the\nintended \"1996.\"\n     Third, and perhaps most importantly, Jobe bears the burden\nof making a prima facie showing of entitlement to equitable\ntolling, and therefore of filling in any gaps in the record\nregarding whether his is a case warranting equitable relief. On\nthis point, we regard it as particularly telling that Jobe has\nfailed throughout these proceedings to offer any explanation for\nthe discrepancy between the date of the in absentia deportation\norder and the dates referenced in Bah's sworn correction to his\naffidavit, even in the face of (1) our request that he address\nhis factual entitlement to equitable tolling in our solicitation\nof supplemental briefs following the granting of the petition\nfor rehearing en banc; and (2) the dissent from the now-\nwithdrawn panel opinion, which argued that Bah's sworn\ncorrection obviously substituted \"1997\" for the intended \"1996.\"\n\n\n                              -13-\n\fthe notice.\n\n            Thus,       even   if    we     assume    that     \"exceptional\n\ncircumstances\" caused Jobe to miss his hearing, and even if we\n\ncredit the unsworn statement in Jobe's brief which suggests that\n\nJobe did not actually ascertain that he had been ordered deported\n\nuntil December 1996, we are left with Bah's two uncontradicted\n\nsworn statements, put in the record by Jobe himself, which\n\ncombine to establish that, in May or June of 1996, several months\n\nbefore the expiration of the 180-day time period set forth in INA\n\n§ 242B(c)(3)(A), Jobe learned that an IJ had taken some action on\n\nhis asylum application and was advised to consult an attorney\n\nimmediately.     Despite this knowledge and advice, Jobe took no\n\naction to protect his rights for more than half a year.               In our\n\nview,     this   fact     conclusively      establishes     that   Jobe   was\n\ninsufficiently diligent in pursuing his asylum application to\n\nwarrant the provision of any equitable relief that might be\n\navailable under the statute.              So too does this fact fatally\n\nundermine the premise of the as-applied due process argument Jobe\n\npresses     in   his     appellate    brief:         that    his   counsel's\n\nineffectiveness was the cause of his failure to file a timely\n\nmotion to reopen his deportation proceedings and rescind the\n\ndeportation order.\n\n                                     III.\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f           For the reasons stated, we do not decide whether the\n\nequitable tolling doctrine applies to INA § 242B(c)(3)(A) but\n\nrather   dismiss   Jobe's   petition    because   he   is   not   factually\n\nentitled to equitable tolling and because application of the\n\nstatute in these circumstances does not deprive him of due\n\nprocess.\n\n           Petition dismissed.    Dissenting opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, with whom LIPEZ, Circuit\n\nJudge, joins       (dissenting).          I dissent for two reasons.               First,\n\nI do not think there is a sufficient basis to find that Jobe had\n\nnotice of the IJ decision to deport him in absentia well before\n\nthe   expiration         of    the    180-day    time    period      set    forth      in\n\nINA § 242B(c)(3)(A).            Second, even if Jobe received such notice,\n\nthat fact alone does not establish that the running of the 180-\n\nday period for filing a motion to reopen should not be equitably\n\ntolled.     The majority says Jobe was insufficiently diligent in\n\npursuit    of     his    rights.         That    diligence      analysis      requires\n\nconsideration      of     other      factors,    particularly        Jobe's    alleged\n\nreliance     on     an        attorney    who    may     have    represented         him\n\nineffectively.          Without further fact-finding, we cannot know the\n\ncircumstances surrounding Jobe's untimely motion to reopen, and\n\nso cannot fairly dispose of his case.                  Regrettably, the majority\n\ndoes the fact-finding here.                 That is not a proper appellate\n\nfunction.\n\n                                           I.\n\n            The    majority       finds    “that    in   May    or   June     of    1996,\n\nseveral months before the expiration of the 180-day time period\n\nset forth in INA § 242B(c)(3)(A), Jobe learned that an IJ had\n\ntaken some action on his asylum application and was advised to\n\nconsult an attorney immediately.                   Despite this knowledge and\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fadvice, Jobe took no action to protect his rights for more than\n\nhalf a year.”   I do not think the majority's reasoning withstands\n\nscrutiny.    It depends in large part upon the interpretation of\n\ntwo affidavits of a presumed friend of Jobe, Sulayman Bah.      The\n\nfirst affidavit is dated 4/August/1997.       There are no dates in\n\nthe body of the affidavit.      It states as follows:\n\n                       AFFIDAVIT OF SULAYMAN BAH\n\n               I, SULAYMAN BAH, having been duly sworn\n            upon oath, do hereby depose and say:\n\n                1. My name is Sulayman Bah and I live at\n            933 E. 224th Street, #1A, Bronx, New York\n            10466.\n\n                2. I served as a mediator between Sulay\n            Jobe and Attorney Earl David.\n\n                3. Sulay Jobe asked me if I knew of any\n            New York Attorneys because attorneys in Rhode\n            Island are extremely expensive. I introduced\n            Sulay Jobe to Earl David.     Attorney David\n            charged Sulay Jobe $600.00 for his legal\n            services.\n\n                4. Attorney David promised to transfer\n            the case to New York. Attorney David told me\n            that he had written for the case to be\n            transferred from Boston to New York.        I\n            believed him and told Sulay Jobe to disregard\n            the hearing date scheduled for Boston.      I\n            told Sulay Jobe that Immigration will inform\n            him of his new Court date in New York.\n\n                 5.    The next letter addressed to Sulay\n            Jobe was   a ruling from the Immigration Court\n            that was   done in Sulay’s absence. I advised\n            Sulay of   this letter and told him to see an\n            Attorney   immediately.\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f              6. I found out shortly thereafter that\n          Sulay had been arrested by Immigration.\n\n          The second affidavit is to “correct the record in\n\n    the   matter   of   Sulay   Jobe.”   It   was   executed    on\n\n    September 11, 1997.     It states:\n\n          I, Sulaman Bah, being duly sworn, deposes and\n          states the following under penalty of\n          perjury: I would like to correct the record\n          in the matter of Sulay Jobe. I told Mr. Jobe\n          to disregard the hearing date since I was\n          told by Mr. David that he wrote a letter to\n          transfer the file.      When the notice of\n          decision came to the New York address, on or\n          about May - June, 1997, I received the notice\n          of decision from the Court at 933 E. 224th\n          Street, Bronx, NY 10466.       I immediately\n          contacted Mr. Jobe regarding this notice. I\n          then left the country and later on heard that\n          Mr. Jobe was arrested.\n\n          X   /s/ Sulaman Bah\n          Sulaman Bah\n\n          The majority makes the rather remarkable finding:          “It\n\nis clear from context, however, that Bah intended to state that\n\nthe notice of decision arrived in May - June 1996.”     Majority Op.\n\nat 11.\n\n          This affidavit was given “to correct the record in the\n\nmatter of Sulay Jobe.”   How do we know that Bah intended to state\n\nthat the notice of decision arrived in May-June 1996?          The only\n\ndates given in his affidavit are “on or about May-June 1997.”\n\nHow can the majority be so sure that the dates Bah gave in his\n\ncorrected affidavit were wrong?    We know nothing about Bah except\n\n                                 -18-\n\fwhat he states in his affidavits.        His deposition was not taken.\n\nWe have no way of judging either his credibility or competence.\n\n         The dates of the receipt of the notice found by the\n\nmajority must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nThe court attempts to meet this burden by stating\n\n         Thus, already knowing (as we do) that\n         (1) Bah’s sworn correction is mistaken\n         insofar as it refers to May-June 1997; and\n         (2) notice of a ruling handed down in Boston\n         on May 22, 1996 is likely to reach New York\n         by mail sometime around May-June 1996, the\n         logical inference is that Bah (who swore out\n         the    correction   in    September    1997)\n         inadvertently substituted “1997\" for the\n         intended “1996.”\n\nMajority Op. at 11.     But we do not know in the true sense of the\n\nword anything but what is stated in the affidavit.             Bah may have\n\nbeen mistaken about the dates he stated in the affidavit but we\n\ndo not know that he was.\n\n         It     seems   significant      that    the    only   substantive\n\ndifference    between   Bah's   first    and   second   affidavit   is   the\n\ninclusion of dates.     If the affidavit was amended to clarify the\n\ntiming of events, which seems to have been the intent, this makes\n\nit more likely that the May-June 1997 date is correct.                    If\n\nproviding a date was the purpose of the amendment, we can presume\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fthat particular attention was given to the accuracy of the\n\nreported date.1\n\n         It should also be noted that Bah's second affidavit\n\nstates that he received notice of the decision at 933 E. 224th\n\nStreet, Bronx, NY 10466.       His first affidavit confirms this\n\naddress, but includes an apartment number, #1A. Attorney David's\n\nvenue change request states that Jobe lived at the New York\n\naddress, but at apartment #1.   We do not know whether the correct\n\naddress was the one with apartment #1, the one with apartment\n\n#1A, or the one without any apartment number.       It is, at least,\n\npossible that these variant addresses might have affected the\n\ndate Bah received the order.\n\n         The majority also states:      “Indeed there never has been\n\na suggestion that the arrival of the notice was in any way\n\nuntimely, as these surely would have been had that in fact been\n\nthe case.”   Majority Op. at 11.       This, of course, ignores that\n\nthere is only one date given in Bah’s two affidavits.     The second\n\naffidavit states that “the notice of decision came to the New\n\nYork address, on or about May-June 1997.”       The decision of the\n\n\n     1\n     We do not even know that the same person made out both\naffidavits. The name of the affiant in the first affidavit is\ngiven as Sulayman Bah; in the second the first name is Sulaman.\nI do not think it fair to make a finding that results in\ndeportation of an individual by changing dates in a sworn\naffidavit which may have been executed by two different\naffiants.\n\n                                -20-\n\fcourt   assumes      that    there    is    always      an    orderly     and   logical\n\nsequence to a chain of events.                    Such a belief is natural to\n\njudicial thinking and analysis.                  But as Justice Holmes pointed\n\nout: “The life of the law is not logic but experience.”                               And\n\nexperience     teaches       that    many    things     happen       that    cannot    be\n\nexplained     by    logical      analysis.         There      are    at   least   three\n\nexplanations that might account for the dates mentioned in Bah's\n\naffidavits:        a late mailing by the INS, a late delivery by the\n\npost office, or a delivery to a wrong address.\n\n             I do not think that the affidavits can or should be\n\nused for finding, as the court does, that “Jobe took no action to\n\nprotect his rights for more than half a year.”                       Majority Op. at\n\n12.     It   constitutes         appellate       findings      of    facts   based     on\n\ninferences and unsubstantiated assumptions.                         The only way to\n\ndetermine the facts in this case is to have a hearing before the\n\nImmigration Court.\n\n                                           II.\n\n             Aside from the uncertainty about the date on which Jobe\n\nreceived notice of the IJ's decision, the facts here do not\n\nestablish     Jobe's    ineligibility            for   equitable      tolling.        The\n\nmajority relies exclusively upon one \"fact,\" based on one of\n\nBah's   affidavits,         to   conclude    that      Jobe    was    insufficiently\n\ndiligent in pursuing his asylum application, and hence he would\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fnot be entitled to equitable relief.       That one fact is Bah's\n\nassertion that he advised Jobe of the IJ's decision immediately\n\nafter he received it and told Jobe to see an attorney.    But that\n\none fact does not exhaust the reasonable diligence inquiry when\n\nthe record strongly suggests Jobe's dependence on others to\n\nprotect his rights, including an attorney who may have been\n\nconsistently ineffective in protecting Jobe's rights prior to the\n\nMay 22, 1996 hearing, and subsequent to the issuance of the in\n\nabsentia deportation order.\n\n         From the time his hearing before the IJ was scheduled,\n\nJobe relied upon his friend Bah, as well as Attorney David, for\n\nguidance in his immigration proceedings.       Jobe states in his\n\naffidavit (drafted by a translator fluent in both English and\n\nJobe's native Wolof), \"I do not read, write or speak the English\n\nlanguage.\"   Jobe sought the assistance of Bah in obtaining\n\ncounsel, and the two of them met with Attorney David in New York\n\nwith Bah acting as translator.    The nature of the attorney-client\n\nrelationship established at their initial meeting is unclear.\n\nJobe's affidavit suggests his understanding that David would\n\nrepresent him in his asylum claim generally: \"I retained Attorney\n\nEarl S. David to represent me in my asylum proceedings.\"      This\n\nunderstanding would have been reasonable, based on the fact that\n\nDavid represented Bah in the immigration proceedings resulting in\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fhis successful asylum claim.    Guided by Bah, Jobe would likely\n\nseek the same service from David.     Nevertheless, David's letter\n\nof justification to the Board of Immigration Appeals defending\n\nhimself against charges of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nsuggests that he was retained exclusively to obtain a change of\n\nvenue for Jobe's asylum hearing, a seemingly minimal task for the\n\n$600 fee that Bah says David received.   Thus, at the beginning of\n\nthe   attorney-client   relationship,     there   may    have   been\n\nmiscommunications between Jobe and David.\n\n         With Bah's assistance, Jobe requested that David obtain\n\na transfer of his Boston-based immigration court hearing to his\n\nnew home, New York.   As he recalls, \"Attorney David told me that\n\nhe would be transferring his case to New York.\"   Bah corroborates\n\nthis account, while David denies it, saying that \"[u]nder no\n\ncircumstances did I promise to transfer the file as the power to\n\ndo so arises from the government, not this office.\"\n\n         Prior to the May 22nd hearing date, Jobe says he again\n\ncontacted David, through Bah, to say he would be unable to make\n\nthe Boston court appearance due to a back injury.       According to\n\nJobe, \"Attorney David told [Bah] that [the] case had already been\n\ntransferred to New York and that a new hearing date would be\n\nset,\" a communication that David again claims never happened.\n\nIndeed, David says he told Jobe through Bah that he would have to\n\n\n                               -23-\n\fattend the hearing on May 22, 1996 in Boston regardless of the\n\noutcome of the change of venue request.\n\n              In reality, David's request for a change of venue,\n\nsubmitted on April 12, 1996 with no supporting evidence or\n\naffidavits, was never adequate to win a transfer.                   A change of\n\nvenue request may be granted by an IJ for \"good cause.\" 8 C.F.R.\n\n3.20.     In seeking a change of venue, \"the mere fact that an\n\napplicant allegedly resides . . . in another city, without a\n\nshowing    of    other      significant    factors     associated    with    such\n\nresidence, is insufficient.\"          Matter of Rahman, 20 I & N Dec. 480\n\n(BIA 1992).       Yet that residence in another city is all David\n\noffered   to     the   IJ   to   support   the   change   of   venue      request.\n\nFurthermore, it is difficult to credit David's insistence that he\n\ntold Jobe he had to appear in Boston on May 22 under any\n\ncircumstances, ready, apparently, to represent himself, after\n\nJobe    had     retained     David   to    represent    him    in   his     asylum\n\nproceedings.       Jobe hired David because he could not effectively\n\nrepresent himself.           Yet Attorney David did not attend the May\n\n22nd sitting in Boston.          Moreover, if David was so sure that the\n\nMay 22 hearing would take place, and he told Jobe to be there\n\nwithout David's representation, did he give Jobe any advice on\n\nwhat he had to do to protect his interests?                    Apparently not.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fDavid   says     he   just    told   Jobe       to   be    there,    an    ineffective\n\ncontribution even on David's version of the facts.\n\n            David characterizes the events surrounding the transfer\n\nrequest and missed hearing as \"an unfortunate miscommunication.\"\n\nIndeed, it was an unfortunate miscommunication, depriving Jobe of\n\nthe opportunity to present his asylum claim and resulting in the\n\nissuance of an in absentia deportation order.                             It was also\n\nanother miscommunication that seemed to plague the David-Jobe\n\nattorney-client relationship.\n\n\n\n            We    also   do    not   know       from      this    record     what   Jobe\n\nunderstood about the information given to him by Bah concerning\n\nthe decision of the IJ after Jobe failed to appear in Boston on\n\nMay 22.   In his affidavits, Bah only indicates that he \"contacted\n\nMr. Jobe regarding this notice,\" and states his impression that\n\n\"a ruling from the Immigration Court . . . was done in Sulay's\n\nabsence.\"      Bah does not say that he told Jobe of his imminent\n\ndeportation.      In addition, it is not clear from the record that\n\nJobe ever took possession of the correspondence.                              The best\n\nevidence that Jobe did not understand the effect of the order is\n\nthat he sought out the Immigration Office in December regarding\n\nhis   employment      authorization,        a    risk     an     immigrant    would   be\n\nunlikely to take if he understood his deportation was imminent.\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fIf Jobe did not actually receive notice of the IJ's in absentia\n\ndecision, he then learned of his deportation status only on\n\nDecember 4, 1996 when he sought employment.        The timespan between\n\nthis notification and the February 11, 1997 filing of motions to\n\nreopen and to stay deportation cannot be characterized as a\n\nfailure to take action, as the majority suggests.\n\n          Meanwhile, having advised Jobe \"to see an Attorney\n\nimmediately,\" Bah, Jobe's only liaison to his attorney, leaves\n\nthe country.    As noted, Jobe states in his affidavit that he was\n\nrelying   on   Attorney   David   to   represent   him    in   his   asylum\n\nproceedings.    David apparently had a more limited view of his\n\nobligation to Jobe, possibly leaving Jobe to rely on an attorney\n\nwho felt no obligation to help him even after the issuance of the\n\nin absentia deportation order.     There is some evidence that David\n\nhimself learned of the deportation order.                He writes that,\n\napparently after issuance of the IJ decision: \"I tried to reach\n\nmy client by mail and by the number I had in my file but it was\n\nto no avail.\"    While David had failed to file a EOIR-28 \"Notice\n\nof Entry of Appearance\" form with the INS,2 another suggestion of\n\nineffective representation, the fact that David's address appears\n\n\n     2\n     The BIA Practice Manual indicates that an entry of\nappearance must be filed upon \"the first appearance of an\nattorney or representative,\" as well as with the filing of an\nappeal, a motion to reconsider, a motion to reopen, and when\nthere is a change of business address.\n\n                                  -26-\n\fprominently on the request for change of venue may have been\n\nenough for him to be listed as the attorney of record in Jobe's\n\nimmigration court proceedings.          If David did know of the       in\n\nabsentia deportation order, there is no evidence that he made any\n\neffort to file a motion to reopen in a timely fashion, despite\n\nhis apparent awareness that an \"unfortunate miscommunication\"\n\nbetween himself and Jobe contributed to Jobe's failure to appear\n\nin Boston.\n\n         Without clarification of David's obligation to protect\n\nJobe after the issuance of the in absentia deportation order, and\n\nDavid's apparent inaction despite any such obligation, a real\n\nissue of ongoing ineffective assistance during this critical\n\nperiod exists, which would further account for Jobe's delay in\n\nseeking relief from the in absentia deportation order.\n\n         In summary, without the support of Bah to comprehend\n\nthe English language, and perhaps without the support of a\n\nreliable attorney who Jobe thought was protecting his interests,\n\nit may have been difficult for Jobe to understand his peril and\n\nto press his claim more diligently.         Yet the majority sees no\n\nrelationship   between   these   facts    and   the   equitable   tolling\n\ndoctrine. Whether a party is reasonably diligent in ascertaining\n\ntheir claim is a matter of fact.        See Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank,\n\n128 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir. 1997).    In this case, there has been no\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\ffact-finding on the diligence issue because the BIA concluded\n\nthat the 180-day time limit was not subject to equitable tolling.\n\nAs a legal proposition, that conclusion is wrong.             See Lopez v.\n\nINS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999).           Equitable tolling does\n\napply to the 180-day time limit.             There is conflicting and\n\ninadequate evidence as to Jobe's notice of the IJ decision, his\n\ncapacity to pursue a timely motion to reopen, and the burdens\n\nimposed by ongoing ineffective assistance of counsel.            There has\n\nbeen no chance for Jobe to make a showing as to his diligence,\n\nand the case should not be disposed of on the basis of one fact\n\nwhich,   upon   fair   examination,    may   show    little   about   Jobe's\n\nreasonable diligence in pursuing his rights.\n\n                                 III.\n\n           I think it important to focus on the situation that led\n\nto this case.    Jobe was a native and citizen of Gambia where he\n\nhad been employed as a chauffeur for a deposed president's\n\nMinister of Education and Agriculture.         According to the record,\n\nJobe claimed that he had reason to fear that he would be hurt\n\nand/or killed if he were to return to Gambia.             Jobe overstayed\n\nhis visa and though he was undetected by the INS, he presented\n\nhimself and sought political asylum.         When the INS received this\n\nrequest, they denied the request for political asylum and put him\n\ninto deportation proceedings.         The INS issued an Order to Show\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fCause and told him that he could request political asylum at his\n\ndeportation hearing.      We know the rest:     he failed to appear at\n\nhis May 22 hearing and was ordered deported.        Therefore he never\n\nhad the opportunity to request political asylum at a deportation\n\nhearing; his ultimate goal when he presented himself before the\n\nINS.\n\n           I do not think it fair or just to deport an individual\n\nand put his life in danger on the basis of appellate fact-\n\nfinding.    We should rule, as the panel did originally, that the\n\n180-day time limit for reopening is subject to equitable tolling,\n\nthat ineffective assistance of counsel may provide a basis for\n\nthe application of the equitable tolling doctrine, and that there\n\nshould be a hearing by the IJ to determine whether the running of\n\nthe 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should be\n\nequitably tolled on the facts of this case.        If so, there should\n\nbe   a   hearing   on   Jobe's   motion   to   reopen,   giving   him   an\n\nopportunity to make the case that he should be given a new\n\nhearing on his asylum application.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\f",

More than eight months later, Jobe filed a motion to reopen asking that his deportation order be rescinded. In support of the motion, Jobe alleged that ineffective assistance of counsel had caused him to miss the deportation hearing. An immigration judge (\"IJ\") denied the motion as untimely because, by statute, such motions must be filed within 180 days of the deportation order. Jobe appealed, contending that the same attorney incompetence that caused him to miss his hearing also caused him to miss the deadline for filing his motion to reopen. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed the appeal. Jobe then sought review of the BIA's decision in this court. On May 24, 2000, a divided panel vacated the BIA's order and remanded for a hearing to determine whether the running of the 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled on the facts of this case. Thereafter, respondent Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") petitioned for and was granted en banc review of the panel's holding. We simultaneously withdrew the panel opinion. We now dismiss Jobe's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1994, Jobe, a native and citizen of Gambia, entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for business. He was authorized to remain in the United States until July 18, 1994, but remained beyond that date without authorization from the INS. On September 9, 1994, Jobe contacted the INS and filed an application for political asylum. On February 6, 1996, the INS informed Jobe that his application had been denied and his case referred to an IJ for a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 1996, the INS served Jobe with an order to show cause (\"OSC\"), which charged him with remaining in the United States longer than permitted, in violation of &#167; 241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A hearing on the OSC was scheduled in Boston on May 22, 1996. The OSC specifically advised Jobe that, if he failed to appear for his hearing and his deportability were established, he would be deported in absentia. The OSC also advised Jobe that, if were deported in absentia, he could not have the order rescinded except that he \"may file a motion to reopen the hearing within 180 days after the date of the [deportation] order if [the alien is] able to show that [his] failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In March or early April of 1996, Jobe moved to New York City to live with his friend, Sulayman Bah. Jobe does not write or speak English, and thus used Bah as an intermediary to retain attorney Earl S. David to represent him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crucial facts of this case, which we derive from Jobe's own submissions during the administrative proceedings, are as follows. On April 12, 1996, Attorney David wrote to the Immigration Court in Boston, requesting a change in venue to New York because Jobe now lived there. Subsequently, Jobe, again using Bah as an intermediary, contacted Attorney David to inform him that he would be unable to attend the May 22 hearing because of a back injury. According to affidavits submitted by Bah and Jobe (and disputed by Attorney David), David informed Bah that the case already had been transferred to New York and that Jobe would be contacted when the court set a new hearing date. The case never was transferred. Neither Jobe nor David attended the May 22 hearing, and Jobe was ordered deported in absentia. In his brief, Jobe suggests that he only learned that he had been ordered deported in absentia when he received a December 4, 1996 notice from the INS denying his application to renew his employment authorization. At that time, the 180-day statutory window for seeking rescission on the basis of exceptional circumstances - a statutory window of which Jobe had been advised in the OSC - had closed, but only by a couple of weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, Jobe failed to take any action until February 11, 1997, when, acting through new counsel, he moved to reopen and stay the deportation proceedings. Insofar as is here relevant, he argued that his failure to appear was the result of \"exceptional circumstances\" -i.e., ineffective assistance of counsel<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> -- and that his deportation order thus should be rescinded. See INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A), codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> (permitting the rescission of an in absentia deportation order \"only . . . upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (f)(2) of this section)\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> On February 12, 1997, an IJ denied the motion as untimely, noting that it was brought well outside the 180-day window provided in the statute. On March 10, 1997, Jobe appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. He argued that the IJ erred in denying his motion to reopen because his failure to file the motion within the 180-day statutory period was caused by the same ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to miss his deportation hearing in the first instance. On December 15, 1998, the BIA dismissed Jobe's appeal because Jobe was \"statutorily barred [by the 180-day statutory window] from rescinding the deportation order on the basis of exceptional circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jobe then petitioned us to review the BIA's order. In his brief, Jobe argued that the BIA violated his due process rights by applying the 180-day statutory period in circumstances where the same ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to miss his hearing also caused him to miss the deadline for filing his motion to reopen. A divided panel of this court granted the petition. The majority construed Jobe's brief as setting forth an argument that the 180-day time period prescribed in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A) is subject to equitable tolling, and, after noting that the issue has split the circuits,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> agreed with Jobe's argument on the merits. The majority also determined that Jobe's submissions were sufficient to warrant further inquiry, at the agency level, into whether the statute should be equitably tolled in the circumstances of this case. The dissent argued, inter alia, that the majority should not have decided whether the statute is subject to equitable tolling because, even if it were, Jobe had failed to establish possible entitlement to equitable relief. Thereafter, the INS sought and was granted rehearing en banc, and the panel opinion was withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its petition for rehearing en banc, the INS makes a powerful argument that INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A) should be regarded as mandatory and jurisdictional and thus not subject to equitable tolling -an argument that is skillfully countered not only by our dissenting brothers, but also by the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, which filed a well argued amicus brief on behalf of itself and the following interested parties: the Political Asylum Immigration Representation Project; Greater Boston Legal Services; the International Institute of Boston; the Community Legal Services and Counseling Center; the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic; the Boston College Immigration and Asylum Project; the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild; and the American Immigration Lawyers Association. We appreciate the importance of the issue and the effort that has been expended in framing it for us in a most helpful way. But because Jobe has not made a prima facie showing of entitlement to equitable tolling or otherwise convinced us that application of INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A)'s time limit violates his due process rights on the facts of this case, we dismiss the petition without deciding whether the equitable tolling doctrine may apply to this statutory provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when it applies, equitable tolling is a \"sparingly\" invoked doctrine. Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990). We have identified five factors that should guide courts in evaluating a claimant's entitlement to such tolling: (1) a lack of actual notice of a time limit; (2) a lack of constructive notice of a time limit; (3) diligence in the pursuit of one's rights; (4) an absence of prejudice to a party opponent; and (5) the claimant's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the time limit. See Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 61 (1st Cir. 1998) (deciding whether to toll the running of a statute of limitations) (citing Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 861 F.2d 746, 752 (1st Cir. 1988)). The fundamental principle is that equitable tolling \"is appropriate only when the circumstances that cause a [party] to miss a filing deadline are out of his hands.\" Salois v. Dime Savings Bank, 128 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, \"[e]quitable tolling is unavailable where a party fails to exercise due diligence.\" Benitez-Pons, 136 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the evidence submitted by Jobe in support of his equitable tolling argument<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> undermines his claim to have been sufficiently diligent to warrant an equitable tolling of the statute. In paragraph 4 of his August 4, 1997 affidavit, Bah largely corroborates the allegation which is at the heart of Jobe's claim that attorney dereliction caused him to miss the May 22, 1996 deportation hearing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attorney David promised to transfer the case to New York. Attorney David told me that he had written for the case to be transferred from Boston to New York. I believed him and told [petitioner] to disregard the hearing date scheduled for Boston. I told [petitioner] that Immigration will inform him of his new Court date in New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But then, in paragraph 5 of the same affidavit, Bah states: \"The next letter addressed to Sulay Jobe was a ruling from the Immigration Court that was done in Sulay's absence. I advised Sulay of this letter and told him to see an Attorney immediately.\" (Emphasis added.). Moreover, in his September 11, 1997 sworn \"correction\" to his August 4 affidavit, Bah makes clear two crucial facts: (1) the notice of the IJ's in absentia deportation order was in Bah's hands within a month of the IJ's ruling;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and (2) Bah \"immediately\" told Jobe about the arrival of the notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even if we assume that \"exceptional circumstances\" caused Jobe to miss his hearing, and even if we credit the unsworn statement in Jobe's brief which suggests that Jobe did not actually ascertain that he had been ordered deported until December 1996, we are left with Bah's two uncontradicted sworn statements, put in the record by Jobe himself, which combine to establish that, in May or June of 1996, several months before the expiration of the 180-day time period set forth in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A), Jobe learned that an IJ had taken some action on his asylum application and was advised to consult an attorney immediately. Despite this knowledge and advice, Jobe took no action to protect his rights for more than half a year. In our view, this fact conclusively establishes that Jobe was insufficiently diligent in pursuing his asylum application to warrant the provision of any equitable relief that might be available under the statute. So too does this fact fatally undermine the premise of the as-applied due process argument Jobe presses in his appellate brief: that his counsel's ineffectiveness was the cause of his failure to file a timely motion to reopen his deportation proceedings and rescind the deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we do not decide whether the equitable tolling doctrine applies to INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A) but rather dismiss Jobe's petition because he is not factually entitled to equitable tolling and because application of the statute in these circumstances does not deprive him of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (1996), which redesignated former INA &#167; 241 as &#167; 237, transferred it to a different section of the United States Code, and otherwise brought significant changes to the country's immigration laws. But because petitioner was in deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997 (IIRIRA's \"Title III-A effective date\") and had his final order of deportation entered more than 30 days thereafter, he is subject only to the IIRIRA's so-called \"transitional rules.\" See IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1),(4) (as amended) (\"transitional rules\"). And under the transitional rules, the IIRIRA's permanent new rules do not apply unless a case meets one of the enumerated exceptions set forth in IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4). All agree that none of these exceptions applies to this case. Thus, we evaluate Jobe's petition under the \"old rules,\" such as INA &#167; 241(a)(1)(B), even though they have since been repealed or redesignated.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The OSC also advised Jobe of his entitlement to file a motion to reopen an in absentia deportation order</p>\n        <p>at any time if [the alien] can show that [he] did not receive written notice of [the hearing on the OSC] and [he] had provided [his] address and telephone number (and any changes of [his] address and telephone number) as required . . . and did not appear at [his] hearing through no fault of [his] own.</p>\n        <p>In the administrative proceedings, Jobe claimed that he received inadequate notice of the hearing on his OSC, but he has abandoned that claim in this court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because deportation proceedings are civil, the Sixth Amendment guarantee of effective counsel in criminal proceedings is inapplicable.

The exact date of Jobe's arrest is not in the record, but Jobe's March 10, 1997 appeal to the BIA quite clearly indicates that Jobe was detained at that time. It is thus evident that Bah received the notice well before the May-June 1997 time-frame referenced in the sworn correction.</p>\n        <p>Second, throughout these proceedings, there never has been any suggestion that the notice of deportation was lost in the mail for nearly a year and arrived at a time when the BIA already had under advisement Jobe's appeal of the denial of the motion to reopen. Indeed, there never has been a suggestion that the arrival of the notice was in any way untimely, as there surely would have been had that in fact been the case. Thus, already knowing (as we do) that (1) Bah's sworn correction is mistaken insofar as it refers to May-June 1997; and (2) notice of a ruling handed down in Boston on May 22, 1996 is likely to reach New York by mail sometime around May-June 1996, the logical inference is that Bah (who swore out the correction in September 1997) inadvertently substituted \"1997\" for the intended \"1996.\"</p>\n        <p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, Jobe bears the burden of making a prima facie showing of entitlement to equitable tolling, and therefore of filling in any gaps in the record regarding whether his is a case warranting equitable relief. On this point, we regard it as particularly telling that Jobe has failed throughout these proceedings to offer any explanation for the discrepancy between the date of the in absentia deportation order and the dates referenced in Bah's sworn correction to his affidavit, even in the face of (1) our request that he address his factual entitlement to equitable tolling in our solicitation of supplemental briefs following the granting of the petition for rehearing en banc; and (2) the dissent from the now-withdrawn panel opinion, which argued that Bah's sworn correction obviously substituted \"1997\" for the intended \"1996.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, with whom LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, joins (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent for two reasons. First, I do not think there is a sufficient basis to find that Jobe had notice of the IJ decision to deport him in absentia well before the expiration of the 180-day time period set forth in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A). Second, even if Jobe received such notice, that fact alone does not establish that the running of the 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should not be equitably tolled. The majority says Jobe was insufficiently diligent in pursuit of his rights. That diligence analysis requires consideration of other factors, particularly Jobe's alleged reliance on an attorney who may have represented him ineffectively. Without further fact-finding, we cannot know the circumstances surrounding Jobe's untimely motion to reopen, and so cannot fairly dispose of his case. Regrettably, the majority does the fact-finding here. That is not a proper appellate function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority finds \"that in May or June of 1996, several months before the expiration of the 180-day time period set forth in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A), Jobe learned that an IJ had taken some action on his asylum application and was advised to consult an attorney immediately. Despite this knowledge and advice, Jobe took no action to protect his rights for more than half a year.\" I do not think the majority's reasoning withstands scrutiny. It depends in large part upon the interpretation of two affidavits of a presumed friend of Jobe, Sulayman Bah. The first affidavit is dated 4/August/1997. There are no dates in the body of the affidavit. It states as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>AFFIDAVIT OF SULAYMAN BAH</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I, SULAYMAN BAH, having been duly sworn upon oath, do hereby depose and say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. My name is Sulayman Bah and I live at 933 E. 224th Street, #1A, Bronx, New York 10466.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. I served as a mediator between Sulay Jobe and Attorney Earl David.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Sulay Jobe asked me if I knew of any New York Attorneys because attorneys in Rhode Island are extremely expensive. I introduced Sulay Jobe to Earl David. Attorney David charged Sulay Jobe $600.00 for his legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Attorney David promised to transfer the case to New York. Attorney David told me that he had written for the case to be transferred from Boston to New York. I believed him and told Sulay Jobe to disregard the hearing date scheduled for Boston. I told Sulay Jobe that Immigration will inform him of his new Court date in New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The next letter addressed to Sulay Jobe was a ruling from the Immigration Court that was done in Sulay's absence. I advised Sulay of this letter and told him to see an Attorney immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. I found out shortly thereafter that Sulay had been arrested by Immigration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second affidavit is to \"correct the record in the matter of Sulay Jobe.\" It was executed on September 11, 1997. It states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I, Sulaman Bah, being duly sworn, deposes and states the following under penalty of perjury: I would like to correct the record in the matter of Sulay Jobe. I told Mr. Jobe to disregard the hearing date since I was told by Mr. David that he wrote a letter to transfer the file. When the notice of decision came to the New York address, on or about May - June, 1997, I received the notice of decision from the Court at 933 E. 224th Street, Bronx, NY 10466. I immediately contacted Mr. Jobe regarding this notice. I then left the country and later on heard that Mr. Jobe was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">X__________/s/Sulaman Bah</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Sulaman Bah</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority makes the rather remarkable finding: \"It is clear from context, however, that Bah intended to state that the notice of decision arrived in May - June 1996.\" Majority Op. at 100-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This affidavit was given \"to correct the record in the matter of Sulay Jobe.\" How do we know that Bah intended to state that the notice of decision arrived in May-June 1996? The only dates given in his affidavit are \"on or about May-June 1997.\" How can the majority be so sure that the dates Bah gave in his corrected affidavit were wrong? We know nothing about Bah except what he states in his affidavits. His deposition was not taken. We have no way of judging either his credibility or competence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dates of the receipt of the notice found by the majority must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. The court attempts to meet this burden by stating</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, already knowing (as we do) that (1) Bah's sworn correction is mistaken insofar as it refers to May-June 1997; and (2) notice of a ruling handed down in Boston on May 22, 1996 is likely to reach New York by mail sometime around May-June 1996, the logical inference is that Bah (who swore out the correction in September 1997) inadvertently substituted \"1997\" for the intended \"1996.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Majority Op. at 101. But we do not know in the true sense of the word anything but what is stated in the affidavit. Bah may have been mistaken about the dates he stated in the affidavit but we do not know that he was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems significant that the only substantive difference between Bah's first and second affidavit is the inclusion of dates. If the affidavit was amended to clarify the timing of events, which seems to have been the intent, this makes it more likely that the May-June 1997 date is correct. If providing a date was the purpose of the amendment, we can presume that particular attention was given to the accuracy of the reported date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It should also be noted that Bah's second affidavit states that he received notice of the decision at 933 E. 224th Street, Bronx, NY 10466. His first affidavit confirms this address, but includes an apartment number, #1A. Attorney David's venue change request states that Jobe lived at the New York address, but at apartment #1. We do not know whether the correct address was the one with apartment #1, the one with apartment #1A, or the one without any apartment number. It is, at least, possible that these variant addresses might have affected the date Bah received the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also states: \"Indeed there never has been a suggestion that the arrival of the notice was in any way untimely, as these surely would have been had that in fact been the case.\" Majority Op. at 101. This, of course, ignores that there is only one date given in Bah's two affidavits. The second affidavit states that \"the notice of decision came to the New York address, on or about May-June 1997.\" The decision of the court assumes that there is always an orderly and logical sequence to a chain of events. Such a belief is natural to judicial thinking and analysis. But as Justice Holmes pointed out: \"The life of the law is not logic but experience.\" And experience teaches that many things happen that cannot be explained by logical analysis. There are at least three explanations that might account for the dates mentioned in Bah's affidavits: a late mailing by the INS, a late delivery by the post office, or a delivery to a wrong address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not think that the affidavits can or should be used for finding, as the court does, that \"Jobe took no action to protect his rights for more than half a year.\" Majority Op. at 101. It constitutes appellate findings of facts based on inferences and unsubstantiated assumptions. The only way to determine the facts in this case is to have a hearing before the Immigration Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the uncertainty about the date on which Jobe received notice of the IJ's decision, the facts here do not establish Jobe's ineligibility for equitable tolling. The majority relies exclusively upon one \"fact,\" based on one of Bah's affidavits, to conclude that Jobe was insufficiently diligent in pursuing his asylum application, and hence he would not be entitled to equitable relief. That one fact is Bah's assertion that he advised Jobe of the IJ's decision immediately after he received it and told Jobe to see an attorney. But that one fact does not exhaust the reasonable diligence inquiry when the record strongly suggests Jobe's dependence on others to protect his rights, including an attorney who may have been consistently ineffective in protecting Jobe's rights prior to the May 22, 1996 hearing, and subsequent to the issuance of the in absentia deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the time his hearing before the IJ was scheduled, Jobe relied upon his friend Bah, as well as Attorney David, for guidance in his immigration proceedings. Jobe states in his affidavit (drafted by a translator fluent in both English and Jobe's native Wolof), \"I do not read, write or speak the English language.\" Jobe sought the assistance of Bah in obtaining counsel, and the two of them met with Attorney David in New York with Bah acting as translator. The nature of the attorney-client relationship established at their initial meeting is unclear. Jobe's affidavit suggests his understanding that David would represent him in his asylum claim generally: \"I retained Attorney Earl S. David to represent me in my asylum proceedings.\" This understanding would have been reasonable, based on the fact that David represented Bah in the immigration proceedings resulting in his successful asylum claim. Guided by Bah, Jobe would likely seek the same service from David. Nevertheless, David's letter of justification to the Board of Immigration Appeals defending himself against charges of ineffective assistance of counsel suggests that he was retained exclusively to obtain a change of venue for Jobe's asylum hearing, a seemingly minimal task for the $600 fee that Bah says David received. Thus, at the beginning of the attorney-client relationship, there may have been miscommunications between Jobe and David.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Bah's assistance, Jobe requested that David obtain a transfer of his Boston-based immigration court hearing to his new home, New York. As he recalls, \"Attorney David told me that he would be transferring his case to New York.\" Bah corroborates this account, while David denies it, saying that \"[u]nder no circumstances did I promise to transfer the file as the power to do so arises from the government, not this office.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the May 22nd hearing date, Jobe says he again contacted David, through Bah, to say he would be unable to make the Boston court appearance due to a back injury. According to Jobe, \"Attorney David told [Bah] that [the] case had already been transferred to New York and that a new hearing date would be set,\" a communication that David again claims never happened. Indeed, David says he told Jobe through Bah that he would have to attend the hearing on May 22, 1996 in Boston regardless of the outcome of the change of venue request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reality, David's request for a change of venue, submitted on April 12, 1996 with no supporting evidence or affidavits, was never adequate to win a transfer. A change of venue request may be granted by an IJ for \"good cause.\" 8 C.F.R. 3.20. In seeking a change of venue, \"the mere fact that an applicant allegedly resides . . . in another city, without a showing of other significant factors associated with such residence, is insufficient.\" Matter of Rahman, 20 I &amp; N Dec. 480 (BIA 1992). Yet that residence in another city is all David offered to the IJ to support the change of venue request. Furthermore, it is difficult to credit David's insistence that he told Jobe he had to appear in Boston on May 22 under any circumstances, ready, apparently, to represent himself, after Jobe had retained David to represent him in his asylum proceedings. Jobe hired David because he could not effectively represent himself. Yet Attorney David did not attend the May 22nd sitting in Boston. Moreover, if David was so sure that the May 22 hearing would take place, and he told Jobe to be there without David's representation, did he give Jobe any advice on what he had to do to protect his interests? Apparently not. David says he just told Jobe to be there, an ineffective contribution even on David's version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David characterizes the events surrounding the transfer request and missed hearing as \"an unfortunate miscommunication.\" Indeed, it was an unfortunate miscommunication, depriving Jobe of the opportunity to present his asylum claim and resulting in the issuance of an in absentia deportation order. It was also another miscommunication that seemed to plague the David-Jobe attorney-client relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not know from this record what Jobe understood about the information given to him by Bah concerning the decision of the IJ after Jobe failed to appear in Boston on May 22. In his affidavits, Bah only indicates that he \"contacted Mr. Jobe regarding this notice,\" and states his impression that \"a ruling from the Immigration Court . . . was done in Sulay's absence.\" Bah does not say that he told Jobe of his imminent deportation. In addition, it is not clear from the record that Jobe ever took possession of the correspondence. The best evidence that Jobe did not understand the effect of the order is that he sought out the Immigration Office in December regarding his employment authorization, a risk an immigrant would be unlikely to take if he understood his deportation was imminent. If Jobe did not actually receive notice of the IJ's in absentia decision, he then learned of his deportation status only on December 4, 1996 when he sought employment. The timespan between this notification and the February 11, 1997 filing of motions to reopen and to stay deportation cannot be characterized as a failure to take action, as the majority suggests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, having advised Jobe \"to see an Attorney immediately,\" Bah, Jobe's only liaison to his attorney, leaves the country. As noted, Jobe states in his affidavit that he was relying on Attorney David to represent him in his asylum proceedings. David apparently had a more limited view of his obligation to Jobe, possibly leaving Jobe to rely on an attorney who felt no obligation to help him even after the issuance of the in absentia deportation order. There is some evidence that David himself learned of the deportation order. He writes that, apparently after issuance of the IJ decision: \"I tried to reach my client by mail and by the number I had in my file but it was to no avail.\" While David had failed to file a EOIR-28 \"Notice of Entry of Appearance\" form with the INS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> another suggestion of ineffective representation, the fact that David's address appears prominently on the request for change of venue may have been enough for him to be listed as the attorney of record in Jobe's immigration court proceedings. If David did know of the in absentia deportation order, there is no evidence that he made any effort to file a motion to reopen in a timely fashion, despite his apparent awareness that an \"unfortunate miscommunication\" between himself and Jobe contributed to Jobe's failure to appear in Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without clarification of David's obligation to protect Jobe after the issuance of the in absentia deportation order, and David's apparent inaction despite any such obligation, a real issue of ongoing ineffective assistance during this critical period exists, which would further account for Jobe's delay in seeking relief from the in absentia deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, without the support of Bah to comprehend the English language, and perhaps without the support of a reliable attorney who Jobe thought was protecting his interests, it may have been difficult for Jobe to understand his peril and to press his claim more diligently. Yet the majority sees no relationship between these facts and the equitable tolling doctrine. Whether a party is reasonably diligent in ascertaining their claim is a matter of fact. See Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank, 128 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir. 1997). In this case, there has been no fact-finding on the diligence issue because the BIA concluded that the 180-day time limit was not subject to equitable tolling. As a legal proposition, that conclusion is wrong. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999). Equitable tolling does apply to the 180-day time limit. There is conflicting and inadequate evidence as to Jobe's notice of the IJ decision, his capacity to pursue a timely motion to reopen, and the burdens imposed by ongoing ineffective assistance of counsel. There has been no chance for Jobe to make a showing as to his diligence, and the case should not be disposed of on the basis of one fact which, upon fair examination, may show little about Jobe's reasonable diligence in pursuing his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think it important to focus on the situation that led to this case. Jobe was a native and citizen of Gambia where he had been employed as a chauffeur for a deposed president's Minister of Education and Agriculture. According to the record, Jobe claimed that he had reason to fear that he would be hurt and/or killed if he were to return to Gambia. Jobe overstayed his visa and though he was undetected by the INS, he presented himself and sought political asylum. When the INS received this request, they denied the request for political asylum and put him into deportation proceedings. The INS issued an Order to Show Cause and told him that he could request political asylum at his deportation hearing. We know the rest: he failed to appear at his May 22 hearing and was ordered deported. Therefore he never had the opportunity to request political asylum at a deportation hearing; his ultimate goal when he presented himself before the INS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not think it fair or just to deport an individual and put his life in danger on the basis of appellate fact-finding. We should rule, as the panel did originally, that the 180-day time limit for reopening is subject to equitable tolling, that ineffective assistance of counsel may provide a basis for the application of the equitable tolling doctrine, and that there should be a hearing by the IJ to determine whether the running of the 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled on the facts of this case. If so, there should be a hearing on Jobe's motion to reopen, giving him an opportunity to make the case that he should be given a new hearing on his asylum application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We do not even know that the same person made out both affidavits.

More than eight months later, Jobe filed a motion to reopen asking that his deportation order be rescinded. In support of the motion, Jobe alleged that ineffective assistance of counsel had caused him to miss the deportation hearing. An immigration judge (\"IJ\") denied the motion as untimely because, by statute, such motions must be filed within 180 days of the deportation order. Jobe appealed, contending that the same attorney incompetence that caused him to miss his hearing also caused him to miss the deadline for filing his motion to reopen. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") dismissed the appeal. Jobe then sought review of the BIA's decision in this court. On May 24, 2000, a divided panel vacated the BIA's order and remanded for a hearing to determine whether the running of the 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled on the facts of this case. Thereafter, respondent Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") petitioned for and was granted en banc review of the panel's holding. We simultaneously withdrew the panel opinion. We now dismiss Jobe's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1994, Jobe, a native and citizen of Gambia, entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for business. He was authorized to remain in the United States until July 18, 1994, but remained beyond that date without authorization from the INS. On September 9, 1994, Jobe contacted the INS and filed an application for political asylum. On February 6, 1996, the INS informed Jobe that his application had been denied and his case referred to an IJ for a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 1996, the INS served Jobe with an order to show cause (\"OSC\"), which charged him with remaining in the United States longer than permitted, in violation of &#167; 241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> A hearing on the OSC was scheduled in Boston on May 22, 1996. The OSC specifically advised Jobe that, if he failed to appear for his hearing and his deportability were established, he would be deported in absentia. The OSC also advised Jobe that, if were deported in absentia, he could not have the order rescinded except that he \"may file a motion to reopen the hearing within 180 days after the date of the [deportation] order if [the alien is] able to show that [his] failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In March or early April of 1996, Jobe moved to New York City to live with his friend, Sulayman Bah. Jobe does not write or speak English, and thus used Bah as an intermediary to retain attorney Earl S. David to represent him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crucial facts of this case, which we derive from Jobe's own submissions during the administrative proceedings, are as follows. On April 12, 1996, Attorney David wrote to the Immigration Court in Boston, requesting a change in venue to New York because Jobe now lived there. Subsequently, Jobe, again using Bah as an intermediary, contacted Attorney David to inform him that he would be unable to attend the May 22 hearing because of a back injury. According to affidavits submitted by Bah and Jobe (and disputed by Attorney David), David informed Bah that the case already had been transferred to New York and that Jobe would be contacted when the court set a new hearing date. The case never was transferred. Neither Jobe nor David attended the May 22 hearing, and Jobe was ordered deported in absentia. In his brief, Jobe suggests that he only learned that he had been ordered deported in absentia when he received a December 4, 1996 notice from the INS denying his application to renew his employment authorization. At that time, the 180-day statutory window for seeking rescission on the basis of exceptional circumstances - a statutory window of which Jobe had been advised in the OSC - had closed, but only by a couple of weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, Jobe failed to take any action until February 11, 1997, when, acting through new counsel, he moved to reopen and stay the deportation proceedings. Insofar as is here relevant, he argued that his failure to appear was the result of \"exceptional circumstances\" -i.e., ineffective assistance of counsel<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> -- and that his deportation order thus should be rescinded. See INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A), codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> (permitting the rescission of an in absentia deportation order \"only . . . upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (f)(2) of this section)\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> On February 12, 1997, an IJ denied the motion as untimely, noting that it was brought well outside the 180-day window provided in the statute. On March 10, 1997, Jobe appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. He argued that the IJ erred in denying his motion to reopen because his failure to file the motion within the 180-day statutory period was caused by the same ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to miss his deportation hearing in the first instance. On December 15, 1998, the BIA dismissed Jobe's appeal because Jobe was \"statutorily barred [by the 180-day statutory window] from rescinding the deportation order on the basis of exceptional circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jobe then petitioned us to review the BIA's order. In his brief, Jobe argued that the BIA violated his due process rights by applying the 180-day statutory period in circumstances where the same ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to miss his hearing also caused him to miss the deadline for filing his motion to reopen. A divided panel of this court granted the petition. The majority construed Jobe's brief as setting forth an argument that the 180-day time period prescribed in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A) is subject to equitable tolling, and, after noting that the issue has split the circuits,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> agreed with Jobe's argument on the merits. The majority also determined that Jobe's submissions were sufficient to warrant further inquiry, at the agency level, into whether the statute should be equitably tolled in the circumstances of this case. The dissent argued, inter alia, that the majority should not have decided whether the statute is subject to equitable tolling because, even if it were, Jobe had failed to establish possible entitlement to equitable relief. Thereafter, the INS sought and was granted rehearing en banc, and the panel opinion was withdrawn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its petition for rehearing en banc, the INS makes a powerful argument that INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A) should be regarded as mandatory and jurisdictional and thus not subject to equitable tolling -an argument that is skillfully countered not only by our dissenting brothers, but also by the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, which filed a well argued amicus brief on behalf of itself and the following interested parties: the Political Asylum Immigration Representation Project; Greater Boston Legal Services; the International Institute of Boston; the Community Legal Services and Counseling Center; the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic; the Boston College Immigration and Asylum Project; the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild; and the American Immigration Lawyers Association. We appreciate the importance of the issue and the effort that has been expended in framing it for us in a most helpful way. But because Jobe has not made a prima facie showing of entitlement to equitable tolling or otherwise convinced us that application of INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A)'s time limit violates his due process rights on the facts of this case, we dismiss the petition without deciding whether the equitable tolling doctrine may apply to this statutory provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when it applies, equitable tolling is a \"sparingly\" invoked doctrine.

We have identified five factors that should guide courts in evaluating a claimant's entitlement to such tolling: (1) a lack of actual notice of a time limit; (2) a lack of constructive notice of a time limit; (3) diligence in the pursuit of one's rights; (4) an absence of prejudice to a party opponent; and (5) the claimant's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the time limit.

The fundamental principle is that equitable tolling \"is appropriate only when the circumstances that cause a [party] to miss a filing deadline are out of his hands.\" Salois v. Dime Savings Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197626\"><a href=\"/opinion/197626/salois-v-the-dime/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, \"[e]quitable tolling is unavailable where a party fails to exercise due diligence.\" Benitez-Pons, 136 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the evidence submitted by Jobe in support of his equitable tolling argument<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> undermines his claim to have been sufficiently diligent to warrant an equitable tolling of the statute. In paragraph 4 of his August 4, 1997 affidavit, Bah largely corroborates the allegation which is at the heart of Jobe's claim that attorney dereliction caused him to miss the May 22, 1996 deportation hearing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attorney David promised to transfer the case to New York. Attorney David told me that he had written for the case to be transferred from Boston to New York. I believed him and told [petitioner] to disregard the hearing date scheduled for Boston. I told [petitioner] that Immigration will inform him of his new Court date in New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But then, in paragraph 5 of the same affidavit, Bah states: \"The next letter addressed to Sulay Jobe was a ruling from the Immigration Court that was done in Sulay's absence. I advised Sulay of this letter and told him to see an Attorney immediately.\" (Emphasis added.). Moreover, in his September 11, 1997 sworn \"correction\" to his August 4 affidavit, Bah makes clear two crucial facts: (1) the notice of the IJ's in absentia deportation order was in Bah's hands within a month of the IJ's ruling;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and (2) Bah \"immediately\" told Jobe about the arrival of the notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even if we assume that \"exceptional circumstances\" caused Jobe to miss his hearing, and even if we credit the unsworn statement in Jobe's brief which suggests that Jobe did not actually ascertain that he had been ordered deported until December 1996, we are left with Bah's two uncontradicted sworn statements, put in the record by Jobe himself, which combine to establish that, in May or June of 1996, several months before the expiration of the 180-day time period set forth in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A), Jobe learned that an IJ had taken some action on his asylum application and was advised to consult an attorney immediately. Despite this knowledge and advice, Jobe took no action to protect his rights for more than half a year. In our view, this fact conclusively establishes that Jobe was insufficiently diligent in pursuing his asylum application to warrant the provision of any equitable relief that might be available under the statute. So too does this fact fatally undermine the premise of the as-applied due process argument Jobe presses in his appellate brief: that his counsel's ineffectiveness was the cause of his failure to file a timely motion to reopen his deportation proceedings and rescind the deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we do not decide whether the equitable tolling doctrine applies to INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A) but rather dismiss Jobe's petition because he is not factually entitled to equitable tolling and because application of the statute in these circumstances does not deprive him of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (1996), which redesignated former INA &#167; 241 as &#167; 237, transferred it to a different section of the United States Code, and otherwise brought significant changes to the country's immigration laws. But because petitioner was in deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997 (IIRIRA's \"Title III-A effective date\") and had his final order of deportation entered more than 30 days thereafter, he is subject only to the IIRIRA's so-called \"transitional rules.\" See IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(1),(4) (as amended) (\"transitional rules\"). And under the transitional rules, the IIRIRA's permanent new rules do not apply unless a case meets one of the enumerated exceptions set forth in IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4). All agree that none of these exceptions applies to this case. Thus, we evaluate Jobe's petition under the \"old rules,\" such as INA &#167; 241(a)(1)(B), even though they have since been repealed or redesignated.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The OSC also advised Jobe of his entitlement to file a motion to reopen an in absentia deportation order</p>\n        <p>at any time if [the alien] can show that [he] did not receive written notice of [the hearing on the OSC] and [he] had provided [his] address and telephone number (and any changes of [his] address and telephone number) as required . . . and did not appear at [his] hearing through no fault of [his] own.</p>\n        <p>In the administrative proceedings, Jobe claimed that he received inadequate notice of the hearing on his OSC, but he has abandoned that claim in this court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because deportation proceedings are civil, the Sixth Amendment guarantee of effective counsel in criminal proceedings is inapplicable.

The exact date of Jobe's arrest is not in the record, but Jobe's March 10, 1997 appeal to the BIA quite clearly indicates that Jobe was detained at that time. It is thus evident that Bah received the notice well before the May-June 1997 time-frame referenced in the sworn correction.</p>\n        <p>Second, throughout these proceedings, there never has been any suggestion that the notice of deportation was lost in the mail for nearly a year and arrived at a time when the BIA already had under advisement Jobe's appeal of the denial of the motion to reopen. Indeed, there never has been a suggestion that the arrival of the notice was in any way untimely, as there surely would have been had that in fact been the case. Thus, already knowing (as we do) that (1) Bah's sworn correction is mistaken insofar as it refers to May-June 1997; and (2) notice of a ruling handed down in Boston on May 22, 1996 is likely to reach New York by mail sometime around May-June 1996, the logical inference is that Bah (who swore out the correction in September 1997) inadvertently substituted \"1997\" for the intended \"1996.\"</p>\n        <p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, Jobe bears the burden of making a prima facie showing of entitlement to equitable tolling, and therefore of filling in any gaps in the record regarding whether his is a case warranting equitable relief. On this point, we regard it as particularly telling that Jobe has failed throughout these proceedings to offer any explanation for the discrepancy between the date of the in absentia deportation order and the dates referenced in Bah's sworn correction to his affidavit, even in the face of (1) our request that he address his factual entitlement to equitable tolling in our solicitation of supplemental briefs following the granting of the petition for rehearing en banc; and (2) the dissent from the now-withdrawn panel opinion, which argued that Bah's sworn correction obviously substituted \"1997\" for the intended \"1996.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, with whom LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, joins (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent for two reasons. First, I do not think there is a sufficient basis to find that Jobe had notice of the IJ decision to deport him in absentia well before the expiration of the 180-day time period set forth in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A). Second, even if Jobe received such notice, that fact alone does not establish that the running of the 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should not be equitably tolled. The majority says Jobe was insufficiently diligent in pursuit of his rights. That diligence analysis requires consideration of other factors, particularly Jobe's alleged reliance on an attorney who may have represented him ineffectively. Without further fact-finding, we cannot know the circumstances surrounding Jobe's untimely motion to reopen, and so cannot fairly dispose of his case. Regrettably, the majority does the fact-finding here. That is not a proper appellate function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority finds \"that in May or June of 1996, several months before the expiration of the 180-day time period set forth in INA &#167; 242B(c)(3)(A), Jobe learned that an IJ had taken some action on his asylum application and was advised to consult an attorney immediately. Despite this knowledge and advice, Jobe took no action to protect his rights for more than half a year.\" I do not think the majority's reasoning withstands scrutiny. It depends in large part upon the interpretation of two affidavits of a presumed friend of Jobe, Sulayman Bah. The first affidavit is dated 4/August/1997. There are no dates in the body of the affidavit. It states as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>AFFIDAVIT OF SULAYMAN BAH</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I, SULAYMAN BAH, having been duly sworn upon oath, do hereby depose and say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The only dates given in his affidavit are \"on or about May-June 1997.\" How can the majority be so sure that the dates Bah gave in his corrected affidavit were wrong? We know nothing about Bah except what he states in his affidavits. His deposition was not taken. We have no way of judging either his credibility or competence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dates of the receipt of the notice found by the majority must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. The court attempts to meet this burden by stating</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, already knowing (as we do) that (1) Bah's sworn correction is mistaken insofar as it refers to May-June 1997; and (2) notice of a ruling handed down in Boston on May 22, 1996 is likely to reach New York by mail sometime around May-June 1996, the logical inference is that Bah (who swore out the correction in September 1997) inadvertently substituted \"1997\" for the intended \"1996.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Majority Op. at 101. But we do not know in the true sense of the word anything but what is stated in the affidavit. Bah may have been mistaken about the dates he stated in the affidavit but we do not know that he was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems significant that the only substantive difference between Bah's first and second affidavit is the inclusion of dates. If the affidavit was amended to clarify the timing of events, which seems to have been the intent, this makes it more likely that the May-June 1997 date is correct. If providing a date was the purpose of the amendment, we can presume that particular attention was given to the accuracy of the reported date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It should also be noted that Bah's second affidavit states that he received notice of the decision at 933 E. 224th Street, Bronx, NY 10466. His first affidavit confirms this address, but includes an apartment number, #1A. Attorney David's venue change request states that Jobe lived at the New York address, but at apartment #1. We do not know whether the correct address was the one with apartment #1, the one with apartment #1A, or the one without any apartment number. It is, at least, possible that these variant addresses might have affected the date Bah received the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also states: \"Indeed there never has been a suggestion that the arrival of the notice was in any way untimely, as these surely would have been had that in fact been the case.\" Majority Op. at 101. This, of course, ignores that there is only one date given in Bah's two affidavits. The second affidavit states that \"the notice of decision came to the New York address, on or about May-June 1997.\" The decision of the court assumes that there is always an orderly and logical sequence to a chain of events. Such a belief is natural to judicial thinking and analysis. But as Justice Holmes pointed out: \"The life of the law is not logic but experience.\" And experience teaches that many things happen that cannot be explained by logical analysis. There are at least three explanations that might account for the dates mentioned in Bah's affidavits: a late mailing by the INS, a late delivery by the post office, or a delivery to a wrong address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not think that the affidavits can or should be used for finding, as the court does, that \"Jobe took no action to protect his rights for more than half a year.\" Majority Op. at 101. It constitutes appellate findings of facts based on inferences and unsubstantiated assumptions. The only way to determine the facts in this case is to have a hearing before the Immigration Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the uncertainty about the date on which Jobe received notice of the IJ's decision, the facts here do not establish Jobe's ineligibility for equitable tolling. The majority relies exclusively upon one \"fact,\" based on one of Bah's affidavits, to conclude that Jobe was insufficiently diligent in pursuing his asylum application, and hence he would not be entitled to equitable relief. That one fact is Bah's assertion that he advised Jobe of the IJ's decision immediately after he received it and told Jobe to see an attorney. But that one fact does not exhaust the reasonable diligence inquiry when the record strongly suggests Jobe's dependence on others to protect his rights, including an attorney who may have been consistently ineffective in protecting Jobe's rights prior to the May 22, 1996 hearing, and subsequent to the issuance of the in absentia deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the time his hearing before the IJ was scheduled, Jobe relied upon his friend Bah, as well as Attorney David, for guidance in his immigration proceedings. Jobe states in his affidavit (drafted by a translator fluent in both English and Jobe's native Wolof), \"I do not read, write or speak the English language.\" Jobe sought the assistance of Bah in obtaining counsel, and the two of them met with Attorney David in New York with Bah acting as translator. The nature of the attorney-client relationship established at their initial meeting is unclear. Jobe's affidavit suggests his understanding that David would represent him in his asylum claim generally: \"I retained Attorney Earl S. David to represent me in my asylum proceedings.\" This understanding would have been reasonable, based on the fact that David represented Bah in the immigration proceedings resulting in his successful asylum claim. Guided by Bah, Jobe would likely seek the same service from David. Nevertheless, David's letter of justification to the Board of Immigration Appeals defending himself against charges of ineffective assistance of counsel suggests that he was retained exclusively to obtain a change of venue for Jobe's asylum hearing, a seemingly minimal task for the $600 fee that Bah says David received. Thus, at the beginning of the attorney-client relationship, there may have been miscommunications between Jobe and David.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With Bah's assistance, Jobe requested that David obtain a transfer of his Boston-based immigration court hearing to his new home, New York. As he recalls, \"Attorney David told me that he would be transferring his case to New York.\" Bah corroborates this account, while David denies it, saying that \"[u]nder no circumstances did I promise to transfer the file as the power to do so arises from the government, not this office.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the May 22nd hearing date, Jobe says he again contacted David, through Bah, to say he would be unable to make the Boston court appearance due to a back injury. According to Jobe, \"Attorney David told [Bah] that [the] case had already been transferred to New York and that a new hearing date would be set,\" a communication that David again claims never happened. Indeed, David says he told Jobe through Bah that he would have to attend the hearing on May 22, 1996 in Boston regardless of the outcome of the change of venue request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reality, David's request for a change of venue, submitted on April 12, 1996 with no supporting evidence or affidavits, was never adequate to win a transfer. A change of venue request may be granted by an IJ for \"good cause.\" 8 C.F.R. 3.20. In seeking a change of venue, \"the mere fact that an applicant allegedly resides . . . in another city, without a showing of other significant factors associated with such residence, is insufficient.\" Matter of Rahman, 20 I &amp; N Dec. 480 (BIA 1992). Yet that residence in another city is all David offered to the IJ to support the change of venue request. Furthermore, it is difficult to credit David's insistence that he told Jobe he had to appear in Boston on May 22 under any circumstances, ready, apparently, to represent himself, after Jobe had retained David to represent him in his asylum proceedings. Jobe hired David because he could not effectively represent himself. Yet Attorney David did not attend the May 22nd sitting in Boston. Moreover, if David was so sure that the May 22 hearing would take place, and he told Jobe to be there without David's representation, did he give Jobe any advice on what he had to do to protect his interests? Apparently not. David says he just told Jobe to be there, an ineffective contribution even on David's version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David characterizes the events surrounding the transfer request and missed hearing as \"an unfortunate miscommunication.\" Indeed, it was an unfortunate miscommunication, depriving Jobe of the opportunity to present his asylum claim and resulting in the issuance of an in absentia deportation order. It was also another miscommunication that seemed to plague the David-Jobe attorney-client relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not know from this record what Jobe understood about the information given to him by Bah concerning the decision of the IJ after Jobe failed to appear in Boston on May 22. In his affidavits, Bah only indicates that he \"contacted Mr. Jobe regarding this notice,\" and states his impression that \"a ruling from the Immigration Court . . . was done in Sulay's absence.\" Bah does not say that he told Jobe of his imminent deportation. In addition, it is not clear from the record that Jobe ever took possession of the correspondence. The best evidence that Jobe did not understand the effect of the order is that he sought out the Immigration Office in December regarding his employment authorization, a risk an immigrant would be unlikely to take if he understood his deportation was imminent. If Jobe did not actually receive notice of the IJ's in absentia decision, he then learned of his deportation status only on December 4, 1996 when he sought employment. The timespan between this notification and the February 11, 1997 filing of motions to reopen and to stay deportation cannot be characterized as a failure to take action, as the majority suggests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, having advised Jobe \"to see an Attorney immediately,\" Bah, Jobe's only liaison to his attorney, leaves the country. As noted, Jobe states in his affidavit that he was relying on Attorney David to represent him in his asylum proceedings. David apparently had a more limited view of his obligation to Jobe, possibly leaving Jobe to rely on an attorney who felt no obligation to help him even after the issuance of the in absentia deportation order. There is some evidence that David himself learned of the deportation order. He writes that, apparently after issuance of the IJ decision: \"I tried to reach my client by mail and by the number I had in my file but it was to no avail.\" While David had failed to file a EOIR-28 \"Notice of Entry of Appearance\" form with the INS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> another suggestion of ineffective representation, the fact that David's address appears prominently on the request for change of venue may have been enough for him to be listed as the attorney of record in Jobe's immigration court proceedings. If David did know of the in absentia deportation order, there is no evidence that he made any effort to file a motion to reopen in a timely fashion, despite his apparent awareness that an \"unfortunate miscommunication\" between himself and Jobe contributed to Jobe's failure to appear in Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without clarification of David's obligation to protect Jobe after the issuance of the in absentia deportation order, and David's apparent inaction despite any such obligation, a real issue of ongoing ineffective assistance during this critical period exists, which would further account for Jobe's delay in seeking relief from the in absentia deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, without the support of Bah to comprehend the English language, and perhaps without the support of a reliable attorney who Jobe thought was protecting his interests, it may have been difficult for Jobe to understand his peril and to press his claim more diligently. Yet the majority sees no relationship between these facts and the equitable tolling doctrine. Whether a party is reasonably diligent in ascertaining their claim is a matter of fact. See Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197626\"><a href=\"/opinion/197626/salois-v-the-dime/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1997). In this case, there has been no fact-finding on the diligence issue because the BIA concluded that the 180-day time limit was not subject to equitable tolling. As a legal proposition, that conclusion is wrong. See Lopez v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765339\"><a href=\"/opinion/765339/ruben-lopez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span>, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999). Equitable tolling does apply to the 180-day time limit. There is conflicting and inadequate evidence as to Jobe's notice of the IJ decision, his capacity to pursue a timely motion to reopen, and the burdens imposed by ongoing ineffective assistance of counsel. There has been no chance for Jobe to make a showing as to his diligence, and the case should not be disposed of on the basis of one fact which, upon fair examination, may show little about Jobe's reasonable diligence in pursuing his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think it important to focus on the situation that led to this case. Jobe was a native and citizen of Gambia where he had been employed as a chauffeur for a deposed president's Minister of Education and Agriculture. According to the record, Jobe claimed that he had reason to fear that he would be hurt and/or killed if he were to return to Gambia. Jobe overstayed his visa and though he was undetected by the INS, he presented himself and sought political asylum. When the INS received this request, they denied the request for political asylum and put him into deportation proceedings. The INS issued an Order to Show Cause and told him that he could request political asylum at his deportation hearing. We know the rest: he failed to appear at his May 22 hearing and was ordered deported. Therefore he never had the opportunity to request political asylum at a deportation hearing; his ultimate goal when he presented himself before the INS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not think it fair or just to deport an individual and put his life in danger on the basis of appellate fact-finding. We should rule, as the panel did originally, that the 180-day time limit for reopening is subject to equitable tolling, that ineffective assistance of counsel may provide a basis for the application of the equitable tolling doctrine, and that there should be a hearing by the IJ to determine whether the running of the 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled on the facts of this case. If so, there should be a hearing on Jobe's motion to reopen, giving him an opportunity to make the case that he should be given a new hearing on his asylum application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We do not even know that the same person made out both affidavits. The name of the affiant in the first affidavit is given as Sulayman Bah; in the second the first name is Sulaman. I do not think it fair to make a finding that results in deportation of an individual by changing dates in a sworn affidavit which may have been executed by two different affiants.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The BIA Practice Manual indicates that an entry of appearance must be filed upon \"the first appearance of an attorney or representative,\" as well as with the filing of an appeal, a motion to reconsider, a motion to reopen, and when there is a change of business address.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
