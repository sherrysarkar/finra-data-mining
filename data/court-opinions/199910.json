Steven\nRowe, Attorney General of Maine, were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                            July 30, 2002\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation\n\f                                AMENDED OPINION\n\n\n           ROSENN,     Senior     Circuit   Judge.   This    appeal    raises\n\nrecurring questions in litigation with agencies of the United\n\nStates   arising     out   of   the   tension   between     the   substantive\n\nprovisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA or the Act), 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552, and the application of the attorney-client and work-\n\nproduct privileges.        In January 2000, the State of Maine (Maine)\n\nsubmitted a series of FOIA requests to the United States Fish and\n\nWildlife Service, a component of the Department of Interior (DOI),\n\nand the National Maritime Fisheries, a component of the Department\n\nof Commerce (DOC)(collectively the Services) for documents relating\n\nto the efforts of the Services to list Atlantic salmon in eight\n\nrivers within Maine under the protection of the Endangered Species\n\nAct (ESA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544.\n\n           The DOI provided Maine with approximately 1400 documents\n\nbut withheld 308 documents, claiming attorney-client or work-\n\nproduct privileges.        Maine filed an action in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Maine to enjoin the Services\n\nfrom improperly withholding those documents.         On cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgments, the district court allowed the DOI to withhold\n\na number of documents but ordered that 197 documents be disclosed\n\nimmediately to Maine.        It found them unprotected by the attorney-\n\nclient or work-product privileges.              The DOI timely appealed.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fFollowing our issuance of an opinion in this case, the DOI filed a\n\npetition for rehearing and Maine responded.           We withdrew our\n\noriginal opinion and vacated the judgment. We now affirm, reverse,\n\nand vacate in part.\n\n\n\n                                    I.\n\n                                Background\n\n              To provide a better understanding of the issues raised on\n\nappeal and the litigious climate in which Maine made its requests,\n\nwe set forth the background history of this litigation.\n\n              The genesis of these proceedings is that in 1991, the\n\nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service designated Atlantic salmon\n\nin five rivers within Maine as “candidate species” under the\n\nEndangered Species Act.1     In 1993, the Services received petitions\n\nto list all Atlantic salmon throughout the United States under the\n\nESA.       In 1995, the Services decided that nationwide listing was\n\nunwarranted.       However, they determined that Atlantic salmon in\n\n\n       1\n        Congress enacted the ESA to protect species deemed to be\neither endangered or threatened.     The DOI and the DOC jointly\nadminister the ESA.     Endangered is defined as: “in danger of\nextinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.”\n16 U.S.C. § 1532(6). Threatened is defined as: “likely to become\nan endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all\nor a significant portion of its range.” Id. § 1532(20). Species\nis defined as: “any distinct population segment of any species.”\nId. § 1532(16). Although the normal listing procedures must comply\nwith the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), the Services have the\npower to temporarily bypass the APA if an “emergency posing a\nsignificant risk to the well-being of any species” exists. Id. §\n1533(b)(7).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fseven rivers within Maine were a “distinct population segment,”\n\neligible for protection under the ESA and in danger of extinction.\n\nThe Services, therefore, proposed to list the salmon in these seven\n\nrivers as “threatened” under the ESA.\n\n           Opposed to such a listing, Maine proposed the Atlantic\n\nSalmon Conservation Plan for Seven Maine Rivers. In December 1997,\n\nthe Services, satisfied with the Conservation Plan, withdrew the\n\nlisting proposal.     The compromise obligated Maine to issue annual\n\nreports which were to be made available for public comment.            With\n\nthe withdrawal of the proposed listing, the Services advised Maine\n\nthat they would maintain oversight of the species.            They also\n\noutlined circumstances under which the process for listing Atlantic\n\nsalmon in Maine rivers would be reinstated. In January 1999, Maine\n\ncirculated its draft 1998 annual report, which it issued in April\n\n1999 as a final report after comments from the Services and the\n\npublic.\n\n           In the meantime, in January 1999, the Defenders of\n\nWildlife filed an action in the United States District Court for\n\nthe   District   of   Columbia   challenging   the   withdrawal   of    the\n\nServices’ 1997 listing as violative of the ESA and the APA.              In\n\nMarch 1999, Maine moved to intervene as defendant.2       The Defenders\n\n\n      2\n       Maine also pleaded a cross-claim against the Services\nchallenging the listing of Atlantic salmon, but stipulated to a\ndismissal of the cross-claim without prejudice. Maine threatened\nto challenge the validity of any final listing should it ever come\nto pass.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fsought, among other relief, to have the Services list the Atlantic\n\nsalmon under the emergency listing provision of the ESA. In August\n\n1999, Trout Unlimited filed a suit raising substantially the same\n\nissues in the same court as the Defenders.           In the midst of the\n\nDefenders and Trout lawsuits and Maine’s threat of future legal\n\naction, the Services in November 1999 conducted another status\n\nreview and decided to list the Atlantic salmon as being in danger\n\nof extinction in eight rivers within Maine.3\n\n           In resisting the proposed listing, Maine made a series of\n\nFOIA requests to the Departments and their components seeking\n\ndocuments pertaining to the decision to list the Atlantic salmon in\n\neight Maine rivers as endangered.       The DOI satisfied Maine’s first\n\nrequest made in December 1999.     Maine made a second request, which\n\nis the subject of this appeal, on January 18, 2000, to both\n\nDepartments, DOI and DOC, seeking all documents, data, studies, and\n\ncorrespondence pertaining to the Services’ consideration of whether\n\nto list Atlantic salmon in eight Maine rivers.4         In response, the\n\nDOI   released   approximately   1400   documents.      It   withheld   308\n\ndocuments as protected from disclosure under the attorney-client\n\n\n      3\n       In November 2000, after public hearings and comments, the\nServices issued their final decision that became effective on\nDecember 18, 2000. It listed as endangered a distinct population\nof wild Atlantic salmon. In December 2000, Maine filed an action\nin the United States District Court for the District of Maine\nchallenging the validity of the final decision.\n      4\n       The disputes with respect to documents from the DOC and its\ndivision have been successfully resolved in the district court.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fand work-product privileges subsumed by the FOIA exemption 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b)(5).5     The DOI asserts that all withheld documents were\n\ngenerated between January 1999 and January 2000, a period in which\n\nthe Defenders and Trout lawsuits were pending.\n\n           Unsuccessful in administrative appeals, Maine filed an\n\naction in June 2000, in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Maine alleging that the DOI improperly withheld 308\n\ndocuments.     On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district\n\ncourt issued its decision and order on December 26, 2000, as\n\namended on January 2, 2001.      Maine v. DOI, 124 F. Supp. 2d 728 (D.\n\nMe.   2001).    It   ordered   the   DOI   immediately   to   disclose   197\n\ndocuments to Maine, finding them not exempt under either the\n\nattorney-client or work-product privileges.6 Although the district\n\ncourt stayed the immediate disclosure order pending appeal, the DOI\n\nreleased 84 documents and challenged disclosure of the remaining\n\n113 documents.7\n\n\n      5\n       In two documents, the DOI claimed an exemption under 5\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(6), the privacy exemption, to which the district\ncourt agreed. These documents are not at issue here.\n      6\n       As to the remaining documents, the district court found\nseventy-one documents to be exempt and ordered an in camera review\nof forty documents. None of those documents are at issue before\nthis Court, but the district court stayed the in camera review\npending the outcome of this interlocutory appeal.\n      7\n       The district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction\npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).     This Court has appellate\njurisdiction over the interlocutory order. Irons v. FBI, 811 F.2d\n681, 683-84 (1st Cir. 1987) (upholding interlocutory appellate\njurisdiction pursuant to either 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) or\n\n                                     -6-\n\f                                    II.\n\n           On appeal, the DOI raises two primary issues.           First, as\n\nto the attorney work-product privilege, the DOI claims that the\n\ncourt erred in requiring a withholding agency to demonstrate that\n\na document was prepared “primarily” for litigation purposes to\n\nprotect it from disclosure under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).\n\nSecond, the DOI argues that the district court erred in rejecting\n\nthe agency’s assertion of attorney-client privilege for documents\n\ncontaining legal advice and analysis from agency attorneys and\n\ndraft materials written by agency officials on the ground that the\n\ndocuments do not reveal confidential communications from clients.\n\n           The FOIA requires government agencies to “make . . .\n\npromptly available” to any person, upon request, whatever “records”\n\nthe agency possessed unless those records fall within one of the\n\nstatute’s exemption.      5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3), (b).           Even if some\n\ninformation within a document is exempt, the withholding agency\n\nmust still disclose reasonably segregable non-exempt information.\n\nId. § 552(b).    Several years ago, this court had the occasion to\n\nreview   the   policy,   purpose   and    sweep   of   FOIA   in   Church   of\n\nScientology International v. United States Department of Justice,\n\n30 F.3d 224 (1st Cir. 1994).       Writing for the court, Judge Coffin\n\nnoted that the statute’s basic purpose is to open agency action to\n\n\n\ncollateral order jurisdiction over FOIA orders directing immediate\ndisclosure).\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthe light of public scrutiny.     Id. at 228.       The policy underlying\n\nthe statute, he wrote, “is thus one of broad disclosure, and the\n\ngovernment must supply any information requested by an individual\n\nunless it determines that a specific exemption, narrowly construed,\n\napplies.”    Id.\n\n            When an aggrieved party files an action under the Act\n\nbecause documents are withheld, the burden under the statute is on\n\nthe agency to demonstrate the applicability of a claimed exemption.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). The district court must make a de novo\n\ndetermination whether the agency has met its burden.           Id.\n\n            To facilitate a broad disclosure and assist the requester\n\nand, if necessary, a reviewing court, in determining whether the\n\nclaim of exemption is justified, a practice has developed for the\n\nwithholding agency to supply the requester with a Vaughn index.\n\nThe index takes its name from Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1973), and requires a correlation of the information that an\n\nagency decides to withhold with the particular FOIA exemption and\n\nthe agency’s justification for withholding.           Maynard v. CIA, 986\n\nF.2d 547, 556 (1st Cir. 1993).          The index includes “a general\n\ndescription of each document sought by the FOIA requester and\n\nexplains the agency’s justification for nondisclosure of each\n\nindividual   document   or   portion    of    a   document.”    Church   of\n\nScientology Int’l, 30 F.3d at 228.           Thus, the index compels the\n\nagency to scrutinize any material withheld in justification of its\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fclaimed exemption, assists the court in performing its duties, and\n\ngives the requester as much information as is legally permissible.\n\nId.\n\n          Here, the DOI claims that 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5), which\n\nexempts from disclosure “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums\n\nor letters which would not be available by law to a party other\n\nthan an   agency      in   litigation    with    the    agency,”   shields     from\n\ndisclosure    the   documents    at     issue.         The   Supreme   Court    has\n\ninterpreted    that    exemption   to     protect      from   disclosure     those\n\ndocuments that normally are privileged from civil discovery.                   NLRB\n\nv. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 149 (1975); see also Church\n\nof Scientology Int’l, 30 F.3d at 236.             Thus, the attorney-client\n\nand work-product privileges are included within the scope of the\n\nfifth exemption of FOIA.        Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. at 154.\n\n          Although enacted to inform the public about government\n\nagencies’ actions, FOIA “was not designed to supplement the rules\n\nof civil discovery, and [a requester’s] right to obtain information\n\nis neither enhanced nor diminished because of its needs as a\n\nlitigant.”    Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Irving, 548 F.2d 1131, 1134-\n\n35 (4th Cir. 1977)(citing Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. at 143\n\nn.10). With these principles in mind, we address the issues before\n\nus and turn to the exemptions claimed by the DOI under the work-\n\nproduct and attorney-client privileges.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f                                      A.\n\n                      Attorney Work-Product Privilege\n\n           The attorney work-product privilege first established in\n\nHickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), codified in Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\nRule   26(b)(3)   for    civil    discovery,     protects    from      disclosure\n\nmaterials prepared by attorneys “in anticipation of litigation.”\n\nSince Hickman, courts have reaffirmed the “strong public policy” on\n\nwhich the work-product privilege is grounded. E.g., United States\n\nv. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1197 (2d Cir. 1998).                   The privilege\n\nprotects work done by an attorney in anticipation of, or during,\n\nlitigation from disclosure to the opposing party.\n\n           The specific problem posed by the parties here is the\n\ninterpretation of the “in anticipation of litigation” requirement\n\nin a FOIA context.      The DOI submits that the district court erred\n\nin   holding   that    the   documents     DOI   claims   are   privileged     as\n\nattorney work-product must not only identify the litigation for\n\nwhich each document was prepared but also establish that counsel\n\nprepared the document primarily for litigation purposes.\n\n           Relying on the Supreme Court’s admonition to interpret\n\nFOIA   exemptions     narrowly,    the   district    court      held    that   the\n\ndeterminative question here is whether the prospect of litigation\n\n“served as the primary motivating factor for the preparation of the\n\ndocuments.”    Maine, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 743 (citing Scott Paper Co.\n\nv. Ceilcote Co., 103 F.R.D. 591, 594 (D. Me. 1984))(emphasis\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fadded).     The court reasoned that without such demonstration,\n\ndocuments    created   for   a   dual     purpose,   as   is   common   with\n\ncontroversial rule proposals, “would eviscerate the purposes of the\n\nFOIA” by potentially allowing an agency to withhold any document\n\ncreated during a decision to promulgate a controversial rule.            Id.\n\nTo do so would do nothing to advance the core purpose of the\n\nattorney work-product privilege which is to protect “the adversary\n\ntrial process itself.” Id.       Thus, the court held that to sustain\n\nits burden of establishing the attorney work-product privilege, the\n\nDOI’s Vaughn index must identify the litigation for which each\n\ndocument was prepared and establish that the document was prepared\n\nprimarily for litigation purposes.         Id. at 743-44.\n\n            The DOI argues that the district court’s reliance on\n\nScott Paper Company v. Ceilcote Company, 103 F.R.D. 591, 594 (D.\n\nMe. 1984), a district court opinion, to require that counsel show\n\nthat the document was prepared “in anticipation of litigation” and\n\nthat litigation was “the primary factor” contradicts the purpose of\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. Rule 26 and court of appeals cases.                The DOI\n\nasserts that numerous courts of appeals have rejected the district\n\ncourt’s approach here and adopted a “because of” standard.               The\n\n“because of” standard is one that determines whether a document is\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fprepared because of existing or expected litigation. United States\n\nv. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1202 (2d Cir. 1998).8\n\n            In   DOI’s   petition   for     rehearing,    it   augments     and\n\nclarifies its views as to the application of FTC v. Grolier, Inc.,\n\n462 U.S. 19 (1983) to the issue before us and emphasizes that the\n\ndistrict    court   interpreted     the    relevant     FOIA   exemption    too\n\nnarrowly.    The district court erred, the DOI argues, in holding\n\nthat the documents are protected by the attorney work-product\n\nprivilege   only    if   the   “primary    motivating    factor”   for     their\n\ncreation was to assist in litigation.         DOI strenuously argues that\n\nthe applicable law, even in the FOIA context, is Rule 26 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure9 and case law governing the\n\n\n     8\n        Other courts of appeals that have adopted this standard\ninclude: National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co.,\nInc., 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992); Simon v. G.D. Searle &\nCo., 816 F.2d 397, 401 (8th Cir. 1987); Senate of Puerto Rico v.\nDOJ, 823 F.2d 574, 586 n.42 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Binks Mfg. Co. v.\nNational Presto Indus., Inc., 709 F.2d 1109, 1118-19 (7th Cir.\n1983); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 604 F.2d 798, 803 (3d Cir.\n1979).\n     9\n         Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) provides in\npertinent part that \"a party may obtain discovery of documents and\ntangible things otherwise discoverable . . . and prepared in\nanticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or\nby or for that other party's representative (including the other\nparty's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or\nagent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has\nsubstantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's\ncase and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain\nthe substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In\nordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has\nbeen made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental\nimpressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an\nattorney or other representative of a party concerning the\n\n                                    -12-\n\fprivilege, particularly FTC v. Grolier, Inc. and United States v.\n\nAdlman.\n\n             In Grolier, the question was the extent, if any, to which\n\nthe   work-product    component    of   Exemption   5   applies    when   the\n\nlitigation for which the requested documents were generated had\n\nbeen terminated.      Although the issue was not identical to the\n\nquestion before us, the Supreme Court concluded that whatever\n\nproblems are engendered in construing Rule 26(b)(3) in the civil\n\ndiscovery area, the Rule “provides a satisfactory resolution to the\n\nquestion of whether work-product documents are exempt under the\n\nFOIA.”    462 U.S. at 25-26.      Without any need to rely exclusively\n\nupon any particular construction of Rule 26(b)(3), the Court held\n\nthat the test under Exemption 5 “is whether the documents would be\n\n‘routinely’ or ‘normally’ disclosed upon a showing of relevance.”\n\nId. at 26.     This was hardly a bolt from the blue.        Several years\n\nbefore, the Court explained in NLRB v. Sears Roebuck & Co., 421\n\nU.S. 132, 149 (1975), that Exemption 5 “exempt[s] those documents,\n\nand   only   those   documents,   normally   privileged    in     the   civil\n\ndiscovery context.”\n\n             Adlman provides the most exhaustive discussion, albeit in\n\na non-FOIA context, of the standard adopted by the district court\n\nhere, as well as the one the DOI advances to this court.           The court\n\n\n\n\nlitigation.\"\n\n                                   -13-\n\fof appeals described the issue and the competing standards as\n\nfollows:\n\n      It is universally agreed that a document whose purpose is to\n      assist in preparation for litigation is within the scope of\n      the Rule and thus eligible to receive protection if the other\n      conditions of protection prescribed by the Rule are met. The\n      issue is less clear, however, as to documents which, although\n      prepared because of expected litigation, are intended to\n      inform a business decision influenced by the prospects of the\n      litigation. The formulation applied by some courts in\n      determining whether documents are protected by work-product\n      privilege is whether they are prepared \"primarily or\n      exclusively to assist in litigation\" - a formulation that\n      would potentially exclude documents containing analysis of\n      expected litigation, if their primary, ultimate, or exclusive\n      purpose is to assist in making the business decision. Others\n      ask whether the documents were prepared \"because of\" existing\n      or expected litigation — a formulation that would include\n      such documents, despite the fact that their purpose is not to\n      \"assist in\" litigation.\n\n134 F.3d at 1197-98 (emphasis added).\n\n            The Adlman Court reasoned that the “primary” standard is\n\nat odds with the text and the policies of Rule 26 because nothing\n\nin   it   suggests   that   documents   prepared   for   dual   purposes   of\n\nlitigation and business or agency decisions do not fall within its\n\nscope.     Id. at 1198-99.    Thus, that court rejected the “primary”\n\npurpose standard as at odds with the literal terms and purpose of\n\nthe Rule.    Id.     Instead, the court adopted the formulation of the\n\nwork-product rule enunciated by Wright and Miller, 8 Fed. Practice\n\n& Procedure, § 2024 at 343 (1994), and adopted by a number of\n\ncircuits, that documents should be deemed prepared for litigation\n\nand within the scope of the Rule if, “in light of the nature of the\n\ndocument and the factual situation in the particular case, the\n\n                                   -14-\n\fdocument can be fairly said to have been prepared or obtained\n\nbecause of the prospect of litigation.”   Id. 1202.\n\n          Maine does not dispute the reasoning or pertinence of\n\nthese cases in its answer to the petition for rehearing.    Rather,\n\nit submits, as it has before, “that the precise scope of the work-\n\nproduct privilege is essentially irrelevant.    This is so because\n\ndefendants failed to demonstrate that the documents at issue fall\n\nwithin even the broad scope of the privilege set forth in the cases\n\nupon which defendants rely.   There is nothing to suggest that the\n\ndocuments were created for any reason other than to assist the\n\ndefendants in taking a routine administrative action – implementing\n\na listing under the Endangered Species Act.”   See Answer of Maine\n\nat 1-2.\n\n          In light of the decisions of the Supreme Court, we\n\ntherefore agree with the formulation of the work-product rule\n\nadopted in Adlman and by five other courts of appeals.     (See n.9\n\nsupra).   Thus, we must conclude that in the instant case it was\n\nerror to require the DOI to demonstrate that the withheld documents\n\nwere created primarily for litigation purposes in order to claim\n\nthe work-product privilege under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).\n\n          This conclusion does not end our inquiry.   Maine argues\n\nthat the “defendants produced so little information regarding the\n\nwithheld documents that there is simply no way of determining why\n\na particular document was prepared, what the document discusses, or\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fwhether it should be protected from disclosure.”                      See Answer of\n\nMaine at 13.        The DOI, on the other hand, argues that the district\n\ncourt also erred in finding that the DOI failed sufficiently to\n\nidentify      the    litigation    for    which    the      alleged    work-product\n\ndocuments were prepared.          This court previously has held:\n\n              [A]t a minimum, an agency seeking to withhold\n              a document . . . must identify the litigation\n              for which the document was created (either by\n              name or through factual description) and\n              explain why the work-product privilege applies\n              to all portions of the document.\n\nChurch   of    Scientology    Int’l,      30    F.3d   at   237.      Although   the\n\nidentification and explanation requirements are not to be given a\n\nhypertechnical construction, they can neither be brushed aside nor\n\nsatisfied by vague generalities.\n\n              The DOI relies on the two declarations of Edward T.\n\nKeable, the Attorney-Advisor, Office of the Solicitor, United\n\nStates Department of the Interior, that the DOI submitted in\n\nsupport of its summary judgment motion.                In the first declaration,\n\nKeable asserts that the withheld documents are privileged and\n\nrefers to his written legal opinion that was sent to Maine during\n\nthe administrative appeal.         However, the declaration is conclusory\n\nand not of much help here.               In the second declaration, Keable\n\nidentifies the following lawsuits related to the listing process:\n\n(1) Defenders of Wildlife v. Babbitt; (2) Trout Unlimited v.\n\nBabbitt; (3) Maine v. Department of Interior; (4) Maine’s threat to\n\nchallenge the final rule; and (5) Maine Aquaculture Association\n\n                                         -16-\n\fthreat of suit if pen permits are modified to protect wild salmon.\n\nThe declaration is peremptory; it offers no information that the\n\ndocuments requested were prepared for any of these lawsuits.                In\n\nboth the legal opinion and in the corresponding transmittal letter,\n\nthe   DOI   explicitly     acknowledged     it    has   not   identified   the\n\nlitigation to which the withheld documents relate.                Rather, it\n\nreasoned that because there already have been three law suits\n\ndirectly    related   to   the   listing,   “it    is   reasonable   for   the\n\nattorneys advising the Department to anticipate more litigation at\n\nvarious stages in the process.”\n\n            An examination of the Vaughn index also is not helpful.\n\nAlthough the index identifies the documents and describes the\n\ngeneral subject matter of each, it fails to demonstrate that any\n\nparticular document was prepared for litigation and fails to\n\ncorrelate the documents to the lawsuits referred to in the Keable\n\ndeclarations.    The mere relation of documents to litigation does\n\nnot automatically endow those documents with privileged status.\n\nThe burden was on the DOI to make the correlation between each\n\nwithheld document and the “litigation for which the document was\n\ncreated,” and the district court found that the DOI did not make\n\nit.   We see no compliance with this court’s minimum requirements\n\nlaid out in Church of Scientology International and perceive no\n\nerror by the district court in this regard.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f            The problem that now confronts us is that the district\n\ncourt did not identify the documents that it considered non-exempt\n\nbecause of the DOI’s failure to satisfy the district court’s\n\n“primary” standard or its failure to identify the litigation for\n\nwhich the documents were created, or both.   Our examination of the\n\nVaughn index and the lengthy footnote 18 of the district court, 124\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 745 n.18, leads us to the conclusion, however, that\n\nthe majority of the documents at issue here were found non-exempt\n\nby the district court because the DOI failed to identify the\n\nlitigation for which the documents were created. As explained, the\n\nVaughn index and the Keable declarations are of little help in\n\nidentifying the litigation responsible for their creation.10   The\n\nDOI admitted as much in its legal opinion and in the corresponding\n\ntransmittal letter.\n\n            As to documents 71, 72, 80, 81, 91, 92, 207, 208, 234,\n\nand 267, the DOI’s reference to the emergency listing proposal\n\ncould arguably be deemed to identify the litigation, mainly, the\n\nDefenders and Trout lawsuits.   The district court stated that the\n\ndescriptions of the emergency listing proposal, however, were\n\n“ambiguous . . . explanations of the contents of the documents and\n\ntheir possible relevance to litigation.”      We see no reason to\n\ndisagree.     The Adlman court emphasized that the “because of”\n\n\n     10\n        We believe that document 218 may sufficiently satisfy the\nwork-product rule.   This document, therefore, is protected and\nexempt from disclosure.\n\n                                -18-\n\fstandard does not protect from disclosure “documents that are\n\nprepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been\n\ncreated    in   essentially        similar    form    irrespective      of    the\n\nlitigation.”      Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1202 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(b)(3), Advisory Committee’s Note; National Union Fire Ins. Co.\n\nv. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992)).\n\nThis is true even if the documents aid in the preparation of\n\nlitigation.     Id.\n\n           On further review of the Vaughn index, we conclude that\n\nthe references to the emergency listing process are insufficient\n\ndescriptions    to     determine   whether    the    documents   were   created\n\nbecause of the Defenders and Trout lawsuits, or were “prepared in\n\nthe ordinary course of business or . . . would have been created in\n\nessentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.”                    Thus,\n\nalthough we conclude that the district court erred in holding that\n\nthe   “primary”       standard   is   the    applicable    test,   under      the\n\ncircumstances, its resolution of the documents to be released\n\nremains unaffected.\n\n           Finally, the DOI argues that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that FOIA does not exempt from disclosure factual\n\nmaterial   in   an     otherwise    privileged      attorney’s   work-product.\n\nMaine, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 744-45.                Maine moots the issue by\n\nwithdrawing its request for those nineteen documents still on\n\nappeal that the district court ordered disclosed based on this\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\flegal holding.    At oral argument, counsel for Maine also advised\n\nthe court that it will make a similar withdrawal with respect to\n\nthe documents subject to in camera review.                   Therefore, we will\n\nvacate that portion of the district court’s order that held that\n\nFOIA exemption    5     does   not    encompass       factual   components   of   a\n\nprivileged attorney work-product.                Medical Prof’l Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nBreon Lab., Inc., 141 F.3d 372, 376 (1st Cir. 1998) (“If a judgment\n\nis rendered moot during an appeal, either through happenstance or\n\nunilateral action by the prevailing party, normally the court\n\ndismisses the appeal and orders the judgment vacated.”) (citing\n\nUnited States Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall P’ship, 513 U.S.\n\n18, 25 (1994)).\n\n                                           B.\n\n                        Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n            We now consider the attorney-client privilege.                The DOI\n\ncontends that the court either misunderstood the scope of the\n\nattorney-client privilege or applied it very narrowly in finding 81\n\nof the still remaining 94 documents on appeal unprotected by the\n\nattorney-client privilege.           This privilege protects confidential\n\ncommunications made by a client to his attorney.                In re Grand Jury\n\nSubpoena, 274 F.3d 563, 571 (1st Cir. 2001).                The attorney-client\n\nprivilege   “is   the    oldest      of    the    privileges    for   confidential\n\ncommunications recognized by law.”                Weinstein’s Federal Evidence,\n\n§ 503.03 (2d Ed.).      The modern rationale for the privilege is more\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fpractical and expansive, promoting full disclosure by clients to\n\ntheir attorneys; “it enables attorneys to act more effectively,\n\njustly, and expeditiously.”     Id.     The privilege also protects from\n\ndisclosure documents provided by an attorney if the party asserting\n\nthe privilege shows:\n\n     (1) that he was or sought to be a client of [the attorney];\n     (2) that [the attorney] in connection with the [document]\n     acted as a lawyer; (3) that the [document] relates to facts\n     communicated for the purpose of securing a legal opinion,\n     legal services or assistance in legal proceedings; and (4)\n     that the privilege has not been waived.\n\nUnited States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc.,\n\n874 F.2d 20, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting United States v.\n\nWilson, 798 F.2d 509, 512 (1st Cir. 1986)).\n\n          The    DOI   here   asserts    that   the   court   held   certain\n\ndocuments unprotected by the privilege because they did not reveal\n\na confidential communication.         This, it submits, is contrary to\n\nTown of Norfolk v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 968 F.2d\n\n1438, 1457-58 (1st Cir. 1992), which holds that an attorney’s\n\nadvice to a client is protected if it relates to a confidential\n\ncommunication.    The DOI, however, mischaracterizes the district\n\ncourt ruling.     The district court held that the DOI failed to\n\ndemonstrate a confidential factual communication and “also [failed]\n\nto explain how the withheld legal analysis would reveal any such\n\nfact if it existed.”     Maine, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 742.\n\n          Further, relying on Town of Norfolk, the DOI argues that\n\nthe court’s erroneous view of the scope of the privilege led the\n\n                                  -21-\n\fcourt to reject the privilege for documents at the heart of the\n\nexchange of information and advice between the attorney and his\n\nclient.   It points to the attorney’s advice, the agency’s proposed\n\nactions, comment on and analysis of the lawyers’ draft pleading,\n\nthe opposing party’s pleadings, and discussions of strategy between\n\nthe lawyer and the client.\n\n           The DOI’s arguments are misplaced.          In Town of Norfolk,\n\nthe court made a finding, absent here, that “by the content of the\n\nletters, it is clear that they relate to facts communicated for the\n\npurpose of securing a legal opinion, legal services or assistance\n\nin a legal proceeding.” 968 F.2d at 1458 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted).      Here, the DOI has failed to explain, or\n\neven attempt to explain except in conclusory statements, how the\n\ndocuments claimed to be protected establish that they relate to a\n\nconfidential client communication.       It further asserts that the\n\ndistrict court erred in requiring the DOI to show definitively that\n\neach   document   reveals   the   substance   of   a    confidential   fact\n\ncommunicated by the client.        As we already noted, the court’s\n\nconclusion of inapplicability of the attorney-client privilege was\n\npremised on its determination that the DOI failed to establish the\n\nrequisite element of a client-communicated confidential fact.\n\n           The DOI erroneously assumes that the requirement of\n\nclient communicated confidentiality is satisfied merely because the\n\ndocuments are communications between a client and attorney. The\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\ferror in this assumption can be found by referring to Mead Data\n\nCentral, Inc., 566 F.2d at 253, where the court held that the\n\nattorney-client    privilege   “does   not   allow   the   withholding    of\n\ndocuments simply because they are the product of an attorney-client\n\nrelationship . . . .        It must also be demonstrated that the\n\ninformation is confidential.” (emphasis added)(footnote omitted).\n\n          Like the district court here, the Court of Appeals for\n\nthe District of Columbia Circuit in Mead found certain documents\n\nunprotected   by    the    attorney-client     privilege     because     the\n\nwithholding agency failed to demonstrate the confidentiality of the\n\ninformation on which they are based.          The court found that the\n\nwithholding party simply failed to demonstrate that the withheld\n\ndocuments contain or relate to information that the client intended\n\nto keep confidential and it thus failed to establish an essential\n\nelement of the privilege.      566 F.2d at 253-54.\n\n          We need not discuss each document for which the DOI\n\nclaims the attorney-client privilege because they all suffer from\n\nthe same infirmity.       The Vaughn index states the names of the\n\nindividual or individuals preparing each document withheld, the\n\nrecipient, the claimed privilege, a general description of the\n\ndocument, and the date.     A strong example of the index in support\n\nof the attorney-client privilege is entry number 112:\n\n          14-page draft statement materials facts from\n          an   agency  official   to  the   DOJ  lawyer\n          representing the Services in the Defenders of\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f          Wildlife case in order to assist the lawyer in\n          preparing pleadings in the case.\n\n\n          In   Church   of   Scientology    International,      this   court\n\nrejected index entries as insufficient “because they fail to\n\nspecify whether the source was provided an express or implied grant\n\nof confidentiality, or do not provide sufficient detail about the\n\nsurrounding circumstances to support an expression of implied\n\nconfidentiality.”   30 F.3d at 238.         The above entry, like the\n\nothers, including   those     claimed    under   work-product   privilege,\n\nexcept one, is very general, without any explanation justifying the\n\nprivilege, and fails to identify any circumstance expressly or\n\ninferentially supporting confidentiality.\n\n          We therefore conclude that Judge Carter, in his analysis\n\nof the index and supporting affidavits, committed no error.\n\n                                    C.\n\n                             Summary Judgment\n\n          Lastly, the DOI argues that the court acted prematurely\n\nin granting summary judgment.       Relying on Church of Scientology\n\nInternational, 30 F.3d at 239-40, Judge Carter stated:\n\n          When   an  agency  has   failed  to  provide\n          sufficient detail in its Vaughn index and/or\n          affidavits in support of its claim of\n          exemption and nonsegregability, a district\n          court may require supplementation of the\n          Vaughn index, conduct an in camera review of\n          the documents in question, authorize limited\n          discovery, or order immediate disclosure of\n          the documents.\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fMaine, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 737.           The judge concluded that DOI met\n\nits burden of establishing the privileged claim for some of the\n\ndocuments.      For many, he concluded that the DOI failed to supply\n\nsufficient information to meet its burden of establishing the\n\nclaimed privilege.       Id. at 738.\n\n            The DOI contends that the court erred on cross-motions\n\nfor summary judgment in granting immediate disclosure based on an\n\ninadequate Vaughn index instead of providing the DOI with an\n\nopportunity to submit additional affidavits and to revise its\n\nVaughn index.     It argues that at the very least there exist genuine\n\nissues of material fact to preclude granting of summary judgment\n\nand ordering immediate disclosure.\n\n             As Maine points out, the DOI also requested that this\n\ncase proceed to disposition on its motion for summary judgment.\n\nFurther, the DOI has unilateral and uninhibited access to the\n\ncontent of the withheld documents.                In Church of Scientology\n\nInternational, this court remanded the case and instructed the\n\nparties    that    after    the     government    has    provided      additional\n\ninformation, the district court could choose to permit discovery\n\nlimited    to   specified    documents,      conduct    in   camera    review   of\n\nselected    documents,      order    release     of   some   documents,    or   a\n\ncombination of these procedures.          30 F.3d at 239-40.          This is the\n\ncourse that the court followed here.           It conducted a comprehensive\n\nand painstaking review of the documents and the Vaughn index to\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\farrive at its decision.      It ordered immediate disclosure for some\n\ndocuments where the DOI failed to satisfy the legal prerequisites\n\nof the claimed privilege.\n\n            Although in Irons v. Bell we cautioned against ordering\n\nimmediate disclosure of documents based on an agency’s admittedly\n\nflawed    affidavit,    especially    where    the    supporting   affidavit\n\ninvolves a novel question of law, 596 F.2d 468, 471 n.6 (1st Cir.\n\n1979), we perceive no error by this court.             The Court of Appeals\n\nfor the Third Circuit similarly frowned upon immediate disclosure\n\nin Coastal States Gas Corporation v. Department of Energy, but\n\nnoted that it in no way encouraged agency delay.           644 F.2d 969, 979\n\n(3d Cir. 1981)(Coastal II).          It would in the future follow the\n\nsuggestion of the court in Coastal States Gas Corporation v.\n\nDepartment of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980)(Coastal I),\n\nrequiring agencies to supply sufficient information the first time\n\nso as to allow courts to make a reasoned determination pertaining\n\nto the legitimacy of the claimed exemptions.            Coastal II, 644 F.2d\n\nat 981.     Of special pertinence here, the Coastal II court also\n\nconcluded   that   to   survive   summary     judgment,   it   would   not   be\n\nunreasonable to require an agency to stand on its first Vaughn\n\nindex. Id. at 984.\n\n            In the instant case, the DOI opposed the discovery of\n\nthese documents and never requested a hearing or oral argument. It\n\nstood on its motion for summary judgment.            The DOI never submitted\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fa supplemental or revised index justifying the withholding of the\n\ndocuments under the claimed privilege.       The district court adhered\n\nto the common standard summary judgment procedure and, under the\n\ncircumstances, did not abuse its discretion in denying the agency\n\n“a second chance.”\n\n\n\n                                   III.\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n      In sum, as Maine has withdrawn its request for documents\n\nrelated to the district court’s holding that factual materials in\n\na privileged attorney work-product are not exempt from disclosure,\n\nwe will vacate that part of the district court’s order.                The\n\ndistrict court’s standard that a document may not be exempt under\n\nthe   attorney   work-product    privilege   unless   the   prospect    of\n\nlitigation “served as the primary motivating factor” must be\n\nrejected.   Under the circumstances already explained, the error is\n\nharmless here.     For the reasons set forth above, the district\n\ncourt’s rulings on the attorney-client privilege are affirmed. The\n\norder granting Maine’s motion for summary judgment and directing\n\nthe disclosure of the 94 withheld documents is affirmed except as\n\nto document 218.\n\nAffirmed, reversed, and vacated in part.

In January 2000, the State of Maine (Maine) submitted a series of FOIA requests to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a component of the Department of Interior (DOI), and the National Maritime Fisheries, a component of the Department of Commerce (DOC) (collectively the Services) for documents relating to the efforts of the Services to list Atlantic salmon in eight rivers within Maine under the protection of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1531-1544.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI provided Maine with approximately 1400 documents but withheld 308 documents, claiming attorney-client or work product privileges. Maine filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maine to enjoin the Services from improperly withholding those documents. On cross-motions for summary judgments, the district court allowed the DOI to withhold a number of documents but ordered that 197 documents be disclosed immediately to Maine. It found them unprotected by the attorney-client or work product privileges. The DOI timely appealed. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To provide a better understanding of the issues raised on appeal and the litigious climate in which Maine made its requests, we set forth the background history of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of these proceedings is that in 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service designated Atlantic salmon in five rivers within Maine as \"candidate species\" under the Endangered Species Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In 1993, the Services received petitions to list all Atlantic salmon throughout the United States under the ESA. In 1995, the Services decided that nationwide listing was unwarranted. However, they determined that Atlantic salmon in seven rivers within Maine were a \"distinct population segment,\" eligible for protection under the ESA and in danger of extinction. The Services, therefore, proposed to list the salmon in these seven rivers as \"threatened\" under the ESA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Opposed to such a listing, Maine proposed the Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan for Seven Maine Rivers. In December 1997, the Services, satisfied with the Conservation Plan, withdrew the listing proposal. The compromise obligated Maine to issue annual reports which were to be made available for public comment. With the withdrawal of the proposed listing, the Services advised Maine that they would maintain oversight of the species. They also outlined circumstances under which the process for listing Atlantic salmon in Maine rivers would be reinstated. In January 1999, Maine circulated its draft 1998 annual report, which it issued in April 1999 as a final report after comments from the Services and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, in January 1999, the Defenders of Wildlife filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the withdrawal of the Services' 1997 listing as violative of the ESA and the APA. In March 1999, Maine moved to intervene as defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Defenders sought, among other relief, to have the Services list the Atlantic salmon under the emergency listing provision of the ESA. In August 1999, Trout Unlimited filed a suit raising substantially the same issues in the same court as the Defenders. In the midst of the Defenders and Trout lawsuits and Maine's threat of future legal action, the Services in November 1999 conducted another status review and decided to list the Atlantic salmon as being in danger of extinction in eight rivers within Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resisting the proposed listing, Maine made a series of FOIA requests to the Departments and their components seeking documents pertaining to the decision to list the Atlantic salmon in eight Maine rivers as endangered. The DOI satisfied Maine's first request made in December 1999. Maine made a second request, which is the subject of this appeal, on January 18, 2000, to both Departments, DOI and DOC, seeking all documents, data, studies, and correspondence pertaining to the Services' consideration of whether to list Atlantic salmon in eight Maine rivers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In response, the DOI released approximately 1400 documents. It withheld 308 documents as protected from disclosure under the attorney-client and work product privileges subsumed by the FOIA exemption 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The DOI asserts that all withheld documents were generated between January 1999 and January 2000, a period in which the Defenders and Trout lawsuits were pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unsuccessful in administrative appeals, Maine filed an action in June 2000, in the United States District Court for the District of Maine alleging that the DOI improperly withheld 308 documents. On cross-motions for summary judgement, the district court issued its decision and order on December 26, 2000, as amended on January 2, 2001. Maine v. DOI, 124 F. Supp.2d 728 (D.Me. 2001). It ordered the DOI immediately to disclose 197 documents to Maine, finding them not exempt under either the attorney-client or work product privileges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Although the district court stayed the immediate disclosure order pending appeal, the DOI released 84 documents and challenged disclosure of the remaining 113 documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the DOI raises two primary issues. First, as to the attorney work product privilege, the DOI claims that the court erred in requiring a withholding agency to demonstrate that a document was prepared \"primarily\" for litigation purposes to protect it from disclosure under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5). Second, the DOI argues that the district court erred in rejecting the agency's assertion of attorney-client privilege for documents containing legal advice and analysis from agency attorneys and draft materials written by agency officials on the ground that the documents do not reveal confidential communications from clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOIA requires government agencies to \"make ... promptly available\" to any person, upon request, whatever \"records\" the agency possessed unless those records fall within one of the statute's exemption. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(3), (b). Even if some information within a document is exempt, the withholding agency must still disclose reasonably segregable non-exempt information. Id. &#167; 552(b). Several years ago, this court had the occasion to review the policy, purpose and sweep of FOIA in Church of Scientology International v. United States Department of Justice, 30 F.3d 224 (1st Cir.1994). Writing for the court, Judge Coffin noted that the statute's basic purpose is to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny. Id. at 228. The policy underlying the statute, he wrote, \"is thus one of broad disclosure, and the government must supply any information requested by an individual unless it determines that a specific exemption, narrowly construed, applies.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an aggrieved party files an action under the Act because documents are withheld, the burden under the statute is on the agency to demonstrate the applicability of a claimed exemption. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a) (4)(B). The district court must make a de novo determination whether the agency has met its burden. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To facilitate a broad disclosure and assist the requester and, if necessary, a reviewing court, in determining whether the claim of exemption is justified, a practice has developed for the withholding agency to supply the requester with a Vaughn index. The index takes its name from Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir.1973), and requires a correlation of the information that an agency decides to withhold with the particular FOIA exemption and the agency's justification for withholding. Maynard v. CIA, 986 F.2d 547, 556 (1st Cir.1993). The index includes \"a general description of each document sought by the FOIA requester and explains the agency's justification for nondisclosure of each individual document or portion of a document.\" Church of Scientology Int'l, 30 F.3d at 228. Thus, the index compels the agency to scrutinize any material withheld in justification of its claimed exemption, assists the court in performing its duties, and gives the requester as much information as is legally permissible. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the DOI claims that 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5), which exempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,\" shields from disclosure the documents at issue. The Supreme Court has interpreted that exemption to protect from disclosure those documents that normally are privileged from civil discovery. NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 421 U.S. 132, 149 (1975); Church of Scientology Int'l, 30 F.3d at 236. Thus, the attorney-client and work product privileges are included within the scope of the fifth exemption of FOIA. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 421 U.S. at 154.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, it has been observed that although \"Congress clearly intended to refer the courts to discovery principles for the resolution of the exemption five disputes, the situations are not identical, and the Supreme Court has recognized that discovery rules should be applied to FOIA cases only `by way of rough analogies.'\" Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Dep't of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 252 (D.C. Cir.1977) (citing EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 86 (1973)). Although enacted to inform the public about government agencies' actions, FOIA \"was not designed to supplement the rules of civil discovery, and [a requester's] right to obtain information is neither enhanced nor diminished because of its needs as a litigant.\" Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Irving, 548 F.2d 1131, 1134-35 (4th Cir.1977) (citing Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 421 U.S. at 143 n. 10). With these principles in mind, we address the issues before us and turn to the exemptions claimed by the DOI under the work product and attorney-client privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Attorney Work Product Privilege</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attorney work product privilege first established in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), codified in Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 26(b)(3) for civil discovery, protects from disclosure materials prepared by attorneys \"in anticipation of litigation.\" Since Hickman, courts have reaffirmed the \"strong public policy\" on which the work-product privilege is grounded. E.g., United States v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1197 (2d Cir.1998). The privilege protects work done by an attorney in anticipation of, or during, litigation from disclosure to the opposing party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific problem posed by the parties here is the interpretation of the \"in anticipation of litigation\" requirement in a FOIA context. The DOI submits that the district court erred in holding that the documents DOI claims are privileged as attorney work product must not only identify the litigation for which each document was prepared but also establish that counsel prepared the document primarily for litigation purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the Supreme Court's admonition to interpret FOIA exemptions narrowly, the district court held that the determinative question here is whether the prospect of litigation \"served as the primary motivating factor for the preparation of the documents.\" Maine, 124 F. Supp.2d at 743 (citing Scott Paper Co. v. Ceilcote Co., Inc., 103 F.R.D. 591, 594 (D.Me. 1984)) (emphasis added). The court reasoned that without such demonstration, documents created for a dual purpose, as is common with controversial rule proposals, \"would eviscerate the purposes of the FOIA\" by potentially allowing an agency to withhold any document created during a decision to promulgate a controversial rule. Id. To do so would do nothing to advance the core purpose of the attorney work product privilege which is to protect \"the adversary trial process itself.\" Id. Thus, the court held that to sustain its burden of establishing the attorney work product privilege, the DOI's Vaughn index must identify the litigation for which each document was prepared and establish that the document was prepared primarily for litigation purposes. Id. at 743-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI argues that the district court's reliance on Scott Paper Company v. Ceilcote Company, Inc., 103 F.R.D. 591, 594 (D.Me. 1984), a district court opinion, to require that counsel show that the document was prepared \"in anticipation of litigation\" and that litigation was \"the primary factor\" contradicts the purpose of Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 26 and court of appeals cases. The DOI asserts that numerous courts of appeals have rejected the district court's approach here and adopted a \"because of\" standard. The \"because of\" standard is one that determines whether a document is prepared because of existing or expected litigation. United States v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1202 (2d Cir.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adlman provides the most exhaustive discussion, albeit in a non-FOIA context, of the standard adopted by this district court, as well as the one the DOI advances to this court. The court described the issue and the competing standards as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is universally agreed that a document whose purpose is to assist in preparation for litigation is within the scope of the Rule and thus eligible to receive protection if the other conditions of protection prescribed by the Rule are met. The issue is less clear, however, as to documents which, although prepared because of expected litigation, are intended to inform a business decision influenced by the prospects of the litigation. The formulation applied by some courts in determining whether documents are protected by work-product privilege is whether they are prepared \"primarily or exclusively to assist in litigation\" &#8212; a formulation that would potentially exclude documents containing analysis of expected litigation, if their primary, ultimate, or exclusive purpose is to assist in making the business decision. Others ask whether the documents were prepared \"because of\" existing or expected litigation &#8212; a formulation that would include such documents, despite the fact that their purpose is not to \"assist in\" litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1197-98 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Adlman Court reasoned that the \"primary\" standard is at odds with the text and the policies of Rule 26 because nothing in it suggests that documents prepared for dual purposes of litigation and business or agency decisions do not fall within its scope. Id. at 1198-99. Thus, the court rejected the \"primary\" purpose standard as at odds with the literal term and purpose of the Rule. Id. Instead, the court adopted the formulation of the work product rule enunciated by Wright and Miller, 8 Fed. Practice &amp; Procedure, &#167; 2024 at 343 (1994), and adopted by a number of circuits that documents should be deemed prepared for litigation and within the scope of the Rule if, \"in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the document can be fairly said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.\" Id. 1202.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However sound the reasoning in Adlman may be in the civil discovery context, we are not persuaded that it should apply in an action seeking disclosure of documents pursuant to FOIA. As the district court observed, agency decision making on controversial regulations, as this case highlights, usually involves the prospect of litigation and in many cases does lead to litigation. The standard adopted by Adlman would hinder the openness that Congress envisioned in enacting FOIA and shield from disclosure documents that would aid in understanding the decision making process of an agency. Indeed, the Supreme Court has cautioned that \"the discovery rules can only be applied under Exemption 5 by way of rough analogies.\" Mink, 410 U.S. at 86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of FOIA, as the DOI alleges Maine is doing here, to expand discovery that otherwise would not be available in a civil action, is permissible in light of the Congressional purpose and policy of the Act. Thus, we cannot say that the district court erred in this case in requiring the DOI to demonstrate that the withheld documents were created primarily for litigation purposes in order to claim the work product privilege under 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the DOI argues that the district court erred in finding that the DOI failed sufficiently to disclose that the documents at issue were prepared in anticipation of litigation and to identify the litigation for which the alleged work product documents were prepared. However, this court has held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]t a minimum, an agency seeking to withhold a document ... must identify the litigation for which the document was created (either by name or through factual description) and explain why the work-product privilege applies to all portions of the document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Church of Scientology Int'l, 30 F.3d at 237.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI relies on the two declarations of Edward T. Keable, the Attorney-Advisor, Office of the Solicitor, United States Department of the Interior, that the DOI submitted in support of its summary judgment motion. In the first declaration, Keable asserts that the withheld documents are privileged and refers to his written legal opinion that was sent to Maine during the administrative appeal. However, the declaration is conclusory and not of much help here. In the second declaration, Keable identifies the following lawsuits related to the listing process: (1) Defenders of Wildlife v. Babbitt; (2) Trout Unlimited v. Babbitt; (3) Maine v. Department of Interior; (4) Maine's threat to challenge the final rule; and (5) Maine Aquaculture Association threat of suit if pen permits are modified to protect wild salmon. The declaration is peremptory; it offers no information that the documents requested were prepared primarily for any of these lawsuits. In both the legal opinion and in the corresponding transmittal letter, the DOI explicitly acknowledged it has not identified the litigation to which the withheld documents relate. Rather, it reasoned that because there already have been three law suits directly related to the listing, \"it is reasonable for the attorneys advising the Department to anticipate more litigation at various stages in the process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the Vaughn index also is not helpful. Although the index identifies the documents and describes the general subject matter of each, it fails to demonstrate that any particular document was prepared primarily for litigation and fails to correlate the documents to the lawsuits referred to in the Keable declarations. The mere relation of documents to litigation does not automatically endow those documents with privileged status. The burden was on the DOI to make the correlation between each withheld document and the \"litigation for which the document was created,\" and the district court found that the DOI did not make it. We perceive no error by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the DOI also argued that the district court erred in concluding that FOIA does not exempt from disclosure otherwise privileged factual material in an attorney's work product. Maine, 124 F. Supp.2d at 744-45. Maine moots the issue by withdrawing its request for those nineteen documents still on appeal that the district court ordered disclosed based on this legal holding. At oral argument, counsel for Maine also advised the court that it will make a similar withdrawal with respect to the documents subject to in camera review. Therefore, we will vacate that portion of the district court's order that held that FOIA exemption 5 does not encompass factual components of a privileged attorney work product. Medical Prof'l Mut. Ins. Co. v. Breon Lab., Inc., 141 F.3d 372, 376 (1st Cir.1998) (\"If a judgment is rendered moot during an appeal, either through happenstance or unilateral action by the prevailing party, normally the court dismisses the appeal and orders the judgment vacated.\") (citing United States Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall P'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 25 (1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Attorney-Client Privilege</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now consider the attorney-client privilege. The DOI contends that the court either misunderstood the scope of the attorney-client privilege or applied it very narrowly in finding 81 of the still remaining 94 documents on appeal unprotected by the attorney-client privilege. This privilege protects confidential communications made by a client to his attorney. In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 274 F.3d 563, 571 (1st Cir.2001). The attorney-client privilege \"is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications recognized by law.\" Weinstein's Federal Evidence, &#167; 503.03 (2d Ed.). The modern rationale for the privilege is more practical and expansive, promoting full disclosure by clients to their attorneys; \"it enables attorneys to act more effectively, justly, and expeditiously.\" Id. The privilege also protects from disclosure documents provided by an attorney if the party asserting the privilege shows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) that he was or sought to be a client of [the attorney];</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) that [the attorney] in connection with the [document] acted as a lawyer;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) that the [document] relates to facts communicated for the purpose of securing a legal opinion, legal services or assistance in legal proceedings; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) that the privilege has not been waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., 874 F.2d 20, 27-28 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting United States v. Wilson, 798 F.2d 509, 512 (1st Cir.1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI here asserts that the court held certain documents unprotected by the privilege because they did not reveal a confidential communication. This, it submits, is contrary to Town of Norfolk v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 968 F.2d 1438, 1457-58 (1st Cir.1992), which holds that an attorney's advice to a client is protected if it relates to a confidential communication. The DOI, however, mischaracterizes the district court ruling. The district court held that the DOI failed to demonstrate a confidential factual communication and \"also [failed] to explain how the withheld legal analysis would reveal any such fact if it existed.\" Maine, 124 F. Supp.2d at 742.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, relying on Town of Norfolk, the DOI argues that the court's erroneous view of the scope of the privilege led the court to reject the privilege for documents at the heart of the exchange of information and advice between client. It points to the attorney's advice, the agency's proposed actions, comment on and analysis of the lawyers' draft pleading, the opposing party's pleadings, and discussions of strategy between the lawyer and the client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI's arguments are misplaced. In Town of Norfolk, the court made a finding, absent here, that \"by the content of the letters, it is clear that they relate to facts communicated for the purpose of securing a legal opinion, legal services or assistance in a legal proceeding.\" 968 F.2d at 1458 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the DOI has failed to explain, or even attempt to explain except in conclusory statements, how the documents claimed to be protected establish that they relate to a confidential client communication. It further asserts that the district court erred in requiring the DOI to show definitively that each document reveals the substance of a confidential fact communicated by the client. As we already noted, the court's conclusion of inapplicability of the attorney-client privilege was premised on its determination that the DOI failed to establish the requisite element of a client-communicated confidential fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI erroneously assumes that the requirement of client communicated confidentiality is satisfied merely because the documents are communications between a client and attorney. The error in this assumption can be found by referring to Mead Data Central, Inc., 566 F.2d at 253, where the court held that the attorney-client privilege \"does not allow the withholding of documents simply because they are the product of an attorney-client relationship.... It must also be demonstrated that the information is confidential.\" (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court here, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Mead found certain documents unprotected by the attorney-client privilege because the withholding agency failed to demonstrate the confidentiality of the information on which they are based. The court found that the withholding party simply failed to demonstrate that the withheld documents contain or relate to information that the client intended to keep confidential and it thus failed to establish an essential element of the privilege. 566 F.2d at 253-54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not discuss each document for which the DOI claims the attorney-client privilege because they all suffer from the same infirmity. The Vaughn index states the names of the individual or individuals preparing each document withheld, the recipient, the claimed privilege, a general description of the document, and the date. A strong example of the index in support of the attorney-client privilege is entry number 112:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">14-page draft statement materials facts from an agency official to the DOJ lawyer representing the Services in the Defenders of Wildlife case in order to assist the lawyer in preparing pleadings in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Church of Scientology International, this court rejected index entries as insufficient \"because they fail to specify whether the source was provided an express or implied grant of confidentiality, or do not provide sufficient detail about the surrounding circumstances to support an expression of implied confidentiality.\" 30 F.3d at 238. The above entry, like the others, including those claimed under work product privilege, is very general, without any explanation justifying the privilege, and fails to identify any circumstance expressly or inferentially supporting confidentiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that Judge Carter, in his analysis of the index and supporting affidavits, committed no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the DOI argues that the court acted prematurely in granting summary judgment. Relying on Church of Scientology International, 30 F.3d at 239-40, Judge Carter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an agency has failed to provide sufficient detail in its Vaughn index and/or affidavits in support of its claim of exemption and nonsegregability, a district court may require supplementation of the Vaughn index, conduct an in camera review of the documents in question, authorize limited discovery, or order immediate disclosure of the documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine, 124 F. Supp.2d at 737. The judge concluded that DOI met its burden of establishing the privileged claim for some of the documents. For many, he concluded that the DOI failed to supply sufficient information to meet its burden of establishing the claimed privilege. Id. at 738.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI contends that the court erred on cross-motions for summary judgment in granting immediate disclosure based on an inadequate Vaughn index instead of providing the DOI with an opportunity to submit additional affidavits and to revise its Vaughn index. It argues that at the very least there exist genuine issues of material fact to preclude granting of summary judgment and ordering immediate disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Maine points out, the DOI also requested that this case proceed to disposition on its motion for summary judgment. Further, the DOI has unilateral and uninhibited access to the content of the withheld documents. In Church of Scientology International, this court remanded the case and instructed the parties that after the government has provided additional information, the district court could choose to permit discovery limited to specified documents, conduct in camera review of selected documents, order release of some documents, or a combination of these procedures. 30 F.3d at 239-40. This is the course that the court followed here. It conducted a comprehensive and painstaking review of the documents and the Vaughn index to arrive at its decision. It ordered immediate disclosure for some documents where the DOI failed to satisfy the legal prerequisites of the claimed privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although in Irons v. Bell we cautioned against ordering immediate disclosure of documents based on an agency's admittedly flawed affidavit, especially where the supporting affidavit involves a novel question of law, 596 F.2d 468, 471 n. 6 (1st Cir.1979), we perceive no error by this court. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit similarly frowned upon immediate disclosure in Coastal States Gas Corporation v. Department of Energy, but noted that it in no way encouraged agency delay. 644 F.2d 969, 979 (3d Cir.1981) (Coastal II). It would in the future follow the suggestion of the Court in Coastal States Gas Corporation v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir.1980) (Coastal I), requiring agencies to supply sufficient information the first time so as to allow courts to make a reasoned determination pertaining to the legitimacy of the claimed exemptions. Coastal II, 644 F.2d at 981. Of special pertinence here, the Coastal II court also concluded that to survive summary judgment, it would not be unreasonable to require an agency to stand on its first Vaughn index. Id. at 984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the DOI opposed the discovery of these documents and never requested a hearing or oral argument. It stood on its motion for summary judgment. The DOI never submitted a supplemental or revised index justifying the withholding of the documents under the claimed privilege. The district court adhered to the common standard summary judgment procedure and, under the circumstances, did not abuse its discretion in denying the agency \"a second chance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, as Maine has withdrawn its request for documents related to the district court's holding that factual materials in a privileged attorney work product are not exempt from disclosure, we will vacate that part of the district court's order. For the reasons set forth above, we perceive no error on the part of the district court in the remaining aspects of this case. The order granting Maine's motion for summary judgment and ordering the disclosure of the 94 withheld documents is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Congress enacted the ESA to protect species deemed to be either endangered or threatened.

In January 2000, the State of Maine (Maine) submitted a series of FOIA requests to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a component of the Department of Interior (DOI), and the National Maritime Fisheries, a component of the Department of Commerce (DOC) (collectively the Services) for documents relating to the efforts of the Services to list Atlantic salmon in eight rivers within Maine under the protection of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1531-1544.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI provided Maine with approximately 1400 documents but withheld 308 documents, claiming attorney-client or work product privileges. Maine filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maine to enjoin the Services from improperly withholding those documents. On cross-motions for summary judgments, the district court allowed the DOI to withhold a number of documents but ordered that 197 documents be disclosed immediately to Maine. It found them unprotected by the attorney-client or work product privileges. The DOI timely appealed. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To provide a better understanding of the issues raised on appeal and the litigious climate in which Maine made its requests, we set forth the background history of this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of these proceedings is that in 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service designated Atlantic salmon in five rivers within Maine as \"candidate species\" under the Endangered Species Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In 1993, the Services received petitions to list all Atlantic salmon throughout the United States under the ESA. In 1995, the Services decided that nationwide listing was unwarranted. However, they determined that Atlantic salmon in seven rivers within Maine were a \"distinct population segment,\" eligible for protection under the ESA and in danger of extinction. The Services, therefore, proposed to list the salmon in these seven rivers as \"threatened\" under the ESA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Opposed to such a listing, Maine proposed the Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan for Seven Maine Rivers. In December 1997, the Services, satisfied with the Conservation Plan, withdrew the listing proposal. The compromise obligated Maine to issue annual reports which were to be made available for public comment. With the withdrawal of the proposed listing, the Services advised Maine that they would maintain oversight of the species. They also outlined circumstances under which the process for listing Atlantic salmon in Maine rivers would be reinstated. In January 1999, Maine circulated its draft 1998 annual report, which it issued in April 1999 as a final report after comments from the Services and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, in January 1999, the Defenders of Wildlife filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the withdrawal of the Services' 1997 listing as violative of the ESA and the APA. In March 1999, Maine moved to intervene as defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Defenders sought, among other relief, to have the Services list the Atlantic salmon under the emergency listing provision of the ESA. In August 1999, Trout Unlimited filed a suit raising substantially the same issues in the same court as the Defenders. In the midst of the Defenders and Trout lawsuits and Maine's threat of future legal action, the Services in November 1999 conducted another status review and decided to list the Atlantic salmon as being in danger of extinction in eight rivers within Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resisting the proposed listing, Maine made a series of FOIA requests to the Departments and their components seeking documents pertaining to the decision to list the Atlantic salmon in eight Maine rivers as endangered. The DOI satisfied Maine's first request made in December 1999. Maine made a second request, which is the subject of this appeal, on January 18, 2000, to both Departments, DOI and DOC, seeking all documents, data, studies, and correspondence pertaining to the Services' consideration of whether to list Atlantic salmon in eight Maine rivers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In response, the DOI released approximately 1400 documents. It withheld 308 documents as protected from disclosure under the attorney-client and work product privileges subsumed by the FOIA exemption 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The DOI asserts that all withheld documents were generated between January 1999 and January 2000, a period in which the Defenders and Trout lawsuits were pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unsuccessful in administrative appeals, Maine filed an action in June 2000, in the United States District Court for the District of Maine alleging that the DOI improperly withheld 308 documents. On cross-motions for summary judgement, the district court issued its decision and order on December 26, 2000, as amended on January 2, 2001. Maine v. DOI, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569647\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569647/maine-v-us-dept-of-interior/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span> (D.Me. 2001). It ordered the DOI immediately to disclose 197 documents to Maine, finding them not exempt under either the attorney-client or work product privileges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Although the district court stayed the immediate disclosure order pending appeal, the DOI released 84 documents and challenged disclosure of the remaining 113 documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the DOI raises two primary issues. First, as to the attorney work product privilege, the DOI claims that the court erred in requiring a withholding agency to demonstrate that a document was prepared \"primarily\" for litigation purposes to protect it from disclosure under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5). Second, the DOI argues that the district court erred in rejecting the agency's assertion of attorney-client privilege for documents containing legal advice and analysis from agency attorneys and draft materials written by agency officials on the ground that the documents do not reveal confidential communications from clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOIA requires government agencies to \"make ... promptly available\" to any person, upon request, whatever \"records\" the agency possessed unless those records fall within one of the statute's exemption. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(3), (b). Even if some information within a document is exempt, the withholding agency must still disclose reasonably segregable non-exempt information. Id. &#167; 552(b). Several years ago, this court had the occasion to review the policy, purpose and sweep of FOIA in Church of Scientology International v. United States Department of Justice, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195518\"><a href=\"/opinion/195518/church-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994). Writing for the court, Judge Coffin noted that the statute's basic purpose is to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny. Id. at 228.

Rule 26(b)(3) for civil discovery, protects from disclosure materials prepared by attorneys \"in anticipation of litigation.\" Since Hickman, courts have reaffirmed the \"strong public policy\" on which the work-product privilege is grounded.

Id. To do so would do nothing to advance the core purpose of the attorney work product privilege which is to protect \"the adversary trial process itself.\" Id. Thus, the court held that to sustain its burden of establishing the attorney work product privilege, the DOI's Vaughn index must identify the litigation for which each document was prepared and establish that the document was prepared primarily for litigation purposes.

Rule 26 and court of appeals cases. The DOI asserts that numerous courts of appeals have rejected the district court's approach here and adopted a \"because of\" standard. The \"because of\" standard is one that determines whether a document is prepared because of existing or expected litigation. United States v. Adlman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751170\"><a href=\"/opinion/751170/united-states-v-monroe-adlman-as-officer-and-representative-of-sequa/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1202 (2d Cir.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adlman provides the most exhaustive discussion, albeit in a non-FOIA context, of the standard adopted by this district court, as well as the one the DOI advances to this court. The court described the issue and the competing standards as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is universally agreed that a document whose purpose is to assist in preparation for litigation is within the scope of the Rule and thus eligible to receive protection if the other conditions of protection prescribed by the Rule are met. The issue is less clear, however, as to documents which, although prepared because of expected litigation, are intended to inform a business decision influenced by the prospects of the litigation. The formulation applied by some courts in determining whether documents are protected by work-product privilege is whether they are prepared \"primarily or exclusively to assist in litigation\" &#8212; a formulation that would potentially exclude documents containing analysis of expected litigation, if their primary, ultimate, or exclusive purpose is to assist in making the business decision. Others ask whether the documents were prepared \"because of\" existing or expected litigation &#8212; a formulation that would include such documents, despite the fact that their purpose is not to \"assist in\" litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1197-98 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Adlman Court reasoned that the \"primary\" standard is at odds with the text and the policies of Rule 26 because nothing in it suggests that documents prepared for dual purposes of litigation and business or agency decisions do not fall within its scope. Id. at 1198-99. Thus, the court rejected the \"primary\" purpose standard as at odds with the literal term and purpose of the Rule. Id. Instead, the court adopted the formulation of the work product rule enunciated by Wright and Miller, 8 Fed. Practice &amp; Procedure, &#167; 2024 at 343 (1994), and adopted by a number of circuits that documents should be deemed prepared for litigation and within the scope of the Rule if, \"in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the document can be fairly said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.\" Id. 1202.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However sound the reasoning in Adlman may be in the civil discovery context, we are not persuaded that it should apply in an action seeking disclosure of documents pursuant to FOIA. As the district court observed, agency decision making on controversial regulations, as this case highlights, usually involves the prospect of litigation and in many cases does lead to litigation. The standard adopted by Adlman would hinder the openness that Congress envisioned in enacting FOIA and shield from disclosure documents that would aid in understanding the decision making process of an agency. Indeed, the Supreme Court has cautioned that \"the discovery rules can only be applied under Exemption 5 by way of rough analogies.\" Mink, 410 U.S. at 86.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of FOIA, as the DOI alleges Maine is doing here, to expand discovery that otherwise would not be available in a civil action, is permissible in light of the Congressional purpose and policy of the Act. Thus, we cannot say that the district court erred in this case in requiring the DOI to demonstrate that the withheld documents were created primarily for litigation purposes in order to claim the work product privilege under 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the DOI argues that the district court erred in finding that the DOI failed sufficiently to disclose that the documents at issue were prepared in anticipation of litigation and to identify the litigation for which the alleged work product documents were prepared. However, this court has held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]t a minimum, an agency seeking to withhold a document ... must identify the litigation for which the document was created (either by name or through factual description) and explain why the work-product privilege applies to all portions of the document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Church of Scientology Int'l, 30 F.3d at 237.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI relies on the two declarations of Edward T. Keable, the Attorney-Advisor, Office of the Solicitor, United States Department of the Interior, that the DOI submitted in support of its summary judgment motion. In the first declaration, Keable asserts that the withheld documents are privileged and refers to his written legal opinion that was sent to Maine during the administrative appeal. However, the declaration is conclusory and not of much help here. In the second declaration, Keable identifies the following lawsuits related to the listing process: (1) Defenders of Wildlife v. Babbitt; (2) Trout Unlimited v. Babbitt; (3) Maine v. Department of Interior; (4) Maine's threat to challenge the final rule; and (5) Maine Aquaculture Association threat of suit if pen permits are modified to protect wild salmon. The declaration is peremptory; it offers no information that the documents requested were prepared primarily for any of these lawsuits. In both the legal opinion and in the corresponding transmittal letter, the DOI explicitly acknowledged it has not identified the litigation to which the withheld documents relate. Rather, it reasoned that because there already have been three law suits directly related to the listing, \"it is reasonable for the attorneys advising the Department to anticipate more litigation at various stages in the process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the Vaughn index also is not helpful. Although the index identifies the documents and describes the general subject matter of each, it fails to demonstrate that any particular document was prepared primarily for litigation and fails to correlate the documents to the lawsuits referred to in the Keable declarations. The mere relation of documents to litigation does not automatically endow those documents with privileged status. The burden was on the DOI to make the correlation between each withheld document and the \"litigation for which the document was created,\" and the district court found that the DOI did not make it. We perceive no error by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the DOI also argued that the district court erred in concluding that FOIA does not exempt from disclosure otherwise privileged factual material in an attorney's work product. Maine, 124 F. Supp.2d at 744-45. Maine moots the issue by withdrawing its request for those nineteen documents still on appeal that the district court ordered disclosed based on this legal holding. At oral argument, counsel for Maine also advised the court that it will make a similar withdrawal with respect to the documents subject to in camera review. Therefore, we will vacate that portion of the district court's order that held that FOIA exemption 5 does not encompass factual components of a privileged attorney work product. Medical Prof'l Mut.

The DOI contends that the court either misunderstood the scope of the attorney-client privilege or applied it very narrowly in finding 81 of the still remaining 94 documents on appeal unprotected by the attorney-client privilege. This privilege protects confidential communications made by a client to his attorney.

The attorney-client privilege \"is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications recognized by law.\" Weinstein's Federal Evidence, &#167; 503.03 (2d Ed.). The modern rationale for the privilege is more practical and expansive, promoting full disclosure by clients to their attorneys; \"it enables attorneys to act more effectively, justly, and expeditiously.\" Id.

The DOI, however, mischaracterizes the district court ruling. The district court held that the DOI failed to demonstrate a confidential factual communication and \"also [failed] to explain how the withheld legal analysis would reveal any such fact if it existed.\" Maine, 124 F. Supp.2d at 742.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, relying on Town of Norfolk, the DOI argues that the court's erroneous view of the scope of the privilege led the court to reject the privilege for documents at the heart of the exchange of information and advice between client. It points to the attorney's advice, the agency's proposed actions, comment on and analysis of the lawyers' draft pleading, the opposing party's pleadings, and discussions of strategy between the lawyer and the client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI's arguments are misplaced. In Town of Norfolk, the court made a finding, absent here, that \"by the content of the letters, it is clear that they relate to facts communicated for the purpose of securing a legal opinion, legal services or assistance in a legal proceeding.\" 968 F.2d at 1458 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the DOI has failed to explain, or even attempt to explain except in conclusory statements, how the documents claimed to be protected establish that they relate to a confidential client communication. It further asserts that the district court erred in requiring the DOI to show definitively that each document reveals the substance of a confidential fact communicated by the client. As we already noted, the court's conclusion of inapplicability of the attorney-client privilege was premised on its determination that the DOI failed to establish the requisite element of a client-communicated confidential fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOI erroneously assumes that the requirement of client communicated confidentiality is satisfied merely because the documents are communications between a client and attorney. The error in this assumption can be found by referring to Mead Data Central, Inc., 566 F.2d at 253, where the court held that the attorney-client privilege \"does not allow the withholding of documents simply because they are the product of an attorney-client relationship.... It must also be demonstrated that the information is confidential.\" (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court here, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Mead found certain documents unprotected by the attorney-client privilege because the withholding agency failed to demonstrate the confidentiality of the information on which they are based. The court found that the withholding party simply failed to demonstrate that the withheld documents contain or relate to information that the client intended to keep confidential and it thus failed to establish an essential element of the privilege. 566 F.2d at 253-54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not discuss each document for which the DOI claims the attorney-client privilege because they all suffer from the same infirmity. The Vaughn index states the names of the individual or individuals preparing each document withheld, the recipient, the claimed privilege, a general description of the document, and the date. A strong example of the index in support of the attorney-client privilege is entry number 112:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">14-page draft statement materials facts from an agency official to the DOJ lawyer representing the Services in the Defenders of Wildlife case in order to assist the lawyer in preparing pleadings in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Church of Scientology International, this court rejected index entries as insufficient \"because they fail to specify whether the source was provided an express or implied grant of confidentiality, or do not provide sufficient detail about the surrounding circumstances to support an expression of implied confidentiality.\" 30 F.3d at 238. The above entry, like the others, including those claimed under work product privilege, is very general, without any explanation justifying the privilege, and fails to identify any circumstance expressly or inferentially supporting confidentiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that Judge Carter, in his analysis of the index and supporting affidavits, committed no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the DOI argues that the court acted prematurely in granting summary judgment.

It argues that at the very least there exist genuine issues of material fact to preclude granting of summary judgment and ordering immediate disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Maine points out, the DOI also requested that this case proceed to disposition on its motion for summary judgment. Further, the DOI has unilateral and uninhibited access to the content of the withheld documents. In Church of Scientology International, this court remanded the case and instructed the parties that after the government has provided additional information, the district court could choose to permit discovery limited to specified documents, conduct in camera review of selected documents, order release of some documents, or a combination of these procedures. 30 F.3d at 239-40. This is the course that the court followed here. It conducted a comprehensive and painstaking review of the documents and the Vaughn index to arrive at its decision. It ordered immediate disclosure for some documents where the DOI failed to satisfy the legal prerequisites of the claimed privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although in Irons v. Bell we cautioned against ordering immediate disclosure of documents based on an agency's admittedly flawed affidavit, especially where the supporting affidavit involves a novel question of law, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365530\"><a href=\"/opinion/365530/peter-hanlon-irons-v-griffin-b-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 471 n. 6 (1st Cir.1979), we perceive no error by this court. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit similarly frowned upon immediate disclosure in Coastal States Gas Corporation v. Department of Energy, but noted that it in no way encouraged agency delay. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388765\"><a href=\"/opinion/388765/energy-mgt-p-26279-coastal-states-gas-corporation-v-department-of-energy/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>, 979 (3d Cir.1981) (Coastal II). It would in the future follow the suggestion of the Court in Coastal States Gas Corporation v. Department of Energy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375896\"><a href=\"/opinion/375896/coastal-states-gas-corporation-v-department-of-energy/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span> (D.C. Cir.1980) (Coastal I), requiring agencies to supply sufficient information the first time so as to allow courts to make a reasoned determination pertaining to the legitimacy of the claimed exemptions. Coastal II, 644 F.2d at 981. Of special pertinence here, the Coastal II court also concluded that to survive summary judgment, it would not be unreasonable to require an agency to stand on its first Vaughn index. Id. at 984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the DOI opposed the discovery of these documents and never requested a hearing or oral argument. It stood on its motion for summary judgment. The DOI never submitted a supplemental or revised index justifying the withholding of the documents under the claimed privilege. The district court adhered to the common standard summary judgment procedure and, under the circumstances, did not abuse its discretion in denying the agency \"a second chance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, as Maine has withdrawn its request for documents related to the district court's holding that factual materials in a privileged attorney work product are not exempt from disclosure, we will vacate that part of the district court's order. For the reasons set forth above, we perceive no error on the part of the district court in the remaining aspects of this case. The order granting Maine's motion for summary judgment and ordering the disclosure of the 94 withheld documents is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Congress enacted the ESA to protect species deemed to be either endangered or threatened.
