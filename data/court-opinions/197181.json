The record in this\r                                                   \r\n\ncase   calls  for  our  writing  something  of  a  primer  on\r\n\nacceptance-of-plea hearings.  First, the background.  Camille\r\n\nBelle  (Belle),  together  with  her husband  and  son,  were\r\n\narrested  on a  criminal complaint  in February  1994.   By a\r\n\nsuperseding indictment  in June  1994 she was  charged, inter\r                                                                         \r\n\nalia, with  various drug offenses, including  conspiracy from\r                \r\n\n1987 to the date of arrest.  In January 1995 she retained new\r\n\ncounsel,  and her (separate) trial  date was set  for May 22.\r\n\nOn the morning of that day Belle told the court she wished to\r\n\nplead.  A plea agreement was drawn, and, after a hearing, her\r\n\nplea  to  six  of the  eight  counts  of  the indictment  was\r\n\naccepted.\r\n\n          On September 7, 1995 a Presentence Report (PSR) was\r\n\nreleased, with objections due by September 21.   On September\r\n\n19, supported by a one page affidavit of counsel, Belle moved\r\n\nfor  leave  to  vacate  her   plea,  and  for  a   competency\r\n\nevaluation.   These  motions were  denied the  following day.\r\n\nThereafter she filed  objections to  the PSR.   A  sentencing\r\n\nhearing was  held  on September  28.   After, in  a two  hour\r\n\naddress,  Belle had informed the court of her views as to how\r\n\nthe  agents  had  treated  her  during  the  \"reverse  sting\"\r\n\noperations that had led to  her indictment, she was sentenced\r\n\nto a minimum-mandatory term of ten years.  She appeals.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Belle's primary complaint is  that her Rule 11 plea\r\n\nhearing was  inadequate.  Of present  relevance the following\r\n\noccurred (numerals ours).\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [1]   Are  you  presently  under  a\r\n                          doctor's care?\r\n\n          BELLE:          Yes, your Honor.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [2]  What did she say?\r\n\n          THE CLERK:      Yes, your Honor.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [3]  Does  the illness that  you're\r\n                          being   treated  for   affect  your\r\n                          ability to understand the nature of\r\n                          these proceedings?\r\n\n          BELLE:          No.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [4]  Have you taken any medicine or\r\n                          pills or drugs today?\r\n\n          BELLE:          Yes, your Honor.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [5]   Is the  ingestion  of any  of\r\n                          those items, medicines or  pills or\r\n                          drugs, does it affect  your ability\r\n                          to understand the  nature of  these\r\n                          proceedings?\r\n\n          BELLE:          No.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [6]    Have  you  ever  been  under\r\n                          psychiatric care?\r\n\n          BELLE:          No, your Honor.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [7]    Counsel,  do  you  know  any\r\n                          reason  why  the  Court should  not\r\n                          accept the plea of guilty?\r\n\n          MR. BALLIRO:    I do not, your Honor.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [8]   Have you had  sufficient time\r\n                          to discuss this  matter fully  with\r\n                          your attorney?\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          BELLE:          Yes.\r\n\n          THE COURT:      [9]   Are  you satisfied  with  his\r\n                          representation of you?\r\n\n          BELLE:          Yes.\r\n\nAfter this exchange, the court found that \"the plea of guilty\r\n\nhas been  knowledgeably offered with an  understanding of its\r\n\npossible consequences.\"\r\n\n          In United  States v.  Parra-Ibanez,  936 F.2d  588,\r                                                        \r\n\n594-95   (1st  Cir.   1991),  after   recognizing   that  the\r\n\nvoluntariness  of the plea is  a core requirement  of Fed. R.\r\n\nCrim.  P. 11, we quoted  with approval from  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCole, 813 F.2d 43, 46 (3d Cir. 1987) that once the court \"has\r                \r\n\nbeen informed that the  defendant has recently ingested drugs\r\n\nor other  substances capable of impairing his ability to make\r\n\na  knowing  and  intelligent  waiver  of  his  constitutional\r\n\nrights,\"  this subject  must be  pursued.   We  repeated this\r\n\nadmonishment in  Carey v. United  States, 50 F.2d  1097, 1099\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1995).  Even without these  authorities this would\r\n\nseem manifest.\r\n\n          We  cannot understand how,  having been informed by\r\n\nthe affirmative  answer to  question 4,  that Belle may  have\r\n\njust ingested  drugs,  the court  would  not have  asked  the\r\n\nobvious.  Her opinion, 5, and  that of her counsel, 7, to the\r\n\neffect that some, unidentified,  substance had not interfered\r\n\nwith her mental abilities,  was, at best, secondary evidence.\r\n\nIt  is not  to be  forgotten that  defendant and  counsel are\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nconcerned parties who  want the plea  accepted.  Their  views\r\n\nare important, and  we certainly do not, at  least initially,\r\n\n(see post),  question the  good faith  or general  ability of\r                     \r\n\ncounsel,  but  the purpose  of a  plea  hearing is  to obtain\r\n\nimpartial findings  upon available basic  facts.  We  are not\r\n\npersuaded by a discomforted  government's argument that these\r\n\nopinions  excused  the  court  \"from  engaging  Belle  in  an\r\n\nextended colloquy  about her various ailments.\"   Rather, the\r\n\ncourt's inquiry was conspicuously deficient.\r\n\n          This  conclusion  may  not  of  itself  warrant the\r\n\nwithdrawal of  the plea.  Apart  from the red flag  answer to\r\n\nquestion 4 the record as a whole  fully warranted the court's\r\n\nconclusion that the plea was voluntary.  Can we then conclude\r\n\nfrom  the  record as  a whole  that  this error  was harmless\r\n\n(e.g., the PSR)?  See Carey, 50 F.3d at 1099.  Here, however,\r                                       \r\n\nwe  run  into a  singular  situation.   According  to Belle's\r\n\ncounsel, on May 22 when her plea  was accepted (and after his\r\n\nbeing with her for  some time), there  was no reason why  her\r\n\nplea should not  be accepted.   (Question 7).   According  to\r\n\nthis same counsel,  by his September affidavit in  support of\r\n\nher motion to withdraw her plea, on May 22 she was \"confused,\r\n\ndisoriented and lacking in comprehension as to the effect  of\r\n\nher agreement to plead guilty.\"\r\n\n          While this affidavit may raise serious questions as\r\n\nto  counsel,  it  surely   weakens  the  reliability  of  his\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nstatement to the court as to defendant's state of mind on May\r\n\n22.    This, together  with the  court's  failure to  ask the\r\n\nobvious question  after 4, prevents us  from determining that\r\n\nthe Rule 11 error was harmless.\r\n\n          As  we did  in Parra-Ibanez,  936 F.2d  at 598,  we\r                                                 \r\n\nremand to the district court for an evidentiary  hearing, its\r\n\nfindings and recommendations  to be forwarded to the clerk of\r\n\nthis court.    This hearing  should include  findings on  the\r\n\ncompanion matters sought to  be raised before us, ante.   Our\r                                                                  \r\n\njurisdiction to continue.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

According to this same counsel, by his September affidavit in support of her motion to withdraw her plea, on May 22 she was \"confused, disoriented and lacking in comprehension as to the effect of her agreement to plead guilty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this affidavit may raise serious questions as to counsel, it surely weakens the reliability of his statement to the court as to defendant's state of mind on May 22.  This, together with the court's failure to ask the obvious question after 4, prevents us from determining that the Rule 11 error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we did in Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d at 598, we remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing, its findings and recommendations to be forwarded to the clerk of this court.

First, the background.  Camille Belle (Belle), together with her husband and son, were arrested on a criminal complaint in February 1994.  By a superseding indictment in June 1994 she was charged, inter alia, with various drug offenses, including conspiracy from 1987 to the date of arrest.  In January 1995 she retained new counsel, and her (separate) trial date was set for May 22.  On the morning of that day Belle told the court she wished to plead.  A plea agreement was drawn, and, after a hearing, her plea to six of the eight counts of the indictment was accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1995 a Presentence Report (PSR) was released, with objections due by September 21.  On September 19, supported by a one page affidavit of counsel, Belle moved for leave to vacate her plea, and for a competency evaluation.  These motions were denied the following day.  Thereafter she filed objections to the PSR. A sentencing hearing was held on September 28.  After, in a two hour address, Belle had informed the court of her views as to how the agents had treated her during the \"reverse sting\" operations that had led to her indictment, she was sentenced to a minimum-mandatory term of ten years.  She appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Belle's primary complaint is that her Rule 11 plea hearing was inadequate.

Parra-Ibanez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563642\"><a href=\"/opinion/563642/united-states-v-francisco-j-parra-ibanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 594-95 (1st Cir.1991), after recognizing that the voluntariness of the plea is a core requirement of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, we quoted with approval from United States v. Cole, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484269\"><a href=\"/opinion/484269/united-states-v-cole-reginald-appeal-of-reginald-cole/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 46 (3d Cir.1987) that once the court \"has been informed that the defendant has recently ingested drugs or other substances capable of impairing his ability to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights,\" this subject must be pursued.  We repeated this admonishment in Carey v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></span>, 1099 (1st Cir.1995).  Even without these authorities this would seem manifest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot understand how, having been informed by the affirmative answer to question 4, that Belle may have just ingested drugs, the court would not have asked the obvious.  Her opinion, 5, and that of her counsel, 7, to the effect that some, unidentified, substance had not interfered with her mental abilities, was, at best, secondary evidence.  It is not to be forgotten that defendant and counsel are concerned parties who want the plea accepted.  Their views are important, and we certainly do not, at least initially, (see post ), question the good faith or general ability of counsel, but the purpose of a plea hearing is to obtain impartial findings upon available basic facts.  We are not persuaded by a discomforted government's argument that these opinions excused the court \"from engaging Belle in an extended colloquy about her various ailments.\"   Rather, the court's inquiry was conspicuously deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion may not of itself warrant the withdrawal of the plea.  Apart from the red flag answer to question 4 the record as a whole fully warranted the court's conclusion that the plea was voluntary.  Can we then conclude from the record as a whole that this error was harmless (e.g., the PSR)?   See Carey, 50 F.3d at 1099.   Here, however, we run into a singular situation.  According to Belle's counsel, on May 22 when her plea was accepted (and after his being with her for some time), there was no reason why her plea should not be accepted.  (Question 7).  According to this same counsel, by his September affidavit in support of her motion to withdraw her plea, on May 22 she was \"confused, disoriented and lacking in comprehension as to the effect of her agreement to plead guilty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this affidavit may raise serious questions as to counsel, it surely weakens the reliability of his statement to the court as to defendant's state of mind on May 22.  This, together with the court's failure to ask the obvious question after 4, prevents us from determining that the Rule 11 error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we did in Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d at 598, we remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing, its findings and recommendations to be forwarded to the clerk of this court.
