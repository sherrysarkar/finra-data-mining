Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                   Before\r\n\n          Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n     Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n        and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJune M. White on brief pro se.\r\nLoretta C. Argrett, Assistant Attorney General, Gary D. Grayand Edward T. Perelmuter, Attorneys, Tax Division, Department of\r\nJustice and Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nApril 7, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  After careful consideration of the briefs and\r\nrecord below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.  The\r\nappellant argues that the district court should have ruled on the\r\nissue of the timing of the notice of the 1985 tax deficiency. She\r\neffectively seeks belated review of the 1992 Tax Court decision. \r\nThe district court had no power to review the Tax Court's decision. \r\n26 U.S.C.  7482, 7483. \r\nThe appellant sought, and the government agreed to, a\r\nredetermination of her 1985 income tax liability.  The appellant\r\nagreed to be bound by that redetermination.  She fails to show that\r\nthe agreement was not binding.  Her belated decision, on the basis\r\nof new evidence, that it would have been better to litigate the\r\nnotice issue, an issue which could not have been litigated in\r\ndistrict court, cannot free her from her obligations under the\r\nagreement.  Mathewson Corporation v. Allied Marine Industries, Inc. \r\n827 F.2d 850, 856 (1st Cir. 1987); Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v.\r\nBaccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 17, (1st Cir. 1996)  .\r\nAffirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
