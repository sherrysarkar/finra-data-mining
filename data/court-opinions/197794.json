Pamela Piper, who suffers from urinary\r                                \r\n\nincontinence and other impairments, appeals from the district\r\n\ncourt's  judgment upholding the denial of her application for\r\n\nSocial  Security  benefits  by  the  Commissioner  of  Social\r\n\nSecurity.  After  a careful review of the  record, we affirm,\r\n\nessentially for  the reasons  given in  the district  court's\r\n\nopinion.  The  following addresses only the  most significant\r\n\nissue raised by appellant.  \r\n\n          Piper  objects  to the  hypothetical  posed  by the\r\n\nadministrative law  judge  (ALJ) at  her disability  hearing.\r\n\nShe contends that the ALJ  erred in postulating an individual\r\n\nwho  needed to  use the  bathroom  \"at will.\"   Although  the\r\n\nvocational  expert  (VE)  originally testified  that  such an\r\n\nindividual could  perform certain  sedentary and  light jobs,\r\n\nthe VE later clarified that the individual could not do so if\r\n\nthe bathroom trips were \"frequent,\"  i.e., took place ten  or\r\n\nmore times per eight-hour work  day in addition to breaks and\r\n\nlunch, or more than once  per hour in addition to  breaks and\r\n\nlunch.  In his opinion, the  ALJ used the ambiguous \"at will\"\r\n\nlanguage in describing  Piper's limitations and did  not make\r\n\nan express finding  on the critical question  whether Piper's\r\n\nuse of the  bathroom was frequent.  See  Ellison v. Sullivan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n921 F.2d 816,  822 (8th Cir. 1990)  (an ALJ may not  ignore a\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n\"critical  assumption\"   underlying  a   vocational  expert's\r\n\ntestimony).\r\n\n          Like the district  court, we conclude that  the ALJ\r\n\nimplicitly  and supportably determined that Piper did not use\r\n\nthe bathroom so frequently as to preclude employment.   Based\r\n\non  her treatment  and  employment  history,  activities  and\r\n\nreported tendency  to exaggerate  her symptoms,  the ALJ  was\r\n\nwarranted in concluding that her need for bathroom breaks was\r\n\nbelow the more  than one time  per hour figure  which the  VE\r\n\nsaid would compromise  her ability to work.  It was the ALJ's\r\n\nresponsibility to determine issues of credibility and to draw\r\n\ninferences from the  record evidence.   See Irlanda Ortiz  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSecretary of Health &amp; Human  Services, 955 F.2d 765, 769 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1991) (given the  claimant's treatment history  and the\r\n\nmedical evidence,  the ALJ did  not err in deciding  that the\r\n\nclaimant's  complaints  were  not  credible  \"to  the  extent\r\n\nalleged\").  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
