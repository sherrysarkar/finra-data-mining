Engelhard Corporation appeals from\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment, and its award of\n\n$597,463 in damages plus $191,029.60 in prejudgment interest, in\n\nfavor of the Rhode Island Charities Trust (\"the Trust\").                        The\n\nfacts are somewhat complicated but undisputed.\n\n              In 1937, the Trust was formed for the purpose of\n\ndistributing money grants for charitable purposes.                   In 1948, the\n\nTrust       purchased   Southern   Clays,    Inc.,     a    kaolin   mining     and\n\nprocessing company based in Georgia.             Kaolin is a clay which,\n\namong other uses, is widely employed in the paper industry.                      In\n\n1963, the Trust sold nearly all of the assets of Southern Clays,\n\nwith the exception of certain clay properties in Washington\n\nCounty, Georgia, to the Freeport Sulphur Company (\"Freeport\").\n\n              At the same time, Southern Clays and Freeport entered\n\ninto    a    ninety-nine    year   agreement    (the       \"Indenture\")    as    to\n\nproperties containing the clay.              Some of the properties are\n\nowned in fee by the Trust (the \"fee properties\"), while other\n\nproperties are owned by third parties who have entered into\n\nmineral leases with the Trust with termination dates ranging\n\nfrom    1967    to   2023   (the   \"leased     properties\").          Under     the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fIndenture the Trust leased the fee properties to Freeport, and\n\nit assigned to Freeport its rights as to the leased properties.\n\nEngelhard acquired Freeport in 1985 and is its successor in\n\ninterest; the Trust has succeeded to Southern Clays' rights\n\nunder the Indenture.\n\n           The Indenture, whose pertinent provisions are reprinted\n\nin an appendix to this decision, requires a royalty payment to\n\nthe Trust from Engelhard in consideration of the latter's right\n\nto mine the clay from the covered properties.              To oversimplify\n\nslightly, the royalty rate for each period was 1.5 percent of\n\nEngelhard's      \"net   receipts\"    from   kaolin      derived    from   the\n\nproperties and sold by Engelhard during the period.                Indenture\n\n¶ 5(a).   Engelhard was also required to pay real estate taxes on\n\nthe fee properties and to make various payments on the leased\n\nproperties, including the royalties that the Trust was required\n\nto pay to the third-party owners.           Id. ¶ 7(a), (c).       Engelhard\n\nwas entitled to deduct these payments from the royalties it paid\n\nto the Trust.     Id. ¶ 7(b).\n\n           One    other   set   of   provisions    in   the   Indenture    is\n\nimportant to the dispute that is now before us.            With respect to\n\nthe   leased     properties,    Engelhard    was     entitled     under   the\n\nIndenture to alter, modify, renew, or extend those third-party\n\nleases (by agreement with the relevant third-party owners).\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fIndenture ¶ 2(e).         This could be done either before or upon\n\nexpiration and without the Trust's consent.          Id.   But, as to any\n\nchanges effective before the preexisting termination date of a\n\nlease that was renewed or extended, any increase in fixed costs\n\nor in the royalties payable to the owners under the new terms\n\nwas to be borne by Engelhard.          Id.\n\n            This case centers around a group of leased properties\n\nthat are described in paragraph 23 of the Indenture (the \"Veal\n\nleases\").    The Veal leases all had a royalty rate negotiated\n\nyears ago that is very low by current prices ($.11 per cubic\n\nyard) and had termination dates of March 23, 1995.            Because of\n\nroyalty disputes with the third-party owners, Engelhard did not\n\nmine the properties until the 1990s.         In August 1990, Engelhard\n\nagreed with the owners to extend the terms for 20 years and\n\nincrease royalties immediately--by a multiple of almost 30--to\n\n$3 per cubic yard on three leases and $2.90 on the fourth. For\n\nthe remainder of the preexisting lease terms, Engelhard absorbed\n\nthe cost of the increased royalties.\n\n            Then,   in    mid-1995,    Engelhard   began   deducting   the\n\nincreased royalties on the Veal lease extensions from the total\n\nroyalties due to the Trust from all covered properties--not just\n\nthe Veal leases--with drastic effects on the payments otherwise\n\ndue to the Trust.        Although Engelhard's semi-annual payments to\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe Trust usually exceeded $300,000, the payment for the last\n\nsix months of 1995 was $30,000.            By its calculations, the Trust\n\nwas effectively       paying Engelhard, by a reduction in royalty\n\npayments, about $1.80 for each cubic yard Engelhard mined on\n\nVeal properties.\n\n            In due course, the Trust brought suit against Engelhard\n\nin   federal    district     court   in    Rhode     Island.       The   complaint\n\nalleged that Engelhard had violated the terms of the Indenture,\n\nviolated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\n\nand violated an alleged fiduciary duty owed by Engelhard to the\n\nTrust.     On cross motions for summary judgment, the district\n\ncourt held for the Trust on the implied covenant claim and for\n\nEngelhard      on   the   contract   and       fiduciary    duty      counts.      In\n\nsubstance, the court held that Engelhard could not deduct the\n\nincreased      royalty    payments    on       the   Veal   leases     from     other\n\nroyalties due to the Trust.\n\n            Engelhard now appeals to this court.                 It says that the\n\ndistrict    court    erred    so   far    as    it   favored     the   Trust    and,\n\nfurther, in awarding prejudgment interest to the Trust as to\n\nroyalties wrongly withheld by Engelhard since 1995.                    The parties\n\nare agreed that Georgia law governs the contract-related issues;\n\nthey   disagree      about   whose   law       controls     as   to    prejudgment\n\ninterest.      On the grant of summary judgment and the legal issues\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fpresented as to prejudgment interest, our review is de novo.\n\nAugat v. Fenoglio, 254 F.3d 368, 370 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            In our view the able district judge reached the correct\n\nresult     and   our     own    analysis       differs     only    in    emphasis.\n\nSpecifically, we think that the contract, read in the framework\n\nof plausible business expectations, can reasonably be read only\n\none way, namely, to preclude the negative royalty deductions\n\nsought by Engelhard and, for that reason, the district court's\n\njudgment    is   correct       without   regard    to    the     Trust's   implied\n\ncovenant claim.        But the difference is more a matter of labels\n\nthan of substance.\n\n            The critical language of the Indenture provides in\n\nparagraph    5   for   the     1.5   percent     royalty    to    the    Trust.   In\n\nsubparagraph      7(a)     the       Indenture    sets     forth        Engelhard's\n\nobligation to pay both (i) taxes on fee properties and (ii)\n\npayments on leased properties that the original lessee must pay\n\n\"other than royalties on production, provision for which is made\n\nin [subparagraph 7(c)].\"             Subparagraph 7(b) then allows \"[t]he\n\naggregate amount\" of all such payments under subparagraph 7(a)--\n\ntaxes and non-royalty payments--to be deducted by Engelhard from\n\n\"the aggregate royalties\" payable to the Trust.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f            Subparagraph 7(c) then treats in a single provision the\n\nsubject of production royalties payable to the owners of leased\n\nland and credits for payment of those royalties:\n\n               [Engelhard] also agrees to pay to the\n            person entitled thereto all royalties based\n            on production required to be paid under the\n            Leases, but with respect to any Lease only\n            so long as [Engelhard] remains an assignee\n            thereof; provided, however, that [Engelhard]\n            shall be entitled to a credit for any\n            amounts paid or payable by it pursuant to\n            this subparagraph (c) against royalties\n            thereafter payable to [The Trust] under the\n            provisions of Paragraph 5 of this Agreement.\n\n            It is this \"entitled to a credit\" language on which\n\nEngelhard relies in deducting the full amount of the Veal lease\n\nroyalties paid to the landowners from the total royalty package\n\nowed by Engelhard to the Trust under the Indenture.             The Trust,\n\nit should be stressed, does not claim to be owed any royalties\n\nafter mid-1995 from sales by Engelhard of kaolin derived from\n\nthe Veal properties.     It simply wants to prevent its non-Veal\n\nrelated royalties from being reduced because of the increased\n\nroyalties that Engelhard has agreed to pay the Veal property\n\nowners.\n\n            Although   Engelhard      thinks   that    the    language     of\n\nsubparagraph 7(c) is unequivocally in its favor, this is far\n\nfrom true.    Indeed, if words alone are considered, the Trust can\n\npoint--as    the   district   court    noted--to      the    contrast    with\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fsubparagraph 7(b) which (unlike subparagraph 7(c)) provides for\n\nthe deduction of the specified items from aggregate royalties\n\nowed to the Trust.     But it is guesswork whether the omission of\n\nthe   term   \"aggregate\"   in   subparagraph   7(c)   was   intended   to\n\ncontrol the issue before us; quite likely the drafters never\n\nenvisaged the precise problem.      Certainly, there is no extrinsic\n\nevidence that they did.1\n\n             But even if the language taken in the abstract is not\n\ndecisive in the Trust's favor and even if the drafters never\n\nfocused on the risk of negative royalties, only one reading of\n\nthe contract makes any sense.       No rational party in the Trust's\n\nposition would agree to such negative royalties, nor would\n\nanyone in Engelhard's position demand such an option, because it\n\nwould create an extraordinary perverse incentive for Engelhard\n\nto engage in otherwise irrational conduct and would create an\n\nunlimited risk to the Trust's legitimate general expectations.\n\nThe point is so obvious as to require only brief explanation.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n     In an attempt to show that the parties considered the\npresent scenario, Engelhard points to subparagraph 2(e), which\nprovides that Engelhard shall not modify any existing lease\nunless it agrees to pay any additional fixed costs or royalties\nitself for the period prior to the lease's natural termination\ndate. This provision does nothing to suggest that the parties\nthought about increased royalties being deducted from the\naggregate royalties owed to the Trust after the natural\ntermination date.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f              If the contract were read as the Trust urges, it might\n\nwell make economic sense for Engelhard to agree to a lease\n\nextension      for   the   Veal   property     coupled      with   a   very   large\n\nincrease in royalties paid to the owners.                That would depend on\n\nwhether the increase in kaolin prices was large enough for\n\nEngelhard to pay a greatly increased royalty to the Veals and\n\nstill    have   room   for    a   reasonable       profit    after     mining   and\n\nprocessing costs were paid.           In fact, although unnecessary to\n\nour reasoning, it appears that               Engelhard (reasonably enough)\n\npaid $3 or less in royalties to the Veal property owners while\n\nthe kaolin could be sold for $4 or more.\n\n              But if the contract were read as Engelhard urges, then\n\nit would have an incentive to pay royalties on extended leases\n\nin any amount necessary to secure the extension up the point\n\nthat all of the Trust's other royalties were wiped out.                          Of\n\ncourse, Engelhard might always prefer to pay the third party\n\nowners as little as possible.           Nevertheless, its reading would\n\nmake it profitable (for Engelhard) to make lease extensions that\n\nwere economically unsound as a whole (e.g., on high extraction-\n\ncost property) simply because it could offload the royalty costs\n\nonto    the   Trust,   which      received    no    benefit    from     the   lease\n\nextension.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f           There is a long tradition in contract law of reading\n\ncontracts sensibly; contracts--certainly business contracts of\n\nthe kind involved here--are not parlor games but the means of\n\ngetting the world's work done.     Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank,\n\n247 F.3d 300, 302 (1st Cir. 2001).      Even where courts are sure\n\nthat the parties never thought about an issue, small wrinkles\n\nmay be ironed out by interpretation where it is clear how the\n\nparties would have handled them.      Farnsworth, Contracts § 7.16,\n\nat 545 (1990).   Although no Georgia case directly in point has\n\nbeen cited to us, we are confident that Georgia courts are as\n\ncommonsensical as those elsewhere in the country.        See Ga. R.R.\n\nBank & Trust v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 758 F.2d 1548, 1551\n\n(11th Cir. 1985).\n\n           True, parties can contract for preposterous terms.       If\n\ncontract language is crystal clear or there is independent\n\nextrinsic evidence that something silly was actually intended,\n\na party may be held to its bargain, absent some specialized\n\ndefense.    But the language here is not at all clearly in\n\nEngelhard's favor; nor is there any extrinsic evidence as to\n\noriginal   intent.   Some   evidence    exists   of   what   Engelhard\n\nunilaterally thought when it began to negotiate the extensions,\n\nand it is seemingly unhelpful to Engelhard's current position;\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fbut the post-Indenture views of one side are in any event poor\n\nevidence of what the parties originally negotiated.\n\n           In    our    view   there     was    nothing   unreasonable       about\n\nEngelhard's extension of the Veal leases: the transaction looks\n\nas if it made sense, and Engelhard thought it made sense, even\n\nif it could not deduct the higher third party royalties against\n\nnon-Veal lease royalties owed to the Trust.               And this is so even\n\nthough the extensions might wipe out all Veal lease royalties to\n\nthe Trust after mid-1995; the Trust, after all, had no assurance\n\nthat the Veal leases could ever be extended on terms that would\n\ngive the Trust anything after mid-1995.\n\n           The problem for us is not that the leases were extended\n\non the terms agreed between Engelhard and the owners but that\n\nEngelhard wants to deduct the new royalties due to the Veal\n\nowners not just from the royalties due to the Trust on the Veal\n\nleases but also from the Trust's other royalties.                  Possibly the\n\ncovenant   of    good    faith    and    fair    dealing,      compare    West   v.\n\nKoufman,   384    S.E.2d       664,    666     (Ga.   1989),    with     Automatic\n\nSprinkler Corp. of Am. v. Anderson, 257 S.E.2d 283, 284 (Ga.\n\n1979), could be used in this context--not to \"limit discretion\"\n\nbut as a gap-filler for a situation not anticipated by the\n\nparties.   See Thomas Diamond & Howard Foss, Proposed Standards\n\nfor Evaluating When the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fHas Been Violated: A Framework for Resolving The Mystery, 47\n\nHastings    L.J.    585,     586-87    (1996).      But    to   us   it    is   more\n\nstraightforward simply to say that subparagraph 7(c) does not\n\npermit the deduction of royalties on an aggregate basis but only\n\non a lease-by-lease basis.\n\n            Separately, Engelhard asks us to reverse the district\n\ncourt's award to the Trust of prejudgment interest on the unpaid\n\nroyalties.        Applying     Rhode    Island    law,    the   district        judge\n\ndirected that the statutory rate of 12 percent interest apply\n\nfrom date of accrual to date of judgment.                  R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-\n\n21-10     (1997).        Engelhard     says     that     Georgia     law   governs\n\nprejudgment       interest    and     under    Georgia    law   no   prejudgment\n\ninterest,    or     at   least   a    lesser    amount,    would     be    awarded.\n\nO.C.G.A. § 7-4-2 (Michie 1997); id. § 13-6-13 (Michie 1982).\n\n            Under settled conflict principles, the question whether\n\nRhode Island or Georgia rules on prejudgment interest should be\n\napplied by a district court sitting in diversity in Rhode Island\n\ndepends on how a Rhode Island state court would resolve the\n\nmatter.     Klaxon v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496\n\n(1941); Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co. Ltd., 41\n\nF.3d 764, 774 (1st Cir. 1994).                Here, there is every reason,\n\nshort of an unqualified decision by the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt, to believe that--as the district court held in a bench\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fruling--Rhode Island courts measure the award as a matter of\n\nRhode Island law even where the dispute is controlled by the\n\nsubstantive law of another state.\n\n          The Rhode Island prejudgment statute, typically enough,\n\ndoes not contain any choice of law directions.       We are forbidden\n\nunder   Supreme   Court   precedent,   see   Salve   Regina   Coll.   v.\n\nRussell, 499 U.S. 225, 238-39 (1991), from giving any separate\n\nweight to the fact that the district judge is expert in Rhode\n\nIsland law, having sat for many years on the state court and\n\nthen on the federal court in Rhode Island.       So we merely record\n\nhis factual report that in over 30 years on the bench, he never\n\nheard of a case of a Rhode Island court applying the prejudgment\n\ninterest law of a different state.\n\n          In all events, some states, like Massachusetts, treat\n\nprejudgment interest as substantive, Morris v. Watsco, Inc., 433\n\nN.E.2d 886, 889 (Mass. 1982); Commercial Union, 41 F.3d at 774,\n\nwhile \"others associate prejudgment interest with costs and\n\nattorneys' fees which are governed by the law of the forum,\" Am.\n\nHome Assurance Co. v. Dykema, Gossett, Spencer, Goodnow & Trigg,\n\n811 F.2d 1077, 1088 (7th Cir. 1987).          What little precedent\n\nexists on this issue in Rhode Island suggests that for conflict\n\nof law purposes, Rhode Island courts view their own prejudgment\n\ninterest statute as \"procedural\" (and so governed by local law)\n\n\n                                -13-\n\frather than \"substantive.\"           Holmes v.

The facts are somewhat complicated but undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1937, the Trust was formed for the purpose of distributing money grants for charitable purposes. In 1948, the Trust purchased Southern Clays, Inc., a kaolin mining and processing company based in Georgia. Kaolin is a clay which, among other uses, is widely employed in the paper industry. In 1963, the Trust sold nearly all of the assets of Southern Clays, with the exception of certain clay properties in Washington County, Georgia, to the Freeport Sulphur Company (\"Freeport\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, Southern Clays and Freeport entered into a ninety-nine year agreement (the \"Indenture\") as to properties containing the clay. Some of the properties are owned in fee by the Trust (the \"fee properties\"), while other properties are owned by third parties who have entered into mineral leases with the Trust with termination dates ranging from 1967 to 2023 (the \"leased properties\"). Under the Indenture the Trust leased the fee properties to Freeport, and it assigned to Freeport its rights as to the leased properties. Engelhard acquired Freeport in 1985 and is its successor in interest; the Trust has succeeded to Southern Clays' rights under the Indenture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Indenture, whose pertinent provisions are reprinted in an appendix to this decision, requires a royalty payment to the Trust from Engelhard in consideration of the latter's right to mine the clay from the covered properties. To oversimplify slightly, the royalty rate for each period was 1.5 percent of Engelhard's \"net receipts\" from kaolin derived from the properties and sold by Engelhard during the period. Indenture &#182; 5(a). Engelhard was also required to pay real estate taxes on the fee properties and to make various payments on the leased properties, including the royalties that the Trust was required to pay to the third-party owners. Id. &#182; 7(a), (c). Engelhard was entitled to deduct these payments from the royalties it paid to the Trust. Id. &#182; 7(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other set of provisions in the Indenture is important to the dispute that is now before us. With respect to the leased properties, Engelhard was entitled under the Indenture to alter, modify, renew, or extend those third-party leases (by agreement with the relevant third-party owners). Indenture &#182; 2(e). This could be done either before or upon expiration and without the Trust's consent. Id. But, as to any changes effective before the preexisting termination date of a lease that was renewed or extended, any increase in fixed costs or in the royalties payable to the owners under the new terms was to be borne by Engelhard. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case centers around a group of leased properties that are described in paragraph 23 of the Indenture (the \"Veal leases\"). The Veal leases all had a royalty rate negotiated years ago that is very low by current prices ($.11 per cubic yard) and had termination dates of March 23, 1995. Because of royalty disputes with the third-party owners, Engelhard did not mine the properties until the 1990s. In August 1990, Engelhard agreed with the owners to extend the terms for 20 years and increase royalties immediately--by a multiple of almost 30--to $3 per cubic yard on three leases and $2.90 on the fourth. For the remainder of the preexisting lease terms, Engelhard absorbed the cost of the increased royalties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in mid-1995, Engelhard began deducting the increased royalties on the Veal lease extensions from the total royalties due to the Trust from all covered properties--not just the Veal leases--with drastic effects on the payments otherwise due to the Trust. Although Engelhard's semi-annual payments to the Trust usually exceeded $300,000, the payment for the last six months of 1995 was $30,000. By its calculations, the Trust was effectively paying Engelhard, by a reduction in royalty payments, about $1.80 for each cubic yard Engelhard mined on Veal properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the Trust brought suit against Engelhard in federal district court in Rhode Island. The complaint alleged that Engelhard had violated the terms of the Indenture, violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violated an alleged fiduciary duty owed by Engelhard to the Trust. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held for the Trust on the implied covenant claim and for Engelhard on the contract and fiduciary duty counts. In substance, the court held that Engelhard could not deduct the increased royalty payments on the Veal leases from other royalties due to the Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Engelhard now appeals to this court. It says that the district court erred so far as it favored the Trust and, further, in awarding prejudgment interest to the Trust as to royalties wrongly withheld by Engelhard since 1995. The parties are agreed that Georgia law governs the contract-related issues; they disagree about whose law controls as to prejudgment interest. On the grant of summary judgment and the legal issues presented as to prejudgment interest, our review is de novo. Augat v. Fenoglio, 254 F.3d 368, 370 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view the able district judge reached the correct result and our own analysis differs only in emphasis. Specifically, we think that the contract, read in the framework of plausible business expectations, can reasonably be read only one way, namely, to preclude the negative royalty deductions sought by Engelhard and, for that reason, the district court's judgment is correct without regard to the Trust's implied covenant claim. But the difference is more a matter of labels than of substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical language of the Indenture provides in paragraph 5 for the 1.5 percent royalty to the Trust. In subparagraph 7(a) the Indenture sets forth Engelhard's obligation to pay both (i) taxes on fee properties and (ii) payments on leased properties that the original lessee must pay \"other than royalties on production, provision for which is made in [subparagraph 7(c)].\" Subparagraph 7(b) then allows \"[t]he aggregate amount\" of all such payments under subparagraph 7(a)--taxes and non-royalty payments--to be deducted by Engelhard from \"the aggregate royalties\" payable to the Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subparagraph 7(c) then treats in a single provision the subject of production royalties payable to the owners of leased land and credits for payment of those royalties:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Engelhard] also agrees to pay to the person entitled thereto all royalties based on production required to be paid under the Leases, but with respect to any Lease only so long as [Engelhard] remains an assignee thereof; provided, however, that [Engelhard] shall be entitled to a credit for any amounts paid or payable by it pursuant to this subparagraph (c) against royalties thereafter payable to [The Trust] under the provisions of Paragraph 5 of this Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this \"entitled to a credit\" language on which Engelhard relies in deducting the full amount of the Veal lease royalties paid to the landowners from the total royalty package owed by Engelhard to the Trust under the Indenture. The Trust, it should be stressed, does not claim to be owed any royalties after mid-1995 from sales by Engelhard of kaolin derived from the Veal properties. It simply wants to prevent its non-Veal related royalties from being reduced because of the increased royalties that Engelhard has agreed to pay the Veal property owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Engelhard thinks that the language of subparagraph 7(c) is unequivocally in its favor, this is far from true. Indeed, if words alone are considered, the Trust can point--as the district court noted--to the contrast with subparagraph 7(b) which (unlike subparagraph 7(c)) provides for the deduction of the specified items from aggregate royalties owed to the Trust. But it is guesswork whether the omission of the term \"aggregate\" in subparagraph 7(c) was intended to control the issue before us; quite likely the drafters never envisaged the precise problem. Certainly, there is no extrinsic evidence that they did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if the language taken in the abstract is not decisive in the Trust's favor and even if the drafters never focused on the risk of negative royalties, only one reading of the contract makes any sense. No rational party in the Trust's position would agree to such negative royalties, nor would anyone in Engelhard's position demand such an option, because it would create an extraordinary perverse incentive for Engelhard to engage in otherwise irrational conduct and would create an unlimited risk to the Trust's legitimate general expectations. The point is so obvious as to require only brief explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the contract were read as the Trust urges, it might well make economic sense for Engelhard to agree to a lease extension for the Veal property coupled with a very large increase in royalties paid to the owners. That would depend on whether the increase in kaolin prices was large enough for Engelhard to pay a greatly increased royalty to the Veals and still have room for a reasonable profit after mining and processing costs were paid. In fact, although unnecessary to our reasoning, it appears that Engelhard (reasonably enough) paid $3 or less in royalties to the Veal property owners while the kaolin could be sold for $4 or more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the contract were read as Engelhard urges, then it would have an incentive to pay royalties on extended leases in any amount necessary to secure the extension up the point that all of the Trust's other royalties were wiped out. Of course, Engelhard might always prefer to pay the third party owners as little as possible. Nevertheless, its reading would make it profitable (for Engelhard) to make lease extensions that were economically unsound as a whole (e.g., on high extraction-cost property) simply because it could offload the royalty costs onto the Trust, which received no benefit from the lease extension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a long tradition in contract law of reading contracts sensibly; contracts--certainly business contracts of the kind involved here--are not parlor games but the means of getting the world's work done. Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank, 247 F.3d 300, 302 (1st Cir. 2001). Even where courts are sure that the parties never thought about an issue, small wrinkles may be ironed out by interpretation where it is clear how the parties would have handled them. Farnsworth, Contracts &#167; 7.16, at 545 (1990). Although no Georgia case directly in point has been cited to us, we are confident that Georgia courts are as commonsensical as those elsewhere in the country. See Ga. R.R. Bank &amp; Trust v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 758 F.2d 1548, 1551 (11th Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, parties can contract for preposterous terms. If contract language is crystal clear or there is independent extrinsic evidence that something silly was actually intended, a party may be held to its bargain, absent some specialized defense. But the language here is not at all clearly in Engelhard's favor; nor is there any extrinsic evidence as to original intent. Some evidence exists of what Engelhard unilaterally thought when it began to negotiate the extensions, and it is seemingly unhelpful to Engelhard's current position; but the post-Indenture views of one side are in any event poor evidence of what the parties originally negotiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view there was nothing unreasonable about Engelhard's extension of the Veal leases: the transaction looks as if it made sense, and Engelhard thought it made sense, even if it could not deduct the higher third party royalties against non-Veal lease royalties owed to the Trust. And this is so even though the extensions might wipe out all Veal lease royalties to the Trust after mid-1995; the Trust, after all, had no assurance that the Veal leases could ever be extended on terms that would give the Trust anything after mid-1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem for us is not that the leases were extended on the terms agreed between Engelhard and the owners but that Engelhard wants to deduct the new royalties due to the Veal owners not just from the royalties due to the Trust on the Veal leases but also from the Trust's other royalties. Possibly the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, compare West v. Koufman, 384 S.E.2d 664, 666 (Ga. 1989), with Automatic Sprinkler Corp. of Am. v. Anderson, 257 S.E.2d 283, 284 (Ga. 1979), could be used in this context--not to \"limit discretion\" but as a gap-filler for a situation not anticipated by the parties. See Thomas Diamond &amp; Howard Foss, Proposed Standards for Evaluating When the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Has Been Violated: A Framework for Resolving The Mystery, 47 Hastings L.J. 585, 586-87 (1996). But to us it is more straightforward simply to say that subparagraph 7(c) does not permit the deduction of royalties on an aggregate basis but only on a lease-by-lease basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Separately, Engelhard asks us to reverse the district court's award to the Trust of prejudgment interest on the unpaid royalties. Applying Rhode Island law, the district judge directed that the statutory rate of 12 percent interest apply from date of accrual to date of judgment. R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-21-10 (1997). Engelhard says that Georgia law governs prejudgment interest and under Georgia law no prejudgment interest, or at least a lesser amount, would be awarded. O.C.G.A. &#167; 7-4-2 (Michie 1997); id. &#167; 13-6-13 (Michie 1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under settled conflict principles, the question whether Rhode Island or Georgia rules on prejudgment interest should be applied by a district court sitting in diversity in Rhode Island depends on how a Rhode Island state court would resolve the matter. Klaxon v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941); Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co. Ltd., 41 F.3d 764, 774 (1st Cir. 1994). Here, there is every reason, short of an unqualified decision by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, to believe that--as the district court held in a bench ruling--Rhode Island courts measure the award as a matter of Rhode Island law even where the dispute is controlled by the substantive law of another state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island prejudgment statute, typically enough, does not contain any choice of law directions. We are forbidden under Supreme Court precedent, see Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 238-39 (1991), from giving any separate weight to the fact that the district judge is expert in Rhode Island law, having sat for many years on the state court and then on the federal court in Rhode Island. So we merely record his factual report that in over 30 years on the bench, he never heard of a case of a Rhode Island court applying the prejudgment interest law of a different state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, some states, like Massachusetts, treat prejudgment interest as substantive, Morris v. Watsco, Inc., 433 N.E.2d 886, 889 (Mass. 1982); Commercial Union, 41 F.3d at 774, while \"others associate prejudgment interest with costs and attorneys' fees which are governed by the law of the forum,\" Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Dykema, Gossett, Spencer, Goodnow &amp; Trigg, 811 F.2d 1077, 1088 (7th Cir. 1987). What little precedent exists on this issue in Rhode Island suggests that for conflict of law purposes, Rhode Island courts view their own prejudgment interest statute as \"procedural\" (and so governed by local law) rather than \"substantive.\" Holmes v. Bateson, 434 F. Supp. 1365, 1391 (D.R.I. 1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that prejudgment interest is viewed simply as an element of damages, standard conflict analysis would associate it with the substantive law governing the controversy, here, Georgia law. But Rhode Island prejudgment interest, although partly intended to compensate the plaintiff for temporary loss of the use of his money, is also administrative, being intended to promote the prompt settlement of claims. Roy v. Star Chopper Co., Inc., 584 F.2d 1124, 1135 (1st Cir. 1978); Isserlis v. Dir. of Pub. Works, 300 A.2d 273, 274 (R.I. 1973). Given the latter objective, there is patently a local interest in applying Rhode Island's prejudgment rule even to \"foreign\" causes of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

The facts are somewhat complicated but undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1937, the Trust was formed for the purpose of distributing money grants for charitable purposes. In 1948, the Trust purchased Southern Clays, Inc., a kaolin mining and processing company based in Georgia. Kaolin is a clay which, among other uses, is widely employed in the paper industry. In 1963, the Trust sold nearly all of the assets of Southern Clays, with the exception of certain clay properties in Washington County, Georgia, to the Freeport Sulphur Company (\"Freeport\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, Southern Clays and Freeport entered into a ninety-nine year agreement (the \"Indenture\") as to properties containing the clay. Some of the properties are owned in fee by the Trust (the \"fee properties\"), while other properties are owned by third parties who have entered into mineral leases with the Trust with termination dates ranging from 1967 to 2023 (the \"leased properties\"). Under the Indenture the Trust leased the fee properties to Freeport, and it assigned to Freeport its rights as to the leased properties. Engelhard acquired Freeport in 1985 and is its successor in interest; the Trust has succeeded to Southern Clays' rights under the Indenture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Indenture, whose pertinent provisions are reprinted in an appendix to this decision, requires a royalty payment to the Trust from Engelhard in consideration of the latter's right to mine the clay from the covered properties. To oversimplify slightly, the royalty rate for each period was 1.5 percent of Engelhard's \"net receipts\" from kaolin derived from the properties and sold by Engelhard during the period. Indenture &#182; 5(a). Engelhard was also required to pay real estate taxes on the fee properties and to make various payments on the leased properties, including the royalties that the Trust was required to pay to the third-party owners. Id. &#182; 7(a), (c). Engelhard was entitled to deduct these payments from the royalties it paid to the Trust. Id. &#182; 7(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other set of provisions in the Indenture is important to the dispute that is now before us. With respect to the leased properties, Engelhard was entitled under the Indenture to alter, modify, renew, or extend those third-party leases (by agreement with the relevant third-party owners). Indenture &#182; 2(e). This could be done either before or upon expiration and without the Trust's consent. Id. But, as to any changes effective before the preexisting termination date of a lease that was renewed or extended, any increase in fixed costs or in the royalties payable to the owners under the new terms was to be borne by Engelhard. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case centers around a group of leased properties that are described in paragraph 23 of the Indenture (the \"Veal leases\"). The Veal leases all had a royalty rate negotiated years ago that is very low by current prices ($.11 per cubic yard) and had termination dates of March 23, 1995. Because of royalty disputes with the third-party owners, Engelhard did not mine the properties until the 1990s. In August 1990, Engelhard agreed with the owners to extend the terms for 20 years and increase royalties immediately--by a multiple of almost 30--to $3 per cubic yard on three leases and $2.90 on the fourth. For the remainder of the preexisting lease terms, Engelhard absorbed the cost of the increased royalties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in mid-1995, Engelhard began deducting the increased royalties on the Veal lease extensions from the total royalties due to the Trust from all covered properties--not just the Veal leases--with drastic effects on the payments otherwise due to the Trust. Although Engelhard's semi-annual payments to the Trust usually exceeded $300,000, the payment for the last six months of 1995 was $30,000. By its calculations, the Trust was effectively paying Engelhard, by a reduction in royalty payments, about $1.80 for each cubic yard Engelhard mined on Veal properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the Trust brought suit against Engelhard in federal district court in Rhode Island. The complaint alleged that Engelhard had violated the terms of the Indenture, violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violated an alleged fiduciary duty owed by Engelhard to the Trust. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held for the Trust on the implied covenant claim and for Engelhard on the contract and fiduciary duty counts. In substance, the court held that Engelhard could not deduct the increased royalty payments on the Veal leases from other royalties due to the Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Engelhard now appeals to this court. It says that the district court erred so far as it favored the Trust and, further, in awarding prejudgment interest to the Trust as to royalties wrongly withheld by Engelhard since 1995. The parties are agreed that Georgia law governs the contract-related issues; they disagree about whose law controls as to prejudgment interest. On the grant of summary judgment and the legal issues presented as to prejudgment interest, our review is de novo. Augat v. Fenoglio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199465\"><a href=\"/opinion/199465/fenoglio-v-augat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 370 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view the able district judge reached the correct result and our own analysis differs only in emphasis. Specifically, we think that the contract, read in the framework of plausible business expectations, can reasonably be read only one way, namely, to preclude the negative royalty deductions sought by Engelhard and, for that reason, the district court's judgment is correct without regard to the Trust's implied covenant claim. But the difference is more a matter of labels than of substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical language of the Indenture provides in paragraph 5 for the 1.5 percent royalty to the Trust. In subparagraph 7(a) the Indenture sets forth Engelhard's obligation to pay both (i) taxes on fee properties and (ii) payments on leased properties that the original lessee must pay \"other than royalties on production, provision for which is made in [subparagraph 7(c)].\" Subparagraph 7(b) then allows \"[t]he aggregate amount\" of all such payments under subparagraph 7(a)--taxes and non-royalty payments--to be deducted by Engelhard from \"the aggregate royalties\" payable to the Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subparagraph 7(c) then treats in a single provision the subject of production royalties payable to the owners of leased land and credits for payment of those royalties:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Engelhard] also agrees to pay to the person entitled thereto all royalties based on production required to be paid under the Leases, but with respect to any Lease only so long as [Engelhard] remains an assignee thereof; provided, however, that [Engelhard] shall be entitled to a credit for any amounts paid or payable by it pursuant to this subparagraph (c) against royalties thereafter payable to [The Trust] under the provisions of Paragraph 5 of this Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this \"entitled to a credit\" language on which Engelhard relies in deducting the full amount of the Veal lease royalties paid to the landowners from the total royalty package owed by Engelhard to the Trust under the Indenture. The Trust, it should be stressed, does not claim to be owed any royalties after mid-1995 from sales by Engelhard of kaolin derived from the Veal properties. It simply wants to prevent its non-Veal related royalties from being reduced because of the increased royalties that Engelhard has agreed to pay the Veal property owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Engelhard thinks that the language of subparagraph 7(c) is unequivocally in its favor, this is far from true. Indeed, if words alone are considered, the Trust can point--as the district court noted--to the contrast with subparagraph 7(b) which (unlike subparagraph 7(c)) provides for the deduction of the specified items from aggregate royalties owed to the Trust. But it is guesswork whether the omission of the term \"aggregate\" in subparagraph 7(c) was intended to control the issue before us; quite likely the drafters never envisaged the precise problem. Certainly, there is no extrinsic evidence that they did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if the language taken in the abstract is not decisive in the Trust's favor and even if the drafters never focused on the risk of negative royalties, only one reading of the contract makes any sense. No rational party in the Trust's position would agree to such negative royalties, nor would anyone in Engelhard's position demand such an option, because it would create an extraordinary perverse incentive for Engelhard to engage in otherwise irrational conduct and would create an unlimited risk to the Trust's legitimate general expectations. The point is so obvious as to require only brief explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the contract were read as the Trust urges, it might well make economic sense for Engelhard to agree to a lease extension for the Veal property coupled with a very large increase in royalties paid to the owners. That would depend on whether the increase in kaolin prices was large enough for Engelhard to pay a greatly increased royalty to the Veals and still have room for a reasonable profit after mining and processing costs were paid. In fact, although unnecessary to our reasoning, it appears that Engelhard (reasonably enough) paid $3 or less in royalties to the Veal property owners while the kaolin could be sold for $4 or more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the contract were read as Engelhard urges, then it would have an incentive to pay royalties on extended leases in any amount necessary to secure the extension up the point that all of the Trust's other royalties were wiped out. Of course, Engelhard might always prefer to pay the third party owners as little as possible. Nevertheless, its reading would make it profitable (for Engelhard) to make lease extensions that were economically unsound as a whole (e.g., on high extraction-cost property) simply because it could offload the royalty costs onto the Trust, which received no benefit from the lease extension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a long tradition in contract law of reading contracts sensibly; contracts--certainly business contracts of the kind involved here--are not parlor games but the means of getting the world's work done. Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199389\"><a href=\"/opinion/199389/fishman-v-lasalle-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 302 (1st Cir. 2001). Even where courts are sure that the parties never thought about an issue, small wrinkles may be ironed out by interpretation where it is clear how the parties would have handled them. Farnsworth, Contracts &#167; 7.16, at 545 (1990). Although no Georgia case directly in point has been cited to us, we are confident that Georgia courts are as commonsensical as those elsewhere in the country. See Ga. R.R. Bank &amp; Trust v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1548</span></span>, 1551 (11th Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, parties can contract for preposterous terms. If contract language is crystal clear or there is independent extrinsic evidence that something silly was actually intended, a party may be held to its bargain, absent some specialized defense. But the language here is not at all clearly in Engelhard's favor; nor is there any extrinsic evidence as to original intent. Some evidence exists of what Engelhard unilaterally thought when it began to negotiate the extensions, and it is seemingly unhelpful to Engelhard's current position; but the post-Indenture views of one side are in any event poor evidence of what the parties originally negotiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view there was nothing unreasonable about Engelhard's extension of the Veal leases: the transaction looks as if it made sense, and Engelhard thought it made sense, even if it could not deduct the higher third party royalties against non-Veal lease royalties owed to the Trust. And this is so even though the extensions might wipe out all Veal lease royalties to the Trust after mid-1995; the Trust, after all, had no assurance that the Veal leases could ever be extended on terms that would give the Trust anything after mid-1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem for us is not that the leases were extended on the terms agreed between Engelhard and the owners but that Engelhard wants to deduct the new royalties due to the Veal owners not just from the royalties due to the Trust on the Veal leases but also from the Trust's other royalties. Possibly the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, compare West v. Koufman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203646\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203646/west-v-koufman/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 666 (Ga. 1989), with Automatic Sprinkler Corp. of Am. v.

See Thomas Diamond &amp; Howard Foss, Proposed Standards for Evaluating When the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Has Been Violated: A Framework for Resolving The Mystery, 47 Hastings L.J. 585, 586-87 (1996). But to us it is more straightforward simply to say that subparagraph 7(c) does not permit the deduction of royalties on an aggregate basis but only on a lease-by-lease basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Separately, Engelhard asks us to reverse the district court's award to the Trust of prejudgment interest on the unpaid royalties. Applying Rhode Island law, the district judge directed that the statutory rate of 12 percent interest apply from date of accrual to date of judgment. R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-21-10 (1997). Engelhard says that Georgia law governs prejudgment interest and under Georgia law no prejudgment interest, or at least a lesser amount, would be awarded.

Klaxon v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103542\"><a href=\"/opinion/103542/klaxon-co-v-stentor-elec-mfg-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 496 (1941); Commercial Union Ins.

Here, there is every reason, short of an unqualified decision by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, to believe that--as the district court held in a bench ruling--Rhode Island courts measure the award as a matter of Rhode Island law even where the dispute is controlled by the substantive law of another state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island prejudgment statute, typically enough, does not contain any choice of law directions. We are forbidden under Supreme Court precedent, see Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112564\"><a href=\"/opinion/112564/salve-regina-college-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 238-39 (1991), from giving any separate weight to the fact that the district judge is expert in Rhode Island law, having sat for many years on the state court and then on the federal court in Rhode Island. So we merely record his factual report that in over 30 years on the bench, he never heard of a case of a Rhode Island court applying the prejudgment interest law of a different state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, some states, like Massachusetts, treat prejudgment interest as substantive, Morris v. Watsco, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></span>, 889 (Mass. 1982); Commercial Union, 41 F.3d at 774, while \"others associate prejudgment interest with costs and attorneys' fees which are governed by the law of the forum,\" Am.

What little precedent exists on this issue in Rhode Island suggests that for conflict of law purposes, Rhode Island courts view their own prejudgment interest statute as \"procedural\" (and so governed by local law) rather than \"substantive.\" Holmes v. Bateson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1417061\"><a href=\"/opinion/1417061/holmes-v-bateson/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

But Rhode Island prejudgment interest, although partly intended to compensate the plaintiff for temporary loss of the use of his money, is also administrative, being intended to promote the prompt settlement of claims. Roy v. Star Chopper Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360149\"><a href=\"/opinion/360149/paula-h-roy-v-star-chopper-company-inc-and-third-party-v-ashok/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>, 1135 (1st Cir. 1978); Isserlis v.
