On  March 27, 1996,  Downtown Development\r                    Per  Curiam.  \r                               \r\n\nCorporation  (\"Downtown\") filed  this action  to recover  damages\r\n\narising from  K-Mart Corporation's  (\"K-Mart's\") alleged  illegal\r\n\noccupancy of Downtown's property in Ponce, Puerto Rico.  Downtown\r\n\nappeals the district  court's decision to grant  summary judgment\r\n\nin favor of K-Mart Corporation (\"K-Mart\").\r\n\n          We affirm on the grounds stated in the district court's\r\n\nopinion and order.  See Downtown Dev. Corp. v. K-Mart Corp., Civ.\r                                                                     \r\n\n96-1497CCC (D.P.R. September 25, 1997).  We find clause 27 of the\r\n\nlease at  issue dispositive.   As the district court  noted, that\r\n\nprovision grants K-Mart the option to remain as  a month-to-month\r\n\ntenant after the expiration of  the lease until it is  forced out\r\n\nby the courts.  In the instant case, K-Mart simply exercised this\r\n\noption.\r\n\n          Costs to be assessed against appellant.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n",
