Defendant John A. Meuse pleaded guilty  to\r                    Per Curiam\r                              \r\n\na charge of illegally possessing firearms as a felon (18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n922 (g)(1)).  Meuse appeals his conviction on the ground that the\r\n\nsearch  that led  to the  discovery of  the firearms  was illegal\r\n\nbecause  the affidavit  supporting the  search warrant  failed to\r\n\nestablish  the likelihood that the items sought would be found in\r\n\nhis  residence.  The items sought were burglary tools and jewelry\r\n\nstolen  from   the  home  of  Genevieve   DiCarlo  (\"the  DiCarlo\r\n\nburglary\").  Following  his indictment,  Meuse moved  to suppress\r\n\nall  items recovered  during the  search of  his apartment:   the\r\n\nthree  firearms  referred  to   in  the  indictment,  along  with\r\n\nammunition,  a stun gun, and other  instrumentalities of an armed\r\n\nrobbery and burglary gang.  (None of the jewelry from the DiCarlo\r\n\nburglary was recovered at Meuse's apartment.)  The district court\r\n\ndenied  the motion,  finding that  the officers had  proceeded in\r\n\ngood faith reliance  on a  facially valid warrant,  and that  the\r\n\ninformation in the affidavit supported  the magistrate's decision\r\n\nthat there was a  fair probability that evidence of  a particular\r\n\ncrime, including jewelry stolen in the DiCarlo burglary, would be\r\n\nfound in Meuse's residence.  We affirm the district court.\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.   1291.

The 14-\r\n\npage affidavit,  signed  by Massachusetts  State Trooper  Michael\r\n\nGrassia, stated in substance the following:\r\n\n          On December 2, 1991, Grassia, a ten-year veteran of the\r\n\nforce,  attended a meeting  of police  officers from  a five-town\r\n\narea of  Massachusetts (Wakefield,  Malden, Revere,  Melrose, and\r\n\nSaugus).  The  purpose of the meeting was to  plan and coordinate\r\n\nstrategy for solving  a series of armed robberies  and burglaries\r\n\nof homes  in that area.   Chief among the  suspects identified at\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Meuse  contends  that  the  \"clear  error\"  standard  is  not\r\napplicable here because the district court's determination of the\r\nsufficiency of the  underlying affidavit  was made  after a  non-\r\nevidentiary  hearing, citing  United  States v.  Falon, 959  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n1143, 1147 (1st Cir. 1992).  In Falon, however, the issue was not\r                                               \r\nthe  sufficiency  of  the   search  warrant  affidavit,  but  the\r                                                                \r\nparticularity of a  broadly worded search warrant,  which did not\r\nspecifically incorporate  or attach the affidavit,  and which did\r\nnot refer to  the criminal  offenses for which  the evidence  was\r\nsought.   We suggested that  de novo review  might be appropriate\r                                              \r\nwhen,  as there, the district  court makes a  purely legal ruling\r\nregarding  the  level  of  particularity  required  in  a  search\r\nwarrant.   We added, however, that  when reviewing conclusions in\r\nthe  nature of  fact  finding, we  would  apply the  clear  error\r\nstandard.  Id. \r                        \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthe meeting was  John Meuse.  One of  the Wakefield officers told\r\n\nGrassia that a Ford  van registered to Meuse had  been identified\r\n\nby witnesses as a vehicle  used in an armed robbery the  previous\r\n\nmonth.   Meuse subsequently called  the police to  report the van\r\n\nstolen; when  he was informed that  the police wanted to  talk to\r\n\nhim about  an armed robbery,  however, he  refused to  go to  the\r\n\npolice station to retrieve  the van, sending his attorney  in his\r\n\nplace.  The Wakefield  officer told Grassia that the  only damage\r\n\nto  the van  was  a popped  ignition,  and that  everything  else\r\n\nappeared intact.   Meuse subsequently re-registered  the van with\r\n\ndifferent license  plates.   Grassia  obtained other  information\r\n\nabout Meuse at the meeting, including information about  his past\r\n\ncriminal record.\r\n\n          Because the  crimes of  which Meuse and  his associates\r\n\nwere   suspected   had   been   committed   on   Saturdays,   the\r\n\nrepresentatives  of  the  various police  departments  agreed  to\r\n\nconduct a joint  surveillance of those suspects on  the following\r\n\nSaturday,  December 7,  1991.    At approximately  6:30  p.m.  on\r\n\nDecember 7th,  Grassia and the other  officers began surveillance\r\n\nat  several locations  in Revere  and Everett,  including Meuse's\r\n\nresidence.   Earlier  that  afternoon, the  DiCarlo residence  in\r\n\nMelrose  was burglarized.   Taken  in the  burglary  were several\r\n\nhundred pieces of jewelry and a light green pillowcase.  Some  of\r\n\nthe jewelry was in a white cardboard box.\r\n\n          That evening, at 8:00 p.m., a Monte Carlo registered to\r\n\nRobert  Stevens, another of the suspects in the Wakefield crimes,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\narrived at Meuse's residence.  Three men got out of Stevens'  car\r\n\nand walked into Meuse's apartment building, one carrying a light-\r\n\ncolored  cloth bag,  and  the other  two  with valise-type  bags.\r\n\nPolice  observed  the three  men  walking  around inside  Meuse's\r\n\napartment.\r\n\n          An hour  later, at 9:00 p.m., police saw Ronald Ferrara\r\n\nenter  Meuse's  apartment, empty-handed.    Half  an hour  later,\r\n\nFerrara came out, carrying a brown shopping bag.  Police officers\r\n\nfollowed Ferrara  to the parking lot of  a restaurant in a nearby\r\n\ntown.   Ferrara entered another vehicle, talked to the driver for\r\n\nten minutes, and  got out, still carrying  the shopping bag.   He\r\n\nthen  drove to  an  adjoining parking  lot, and  pulled alongside\r\n\nMeuse's  van and  Stevens' Monte  Carlo, both  of which  had been\r\n\nfollowed  by  police  from  Meuse's apartment.    The  police saw\r\n\nFerrara  hand what looked like  money into the  passenger side of\r\n\nthe  Monte Carlo, after which  he shook hands  with the passenger\r\n\nand  walked back  to his  car, still  carrying the  shopping bag.\r\n\nFerrara then entered  the restaurant, where he  stayed until 1:00\r\n\na.m.\r\n\n          When Ferrara left the restaurant, he was accompanied by\r\n\nhis wife.  Shortly thereafter, Ferrara was arrested for operating\r\n\na motor vehicle with a suspended license.  An inventory search of\r\n\nhis  car revealed a brown shopping bag containing over 100 pieces\r\n\nof jewelry and  a white  cardboard box, all  of which were  later\r\n\nidentified by Mrs. DiCarlo as  the items stolen from her home  on\r\n\nDecember 7th.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          When Ferrara  was questioned at the  police station, he\r\n\nsaid he had been  at the restaurant the entire evening, from 7:30\r\n\np.m. until 1:00 a.m.  He told police he had purchased the jewelry\r\n\nfrom  a friend of a  friend inside the  restaurant, but could not\r\n\nidentify either the  friend or the seller of the  jewelry.  Later\r\n\nthat  night, Ferrara's wife arrived at the police station to post\r\n\nbail  for Ferrara, and told police the  jewelry was hers.  At the\r\n\ntime  the  police had  stopped  the  Ferrara  car, however,  Mrs.\r\n\nFerrara said  that the jewelry in  the car was not  hers and that\r\n\nshe knew nothing about the bag.\r\n\n          Grassia concluded that it was  his belief, based on the\r\n\nfacts stated above, along  with his training and experience  as a\r\n\npolice officer, that the perpetrators of the DiCarlo burglary had\r\n\nused  the pillowcase to carry  off the jewelry;  that the \"light-\r\n\ncolored cloth  bag\" carried into Meuse's apartment on the evening\r\n\nof  December 7th was the  green pillowcase that  had been removed\r\n\nfrom  the DiCarlo residence during the burglary; that Ferrara was\r\n\nacting as  a fence for the  stolen property and  had obtained the\r\n\njewelry from Meuse's  apartment on the  evening of December  7th.\r\n\nGrassia  stated  further that  he  believed  that further  stolen\r\n\nproperty was being kept at Meuse's apartment. \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Meuse  argues  that the  affidavit  in  support of  the\r\n\nsearch warrant failed to establish the requisite probability that\r\n\nevidence of the DiCarlo burglary would be found in his residence.\r\n\nHe contends that the  affidavit was deficient in that  it did not\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nestablish a  sufficient nexus between the stolen  jewelry and his\r\n\napartment.\r\n\n          Probable   cause   exists    where   \"the   facts   and\r\n\ncircumstances within [a police officer's] knowledge, and of which\r\n\n[the officer] had reasonably trustworthy information .  . . [are]\r\n\nsufficient  in themselves  to  warrant a  [person] of  reasonable\r\n\ncaution\" to believe that a  crime has been committed or  is being\r\n\ncommitted and that contraband or other evidence of a crime can be\r\n\nfound at the place to be searched.

Stated another way, probable cause exists when\r\n\nthere  is a \"fair probability\"  that contraband or  evidence of a\r\n\ncrime will be found  in a particular place.  See Massachusetts v.\r                                                                           \r\n\nUpton, 466 U.S.  727, 733  (1984); United States  v.

Gates, 462\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 236;  United States v. Ciampa, 793 F.2d  19, 22 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1986).  The district court found that that standard was met here.\r\n\n          The district  court found  that the information  in the\r\n\naffidavit was  obtained primarily from  the personal observations\r\n\nof trained and experienced police officers; that there had been a\r\n\nrash of burglaries in  which defendant was a prime  suspect; that\r\n\ndefendant drove a van which was  believed to have been used in an\r\n\narmed robbery; that on  the day of the DiCarlo  burglary, Ferrara\r\n\nwas seen entering defendant's apartment  empty-handed and leaving\r\n\nwith a shopping bag that was later found to contain a substantial\r\n\nportion of the jewelry reported stolen by Mrs. DiCarlo just hours\r\n\nbefore; and that Ferrara lied  about his whereabouts that evening\r\n\nand told an  incredible story  about the source  of the  jewelry,\r\n\nfurther  undercut  by his  wife's  conflicting  story.    In  the\r\n\ntotality of the circumstances, the court found  probable cause to\r\n\nbelieve  that evidence of a  crime would be  found in defendant's\r\n\napartment.  Meuse argues that the conclusion that a search of his\r\n\napartment would uncover evidence relating to the DiCarlo burglary\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nrelied on the inference  that the contents of the  brown shopping\r\n\nbag removed from Ferrara  at 1:00 a.m. on  December 8th had  been\r\n\nobtained by  Ferrara  from  Meuse's  apartment at  9:30  p.m.  on\r\n\nDecember  7th.   He  claims that  even  though Ferrara  was  seen\r\n\nleaving the apartment with a bag  that was later found to contain\r\n\nthe  stolen DiCarlo jewelry, the fact that Ferrara met with other\r\n\nindividuals  during  the  three  and  a half  hours  between  his\r\n\ndeparture  from Meuse's  residence  and his  apprehension by  the\r\n\npolice makes it unreasonable  to conclude that the bag  must have\r\n\ncontained the stolen jewelry when Ferrara left Meuse's apartment.\r\n\nThis argument ignores the  fact that the full array of  facts and\r\n\ncircumstances presented to the  issuing court need only establish\r\n\nprobable  cause, not a certainty that the material sought will be\r\n\nfound in  the place to be  searched.

This minor variation  in the terms\r\n\nused to describe the bag does not preclude a finding of  probable\r\n\ncause.

He claims, for  example, that the\r\n\naffidavit  did  not show that Ferrara was a  known fence, that he\r\n\nhad  previously  fenced stolen  property for  Meuse, that  he had\r\n\npreviously received  stolen property  from Meuse's  apartment, or\r\n\nthat  he had any record for any offense involving stolen property\r\n\nor relating to the robbery/burglary activity for which Meuse  was\r\n\nunder surveillance.   Meuse also argues that  Ferrara's lie about\r\n\nhis  visit to  Meuse's apartment  establishes nothing  other than\r\n\nthat Ferrara wished to  hide his association with Meuse,  that it\r\n\nsheds  no light on  whether or not the  DiCarlo jewelry came from\r\n\nMeuse's apartment.\r\n\n          This  argument is  also without  merit.   The affidavit\r\n\nshowed that there  was a  fair probability that  evidence of  the\r\n\nDiCarlo  burglary  could  be  found in  Meuse's  apartment.    In\r\n\naddition  to the  reasons set forth  above, the  affidavit stated\r\n\nthat Meuse's  van had been tied to  an armed robbery committed in\r\n\nthe previous month.  The affidavit also described the activity at\r\n\nMeuse's apartment on  the evening of  December 7th, during  which\r\n\nthis same van was parked outside.   The van was then seen at  the\r\n\nparking  lot  with  Ferrara's   car  and  the  Stevens'  vehicle.\r\n\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, the connection was\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nsufficiently close  to support  the magistrate's issuance  of the\r\n\nsearch warrant.\r\n\n          In any event, the denial of Meuse's motion  to suppress\r\n\nis supported by  the \"good faith\"  exception to the  exclusionary\r\n\nrule.   The Supreme Court has declared that even when information\r\n\ncontained in an affidavit makes only a marginal case for a search\r\n\nwarrant, the warrant should  nevertheless be upheld.   \"[W]e have\r\n\nexpressed  a strong preference for warrants and declared that 'in\r\n\na doubtful  or a marginal  case a search  under a warrant  may be\r\n\nsustainable  where without one it would fall.'\"  United States v.\r                                                                           \r\n\nLe n, 468 U.S. 897, 914 (1984).  \"In the absence of an allegation\r              \r\n\nthat  the magistrate  abandoned  his detached  and neutral  role,\r\n\nsuppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or\r\n\nreckless in preparing their affidavit or could  not have harbored\r\n\nan  objectively reasonable  belief in  the existence  of probable\r\n\ncause.\"  Id. at 926.\r                      \r\n\n          Here,  the  district  court  found  that  the  officers\r\n\nproceeded in  good faith  reliance on  a facially  valid warrant,\r\n\nissued by a judicial officer, and  supported by \"much more than a\r\n\n'bare-bones' affidavit.\"   Id.

Meuse pleaded guilty to a charge of illegally possessing firearms as a felon (18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1)).  Meuse appeals his conviction on the ground that the search that led to the discovery of the firearms was illegal because the affidavit supporting the search warrant failed to establish the likelihood that the items sought would be found in his residence.  The items sought were burglary tools and jewelry stolen from the home of Genevieve DiCarlo (\"the DiCarlo burglary\").  Following his indictment, Meuse moved to suppress all items recovered during the search of his apartment:  the three firearms referred to in the indictment, along with ammunition, a stun gun, and other instrumentalities of an armed robbery and burglary gang.  (None of the jewelry from the DiCarlo burglary was recovered at Meuse's apartment.)  The district court denied the motion, finding that the officers had proceeded in good faith reliance on a facially valid warrant, and that the information in the affidavit supported the magistrate's decision that there was a fair probability that evidence of a particular crime, including jewelry stolen in the DiCarlo burglary, would be found in Meuse's residence.  We affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.  In reviewing a district court's determination that the face of an affidavit stated sufficient probable cause to support a search warrant, we review only for clear error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  United States v. Garc ua, 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir.1993), citing United States v. Nocella, 849 F.2d 33, 39 (1st Cir.1988);  see also United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (reviewing court does not undertake de novo review of sufficiency of search warrant affidavit, but accords great deference to the probable cause determination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The warrant was issued on December 10, 1991, by a clerk-magistrate of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  The 14- page affidavit, signed by Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Grassia, stated in substance the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1991, Grassia, a ten-year veteran of the force, attended a meeting of police officers from a five-town area of Massachusetts (Wakefield, Malden, Revere, Melrose, and Saugus).  The purpose of the meeting was to plan and coordinate strategy for solving a series of armed robberies and burglaries of homes in that area.  Chief among the suspects identified at the meeting was John Meuse.  One of the Wakefield officers told Grassia that a Ford van registered to Meuse had been identified by witnesses as a vehicle used in an armed robbery the previous month.  Meuse subsequently called the police to report the van stolen;  when he was informed that the police wanted to talk to him about an armed robbery, however, he refused to go to the police station to retrieve the van, sending his attorney in his place.  The Wakefield officer told Grassia that the only damage to the van was a popped ignition, and that everything else appeared intact.  Meuse subsequently re-registered the van with different license plates.  Grassia obtained other information about Meuse at the meeting, including information about his past criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the crimes of which Meuse and his associates were suspected had been committed on Saturdays, the representatives of the various police departments agreed to conduct a joint surveillance of those suspects on the following Saturday, December 7, 1991.  At approximately 6:30 p.m.  on December 7th, Grassia and the other officers began surveillance at several locations in Revere and Everett, including Meuse's residence.  Earlier that afternoon, the DiCarlo residence in Melrose was burglarized.  Taken in the burglary were several hundred pieces of jewelry and a light green pillowcase.  Some of the jewelry was in a white cardboard box.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That evening, at 8:00 p.m., a Monte Carlo registered to Robert Stevens, another of the suspects in the Wakefield crimes, arrived at Meuse's residence.  Three men got out of Stevens' car and walked into Meuse's apartment building, one carrying a light- colored cloth bag, and the other two with valise-type bags.  Police observed the three men walking around inside Meuse's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An hour later, at 9:00 p.m., police saw Ronald Ferrara enter Meuse's apartment, empty-handed.  Half an hour later, Ferrara came out, carrying a brown shopping bag.  Police officers followed Ferrara to the parking lot of a restaurant in a nearby town.  Ferrara entered another vehicle, talked to the driver for ten minutes, and got out, still carrying the shopping bag.  He then drove to an adjoining parking lot, and pulled alongside Meuse's van and Stevens' Monte Carlo, both of which had been followed by police from Meuse's apartment.  The police saw Ferrara hand what looked like money into the passenger side of the Monte Carlo, after which he shook hands with the passenger and walked back to his car, still carrying the shopping bag.  Ferrara then entered the restaurant, where he stayed until 1:00 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Ferrara left the restaurant, he was accompanied by his wife.  Shortly thereafter, Ferrara was arrested for operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license.  An inventory search of his car revealed a brown shopping bag containing over 100 pieces of jewelry and a white cardboard box, all of which were later identified by Mrs. DiCarlo as the items stolen from her home on December 7th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Ferrara was questioned at the police station, he said he had been at the restaurant the entire evening, from 7:30 p.m.  until 1:00 a.m.  He told police he had purchased the jewelry from a friend of a friend inside the restaurant, but could not identify either the friend or the seller of the jewelry.  Later that night, Ferrara's wife arrived at the police station to post bail for Ferrara, and told police the jewelry was hers.  At the time the police had stopped the Ferrara car, however, Mrs. Ferrara said that the jewelry in the car was not hers and that she knew nothing about the bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grassia concluded that it was his belief, based on the facts stated above, along with his training and experience as a police officer, that the perpetrators of the DiCarlo burglary had used the pillowcase to carry off the jewelry;  that the \"light- colored cloth bag\" carried into Meuse's apartment on the evening of December 7th was the green pillowcase that had been removed from the DiCarlo residence during the burglary;  that Ferrara was acting as a fence for the stolen property and had obtained the jewelry from Meuse's apartment on the evening of December 7th.  Grassia stated further that he believed that further stolen property was being kept at Meuse's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meuse argues that the affidavit in support of the search warrant failed to establish the requisite probability that evidence of the DiCarlo burglary would be found in his residence.  He contends that the affidavit was deficient in that it did not establish a sufficient nexus between the stolen jewelry and his apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause exists where \"the facts and circumstances within [a police officer's] knowledge, and of which [the officer] had reasonably trustworthy information ... [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a [person] of reasonable caution\" to believe that a crime has been committed or is being committed and that contraband or other evidence of a crime can be found at the place to be searched.  Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162 (1925);  United States v. Drake, 673 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1982).  Stated another way, probable cause exists when there is a \"fair probability\" that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.  See Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727, 733 (1984);  United States v. Jordan, 999 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1993).  \"Probable cause\" is something less than the \"preponderance\" standard of proof.  \"[T]he words 'reasonable cause' are perhaps closer to what is meant.\"  United States v. Melvin, 596 F.2d 492, 495 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 837 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause may be established in various ways, including hearsay from a reliable source or information from an anonymous tip that can be independently corroborated.  See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 233-34, 241 (1983).  Probable cause may also be established by the personal observations of police officers.  See McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 454-55 (1948);  United States v. Lee, 962 F.2d 430, 436-38 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1057 (1992).  Police may use their training, experience, and expertise to draw inferences of criminal activity from behavior that is not facially criminal.  Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742-43 (1983) (plurality opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandate of the Fourth Amendment was satisfied in this case so long as the \"totality of the circumstances\" provided the issuing magistrate with a substantial basis for concluding that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing.  Gates, 462 U.S. at 236;  United States v. Ciampa, 793 F.2d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1986).  The district court found that that standard was met here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the information in the affidavit was obtained primarily from the personal observations of trained and experienced police officers;  that there had been a rash of burglaries in which defendant was a prime suspect;  that defendant drove a van which was believed to have been used in an armed robbery;  that on the day of the DiCarlo burglary, Ferrara was seen entering defendant's apartment empty-handed and leaving with a shopping bag that was later found to contain a substantial portion of the jewelry reported stolen by Mrs. DiCarlo just hours before;  and that Ferrara lied about his whereabouts that evening and told an incredible story about the source of the jewelry, further undercut by his wife's conflicting story.  In the totality of the circumstances, the court found probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found in defendant's apartment.  Meuse argues that the conclusion that a search of his apartment would uncover evidence relating to the DiCarlo burglary relied on the inference that the contents of the brown shopping bag removed from Ferrara at 1:00 a.m.  on December 8th had been obtained by Ferrara from Meuse's apartment at 9:30 p.m.  on December 7th.  He claims that even though Ferrara was seen leaving the apartment with a bag that was later found to contain the stolen DiCarlo jewelry, the fact that Ferrara met with other individuals during the three and a half hours between his departure from Meuse's residence and his apprehension by the police makes it unreasonable to conclude that the bag must have contained the stolen jewelry when Ferrara left Meuse's apartment.  This argument ignores the fact that the full array of facts and circumstances presented to the issuing court need only establish probable cause, not a certainty that the material sought will be found in the place to be searched.  Gates, 462 U.S. at 231-35;  accord, Ciampa, 793 F.2d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly unpersuasive is Meuse's argument that the affidavit does not support the inference that the DiCarlo jewelry entered Meuse's apartment in the cloth bag at 8:00 p.m.  He claims that the requisite probable cause is lacking because the officers conducting the surveillance described a man carrying a \"light-colored bag\" rather than the \"green pillowcase\" missing from the DiCarlo residence.  This minor variation in the terms used to describe the bag does not preclude a finding of probable cause.  Search warrants are to be interpreted in a \"common-sense rather than a hypothetical or a hypertechnical manner.\"  Garc ua, 983 F.2d at 1167.  Bits and pieces of information are not to be judged in isolation.  United States v. Badessa, 752 F.2d 771, 773 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meuse's final argument is that there were insufficient facts to link him personally to the stolen jewelry or to Ferrara's criminal activities.  He claims, for example, that the affidavit did not show that Ferrara was a known fence, that he had previously fenced stolen property for Meuse, that he had previously received stolen property from Meuse's apartment, or that he had any record for any offense involving stolen property or relating to the robbery/burglary activity for which Meuse was under surveillance.  Meuse also argues that Ferrara's lie about his visit to Meuse's apartment establishes nothing other than that Ferrara wished to hide his association with Meuse, that it sheds no light on whether or not the DiCarlo jewelry came from Meuse's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is also without merit.  The affidavit showed that there was a fair probability that evidence of the DiCarlo burglary could be found in Meuse's apartment.  In addition to the reasons set forth above, the affidavit stated that Meuse's van had been tied to an armed robbery committed in the previous month.  The affidavit also described the activity at Meuse's apartment on the evening of December 7th, during which this same van was parked outside.  The van was then seen at the parking lot with Ferrara's car and the Stevens' vehicle.  Considering the totality of the circumstances, the connection was sufficiently close to support the magistrate's issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the denial of Meuse's motion to suppress is supported by the \"good faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule.  The Supreme Court has declared that even when information contained in an affidavit makes only a marginal case for a search warrant, the warrant should nevertheless be upheld.  \"[W]e have expressed a strong preference for warrants and declared that 'in a doubtful or a marginal case a search under a warrant may be sustainable where without one it would fall.' \"  United States v. Le on, 468 U.S. 897, 914 (1984).  \"In the absence of an allegation that the magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role, suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.\"  Id. at 926.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court found that the officers proceeded in good faith reliance on a facially valid warrant, issued by a judicial officer, and supported by \"much more than a 'bare-bones' affidavit.\"  Id. Thus, the \"good-faith\" exception applies in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Northern California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Meuse contends that the \"clear error\" standard is not applicable here because the district court's determination of the sufficiency of the underlying affidavit was made after a non- evidentiary hearing, citing United States v. Falon, 959 F.2d 1143, 1147 (1st Cir.1992).  In Falon, however, the issue was not the sufficiency of the search warrant affidavit, but the particularity of a broadly worded search warrant, which did not specifically incorporate or attach the affidavit, and which did not refer to the criminal offenses for which the evidence was sought.  We suggested that de novo review might be appropriate when, as there, the district court makes a purely legal ruling regarding the level of particularity required in a search warrant.  We added, however, that when reviewing conclusions in the nature of fact finding, we would apply the clear error standard.  Id</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Meuse appeals his conviction on the ground that the search that led to the discovery of the firearms was illegal because the affidavit supporting the search warrant failed to establish the likelihood that the items sought would be found in his residence.  The items sought were burglary tools and jewelry stolen from the home of Genevieve DiCarlo (\"the DiCarlo burglary\").  Following his indictment, Meuse moved to suppress all items recovered during the search of his apartment:  the three firearms referred to in the indictment, along with ammunition, a stun gun, and other instrumentalities of an armed robbery and burglary gang.  (None of the jewelry from the DiCarlo burglary was recovered at Meuse's apartment.)  The district court denied the motion, finding that the officers had proceeded in good faith reliance on a facially valid warrant, and that the information in the affidavit supported the magistrate's decision that there was a fair probability that evidence of a particular crime, including jewelry stolen in the DiCarlo burglary, would be found in Meuse's residence.

The 14- page affidavit, signed by Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Grassia, stated in substance the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1991, Grassia, a ten-year veteran of the force, attended a meeting of police officers from a five-town area of Massachusetts (Wakefield, Malden, Revere, Melrose, and Saugus).  The purpose of the meeting was to plan and coordinate strategy for solving a series of armed robberies and burglaries of homes in that area.  Chief among the suspects identified at the meeting was John Meuse.  One of the Wakefield officers told Grassia that a Ford van registered to Meuse had been identified by witnesses as a vehicle used in an armed robbery the previous month.  Meuse subsequently called the police to report the van stolen;  when he was informed that the police wanted to talk to him about an armed robbery, however, he refused to go to the police station to retrieve the van, sending his attorney in his place.  The Wakefield officer told Grassia that the only damage to the van was a popped ignition, and that everything else appeared intact.  Meuse subsequently re-registered the van with different license plates.  Grassia obtained other information about Meuse at the meeting, including information about his past criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the crimes of which Meuse and his associates were suspected had been committed on Saturdays, the representatives of the various police departments agreed to conduct a joint surveillance of those suspects on the following Saturday, December 7, 1991.  At approximately 6:30 p.m.  on December 7th, Grassia and the other officers began surveillance at several locations in Revere and Everett, including Meuse's residence.  Earlier that afternoon, the DiCarlo residence in Melrose was burglarized.  Taken in the burglary were several hundred pieces of jewelry and a light green pillowcase.  Some of the jewelry was in a white cardboard box.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That evening, at 8:00 p.m., a Monte Carlo registered to Robert Stevens, another of the suspects in the Wakefield crimes, arrived at Meuse's residence.  Three men got out of Stevens' car and walked into Meuse's apartment building, one carrying a light- colored cloth bag, and the other two with valise-type bags.  Police observed the three men walking around inside Meuse's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An hour later, at 9:00 p.m., police saw Ronald Ferrara enter Meuse's apartment, empty-handed.  Half an hour later, Ferrara came out, carrying a brown shopping bag.  Police officers followed Ferrara to the parking lot of a restaurant in a nearby town.  Ferrara entered another vehicle, talked to the driver for ten minutes, and got out, still carrying the shopping bag.  He then drove to an adjoining parking lot, and pulled alongside Meuse's van and Stevens' Monte Carlo, both of which had been followed by police from Meuse's apartment.  The police saw Ferrara hand what looked like money into the passenger side of the Monte Carlo, after which he shook hands with the passenger and walked back to his car, still carrying the shopping bag.  Ferrara then entered the restaurant, where he stayed until 1:00 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Ferrara left the restaurant, he was accompanied by his wife.  Shortly thereafter, Ferrara was arrested for operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license.  An inventory search of his car revealed a brown shopping bag containing over 100 pieces of jewelry and a white cardboard box, all of which were later identified by Mrs. DiCarlo as the items stolen from her home on December 7th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Ferrara was questioned at the police station, he said he had been at the restaurant the entire evening, from 7:30 p.m.  until 1:00 a.m.  He told police he had purchased the jewelry from a friend of a friend inside the restaurant, but could not identify either the friend or the seller of the jewelry.  Later that night, Ferrara's wife arrived at the police station to post bail for Ferrara, and told police the jewelry was hers.  At the time the police had stopped the Ferrara car, however, Mrs. Ferrara said that the jewelry in the car was not hers and that she knew nothing about the bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grassia concluded that it was his belief, based on the facts stated above, along with his training and experience as a police officer, that the perpetrators of the DiCarlo burglary had used the pillowcase to carry off the jewelry;  that the \"light- colored cloth bag\" carried into Meuse's apartment on the evening of December 7th was the green pillowcase that had been removed from the DiCarlo residence during the burglary;  that Ferrara was acting as a fence for the stolen property and had obtained the jewelry from Meuse's apartment on the evening of December 7th.  Grassia stated further that he believed that further stolen property was being kept at Meuse's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meuse argues that the affidavit in support of the search warrant failed to establish the requisite probability that evidence of the DiCarlo burglary would be found in his residence.  He contends that the affidavit was deficient in that it did not establish a sufficient nexus between the stolen jewelry and his apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause exists where \"the facts and circumstances within [a police officer's] knowledge, and of which [the officer] had reasonably trustworthy information ... [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a [person] of reasonable caution\" to believe that a crime has been committed or is being committed and that contraband or other evidence of a crime can be found at the place to be searched.

Gates, 462 U.S. at 236;  United States v. Ciampa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471650\"><a href=\"/opinion/471650/united-states-v-vincent-ciampa/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1986).  The district court found that that standard was met here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the information in the affidavit was obtained primarily from the personal observations of trained and experienced police officers;  that there had been a rash of burglaries in which defendant was a prime suspect;  that defendant drove a van which was believed to have been used in an armed robbery;  that on the day of the DiCarlo burglary, Ferrara was seen entering defendant's apartment empty-handed and leaving with a shopping bag that was later found to contain a substantial portion of the jewelry reported stolen by Mrs. DiCarlo just hours before;  and that Ferrara lied about his whereabouts that evening and told an incredible story about the source of the jewelry, further undercut by his wife's conflicting story.  In the totality of the circumstances, the court found probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found in defendant's apartment.  Meuse argues that the conclusion that a search of his apartment would uncover evidence relating to the DiCarlo burglary relied on the inference that the contents of the brown shopping bag removed from Ferrara at 1:00 a.m.  on December 8th had been obtained by Ferrara from Meuse's apartment at 9:30 p.m.  on December 7th.  He claims that even though Ferrara was seen leaving the apartment with a bag that was later found to contain the stolen DiCarlo jewelry, the fact that Ferrara met with other individuals during the three and a half hours between his departure from Meuse's residence and his apprehension by the police makes it unreasonable to conclude that the bag must have contained the stolen jewelry when Ferrara left Meuse's apartment.  This argument ignores the fact that the full array of facts and circumstances presented to the issuing court need only establish probable cause, not a certainty that the material sought will be found in the place to be searched.  Gates, 462 U.S. at 231-35;  accord, Ciampa, 793 F.2d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly unpersuasive is Meuse's argument that the affidavit does not support the inference that the DiCarlo jewelry entered Meuse's apartment in the cloth bag at 8:00 p.m.  He claims that the requisite probable cause is lacking because the officers conducting the surveillance described a man carrying a \"light-colored bag\" rather than the \"green pillowcase\" missing from the DiCarlo residence.  This minor variation in the terms used to describe the bag does not preclude a finding of probable cause.  Search warrants are to be interpreted in a \"common-sense rather than a hypothetical or a hypertechnical manner.\"  Garc ua, 983 F.2d at 1167.  Bits and pieces of information are not to be judged in isolation.  United States v. Badessa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446767\"><a href=\"/opinion/446767/united-states-v-michael-badessa-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span>, 773 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meuse's final argument is that there were insufficient facts to link him personally to the stolen jewelry or to Ferrara's criminal activities.  He claims, for example, that the affidavit did not show that Ferrara was a known fence, that he had previously fenced stolen property for Meuse, that he had previously received stolen property from Meuse's apartment, or that he had any record for any offense involving stolen property or relating to the robbery/burglary activity for which Meuse was under surveillance.  Meuse also argues that Ferrara's lie about his visit to Meuse's apartment establishes nothing other than that Ferrara wished to hide his association with Meuse, that it sheds no light on whether or not the DiCarlo jewelry came from Meuse's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is also without merit.  The affidavit showed that there was a fair probability that evidence of the DiCarlo burglary could be found in Meuse's apartment.  In addition to the reasons set forth above, the affidavit stated that Meuse's van had been tied to an armed robbery committed in the previous month.  The affidavit also described the activity at Meuse's apartment on the evening of December 7th, during which this same van was parked outside.  The van was then seen at the parking lot with Ferrara's car and the Stevens' vehicle.  Considering the totality of the circumstances, the connection was sufficiently close to support the magistrate's issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the denial of Meuse's motion to suppress is supported by the \"good faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule.  The Supreme Court has declared that even when information contained in an affidavit makes only a marginal case for a search warrant, the warrant should nevertheless be upheld.  \"[W]e have expressed a strong preference for warrants and declared that 'in a doubtful or a marginal case a search under a warrant may be sustainable where without one it would fall.' \"  United States v. Le on, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 914 (1984).  \"In the absence of an allegation that the magistrate abandoned his detached and neutral role, suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.\"  Id. at 926.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court found that the officers proceeded in good faith reliance on a facially valid warrant, issued by a judicial officer, and supported by \"much more than a 'bare-bones' affidavit.\"  Id. Thus, the \"good-faith\" exception applies in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Northern California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Meuse contends that the \"clear error\" standard is not applicable here because the district court's determination of the sufficiency of the underlying affidavit was made after a non- evidentiary hearing, citing United States v. Falon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580296\"><a href=\"/opinion/580296/united-states-v-paul-falon-aka-peter-maitra-aka-pradeep-kumar-maitra/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span>, 1147 (1st Cir.1992).  In Falon, however, the issue was not the sufficiency of the search warrant affidavit, but the particularity of a broadly worded search warrant, which did not specifically incorporate or attach the affidavit, and which did not refer to the criminal offenses for which the evidence was sought.  We suggested that de novo review might be appropriate when, as there, the district court makes a purely legal ruling regarding the level of particularity required in a search warrant.  We added, however, that when reviewing conclusions in the nature of fact finding, we would apply the clear error standard.  Id</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
