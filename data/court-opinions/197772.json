The district court dismissed all claims  against all\r\n\ndefendants  in  a series  of  summary judgment  orders.   One\r\n\nargument made by plaintiffs on appeal leads us to reinstate a\r\n\nportion of their case.  \r\n\n          Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  Puerto  Rican  police\r\n\nofficer,  Ernesto Laboy-Escobar, who  filed the affidavit and\r\n\nswore to facts in support of the search warrant lied in doing\r\n\nso,  fabricating the \"facts\"  asserted in order  to establish\r\n\nprobable  cause.     Plaintiffs'  evidence  presents  genuine\r\n\ndisputes of fact  as to whether the  material representations\r\n\nmade by  Laboy in the  warrant application were true  or were\r\n\nfabricated.   It has long  been well established that  such a\r\n\nmaterial  fabrication  violates  the  Warrant  Clause of  the\r\n\nFourth Amendment.   Further, we have  no doubt that  officers\r\n\nreasonably understand  that  they may  not  lie in  order  to\r\n\nestablish  probable cause  in  a  warrant  application.    If\r\n\nplaintiffs are able to prove their claim at trial, Laboy will\r\n\nnot be protected by qualified immunity.\r\n\n          Accordingly, it was error to enter summary judgment\r\n\nin favor of  Laboy on  that claim.   But plaintiffs have  not\r\n\nmade any  showing that  others assisted or  even knew  of the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nalleged  falsehoods, nor  have plaintiffs  provided facts  to\r\n\nsupport  the claim that  the search itself  was unreasonable.\r\n\nFor  these and  other  reasons  the  dismissal of  all  other\r\n\ndefendants and all other claims is affirmed.  \r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Entry of summary  judgment is reviewed de  novo and\r\n\nwe take  the facts in the  light most favorable  to the party\r\n\nopposing summary  judgment.  See Acosta-Orozco  v. Rodriguez-\r                                                                         \r\n\nde-Rivera, 1997 WL 775350 at *1 (1st Cir. Dec. 22, 1997).  \r                     \r\n\n          On  December 6, 1993,  plaintiffs Cruz Mar a Andino\r\n\nSerrano (Andino Serrano) and her daughter Mar a Aponte Andino\r\n\n(Aponte  Andino) were  at home in  R o Piedras,  Puerto Rico,\r\n\nwhen Aponte  Andino noticed several unmarked cars approaching\r\n\nthe house.  A group of people emerged from the cars and began\r\n\nwalking toward the house.  One member of the group had an ax;\r\n\nnone was uniformed.  Plaintiffs  believed they were about  to\r\n\nbe   robbed.    Without   identifying  themselves  as  police\r\n\nofficers, the individuals  broke down the  door to the  house\r\n\nwith the  ax and entered.   Only after plaintiffs  begged the\r\n\npeople not to kill them  did the officers identify themselves\r\n\nas police  and show  the two women  a search warrant  for the\r\n\nhouse.  The  warrant authorized a search  of plaintiffs' home\r\n\nfor weapons, and nothing else.  \r\n\n          The  officers conducted the  search in an efficient\r\n\nand orderly  fashion,  without the  use  of force.    Several\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nofficers  questioned the two women inside about whether there\r\n\nwere  large sums of drug money hidden  inside the house.  FBI\r\n\nAgent Michael Plichta  also attempted to search  the computer\r\n\nfiles  to find evidence of drugs or drug money, but could not\r\n\ngain  access to  any files.    The entire  search lasted  two\r\n\nhours, and  failed to  turn up  evidence of illegal  weapons,\r\n\ndrugs,  drug money,  or, indeed,  of  any criminal  activity.\r\n\nAnother daughter,  Iris Teresa  Aponte Andino  (Iris Teresa),\r\n\nreturned and  tried to enter  the house.  An  officer outside\r\n\nrefused to let Iris Teresa through the blockade.  \r\n\n          In  May of  1995,  Aponte Andino,  Andino  Serrano,\r\n\nRafael  Aponte  Matos (Andino  Serrano's  husband), and  Iris\r\n\nTeresa filed this action for  damages under 42 U.S.C.   1983,\r\n\nand against the federal officials  under 28 U.S.C.   1331 and\r\n\nBivens  v. Six  Unknown Named  Agents, 403  U.S.  388 (1971).\r                                                 \r\n\nThey  alleged  violations   of  the  Fourth  and   Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.  \r\n\n          Plaintiffs  sued two  groups  of defendants.    The\r\n\nfirst group  is  composed  of  the  state  and  federal  line\r\n\nofficers who participated in the search:  Puerto Rican Police\r\n\nOfficers Ernesto Laboy-Escobar, Ernesto  Torres Lebr n, Jimmy\r\n\nCol n, Zulma Fern ndez, Iv n-Nieves  Dom nguez, and FBI Agent\r\n\nMichael Plichta.   Plaintiffs alleged  that these  defendants\r\n\nviolated  plaintiffs'  right  to  be  free from  unreasonable\r\n\nsearches by fabricating  facts to obtain the  search warrant,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nconducting a search  that exceeded the scope of  the warrant,\r\n\nand using excessive force in carrying out the search.1\r\n\n          Plaintiffs sued the second group of defendants, the\r\n\nsupervisors, alleging  that they failed  adequately to  train\r\n\nand supervise the  first group of defendants.   This group of\r\n\ndefendants  included  both  state  and  federal  supervisors:\r\n\nPuerto  Rico Police  Department  (PRPD) Superintendent  Pedro\r\n\nToledo-D vila, PRPD Supervisor Carlos Haddock, PRPD Auxiliary\r\n\nSuperintendent of  Inspection and  Disciplinary Affairs  Jos \r\n\nZapata, PRPD  Lieutenant  Juan Ort z-D az,  and FBI  Director\r\n\nLewis  Freeh   and  an  unidentified   FBI  supervisor  named\r\n\n\"Ilario.\"  Plaintiffs alleged that these defendants knew that\r\n\nthe officers involved in the  search had records of violence,\r\n\nand  that   the   supervisors   had   callously   disregarded\r\n\nplaintiffs' constitutional rights by inadequately supervising\r\n\ntheir subordinates.\r\n\n          All defendants moved for summary judgment  based on\r\n\nqualified immunity.  On December 13, 1995, the district court\r\n\ngranted  in part Agent Plichta's motion for summary judgment,\r\n\ndismissing the claim  that Plichta engaged in  a \"pretextual\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    Plaintiffs also  alleged  in their  complaint  that the\r\nofficials conducting the search  deprived plaintiffs of their\r\nright to counsel during the  search.  They alleged that their\r\nlawyer was  outside of  the house, but  the police  would not\r\nallow counsel to  be with her clients inside.   Plaintiffs do\r\nnot present  this claim  as a specific  issue on  appeal, nor\r\ndevelop any argument  regarding the claim,  and it is  deemed\r\nwaived.  See  King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st\r                                                 \r\nCir. 1997) (collecting cases).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nsearch  of plaintiffs'  home.   On  May 29,  1996, the  court\r\n\nentered partial  judgment dismissing  plaintiffs' claim  that\r\n\nPlichta  exceeded the  scope  of  the  warrant  by  searching\r\n\nplaintiffs'  computer files.   On  July 22,  1996, the  court\r\n\nentered partial judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claim against\r\n\nthe  unnamed federal supervisor \"Ilario.\"   On April 4, 1997,\r\n\nthe  court dismissed  all the  remaining  claims against  all\r\n\ndefendants on qualified immunity  grounds.  Plaintiffs appeal\r\n\nall of these dismissals.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Our review of the district court's grant of summary\r\n\njudgment is de novo.  See St.  Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 20,  24  (1st  Cir.  1995).   We  will  affirm  if  \"the\r\n\npleadings,  depositions,  answers   to  interrogatories,  and\r\n\nadmissions on  file, together  with the  affidavits, if  any,\r\n\nshow that there  is no genuine issue as to  any material fact\r\n\nand that  the moving party  is entitled  to a  judgment as  a\r\n\nmatter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In order to overcome\r\n\ndefendants'  motions for  summary  judgment, plaintiffs  must\r\n\ncome forward with \"specific,  provable facts which  establish\r\n\nthat  there  is   a  triable  issue.\"     Febus-Rodriguez  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nBetancourt-Lebron, 14  F.3d 87,  91 (1st Cir.  1994).   For a\r                             \r\n\ndispute to be \"genuine,\" there must be sufficient evidence to\r\n\npermit a  reasonable trier  of fact to  resolve the  issue in\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfavor  of the  non-moving party.    See United  States v. One\r                                                                         \r\n\nParcel of Real Property, 960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                                   \r\n\n          Qualified immunity protects both  federal and state\r\n\nofficials from liability for damages in a civil rights action\r\n\nif \"a reasonable officer could have believed [his actions] to\r\n\nbe lawful,  in  light  of clearly  established  law  and  the\r\n\ninformation the  [acting] officer[] possessed.\"   Anderson v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCreighton, 483 U.S.  635, 641 (1987).  There  are two aspects\r                     \r\n\nto  this  standard.    The  first   inquiry  is  whether  the\r\n\nconstitutional  right  asserted  by  plaintiffs  was  clearly\r\n\nestablished  at  the time  of  the  alleged violation.    The\r\n\nsecond, if the  right was clearly  established, is whether  a\r\n\nreasonable  officer  in  the   same  situation  would   \"have\r\n\nunderstood  that   the  challenged   conduct  violated   that\r\n\nestablished  right.\"   Hegarty v.  Somerset  County, 53  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1367,  1373 (1st Cir.  1995) (quoting Burns  v.

If the first level of the\r\n\nanalysis   yields   a   determination   that   the   asserted\r\n\nconstitutional right  was  not  clearly  established  at  the\r\n\nrelevant time, then we need  not proceed to the second prong;\r\n\nthere is  qualified immunity.   See Soto v. Flores,  103 F.3d\r                                                              \r\n\n1056, 1064-65 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r\n\nA.

This   is  similar  to,  and  derives   from  the  same\r\nconstitutional  source  as,   the  claim   that  an   officer\r\nreasonably should have known that facts alleged in support of\r\na warrant application were insufficient to establish probable\r\ncause.  See Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986).\r                                        \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Here, plaintiffs allege that Laboy fabricated facts\r\n\nin support of probable  cause in order to obtain a warrant to\r\n\nsearch plaintiffs' home, and that other  defendants conspired\r\n\nwith  Laboy to  obtain  this fraudulently  procured  warrant.\r\n\nPlaintiffs have  presented no  evidence  that other  officers\r\n\nconspired with Laboy  to falsely obtain a search warrant, and\r\n\nwe  readily  affirm  the district  court's  grant  of summary\r\n\njudgment on that claim.\r\n\n          As to Laboy, there is evidence  that on December 2,\r\n\n1993,  FBI  Agent   Plichta  received  a  tip   that  several\r\n\nindividuals intended  to break into  plaintiffs' home, hoping\r\n\nto find two million dollars in hidden drug money and weapons,\r\n\nand that they  planned to murder plaintiffs.   On December 3,\r\n\n1993,  Plichta notified Sergeant  Carri n of the  Puerto Rico\r\n\nPolice Department of the information, and suggested that they\r\n\nobtain a warrant and search  plaintiffs' home for the  money.\r\n\nWe  do  not  comment on  the  implicit  suggestion  that such\r\n\ninformation alone could support a warrant.  In any event, the\r\n\nPuerto Rican Police did not seek a warrant on that basis.\r\n\n          On December  4, Plichta  discussed the matter  with\r\n\nLaboy.   Laboy told  Plichta that on  December 3,  soon after\r\n\nPlichta   spoke  with   Carri n,   Laboy  had   independently\r\n\nestablished facts sufficient to show probable cause to search\r\n\nplaintiffs' home.  He said  he had observed, while working on\r\n\nanother  matter, an  illegal  weapon  exchange  in  front  of\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nplaintiffs' home.   On  December 6, Laboy  obtained a  search\r\n\nwarrant  based on  his  affidavit,  and  invited  Plichta  to\r\n\nparticipate in the search.\r\n\n          Laboy's affidavit in support of his application for\r\n\na warrant stated:\r\n\n          [On the]  3rd day  of December, 1993,  at\r\n          about  4:30 p.m.  I was  in  the area  of\r\n          Cupey in R o  Piedras, Puerto Rico trying\r\n          to locate an address about a complaint  I\r\n          am investigating and upon arriving to the\r\n          Pedro  Castro Road  which is a  dead end,\r\n          when  I  turn at  the end  of the  same I\r\n          realized   there   was    an   individual\r\n          approximately  6  feet tall,  with  white\r\n          skin, brown  hair giving a long  wood and\r\n          black  color  firearm  to  another  white\r\n          individual, who was  approximately 5 feet\r\n          10 inches tall, wearing khaki pants and a\r\n          black  sweater  and  at  that  time  both\r\n          looked toward the vehicle I  was in . . .\r\n          and the individual in the khaki pants and\r\n          black sweater walked toward the front and\r\n          gave  the weapon  once  again to  the  6'\r\n          individual with white skin and turned his\r\n          back and  entered  the  residence.    The\r\n          other   individual   also   entered   the\r\n          residence. . . .  That for my  experience\r\n          as investigating agent  what was observed\r\n          by  me  there  was  a  violation  to  the\r\n          Weapons Act of Puerto Rico and that  said\r\n          residence  is  being   utilized  for  the\r\n          custody of firearms. \r\n\nThe affidavit also  described plaintiffs' house as  the place\r\n\nto be searched and added that \"[t]he services of the K-9 Unit\r\n\nof the Puerto  Rico Police shall be utilized  for this search\r\n\nand seizure.\" \r\n\n          The  district  court  granted  summary judgment  to\r\n\ndefendants, finding that \"[p]laintiffs .  . . have failed  to\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nproduce a scintilla of  non-speculative and reliable evidence\r\n\nthat  the  Defendant-Officers  either  knowingly  used  false\r\n\ninformation or recklessly  disregarded the truth in  order to\r\n\nobtain the  warrant.\"  We  disagree with the  district court,\r\n\nand reverse the grant of summary judgment as to Laboy on this\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n          Plaintiff Andino Serrano put in sworn evidence that\r\n\nshe was  in her house at  the time Laboy says he  saw two men\r\n\nenter the house.3   She says  that no man entered  the house.\r\n\nShe also says that the physical description given by Laboy of\r\n\none  of the  men who  allegedly  entered the  house fits  her\r\n\nhusband.  But, she says, her husband did not enter the  house\r\n\nand was not at the house then.  Her husband, plaintiff Rafael\r\n\nAponte Matos, confirms this and says he was elsewhere.  \r\n\n          It is difficult to think of what more could be said\r\n\nby the  plaintiffs to  raise a  question as  to the  truth of\r\n\nLaboy's statements in the  affidavit that two men carrying  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Andino Serrano's affidavit states:  \r\n\n          I was at my house,  and no male, not even\r\n          my husband, entered my house at 4:30 p.m.\r\n          on December 3,  1993. . .  . I have  read\r\n          the sworn declaration  submitted in order\r\n          to procure a search warrant to search  my\r\n          home on  December 6,  1993, and  although\r\n          the physical  description of  one of  the\r\n          individuals described in said declaration\r\n          resembles my husband, I  know for a  fact\r\n          he was not  at my house that  day at that\r\n          time.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nweapon entered the plaintiffs' house.4  The plaintiff who was\r\n\nhome  at the time says that did  not happen.  Plaintiffs also\r\n\nsuggest that Laboy had a motive to  lie:  he wanted access to\r\n\nthe house  to see if  there was a \"narco-treasure\"  there, as\r\n\nthe  information from Agent Plichta suggested.5  And finally,\r\n\nplaintiffs  note, when  the house  was  searched, no  illegal\r\n\nweapon was found.  This evidence tends  to contradict Laboy's\r\n\nstatement in the  affidavit that he saw two men,  one with an\r\n\nillegal weapon, entering  the house, and  that, based on  his\r\n\nobservation   and  experience,  this   meant  the  house  was\r\n\nillegally being used for custody of firearms.  That statement\r\n\nwas  essential  to  the probable  cause  determination.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nFranks, 438 U.S. at 155-56. \r                  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.   Laboy  attempts  to buttress  his  position through  the\r\naffidavit of Officer Nieves Dom nguez,  who was with Laboy at\r\nthe time.  But Nieves  saw nothing himself and simply reports\r\nwhat Laboy said after he made the alleged observations.\r\n\n5.  Plaintiffs say that on December 22, 1993, two weeks after\r\nthe police  search,  three  unidentified  individuals  robbed\r\nplaintiffs' home.  One of  them, dressed as a police officer,\r\nsaid they were  there to investigate  the December 6  search.\r\nWhen plaintiffs opened the  door, the two other robbers  drew\r\ntheir guns and held plaintiffs Andino Serrano, Aponte Andino,\r\nand  Rafael  Aponte  Matos  at  gun  point.    The  intruders\r\nquestioned  plaintiffs about the  $2 million dollars  in drug\r\nmoney.   The  robbers  went  directly  to  the  places  where\r\nplaintiffs kept their  valuables, and took money,  a handgun,\r\nand jewelry.   Plaintiffs have  alleged that the  robbery was\r\nconnected to the prior police search.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          Our decision  does not forecast  whether plaintiffs\r\n\nwill succeed on  this claim at trial; that is for the jury to\r\n\ndecide.6\r\n\nB.

On May 29, 1996, the district court\r\n\nissued  a Memorandum and  Order granting summary  judgment to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.   The parties' briefing sometimes characterizes the Franks\r                                                                         \r\nissue as an  issue of whether there was  a pretextual search.\r\nWe  reject  that  conceptualization  of  the  legal doctrines\r\ninvolved.   The  Franks rule  is as  we have  stated it;  not\r                                   \r\nwhether   the  search  was  pretextual.    Under  the  Fourth\r\nAmendment reasonableness calculus,  inquiry into an officer's\r\nsubjective  motivations is rarely  appropriate.  See  Ohio v.\r                                                                      \r\nRobinette,  117  S. Ct.  417,  419  (1996); Whren  v.

This  was a  final judgment\r\n\nwithin the meaning  of 28 U.S.C.    1291 and Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n54(b), and was immediately appealable to this court.  Fed. R.\r\n\nApp. P. 4(a)  required plaintiffs to file a  notice of appeal\r\n\nfrom that final judgment within  60 days.  Plaintiffs did not\r\n\nfile a notice of appeal in this case until May 5,  1997, long\r\n\nafter the 60 day deadline had passed.8\r\n\nThe Search of the House\r                                   \r\n\n          The  issue  whether  the  district  court erred  in\r\n\ngranting summary judgment to the  other defendants as well as\r\n\nPlichta on  the claim that  the search exceeded the  scope of\r\n\nthe warrant has been timely appealed.  \r\n\n          In 1993  it was  undoubtedly \"clearly  established\"\r\n\nthat  a  search must  not  exceed  the  scope of  the  search\r\n\nauthorized  in the warrant.   See  Maryland v.  Garrison, 480\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 79,  84 (1986) (\"By limiting the authorization to search\r\n\nto the specific areas and  things for which there is probable\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.   The  court reasoned  that  because Plichta's  attempt to\r\nsearch plaintiffs' computer files was unsuccessful (due to an\r\napparent inability to \"boot up\" the hard drive), there was no\r\nsearch within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  We do not\r\naddress this conclusion because the appeal is untimely.\r\n\n8.   The  appeal of  the  district court s  grant of  summary\r\njudgment  in favor of the unnamed federal supervisor \"Ilario\"\r\nis not properly before us for the same reasons.  The district\r\ncourt entered partial  judgment in favor of \"Ilario\"  on July\r\n22, 1996.  Plaintiffs had 60 days to appeal the judgment, but\r\ndid not do  so until the current  appeal was taken on  May 5,\r\n1997.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\ncause  to   search,  the  [Fourth   Amendment  particularity]\r\n\nrequirement  ensures  that  the  search   will  be  carefully\r\n\ntailored to  its justifications,  and  will not  take on  the\r\n\ncharacter  of  the   wide-ranging  exploratory  searches  the\r\n\nFramers  intended to  prohibit.\"); cf. Horton  v. California,\r                                                                        \r\n\n496 U.S. 128, 140 (1990) (\"If the scope of the search exceeds\r\n\nthat permitted by the terms of a validly issued warrant . . .\r\n\nthe subsequent  seizure is unconstitutional  without more.\").\r\n\nBut to state the  rule is not to answer the  question of when\r\n\nthe search does in fact exceed the warrant.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs' evidence  is insufficient to  show that\r\n\nthe officers who  carried out the search are  not entitled to\r\n\nimmunity.   All plaintiffs  offer is  that when  the officers\r\n\nbegan  their  search,  they  \"questioned\"  plaintiffs  Andino\r\n\nSerrano and  Aponte  Andino  as to  the  whereabouts  of  two\r\n\nmillion dollars in  hidden drug money.  There  is no evidence\r\n\nthat the  officers searched anywhere  in the house  that they\r\n\notherwise could not  have searched for a weapon.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Further,  at least  for immunity  purposes, an\r               \r\n\nofficer could reasonably  think that weapons are  more likely\r\n\nto be in a  house if there are millions of  dollars hidden in\r\n\nthe house  as well,  and that  the question  was sufficiently\r\n\nrelated to the  warrant.  The topic of  questioning during an\r\n\nencounter  which itself does not violate the Fourth Amendment\r\n\nis not so clearly defined  against the officers as to deprive\r\n\nthem of  immunity.  Cf. Florida  v.

See  Richards, 117 S. Ct.  at 1422.

We thus held that  defendant officials' failure\r\n\nto  identify themselves to  the plaintiff s decedent  in 1990\r\n\ndid   not  violate  a  \"clearly  established  law,\"  and  the\r\n\ndefendants  were  \"entitled  to qualified  immunity  on  [the\r\n\nfailure to announce] theory.\"  Id.\r                                              \r\n\n          The same  is true here.  Plaintiffs' claim rests at\r\n\nbest on  Wilson; Wilson  was decided in  1995; the  search of\r                                   \r\n\nplaintiffs'  residence occurred in 1993.

Plaintiffs\r\n\npoint  us  to   the  substantive  due  process   \"shocks  the\r\n\nconscience\" standard  announced in Rochin  v. California, 342\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 165 (1952).  But  an \"excessive force\" claim that arises\r\n\nin the context  of a search or seizure  is \"properly analyzed\r\n\nunder  the  Fourth   Amendment's  'objective  reasonableness'\r\n\nstandard.\"    Graham  v.

It is also true that the typical\r\n\n\"excessive force\" claim  arises in the  context of an  arrest\r\n\nand generally  involves physical  contact and  injury to  the\r\n\narrestee.  Here,  there was no arrest, no  physical force was\r\n\nused on any  of the plaintiffs,  and none sustained  physical\r\n\ninjury.    To  the extent  there can be  such a claim  in the\r\n\nabsence of  physical force, the  plaintiffs themselves stated\r\n\nin  their depositions  that the searching  officers conducted\r\n\nthemselves in an orderly manner  once inside the home.  Under\r\n\nthese circumstances, we doubt  any Fourth Amendment violation\r\n\nat all has been stated,  let alone one unreasonable enough to\r\n\novercome official immunity.  See Hinojosa v. City of Terrell,\r                                                                        \r\n\n834  F.2d  1223,  1229  (5th  Cir. 1988)  (in     1983  suit,\r\n\nexcessive force claim was not sustainable  where there was no\r\n\nevidence of physical injury). \r\n\n          The only  allegation worthy  of discussion is  that\r\n\nOfficer  Jimmy Col n directed abusive language at Iris Teresa\r\n\nwhen  she  sought entry  to  plaintiffs'  home, and  that  he\r\n\ndisplayed his  weapon and threatened  to kill her if  she did\r\n\nnot stay behind the police barricade.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\n          We assume that  Iris Teresa's version of  the facts\r\n\nis accurate -- that Col n  threatened her and pointed his gun\r\n\nat her.  Even so, as the district court held, defendant Col n\r\n\nis entitled to  qualified immunity.  Iris  Teresa insisted on\r\n\nentering the  house at the  time a police search  for weapons\r\n\nwas underway.   Col n was  posted at the blockade  and it was\r\n\nhis  duty to  ensure  that  no one  entered  the house.    He\r\n\nreasonably could have believed  that he needed to assert  his\r\n\nauthority  in order  to  prevent  Iris  Teresa  from  passing\r\n\nthrough the blockade.  Indeed,  the threat may well have been\r\n\nreasonably intended  to avoid  the need  to use  any physical\r\n\nforce to restrain her.  There is no dispute that no  physical\r\n\nforce was used.   Cf. Hinojosa, 834 F.2d 1223, 1229-30.9  The\r                                          \r\n\nevidence  is plainly insufficient  to sustain a  finding that\r\n\nCol n's actions were objectively unreasonable.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.   In  Hinojosa, the  Fifth  Circuit confronted  a  similar\r                             \r\nsituation and found the lack  of physical injury to be highly\r\nrelevant in deciding the excessive use of force claim:\r\n\n          There  is absolutely  no evidence  . .  .\r\n          that   Hinojosa  was   struck,  or   even\r\n          touched, during  the incident.   Hinojosa\r\n          did not claim to have suffered even minor\r\n          physical  injuries  or   intrusion.    He\r\n          sought no medical attention. . . .  Thus,\r\n          even stretching the  testimony as far  as\r\n          possible  in a  light  most favorable  to\r\n          Hinojosa,  the  only harm  occasioned  by\r\n          Jones'   pointing   his   gun   was   the\r\n          understandable     immediate    emotional\r\n          distress of Hinojosa  at being the target\r\n          of the gun point.\r\n\n834 F.2d at 1230.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nE.

Plaintiffs argue that these defendants\r\n\nwere  negligent  in  the  training  and  supervision  of  the\r\n\nsearching officers, and that they therefore exhibited callous\r\n\nindifference to plaintiffs  constitutional rights.\r\n\n          Supervisory  liability  under     1983  \"cannot  be\r\n\npredicated on a  respondeat theory, but only on  the basis of\r\n\nthe supervisor s own acts or omissions.\"  Seekamp v.

Plaintiffs' evidence presents genuine disputes of fact as to whether the material representations made by Laboy in the warrant application were true or were fabricated.  It has long been well established that such a material fabrication violates the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.  Further, we have no doubt that officers reasonably understand that they may not lie in order to establish probable cause in a warrant application.  If plaintiffs are able to prove their claim at trial, Laboy will not be protected by qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, it was error to enter summary judgment in favor of Laboy on that claim.  But plaintiffs have not made any showing that others assisted or even knew of the alleged falsehoods, nor have plaintiffs provided facts to support the claim that the search itself was unreasonable.  For these and other reasons the dismissal of all other defendants and all other claims is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Entry of summary judgment is reviewed de novo and we take the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.

A group of people emerged from the cars and began walking toward the house.  One member of the group had an ax;  none was uniformed.  Plaintiffs believed they were about to be robbed.  Without identifying themselves as police officers, the individuals broke down the door to the house with the ax and entered.  Only after plaintiffs begged the people not to kill them did the officers identify themselves as police and show the two women a search warrant for the house.  The warrant authorized a search of plaintiffs' home for weapons, and nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers conducted the search in an efficient and orderly fashion, without the use of force.  Several officers questioned the two women inside about whether there were large sums of drug money hidden inside the house.  FBI Agent Michael Plichta also attempted to search the computer files to find evidence of drugs or drug money, but could not gain access to any files.  The entire search lasted two hours, and failed to turn up evidence of illegal weapons, drugs, drug money, or, indeed, of any criminal activity.  Another daughter, Iris Teresa Aponte Andino (Iris Teresa), returned and tried to enter the house.  An officer outside refused to let Iris Teresa through the blockade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May of 1995, Aponte Andino, Andino Serrano, Rafael Aponte Matos (Andino Serrano's husband), and Iris Teresa filed this action for damages under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and against the federal officials under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).  They alleged violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs sued two groups of defendants.  The first group is composed of the state and federal line officers who participated in the search:  Puerto Rican Police Officers Ernesto Laboy-Escobar, Ernesto Torres Lebrn, Jimmy Coln, Zulma Fernandez, Ivan-Nieves Domnguez, and FBI Agent Michael Plichta.  Plaintiffs alleged that these defendants violated plaintiffs' right to be free from unreasonable searches by fabricating facts to obtain the search warrant, conducting a search that exceeded the scope of the warrant, and using excessive force in carrying out the search.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs sued the second group of defendants, the supervisors, alleging that they failed adequately to train and supervise the first group of defendants.  This group of defendants included both state and federal supervisors:  Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) Superintendent Pedro Toledo-Davila, PRPD Supervisor Carlos Haddock, PRPD Auxiliary Superintendent of Inspection and Disciplinary Affairs Jose Zapata, PRPD Lieutenant Juan Ortz-Daz, and FBI Director Lewis Freeh and an unidentified FBI supervisor named \"Ilario.\"   Plaintiffs alleged that these defendants knew that the officers involved in the search had records of violence, and that the supervisors had callously disregarded plaintiffs' constitutional rights by inadequately supervising their subordinates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All defendants moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.  On December 13, 1995, the district court granted in part Agent Plichta's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the claim that Plichta engaged in a \"pretextual\" search of plaintiffs' home.  On May 29, 1996, the court entered partial judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claim that Plichta exceeded the scope of the warrant by searching plaintiffs' computer files.  On July 22, 1996, the court entered partial judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claim against the unnamed federal supervisor \"Ilario.\"   On April 4, 1997, the court dismissed all the remaining claims against all defendants on qualified immunity grounds.  Plaintiffs appeal all of these dismissals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo.  See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995).  We will affirm if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  In order to overcome defendants' motions for summary judgment, plaintiffs must come forward with \"specific, provable facts which establish that there is a triable issue.\"  Febus-Rodriguez v. Betancourt-Lebron, 14 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.1994).  For a dispute to be \"genuine,\" there must be sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable trier of fact to resolve the issue in favor of the non-moving party.  See United States v. One Parcel of Real Property, 960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity protects both federal and state officials from liability for damages in a civil rights action if \"a reasonable officer could have believed [his actions] to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information the [acting] officer[ ] possessed.\"  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3040, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).  There are two aspects to this standard.  The first inquiry is whether the constitutional right asserted by plaintiffs was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.  The second, if the right was clearly established, is whether a reasonable officer in the same situation would \"have understood that the challenged conduct violated that established right.\"  Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1373 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 235-36 (1st Cir.1990)).  If the first level of the analysis yields a determination that the asserted constitutional right was not clearly established at the relevant time, then we need not proceed to the second prong;  there is qualified immunity.

Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), that the use of false statements to obtain a warrant, where the false statements are necessary to the finding of probable cause, violates the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.  As the Franks Court noted, the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment itself contemplates the affiant's truthfulness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>[N]o warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">438 U.S. at 164, 98 S.Ct. at 2681 (quoting U.S. Const. amend.

See id. at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. at 2684-85.   It is not enough to allege negligence or innocent mistake.  See id.   This court has consistently followed the Franks rule.  See, e.g., United States v.

Fletcher, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 502, 139 L.Ed.2d 471 (1997).  In that case, the Court held that a prosecutor is not entitled to absolute immunity for making false statements in an affidavit supporting an application for an arrest warrant, and may be personally liable for such actions.  See id. at ----, 118 S.Ct. at 505-06.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, plaintiffs allege that Laboy fabricated facts in support of probable cause in order to obtain a warrant to search plaintiffs' home, and that other defendants conspired with Laboy to obtain this fraudulently procured warrant.  Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that other officers conspired with Laboy to falsely obtain a search warrant, and we readily affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Laboy, there is evidence that on December 2, 1993, FBI Agent Plichta received a tip that several individuals intended to break into plaintiffs' home, hoping to find two million dollars in hidden drug money and weapons, and that they planned to murder plaintiffs.  On December 3, 1993, Plichta notified Sergeant Carrin of the Puerto Rico Police Department of the information, and suggested that they obtain a warrant and search plaintiffs' home for the money.  We do not comment on the implicit suggestion that such information alone could support a warrant.  In any event, the Puerto Rican Police did not seek a warrant on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, Plichta discussed the matter with Laboy.  Laboy told Plichta that on December 3, soon after Plichta spoke with Carrin, Laboy had independently established facts sufficient to show probable cause to search plaintiffs' home.  He said he had observed, while working on another matter, an illegal weapon exchange in front of plaintiffs' home.  On December 6, Laboy obtained a search warrant based on his affidavit, and invited Plichta to participate in the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboy's affidavit in support of his application for a warrant stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[On the] 3rd day of December, 1993, at about 4:30 p.m.  I was in the area of Cupey in Ro Piedras, Puerto Rico trying to locate an address about a complaint I am investigating and upon arriving to the Pedro Castro Road which is a dead end, when I turn at the end of the same I realized there was an individual approximately 6 feet tall, with white skin, brown hair giving a long wood and black color firearm to another white individual, who was approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall, wearing khaki pants and a black sweater and at that time both looked toward the vehicle I was in ... and the individual in the khaki pants and black sweater walked toward the front and gave the weapon once again to the 6' individual with white skin and turned his back and entered the residence.  The other individual also entered the residence....  That for my experience as investigating agent what was observed by me there was a violation to the Weapons Act of Puerto Rico and that said residence is being utilized for the custody of firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit also described plaintiffs' house as the place to be searched and added that \"[t]he services of the K-9 Unit of the Puerto Rico Police shall be utilized for this search and seizure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment to defendants, finding that \"[p]laintiffs ... have failed to produce a scintilla of non-speculative and reliable evidence that the Defendant-Officers either knowingly used false information or recklessly disregarded the truth in order to obtain the warrant.\"   We disagree with the district court, and reverse the grant of summary judgment as to Laboy on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Andino Serrano put in sworn evidence that she was in her house at the time Laboy says he saw two men enter the house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  She says that no man entered the house.  She also says that the physical description given by Laboy of one of the men who allegedly entered the house fits her husband.  But, she says, her husband did not enter the house and was not at the house then.  Her husband, plaintiff Rafael Aponte Matos, confirms this and says he was elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to think of what more could be said by the plaintiffs to raise a question as to the truth of Laboy's statements in the affidavit that two men carrying a weapon entered the plaintiffs' house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The plaintiff who was home at the time says that did not happen.  Plaintiffs also suggest that Laboy had a motive to lie:  he wanted access to the house to see if there was a \"narco-treasure\" there, as the information from Agent Plichta suggested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  And finally, plaintiffs note, when the house was searched, no illegal weapon was found.  This evidence tends to contradict Laboy's statement in the affidavit that he saw two men, one with an illegal weapon, entering the house, and that, based on his observation and experience, this meant the house was illegally being used for custody of firearms.  That statement was essential to the probable cause determination.

On May 29, 1996, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order granting summary judgment to Plichta on the computer search claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and entered partial judgment dismissing the claim.  This was a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and was immediately appealable to this court.  Fed. R.App. P. 4(a) required plaintiffs to file a notice of appeal from that final judgment within 60 days.  Plaintiffs did not file a notice of appeal in this case until May 5, 1997, long after the 60 day deadline had passed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Search of the House</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the other defendants as well as Plichta on the claim that the search exceeded the scope of the warrant has been timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993 it was undoubtedly \"clearly established\" that a search must not exceed the scope of the search authorized in the warrant.  See Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S.Ct. 1013, 1016, 94 L.Ed.2d 72 (1986) (\"By limiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is probable cause to search, the [Fourth Amendment particularity] requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on the character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\");   cf. Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 140, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 2310, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990) (\"If the scope of the search exceeds that permitted by the terms of a validly issued warrant ... the subsequent seizure is unconstitutional without more.\").  But to state the rule is not to answer the question of when the search does in fact exceed the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' evidence is insufficient to show that the officers who carried out the search are not entitled to immunity.  All plaintiffs offer is that when the officers began their search, they \"questioned\" plaintiffs Andino Serrano and Aponte Andino as to the whereabouts of two million dollars in hidden drug money.  There is no evidence that the officers searched anywhere in the house that they otherwise could not have searched for a weapon.  See United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 820, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982) (\"A lawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found....\").  The Ross Court provided an illustration pertinent here:  \"A warrant that authorizes an officer to search a home for illegal weapons also provides authority to open closets, chests, drawers, and containers in which the weapon might be found.\"  Id. at 821, 102 S.Ct. at 2171.   Further, at least for immunity purposes, an officer could reasonably think that weapons are more likely to be in a house if there are millions of dollars hidden in the house as well, and that the question was sufficiently related to the warrant.  The topic of questioning during an encounter which itself does not violate the Fourth Amendment is not so clearly defined against the officers as to deprive them of immunity.  Cf. Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1323-24, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (officers do not violate Fourth Amendment by approaching individual in public place and posing questions);  United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (Fourth Amendment not violated when officers ask questions of individuals without particularized suspicion, where reasonable person would not feel obligated to answer).  There is no suggestion that the searching officers ordered or forced plaintiffs to answer the questions, and plaintiffs were free not to answer.  See Robinette, 519 U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 421 (Fourth Amendment reasonableness requirement not violated where officer asks driver questions unrelated to initial justification for stop, and driver voluntarily answers questions and consents to search).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' evidence is inadequate to overcome qualified immunity.  We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment dismissing the claim that the search exceeded the scope of the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Failure to Knock and Announce</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs assert that the officers who conducted the search violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights by failing to announce their presence and identify themselves as police before they entered the house by breaking down the door with an ax.  The district court acknowledged that \"upon approaching the entrance to the home, the officers never announced their presence or their purpose.\"   It did not, however, rule on the claim that this was a violation of plaintiffs' rights, see Richards v. Wisconsin, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997) (Fourth Amendment does not permit blanket exception to knock and announce rule);  Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995) (failure to knock and announce forms part of reasonableness inquiry), nor do we.  Even assuming that there is, on these facts, a right to have the police knock and announce, the asserted right was not clearly established as being of constitutional dimension at the time the alleged violation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Richards makes clear, Wilson neither announced an absolute knock-and-announce rule nor created categorical exceptions to the rule for felony drug cases.  In Richards, the court found that a no-knock entry into a hotel room was justified where the officers had a reasonable suspicion that the occupant would destroy the evidence if given the opportunity.  See Richards, --- U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1422.   We do not reach the question of whether it is reasonable for officers, armed with a warrant to search for weapons, to fail to announce they are police before they enter the area to be searched, because we resolve this on immunity grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In St. Hilaire, this court held that the requirement that officials identify themselves to the subject of a search or seizure, absent exigent circumstances, was \"not clearly of constitutional dimension\" until the Supreme Court decided Wilson in 1995, and that the notice requirement \"was not ... clearly established in this Circuit as a constitutional requirement until Wilson.\"  St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 28.   We thus held that defendant officials' failure to identify themselves to the plaintiff's decedent in 1990 did not violate a \"clearly established law,\" and the defendants were \"entitled to qualified immunity on [the failure to announce] theory.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true here.  Plaintiffs' claim rests at best on Wilson; Wilson was decided in 1995;  the search of plaintiffs' residence occurred in 1993.  We affirm the grant of summary judgment to defendants on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>D. Use of Excessive Force in Executing the Search</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the search of their home was unreasonable because it was carried out with an excessive use of force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' basic theory may be sound but their arguments seek shelter in the wrong doorway.  Plaintiffs point us to the substantive due process \"shocks the conscience\" standard announced in Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952).  But an \"excessive force\" claim that arises in the context of a search or seizure is \"properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's 'objective reasonableness' standard.\"  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1867-68, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (expressly rejecting the Rochin \"shocks the conscience\" test where the claim arises in the context of an investigatory stop).  \"The 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\"  Id. at 396, 109 S.Ct. at 1872;  see also Alexis v. McDonald's Restaurants, 67 F.3d 341, 352 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[A] viable excessive force claim must demonstrate that the police defendant's actions were not objectively reasonable, viewed in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him and without regard to his underlying intent or motivation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs point to the following actions in support of their excessive force claim:  the officers' failure to announce their presence, the use of 10 to 15 officers to carry out the search, the use of an ax to knock down the door, the use of dogs during the search, and one officer's allegedly threatening behavior directed at plaintiff Iris Teresa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that there may be searches carried out in such an excessive manner that they are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  It is also true that the typical \"excessive force\" claim arises in the context of an arrest and generally involves physical contact and injury to the arrestee.  Here, there was no arrest, no physical force was used on any of the plaintiffs, and none sustained physical injury.  To the extent there can be such a claim in the absence of physical force, the plaintiffs themselves stated in their depositions that the searching officers conducted themselves in an orderly manner once inside the home.  Under these circumstances, we doubt any Fourth Amendment violation at all has been stated, let alone one unreasonable enough to overcome official immunity.  See Hinojosa v. City of Terrell, 834 F.2d 1223, 1229 (5th Cir.1988) (in &#167; 1983 suit, excessive force claim was not sustainable where there was no evidence of physical injury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only allegation worthy of discussion is that Officer Jimmy Coln directed abusive language at Iris Teresa when she sought entry to plaintiffs' home, and that he displayed his weapon and threatened to kill her if she did not stay behind the police barricade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume that Iris Teresa's version of the facts is accurate--that Coln threatened her and pointed his gun at her.  Even so, as the district court held, defendant Coln is entitled to qualified immunity.  Iris Teresa insisted on entering the house at the time a police search for weapons was underway.  Coln was posted at the blockade and it was his duty to ensure that no one entered the house.  He reasonably could have believed that he needed to assert his authority in order to prevent Iris Teresa from passing through the blockade.  Indeed, the threat may well have been reasonably intended to avoid the need to use any physical force to restrain her.  There is no dispute that no physical force was used.  Cf. Hinojosa, 834 F.2d 1223, 1229-30.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The evidence is plainly insufficient to sustain a finding that Coln's actions were objectively unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Supervisory Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the claim that defendants Haddock, Toledo-Davila, Zapata, and Ortz-Daz are liable in their supervisory capacity.  Plaintiffs argue that these defendants were negligent in the training and supervision of the searching officers, and that they therefore exhibited callous indifference to plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Supervisory liability under &#167; 1983 \"cannot be predicated on a respondeat theory, but only on the basis of the supervisor's own acts or omissions.\"  Seekamp v. Michaud, 109 F.3d 802, 808 (1st Cir.1997) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  There is supervisory liability only if (1) there is subordinate liability, and (2) the supervisor's action or inaction was \"affirmatively linked\" to the constitutional violation caused by the subordinate.  See id.  (citing Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 902 (1st Cir.1988)).  That affirmative link must amount to \"supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence, or gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference.\"  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no possibility of subordinate liability except for the falsification claim against defendant Laboy.  See supra.   But plaintiffs' evidence does not link Laboy's supposed falsehoods to supervisory condonation or callous indifference.  None of the defendants here had any connection to Laboy's affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs offer evidence that defendant Haddock pressured his subordinates to execute at least three search warrants every month.  They also offer documents they claim prove Laboy's history of misconduct, including a 1989 Puerto Rico Supreme Court case criticizing Laboy for having acted irresponsibly in a criminal case in 1985.  See El Pueblo v. Heriberto Carrasquillo Morales, 123 P.R. Dec. 690 (1989).  That Haddock may have exerted pressure on his staff to execute search warrants is not evidence he acquiesced in or callously disregarded the making of false statements to a judicial officer.  And while a supervisor's failure to take remedial actions regarding a miscreant officer may result in supervisory liability where it amounts to \"deliberate indifference,\" see Diaz v. Martinez, 112 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997), a judicial opinion citing Laboy as irresponsible in something he did nine years before the events at issue here does not establish such indifference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of summary judgment is reversed and remanded with respect to the falsification claim against defendant Laboy in the obtaining of the search warrant, and affirmed with respect to all other claims, including the claims against all the remaining defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also alleged in their complaint that the officials conducting the search deprived plaintiffs of their right to counsel during the search.

When plaintiffs opened the door, the two other robbers drew their guns and held plaintiffs Andino Serrano, Aponte Andino, and Rafael Aponte Matos at gun point.  The intruders questioned plaintiffs about the $2 million dollars in drug money.  The robbers went directly to the places where plaintiffs kept their valuables, and took money, a handgun, and jewelry.

Plaintiffs' evidence presents genuine disputes of fact as to whether the material representations made by Laboy in the warrant application were true or were fabricated.  It has long been well established that such a material fabrication violates the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.  Further, we have no doubt that officers reasonably understand that they may not lie in order to establish probable cause in a warrant application.

Without identifying themselves as police officers, the individuals broke down the door to the house with the ax and entered.

The second, if the right was clearly established, is whether a reasonable officer in the same situation would \"have understood that the challenged conduct violated that established right.\"  Hegarty v.

Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that other officers conspired with Laboy to falsely obtain a search warrant, and we readily affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Laboy, there is evidence that on December 2, 1993, FBI Agent Plichta received a tip that several individuals intended to break into plaintiffs' home, hoping to find two million dollars in hidden drug money and weapons, and that they planned to murder plaintiffs.  On December 3, 1993, Plichta notified Sergeant Carrin of the Puerto Rico Police Department of the information, and suggested that they obtain a warrant and search plaintiffs' home for the money.  We do not comment on the implicit suggestion that such information alone could support a warrant.

He said he had observed, while working on another matter, an illegal weapon exchange in front of plaintiffs' home.  On December 6, Laboy obtained a search warrant based on his affidavit, and invited Plichta to participate in the search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboy's affidavit in support of his application for a warrant stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[On the] 3rd day of December, 1993, at about 4:30 p.m.  I was in the area of Cupey in Ro Piedras, Puerto Rico trying to locate an address about a complaint I am investigating and upon arriving to the Pedro Castro Road which is a dead end, when I turn at the end of the same I realized there was an individual approximately 6 feet tall, with white skin, brown hair giving a long wood and black color firearm to another white individual, who was approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall, wearing khaki pants and a black sweater and at that time both looked toward the vehicle I was in ... and the individual in the khaki pants and black sweater walked toward the front and gave the weapon once again to the 6' individual with white skin and turned his back and entered the residence.  The other individual also entered the residence....  That for my experience as investigating agent what was observed by me there was a violation to the Weapons Act of Puerto Rico and that said residence is being utilized for the custody of firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit also described plaintiffs' house as the place to be searched and added that \"[t]he services of the K-9 Unit of the Puerto Rico Police shall be utilized for this search and seizure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment to defendants, finding that \"[p]laintiffs ... have failed to produce a scintilla of non-speculative and reliable evidence that the Defendant-Officers either knowingly used false information or recklessly disregarded the truth in order to obtain the warrant.\"   We disagree with the district court, and reverse the grant of summary judgment as to Laboy on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Andino Serrano put in sworn evidence that she was in her house at the time Laboy says he saw two men enter the house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  She says that no man entered the house.  She also says that the physical description given by Laboy of one of the men who allegedly entered the house fits her husband.  But, she says, her husband did not enter the house and was not at the house then.  Her husband, plaintiff Rafael Aponte Matos, confirms this and says he was elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to think of what more could be said by the plaintiffs to raise a question as to the truth of Laboy's statements in the affidavit that two men carrying a weapon entered the plaintiffs' house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The plaintiff who was home at the time says that did not happen.  Plaintiffs also suggest that Laboy had a motive to lie:  he wanted access to the house to see if there was a \"narco-treasure\" there, as the information from Agent Plichta suggested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  And finally, plaintiffs note, when the house was searched, no illegal weapon was found.  This evidence tends to contradict Laboy's statement in the affidavit that he saw two men, one with an illegal weapon, entering the house, and that, based on his observation and experience, this meant the house was illegally being used for custody of firearms.  That statement was essential to the probable cause determination.

All plaintiffs offer is that when the officers began their search, they \"questioned\" plaintiffs Andino Serrano and Aponte Andino as to the whereabouts of two million dollars in hidden drug money.  There is no evidence that the officers searched anywhere in the house that they otherwise could not have searched for a weapon.  See United States v.

Further, at least for immunity purposes, an officer could reasonably think that weapons are more likely to be in a house if there are millions of dollars hidden in the house as well, and that the question was sufficiently related to the warrant.  The topic of questioning during an encounter which itself does not violate the Fourth Amendment is not so clearly defined against the officers as to deprive them of immunity.  Cf. Florida v.

California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104943\"><a href=\"/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104943\"><a href=\"/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But an \"excessive force\" claim that arises in the context of a search or seizure is \"properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's 'objective reasonableness' standard.\"  Graham v.

McDonald's Restaurants, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196337\"><a href=\"/opinion/196337/alexis-v-mcdonalds-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[A] viable excessive force claim must demonstrate that the police defendant's actions were not objectively reasonable, viewed in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him and without regard to his underlying intent or motivation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs point to the following actions in support of their excessive force claim:  the officers' failure to announce their presence, the use of 10 to 15 officers to carry out the search, the use of an ax to knock down the door, the use of dogs during the search, and one officer's allegedly threatening behavior directed at plaintiff Iris Teresa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that there may be searches carried out in such an excessive manner that they are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  It is also true that the typical \"excessive force\" claim arises in the context of an arrest and generally involves physical contact and injury to the arrestee.  Here, there was no arrest, no physical force was used on any of the plaintiffs, and none sustained physical injury.  To the extent there can be such a claim in the absence of physical force, the plaintiffs themselves stated in their depositions that the searching officers conducted themselves in an orderly manner once inside the home.  Under these circumstances, we doubt any Fourth Amendment violation at all has been stated, let alone one unreasonable enough to overcome official immunity.  See Hinojosa v. City of Terrell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498399\"><a href=\"/opinion/498399/guadalupe-r-hinojosa-v-the-city-of-terrell-texas-ron-jones-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span>, 1229 (5th Cir.1988) (in &#167; 1983 suit, excessive force claim was not sustainable where there was no evidence of physical injury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only allegation worthy of discussion is that Officer Jimmy Coln directed abusive language at Iris Teresa when she sought entry to plaintiffs' home, and that he displayed his weapon and threatened to kill her if she did not stay behind the police barricade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume that Iris Teresa's version of the facts is accurate--that Coln threatened her and pointed his gun at her.  Even so, as the district court held, defendant Coln is entitled to qualified immunity.  Iris Teresa insisted on entering the house at the time a police search for weapons was underway.  Coln was posted at the blockade and it was his duty to ensure that no one entered the house.  He reasonably could have believed that he needed to assert his authority in order to prevent Iris Teresa from passing through the blockade.  Indeed, the threat may well have been reasonably intended to avoid the need to use any physical force to restrain her.  There is no dispute that no physical force was used.  Cf. Hinojosa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498399\"><a href=\"/opinion/498399/guadalupe-r-hinojosa-v-the-city-of-terrell-texas-ron-jones-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span>, 1229-30.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The evidence is plainly insufficient to sustain a finding that Coln's actions were objectively unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Supervisory Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the claim that defendants Haddock, Toledo-Davila, Zapata, and Ortz-Daz are liable in their supervisory capacity.  Plaintiffs argue that these defendants were negligent in the training and supervision of the searching officers, and that they therefore exhibited callous indifference to plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Supervisory liability under &#167; 1983 \"cannot be predicated on a respondeat theory, but only on the basis of the supervisor's own acts or omissions.\"  Seekamp v. Michaud, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197262\"><a href=\"/opinion/197262/seekamp-v-michaud/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span>, 808 (1st Cir.1997) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  There is supervisory liability only if (1) there is subordinate liability, and (2) the supervisor's action or inaction was \"affirmatively linked\" to the constitutional violation caused by the subordinate.  See id.  (citing Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516408\"><a href=\"/opinion/516408/annabelle-lipsett-v-university-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span>, 902 (1st Cir.1988)).  That affirmative link must amount to \"supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence, or gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference.\"  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no possibility of subordinate liability except for the falsification claim against defendant Laboy.  See supra.   But plaintiffs' evidence does not link Laboy's supposed falsehoods to supervisory condonation or callous indifference.  None of the defendants here had any connection to Laboy's affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs offer evidence that defendant Haddock pressured his subordinates to execute at least three search warrants every month.  They also offer documents they claim prove Laboy's history of misconduct, including a 1989 Puerto Rico Supreme Court case criticizing Laboy for having acted irresponsibly in a criminal case in 1985.  See El Pueblo v. Heriberto Carrasquillo Morales, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></span> (1989).  That Haddock may have exerted pressure on his staff to execute search warrants is not evidence he acquiesced in or callously disregarded the making of false statements to a judicial officer.  And while a supervisor's failure to take remedial actions regarding a miscreant officer may result in supervisory liability where it amounts to \"deliberate indifference,\" see Diaz v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197322\"><a href=\"/opinion/197322/rosario-diaz-v-diaz-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1997), a judicial opinion citing Laboy as irresponsible in something he did nine years before the events at issue here does not establish such indifference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of summary judgment is reversed and remanded with respect to the falsification claim against defendant Laboy in the obtaining of the search warrant, and affirmed with respect to all other claims, including the claims against all the remaining defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also alleged in their complaint that the officials conducting the search deprived plaintiffs of their right to counsel during the search.  They alleged that their lawyer was outside of the house, but the police would not allow counsel to be with her clients inside.  Plaintiffs do not present this claim as a specific issue on appeal, nor develop any argument regarding the claim, and it is deemed waived.  See King v. Town of Hanover, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742622\"><a href=\"/opinion/742622/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1266-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44807-bruce-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 970 (1st Cir.1997) (collecting cases)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This is similar to, and derives from the same constitutional source as, the claim that an officer reasonably should have known that facts alleged in support of a warrant application were insufficient to establish probable cause.

One of them, dressed as a police officer, said they were there to investigate the December 6 search.  When plaintiffs opened the door, the two other robbers drew their guns and held plaintiffs Andino Serrano, Aponte Andino, and Rafael Aponte Matos at gun point.  The intruders questioned plaintiffs about the $2 million dollars in drug money.  The robbers went directly to the places where plaintiffs kept their valuables, and took money, a handgun, and jewelry.
