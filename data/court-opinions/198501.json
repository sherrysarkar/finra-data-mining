Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJames B. Krasnoo on brief for appellant.\r\nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\r\nMcGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 27, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Juan Carlos Duran, who pled guilty to one count\r\nof conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute\r\nheroin, appeals from his sentence on the sole ground that the\r\ndistrict court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for\r\npossession of a weapon under U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1).\r\n\"We review factual determinations made in the course of\r\nsentencing for clear error, mindful that such determinations need\r\nonly be supported by preponderant evidence.  Moreover, the district\r\ncourt's application of a relevant guideline to the facts of a given\r\ncase is a fact-sensitive matter that engenders clear-error review.\"\r\nUnited States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1997) (citations\r\nomitted), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 118 S. Ct. 725 (1998).\r\nIt was not clear error for the district court to conclude that\r\nthe government satisfied its burden of showing the requisite \"nexus\r\nbetween the weapon and the offense.\" Id. at 9.  On this record, the\r\ndistrict court's finding that \"the gun was placed [in the hall\r\ncloset] to be available to be utilized if necessary to protect the\r\ndrug transaction proceeds that were secreted in the bedroom,\" was\r\nnot clearly erroneous.  This constructive possession for such\r\npurpose qualifies as \"possess[ion] [of] the weapon during the\r\ncurrency of the offense.\" Id. at 10.\r\nOnce \"the government has shown that a firearm possessed by the\r\ndefendant was present during the commission of the offense, the\r\nburden shifts to the defendant to persuade the factfinder that a\r\nconnection between the weapon and the crime is clearly improbable.\"\r\nId.   Duran  failed to meet that burden.   His arguments that the\r\n                           2\r\nenhancement should not apply because 1) the gun was not present\r\nduring any of the drug transactions and 2) the gun was not located\r\nin close enough proximity to the drugs, are unavailing.\r\nWe have not interpreted 2D1.1(1)(b) as requiring that the\r\ndefendant have the gun on his person during a drug transaction. \r\n\"While a nexus must be shown between the weapon and the criminal\r\nact, the defendant need not have the weapon on his person or in the\r\nimmediate vicinity for the enhancement to apply.  Presence may be\r\nconstructively established.\" United States v. Pineda, 981 F.2d 569,\r\n473 (1st Cir. 1992).  Where defendant is convicted of conspiracy to\r\ncommit a drug offense, \"the sentencing guidelines require only that\r\na gun be present during some portion of an ongoing crime.\" United\r\nStates v. Berrios, 132 F.3d 834, 839 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nNor have we required that the weapon be located in close\r\nproximity to the drugs.  The enhancement applies if the weapon is\r\nused to protect either the participants, the drugs or the cash\r\ninvolved in the drug business during the ongoing conspiracy. See\r\nUnited States v. Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 727 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\nIn United States v. Paulino, 887 F.2d 358 (1st Cir. 1989), this\r\ncourt affirmed application of the weapon enhancement on facts\r\nsimilar to these.  A gun was found in an apartment where cash\r\nproceeds of the drug transactions were stored.  The drugs\r\nthemselves were found in a separate apartment.  We held that\r\n\"[g]iven the facts of the instant case, it is not 'clearly\r\nimprobable' that the loaded 9 mm. semi-automatic pistol was\r\nconnected to the drug offense.\" Id. at 360.\r\nThe district court was not clearly erroneous in applying the\r\n2D1.1(1)(b) sentence enhancement and the judgment is therefore\r\naffirmed.
