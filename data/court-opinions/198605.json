The Edward Street Daycare Center\r\n(the Center) petitions us to set aside a final order of the\r\nNational Labor Relations Board (the Board) requiring the Center to\r\ncease and desist from its refusal to bargain with Truck Drivers\r\nUnion Local 170, affiliated with the International Brotherhood of\r\nTeamsters, AFL-CIO (the Union) as the exclusive bargaining\r\nrepresentative of the employees in the bargaining unit.  The Board\r\ncross-petitions for enforcement of its order.  After reviewing the\r\nrecord as a whole, we conclude that the Board's decision is\r\nsupported by substantial evidence.  We therefore deny the Center's\r\npetition, grant the Board's cross-petition, and order enforcement\r\nof the Board's order pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act\r\n(the Act).  We begin our explanation with the procedural\r\nbackground.\r\nI. Procedural History\r\nIn March 1998, the Union filed a petition with the Board\r\nseeking to be certified as the exclusive collective bargaining\r\nrepresentative for all non-supervisory employees of the Center, a\r\nday care center in Worcester, Massachusetts that serves\r\napproximately 93 children \"in developmentally appropriate settings\r\nso the families can work or receive training for employment\r\nopportunities.\"  The Center is open five days a week, 52 weeks a\r\nyear and employs approximately 23 people (both full and part time). \r\nThe Center challenged the Union's petition, claiming that the\r\nUnion's proposed bargaining unit was inappropriate because it\r\nincluded three Head Teachers and the Coordinator of Billing and\r\nOperations, all allegedly supervisors within the meaning of the\r\nAct.\r\nOn March 20, 1998, a hearing officer employed by the\r\nRegional Director for the First Region of the Board held a hearing\r\nas the Board's designee.  Following that hearing, the Regional\r\nDirector issued a Decision and Direction of Election on April 15, \r\n1998, concluding that the Center had not established that the Head\r\nTeachers or the Coordinator of Billing and Operations were\r\nsupervisors under the Act.  Consequently, the Regional Director\r\ncertified an exclusive bargaining unit including \"[a]ll full time\r\nand regular part-time head teachers, assistant head teachers in\r\ntraining, teachers in training, the coordinator of billing and\r\noperations, the cook, the assistant cooks, maintenance and\r\nhousekeeping employees, and the bookkeeper.\"  The Center sought\r\nreview of the Regional Director's decision before the Board but\r\nsuch review was denied on May 13, 1998, because the Board\r\ndetermined that the Center raised \"no substantial issues warranting\r\nreview.\"  An election was held on May 15, 1998, in which (1) the\r\nprofessional employees (the head teachers) voted to be included in\r\na bargaining unit with the non-professional employees, and (2) the\r\nCenter's employees voted for the Union by a margin of fifteen to\r\ntwo.  On May 27, 1998, the Board certified the Union as the\r\nbargaining unit's exclusive representative.\r\nThe dispute then took a familiar path.  Employers cannot\r\nobtain direct judicial review of union certification decisions. \r\nTherefore, \"if an employer is dissatisfied with the outcome of a\r\nrepresentation proceeding, the option of choice is to refuse to\r\nbargain and to raise any infirmity in the certification decision as\r\na defense to the unfair labor practice charge that almost\r\ninevitably will ensue.\"  Telemundo de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. NLRB,\r\n113 F.3d 270, 272 (1st Cir. 1997).  The Center refused to bargain\r\nwith the Union because of its objection to the certification of the\r\nbargaining unit.  In response, the Union filed an unfair labor\r\npractice charge.  The Board's Acting General Counsel issued an\r\nunfair labor practice complaint alleging that the Center had\r\nviolated section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act (29 U.S.C.\r\n158(a)(1)&amp;(5)) by refusing to recognize and bargain with the\r\nUnion.  The Center responded to the complaint by admitting that it\r\nrefused to bargain and defending that refusal by challenging the\r\nvalidity of the certification on the basis of the Board's\r\nbargaining unit determination in the representation proceeding. \r\nSpecifically, it claimed that the Head Teachers and the Coordinator\r\nof Billing and Operations were supervisors under the Act.\r\nThe Acting General Counsel filed a motion for summary\r\njudgment, contending that the Center was merely attempting to\r\nrelitigate matters which previously had been considered and upheld\r\nby the Board in the representation proceeding.  On September 14,\r\n1998, the Board issued a notice to Show Cause why the summary\r\njudgment motion should not be granted.  In response, the Center\r\nreiterated its position that the earlier representation decision\r\nwas erroneous because of the alleged supervisory status of the Head\r\nTeachers and the Coordinator of Billing and Operations.  The Center\r\nalso asked the Board to consider the affidavit of the Center's\r\nCoordinator for Social Services/Training, who had allegedly been\r\nunavailable to testify at the representation hearing.\r\nOn September 30, 1998, the Board granted the Acting\r\nGeneral Counsel's motion for summary judgment, ruling that all\r\nissues raised by the Center \"were or could have been litigated in\r\nthe prior representation proceeding,\" that the Center did not\r\nadequately explain why its so-called \"new evidence\" was not adduced\r\nat the representation hearing, and that it did not allege any\r\nspecial circumstances that would require the Board to reexamine the\r\ndecision made in the representation proceeding.  The Board\r\nconcluded that the Center had engaged in an unfair labor practice,\r\nand ordered the Center to recognize and bargain with the Union. \r\nThis appeal ensued.\r\nII. Challenges to the Decision-Making Process\r\nWe begin our legal analysis by considering two challenges\r\nto the way in which the Regional Director and the Board disposed of\r\nthis case.  First, the Center complains that the Regional Director,\r\nin making her supervisory status determinations, abdicated her\r\nresponsibility to make credibility determinations.  The Center\r\nnotes in particular this statement in the Regional Director's\r\ndecision:\r\n  Whenever the evidence is in conflict or\r\notherwise inconclusive on particular indicia\r\nof supervisory authority, the Board will find\r\nthat supervisory status has not been\r\nestablished . . . . In regard to the [H]ead\r\n[T]eachers, much of the evidence is in dispute\r\nand is, therefore, unreliable for establishing\r\nsupervisory authority. . . .\r\n\n  Contrary to the parties' urgings, I do not\r\nmake credibility determinations regarding such\r\ncontradictions in the evidence and, instead,\r\nlook to examples of supervisory authority\r\nbeing exercised.\r\n\nThe Center argues that this approach means that \"an employer could\r\nnever demonstrate supervisory status if the Union introduced\r\ncontradictory evidence regardless of the quality or credibility of\r\nthat evidence.\"  \r\nThe Center raises a potentially important issue which was\r\nnever presented to the Board during the unfair labor practice\r\nproceedings.  This omission is fatal to the consideration of this\r\nissue here.  See 29 U.S.C.  160(e) (\"No objection that has not\r\nbeen urged before the Board . . . shall be considered by the court,\r\nunless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be\r\nexcused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"); Woelke &amp; Romero\r\nFraming, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 665 (1982) (holding that \"the\r\nCourt of Appeals was without jurisdiction to consider th[e]\r\nquestion\" because \"[t]he issue was not raised during the\r\nproceedings before the Board, either by the General Counsel or by\r\n[the employer]\"); accord Pegasus Broad.of San Juan v. NLRB, 82 F.3d\r\n511, 514 (1st Cir. 1996); Local Union No. 25 v. NLRB, 831 F.2d\r\n1149, 1155 (1st Cir. 1987).  The Board noted in its decision\r\ngranting the Acting General Counsel's motion for summary judgment\r\nthat the Center did not allege any special circumstances that would\r\nrequire the Board to reexamine the decisions made by the Regional\r\nDirector in the representation proceeding.  That was a missed\r\nopportunity that we cannot remedy here.\r\nThe Center also assigns error to the Board's decision not\r\nto consider the affidavit of the Center's Coordinator of Social\r\nServices/Training which was proffered to the Board for the first\r\ntime in response to the unfair labor practice charge.  The Board\r\nrefused to consider the affidavit, citing to its regulation\r\nprohibiting the relitigation of issues which could have been\r\ncontested in the original representation proceeding absent\r\nexceptional circumstances.  See 29 C.F.R.  102.65(e)(1); see also\r\nPittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 146, 162 (1941).  The\r\nCenter offers nothing exceptional to explain why this affidavit\r\nshould be considered new evidence, merely stating that the\r\nCoordinator for Social Services/Training \"was out of state and not\r\navailable for the initial hearing.\"  We have previously stated that\r\nthis exception for new (or newly available) evidence \"should be\r\ninvoked sparingly, and a court should hesitate to second-guess the\r\nBoard's assessment that particular circumstances do not qualify for\r\nit.\"  Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276-77.  We have no occasion to\r\nsecond-guess the Board's determination in this instance; the Center\r\ndid not establish the type of exceptional circumstance which\r\nrequires a remand to re-open the record.\r\nIII. The Supervisory Status Determinations\r\nA. The Legal Framework\r\nThe Center challenges the Board's determinations that\r\nparticular employees are not \"supervisors\" within the definition of\r\nthe Act.  Because supervisors \"must represent the interests of\r\ntheir employer rather than the interests of their coworkers,\"\r\nTelemundo, 113 F.3d at 273, supervisors \"may not be included in a\r\nbargaining unit designated by the Board.\"  Northeast Util. Serv.\r\nCorp. v. NLRB, 35 F.3d 621, 624 (1st Cir. 1994).  The Act defines\r\na \"supervisor\" as \"any individual having authority, in the interest\r\nof the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall,\r\npromote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees,\r\nor responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or\r\neffectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the\r\nforegoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine\r\nor clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\" \r\n29 U.S.C.  152(11).  \"Because the [Act] is to be read in the\r\ndisjunctive, any one of the enumerated powers may signify\r\nsupervisory status.\"  Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 273.  Nevertheless,\r\nbecause \"Congress intended to exclude 'straw bosses,' 'lead men,'\r\nand other low-level employees having modest supervisory authority\r\nfrom supervisor status. . . . even an enumerated power must involve\r\nthe exercise of independent judgment in order to brand the holder\r\nof the power as a supervisor.\"  Id. at 273-74 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).  Moreover, \"[b]ecause of the serious consequences\r\nof an erroneous determination of supervisory status, particular\r\ncaution is warranted before concluding that a worker is a\r\nsupervisor despite the fact that the purported supervisory\r\nauthority has not been exercised.\"  Beverly Enterprises    Mass.,\r\nInc. v. NLRB, 165 F.3d 960, 963 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also NLRB v.\r\nBell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 280-81 (1974) (noting Congress'\r\nintent to exclude only those supervisors who possess \"genuine\r\nmanagement prerogatives\").\r\nThe determination of supervisory status vel non, tinged\r\nas it is with policy implications, is within the particular\r\nexpertise of the Board.  See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340\r\nU.S. 474, 488 (1951) (characterizing the Board as \"one of those\r\nagencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with\r\na specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field\r\ncarry the authority of expertness which courts do not possess and\r\ntherefore must respect\").  \"Given the myriad iterations of\r\nauthority that are possible and the subtle distinctions that easily\r\ncan be drawn, courts must afford great deference to the Board's\r\nexpert determination of which workers fall into which\r\nclassification.\"  Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274.  We may not disturb\r\nthe Board's findings as to which employees are supervisors and\r\nwhich are not \"unless those findings fail to derive support from\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record as a whole.\"  Id.  (citing\r\nUniversal Camera, 340 U.S. at 488); see also Northeast Util., 35\r\nF.3d at 625 (recognizing that the Board is entitled \"to wide\r\nlatitude in determining which employees fall within the definition\r\nof 'supervisor'\").  \"Under Board precedent, the burden of proving\r\nsupervisor status falls on the party making the assertion of\r\nsupervisor status.\"  NLRB v. Hilliard Dev. Corp.,    F.3d   , 1999\r\nWL 508814, at *7 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Beverly Enterprises   \r\nMass., Inc., 165 F.3d at 962; St. Alphonsus Hosp., 261 N.L.R.B.\r\n620, 624 (1982), enforced, 703 F.2d 577 (9th Cir. 1983).\r\nWith these legal principles framing the analysis, we\r\nexamine the evidence underlying the Board's supervisory status\r\ndeterminations, drawing all \"supportable inferences in a manner\r\nconsistent with the Board's findings.\"  Hilliard Dev. Corp., 1999\r\nWL 508814, at *2.  Of necessity, this examination requires an\r\nextensive marshaling of the facts. \"[T]he details of the [putative\r\nsupervisor's] functions are critical in ascertaining whether he is\r\na supervisor as that term is defined\" in the Act. See Maine Yankee\r\nAtomic Power Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347, 359 (1st Cir. 1980).\r\nB. The Record\r\n  1. Overview\r\nThe Center is run by its Executive Director, Doryl\r\nRourke, who reports to the Center's Board of Directors, which sets\r\njob descriptions and personnel policies.  Any new policies or\r\nchanges in policy are communicated by the Board to Rourke, who is\r\nresponsible for disseminating the information to her staff.  An\r\norganizational chart introduced into the record by the Center shows\r\nthe Coordinator of Billing and Operations, the Coordinator of\r\nSocial Services/Training, and the Bookkeeper reporting directly to\r\nthe Executive Director.  The maintenance workers and the cooking\r\nstaff report to the Executive Director through the Coordinator of\r\nBilling and Operations.  According to the chart, the Head Teachers\r\nreport to the Executive Director through the Coordinator of Social\r\nServices/Training.  The rest of the teaching staff reports through\r\nthe Head Teachers.\r\n  2. The Coordinator of Billing and Operations\r\nThe Board found that the \"evidence is scant regarding any\r\nindicia of supervisory authority\" for the Coordinator of Billing\r\nand Operations (the Coordinator) (emphasis in original).  The\r\nCenter contends that the Coordinator is a supervisor because she\r\nhas the authority (1) to adjust grievances and to discipline other\r\nemployees and (2) to assign work and to responsibly direct other\r\nemployees. We examine those claims in turn. \r\n       a. Adjustment of Grievances and Discipline\r\nThe Center points to its Employee Handbook as evidence\r\nthat the coordinator has the authority to adjust grievances.  The\r\nHandbook does state that an employee's \"supervisor\" is the first\r\nstep in the grievance process, but there is no indication that the\r\nCoordinator is a \"supervisor\" under the terms of the Handbook. \r\nMoreover, Rourke admitted that the Coordinator has never adjusted\r\na grievance.  See Beverly Enterprises   Mass., Inc. v. NLRB, 165\r\nF.3d 960, 963 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (\"[A]bsent exercise, there must be\r\nother affirmative indications of authority.\"); see also Chevron,\r\nU.S.A., Inc., 309 N.L.R.B. 59, 69 (1992) (stating that no weight is\r\ngiven to \"job descriptions that attribute supervisory authority\r\nwhere there is no independent evidence of its possession or\r\nexercise.\").  The evidence with respect to discipline is equally\r\nequivocal; while Rourke testified that the Coordinator has the\r\nauthority to discipline the maintenance employees and the cook, she\r\nadmitted that the Coordinator has never exercised this authority in\r\nthe six years the position has been in existence, and there are no\r\nother affirmative indications of the Coordinator's actual authority\r\nto discipline.  \r\n              b. Assignment and Direction\r\nRourke testified that the cook works \"fairly\r\nindependently.\"  The only indicia of the Coordinator's supervision\r\nof the cook is her responsibility, \"[i]n conjunction with the\r\nExecutive Director,\" to \"monitor [the] menus in accordance with\r\nU.S.D.A. standards.\"  Although Rourke testified that the\r\ncoordinator reviews the menus and \"discuss[es]\" them with the cook, \r\nshe went on to testify that \"[i]f there's any question, they would\r\ncome to [the Executive Director.]\"\r\nWith respect to the maintenance staff of two, the\r\nCoordinator does nominally \"assign\" work to them.  Although the\r\nCoordinator has some role in prioritizing the requests for\r\nmaintenance, Rourke testified that the prioritizing is a\r\ncooperative process due to the experience of the regular\r\nmaintenance worker, prompting the Board to conclude that the\r\nmaintenance worker \"often participates in the discussion of how to\r\nprioritize work, what to order to do the job, and how to do the\r\nwork.\"  The other maintenance employee, who is primarily\r\nresponsible for housekeeping, works \"off hours\" and on weekends. \r\nThe Coordinator rarely sees him; their contact is mainly over the\r\ntelephone.  See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274 (rejecting inference of\r\nsupervisory authority where the subordinates \"require[d] minimal\r\nsupervision\").  If the Coordinator receives a complaint that\r\nrequested work has not been completed, the Coordinator calls the\r\nemployee to inquire into the reason(s) why.  However, Rourke\r\ntestified that the Coordinator does not write up the omissions as\r\ninfractions and generally does not assign unfinished work to the\r\nother maintenance worker, though if she did, \"she would tell me\r\n[the Executive Director] that she did that, but she has the\r\nauthority to do it.\"\r\nTo be considered indicative of supervisory status, the\r\nauthority to assign and direct has been held necessarily to include\r\nthe responsibility \"to be answerable for the discharge of a duty or\r\nobligation.\"  Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347,\r\n361 (1st Cir. 1980) (quoting Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, 176 F.2d 385,\r\n387 (6th Cir. 1949)).  The evidence presented to the Board fails to\r\ndemonstrate that the Coordinator is held accountable for the\r\nperformance of the maintenance workers or the cook, or for their\r\nfailure to perform.  Therefore, the Center's evidence falls short\r\nof establishing the Coordinator's supervisory responsibility in\r\nthis regard.  See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 275 (\"[T]he record\r\ncontains no compelling evidence that [the purported supervisor] is\r\nheld accountable for the adequate performance of [the putative\r\nsubordinates'] work.  This distinction makes a world of\r\ndifference.\"). \r\nFinally, Rourke testified that the Coordinator had the\r\nauthority to grant maintenance employees time off.  No examples\r\nwere provided, however, and Rourke also testified that \"[t]ime off\r\nis dictated by a policy within the whole agency\" and that the\r\nCoordinator of Social Services/Training \"does the scheduling for\r\nthe staff.\"  Moreover, the Board found that the Executive\r\nDirector's testimony was directly contradicted by the Employee\r\nHandbook, which states that vacations may be taken \"as arranged by\r\nthe Director.\"\r\nAs we stated in Telemundo, \"the mere fact that an\r\nemployee gives other employees instructions from time to time does\r\nnot in and of itself render him [or her] a supervisor under the\r\nAct.\"  Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274.  The evidence must show that\r\nsuch employees \"possess authority to exercise independent judgment\r\nin overseeing other employees.\"  Id.  A review of the entire record\r\nreveals substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that\r\nthe Coordinator does not exercise independent judgment as a\r\nsupervisor, as required by the Act.\r\n  3. The Head Teachers\r\nThe members of the Center's staff that are assigned to\r\nthe six classrooms are divided into three \"teams.\"  Each Head\r\nTeacher leads one team, consisting of her or his classroom's staff\r\nplus one other classroom.  An Assistant Head Teacher (or an\r\nAssistant Head Teacher in Training) runs the other classroom.  In\r\naddition, the teaching complement in each classroom also includes\r\none and sometimes two other teachers.  These secondary teachers are\r\neither Assistant Head Teachers in Training, Assistant Teachers, or\r\nAssistant Teachers in Training.  The Center contends that the Head\r\nTeachers satisfy the Act's \"supervisor\" definition by (1) assigning\r\nwork and directing subordinates; (2) having authority to adjust\r\ngrievances and discipline other employees; and (3) providing\r\nwritten evaluations of other teachers.  We take each claim in\r\nturn.\r\n                a. Assignment and Direction\r\n              i. In the Classroom\r\nThe Head Teachers obviously exercise some supervisory\r\ncontrol over their classrooms.  However, the Board \"has generally\r\nand correctly said that employees who routinely direct other\r\nemployees based solely on a higher skill level are not\r\nsupervisors.\"  Hilliard, 1999 WL 508814, at *13.  The issue is\r\nwhether they exercise \"independent judgment\" on behalf of the\r\nemployer in the discharge of these responsibilities.  29 U.S.C.\r\n152(11).\r\nRourke asserted that relatively little direction is\r\nordered by central administration (i.e., the Executive Director and\r\nthe Coordinator of Social Services/Training) and that \"generally,\r\nthe buck stops with the [H]ead [T]eacher\" on matters of classroom\r\nadministration.  Rourke also testified that Head Teachers are\r\nresponsible for implementing the policies which are announced at\r\nthe planning meetings (attended by the Executive Director, the\r\nCoordinator of Social Services/Training, and the Head Teachers). \r\nThis implementation, she asserts, requires the Head Teachers to\r\nassign tasks to their subordinates and to direct them on execution\r\nof these tasks.  Johnson, the Head Teacher, and Nordstrom, the\r\nAssistant Head Teacher in Training, described a more collaborative\r\napproach.  The Board characterized Johnson's and Nordstrom's\r\ntestimony as establishing \"that the Head Teachers do not order or\r\ndirect anyone to perform certain tasks, they solicit ideas on how\r\nto implement the curriculum directives in their classrooms.\"  This\r\nfinding is amply supported in the record.\r\nAlso, the Board found that the Coordinator of Social\r\nServices/Training \"observes the classrooms and instructs the\r\nteachers, including the [H]ead [T]eachers, regarding changes she\r\nwants made. [The Coordinator of Social Services/Training] has the\r\nauthority to call teachers into her office and tell them to make\r\nchanges, and she has done this with all levels of teachers,\r\nincluding those below the level of [H]ead [T]eacher, and without\r\nthe [H]ead [T]eachers' involvement.\"  The Executive Director\r\nadmitted that she, too, has exercised her authority to disregard\r\nthe Head Teachers and to instruct subordinate teachers directly. \r\nSuch direct oversight by management without the participation or\r\nknowledge of the employee's \"supervisory\" Head Teacher is\r\ninconsistent with the Head Teachers' purported authority to\r\n\"responsibly direct subordinate teachers.\"  See Maine Yankee Atomic\r\nPower Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347, 361 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"To be\r\nresponsible is to be answerable for the discharge of a duty or\r\nobligation.\" (quoting Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, 176 F.2d 385, 387\r\n(6th Cir. 1949))).\r\nBoth sides point to a letter from the Coordinator of\r\nSocial Services/Training to Head Teacher Johnson dated March 3,\r\n1998.  The letter instructed Johnson that she must \"keep [her]\r\nporch closed during the morning but [that she] may choose to open\r\nit in the afternoons;\" asked her to \"please remember good\r\ndevelopmental practice suggests you keep yourself at children's\r\nlevel;\" and directed her to \"[c]ontinue to have one group eat in\r\nthe room whenever possible.  If you find you need your lunch time\r\nchanged, please let me know and we will make some accommodations. \r\nYou may also want to think about a better time for other team\r\nmembers to take morning break if coverage is an issue.\"  While the\r\nletter could be construed to support some supervisory\r\nresponsibility for the Head Teachers, the oversight and direction\r\nof such minutiae by the Coordinator of Social Services/Training\r\nsupports the Board's finding that Head Teachers are not authorized\r\nto exercise independent judgment in carrying out their supervision.\r\n              ii. Authority to Set Schedules\r\nWhile the Head Teacher job description and some of\r\nRourke's testimony support the position that the Head Teachers\r\nexercise supervisory authority over the schedules of their\r\nsubordinates, other evidence supports the Board's contrary\r\nconclusion.  Johnson and Nordstrom testified that the team sets the\r\nschedule cooperatively and that any modifications are made\r\nexclusively on a voluntary basis.  Johnson testified that, to the\r\nextent a staff coverage issue had to be resolved through an\r\ninvoluntary assignment, she would have to consult Rourke for\r\ndirection.  See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276 (noting that \"the\r\nBoard's determination is wholly consistent with the [putative\r\nsupervisor's] stated self-perception that they are crew leaders, no\r\nmore\").  As for substitutes and arrangements for covering absent\r\nteachers, Johnson testified that she possessed no authority to\r\ncontact substitutes.  As evidence, she said that she had no\r\nknowledge of who was covering her classroom at the time that she\r\nwas testifying.  She had called and informed the Center that she\r\nwas taking the day off for personal reasons.  She had no further\r\nresponsibility or authority to address the situation.\r\n       iii. Authority to Grant Time Off\r\nAlthough Rourke testified that Head Teachers could (and\r\ndid) authorize subordinates to take time off, she also testified\r\nthat all requests for time off are handled by the Coordinator of\r\nSocial Services/Training.  Johnson testified that she had no\r\nauthority to authorize any time off.  At one point in the hearing\r\na distinction was drawn between regular time off and vacation time\r\n(apparently based on the duration of the requested leave time), but\r\nthere was no dispute that vacation was authorized through a bid\r\nprocess administered by the Coordinator of Social\r\nServices/Training; no one contends that Head Teachers exercise\r\nsupervisory authority over vacation time.  Finally, conflicting\r\nevidence was offered on the authority to grant compensatory time\r\nfor overtime.  The Employee Handbook states that \"[e]mployees\r\nworking beyond their regular hours . . . may adjust their hours on\r\nanother day with approval of their supervisor.\"  Again, the\r\nHandbook makes no attempt to define who is a \"supervisor.\"  Rourke\r\nasserted that Head Teachers in fact possessed this authority, but\r\nprovided no examples.  Johnson testified in direct contradiction,\r\nstating that Head Teachers \"can't make any decisions about\r\ncomp[ensatory] time.\"\r\n       iv. Authority to Operate the Center\r\nThe Center argues that Head Teachers must have authority\r\nto responsibly direct other employees because Head Teachers are\r\noccasionally left in charge of the Center.  Rourke and Johnson both\r\ntestified that in the absence of the Executive Director and the\r\nCoordinator of Social Services/Training, a Head Teacher is\r\nnominally left \"in charge\" of the Center.  According to Johnson,\r\nhowever, when a Head Teacher is left in charge he/she is \"not\r\nallowed to make any decisions.\"  Instead, Johnson testified that if\r\na problem arises while a Head Teacher is nominally \"in charge,\" the\r\nHead Teachers have been given specific instructions to contact the\r\nExecutive Director or the Coordinator for Social Services/Training,\r\n\"and if they're not available, then someone on the Board of\r\nDirectors is to be contacted.\"\r\nWe have previously held that the \"spasmodic and\r\ninfrequent assumption of a position of command and responsibility\r\ndoes not transform an otherwise rank and file worker into a\r\nsupervisor.\"  Fall River Sav. Bank v. NLRB, 649 F.2d 50, 54 (1st\r\nCir. 1981) (quoting NLRB v. Quincy Steel Casting, 200 F.2d 293, 296\r\n(1st Cir. 1952)); accord Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 275.  The Board was\r\njustified in refusing to find supervisory status on the basis of\r\nthis occasional, nominal authority.\r\n      b. Adjustment of Grievances and Discipline\r\nIt is unclear from the record whether Head Teachers have\r\nthe authority to redress grievances.  The Employee Handbook simply\r\nstates that an employee should initiate the grievance process by\r\nfirst \"(d)iscuss[ing] the matter with his/her immediate\r\nsupervisor.\"  The Employee Handbook, however, contains no material\r\ndefining \"immediate supervisor.\"  Indeed, Assistant Head teacher\r\nNordstrom testified that while she was on Johnson's \"team,\" Rourke\r\nwas her supervisor.  Given the testimony that the Coordinator of\r\nSocial Services/Training instructed subordinate teachers directly\r\nwithout the involvement of Head Teachers, she could reasonably be\r\nconsidered an \"immediate supervisor\" under the plan as well.\r\nWhile neither Rourke nor Johnson could recall any\r\nspecific grievances, they had conflicting views as to how\r\ngrievances were to be handled.  Rourke reiterated the Handbook's\r\npolicy that \"the first line\" in the Center's grievance procedure is\r\nfor an employee to address his/her grievance to the \"supervisor.\" \r\nAt another point, Rourke testified that employees should address\r\ntheir grievances \"to whomever, whether it be a teacher or whether,\r\nwith whom they have an issue . . . .\"  Johnson, like Rourke, could\r\nnot remember a particular grievance but stated that subordinate\r\nteachers' grievances go directly to Rourke.\r\nThe evidence on the issue of discipline follows a similar\r\nuncertain course.  Without setting up a detailed procedure, the\r\nEmployee Handbook offers the statement that \"Supervisors are the\r\nkey people in ensuring that [the Center's] standards and rules are\r\nobserved and are responsible for appropriate action for any\r\nviolation of the standards and rules as set forth by the [Center].\" \r\nAgain, the record is devoid of any instances where such authority\r\nhas actually been exercised by a Head Teacher. The Executive\r\nDirector did not speak to the Head Teachers' role in discipline per\r\nse, but did make references to the Head Teachers' responsibility\r\n\"to make sure that her subordinate is doing what is directed.\" \r\nLater, the Executive Director stated that the \"role [of the Head\r\nTeacher] is to make sure that the classroom runs smoothly, that the\r\npeople are reporting to work on time . . . that they're doing what\r\ntheir, what their assigned duties are, and that if they're not, it\r\nis also [the Head Teachers'] responsibility to make sure that in\r\nsome way this happens, either by reprimand, either by bringing it\r\nto my attention and dealing with it herself or sitting down with\r\nthe person.\"  At another point in her testimony, Rourke stated that\r\nin supervising subordinate teachers, Head Teachers have the ability\r\nto \"observe their teaching ability, to make suggestions and\r\ncomments,  . . . [and] to come to [the Executive Director] if they\r\nfeel there is a larger issue.\"  This evidence is equivocal on\r\nwhether Head Teachers have disciplinary authority.  Johnson,\r\nhowever, was unequivocal in her insistence that as a Head Teacher\r\nshe has no disciplinary authority.  Johnson insisted that Rourke\r\nadministered discipline at the Center.  Understandably, on this\r\nrecord, the Board was uncertain about the disciplinary role of the\r\nteachers.\r\n3. Evaluations\r\nIt is undisputed that Head Teachers prepare written\r\nevaluations of subordinate teachers on their \"teams.\"  However, the\r\nfrequency and the significance of these evaluations were disputed. \r\nWhile the Center's written policies called for annual evaluations,\r\nJohnson testified that she had not evaluated any of her subordinate\r\nteachers in the preceding two to three years.  Rourke confirmed\r\nthat \"it might go two or three years before [employees are]\r\nevaluated.\"  Rourke also testified that \"evaluations have nothing\r\nto do with whether somebody gets a raise or doesn't get a raise\"\r\nand that \"[a]cross-the-board raises are voted by the Board on an\r\nannual basis.\"  Nevertheless, the Center argues that evaluations\r\n\"are placed in the employee's personnel files,\" and that this fact\r\nalone \"demonstrates the importance of the evaluations and supports\r\nthe supervisory status since the evaluations are reasonably\r\ncalculated to affect the employee's status.\"  The Center relies on\r\nNLRB v. Beacon Light Christian Nursing Home, 825 F.2d 1076 (6th\r\nCir. 1987), to support this proposition.\r\nBeacon Light is unavailing.  There, the allegedly\r\nsupervisory nurses were \"expected and encouraged to [utilize\r\nevaluation and discipline forms] routinely,\" and \"[t]hree or four\r\nsuch citations could result in formal disciplinary action including\r\ndischarge, suspension or demotion.\"  Beacon Light, 825 F.2d at\r\n1079.  The authority of the disputed supervisors to \"effectively\r\nrecommend\" employment decisions based on their own independent\r\njudgment, a hallmark of supervision under 29 U.S.C.  152(11), was\r\nclear evidence of supervisory authority.  See id.  Here, the\r\nevidence allowed the Board reasonably to find that such evaluations\r\n\"have no impact on wages, promotions, or other terms and conditions\r\nof employment.\"  See Hilliard, 1999 WL 508814, at *9-10.\r\nIV. Conclusion\r\nWe are mindful of the difficult judgments these fact-\r\nintensive cases require.  The evidence supporting the Board's\r\ndecision is close, particularly on the status of the Head Teachers. \r\nThis closeness makes deference to the Board especially appropriate. \r\n\"It is particularly in the close cases that judges, who are\r\ngeneralists, should respect the specialized knowledge of the Board\r\nand accede to its factbound determinations as long as they are\r\nrooted in the record.\"  Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276.  In the final\r\nanalysis, the Board's determinations that the Coordinator of\r\nBilling and Operations and the Head Teachers are employees and not\r\nsupervisors are supported by substantial evidence on the record as\r\na whole.\r\nAccordingly, we deny the petition for review, grant the\r\ncross-petition, and enforce the Board's order.\n",

The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. After reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence. We therefore deny the Center's petition, grant the Board's cross-petition, and order enforcement of the Board's order pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act (the Act). We begin our explanation with the procedural background.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, the Union filed a petition with the Board seeking to be certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all non-supervisory employees of the Center, a day care center in Worcester, Massachusetts that serves approximately 93 children \"in developmentally appropriate settings so the families can work or receive training for employment opportunities.\" The Center is open five days a week, 52 weeks a year and employs approximately 23 people (both full and part time). The Center challenged the Union's petition, claiming that the Union's proposed bargaining unit was inappropriate because it included three Head Teachers and the Coordinator of Billing and Operations, all allegedly supervisors within the meaning of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 1998, a hearing officer employed by the Regional Director for the First Region of the Board held a hearing as the Board's designee. Following that hearing, the Regional Director issued a Decision and Direction of Election on April 15, 1998, concluding that the Center had not established that the Head Teachers or the Coordinator of Billing and Operations were supervisors under the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, the Regional Director certified an exclusive bargaining unit including \"[a]ll full time and regular part-time head teachers, assistant head teachers in training, teachers in training, the coordinator of billing and operations, the cook, the assistant cooks, maintenance and housekeeping employees, and the bookkeeper.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Center sought review of the Regional Director's decision before the Board but such review was denied on May 13, 1998, because the Board determined that the Center raised \"no substantial issues warranting review.\" An election was held on May 15, 1998, in which (1) the professional employees (the head teachers) voted to be included in a bargaining unit with the non-professional employees, and (2) the Center's employees voted for the Union by a margin of fifteen to two. On May 27, 1998, the Board certified the Union as the bargaining unit's exclusive representative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispute then took a familiar path. Employers cannot obtain direct judicial review of union certification decisions. Therefore, \"if an employer is dissatisfied with the outcome of a representation proceeding, the option of choice is to refuse to bargain and to raise any infirmity in the certification decision as a defense to the unfair labor practice charge that almost inevitably will ensue.\" Telemundo de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. NLRB, 113 F.3d 270, 272 (1st Cir. 1997). The Center refused to bargain with the Union because of its objection to the certification of the bargaining unit. In response, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge. The Board's Acting General Counsel issued an unfair labor practice complaint alleging that the Center had violated section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act (29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 158(a)(1)&amp;(5)) by refusing to recognize and bargain with the Union. The Center responded to the complaint by admitting that it refused to bargain and defending that refusal by challenging the validity of the certification on the basis of the Board's bargaining unit determination in the representation proceeding. Specifically, it claimed that the Head Teachers and the Coordinator of Billing and Operations were supervisors under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Acting General Counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the Center was merely attempting to relitigate matters which previously had been considered and upheld by the Board in the representation proceeding. On September 14, 1998, the Board issued a notice to Show Cause why the summary judgment motion should not be granted. In response, the Center reiterated its position that the earlier representation decision was erroneous because of the alleged supervisory status of the Head Teachers and the Coordinator of Billing and Operations. The Center also asked the Board to consider the affidavit of the Center's Coordinator for Social Services/Training, who had allegedly been unavailable to testify at the representation hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1998, the Board granted the Acting General Counsel's motion for summary judgment, ruling that all issues raised by the Center \"were or could have been litigated in the prior representation proceeding,\" that the Center did not adequately explain why its so-called \"new evidence\" was not adduced at the representation hearing, and that it did not allege any special circumstances that would require the Board to reexamine the decision made in the representation proceeding. The Board concluded that the Center had engaged in an unfair labor practice, and ordered the Center to recognize and bargain with the Union. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Challenges to the Decision-Making Process</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our legal analysis by considering two challenges to the way in which the Regional Director and the Board disposed of this case. First, the Center complains that the Regional Director, in making her supervisory status determinations, abdicated her responsibility to make credibility determinations. The Center notes in particular this statement in the Regional Director's decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever the evidence is in conflict or otherwise inconclusive on particular indicia of supervisory authority, the Board will find that supervisory status has not been established . . . . In regard to the [H]ead [T]eachers, much of the evidence is in dispute and is, therefore, unreliable for establishing supervisory authority. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the parties' urgings, I do not make credibility determinations regarding such contradictions in the evidence and, instead, look to examples of supervisory authority being exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center argues that this approach means that \"an employer could never demonstrate supervisory status if the Union introduced contradictory evidence regardless of the quality or credibility of that evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center raises a potentially important issue which was never presented to the Board during the unfair labor practice proceedings. This omission is fatal to the consideration of this issue here. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(e) (\"No objection that has not been urged before the Board . . . shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"); Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 665 (1982) (holding that \"the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to consider th[e] question\" because \"[t]he issue was not raised during the proceedings before the Board, either by the General Counsel or by [the employer]\"); accord Pegasus Broad.of San Juan v. NLRB, 82 F.3d 511, 514 (1st Cir. 1996); Local Union No. 25 v. NLRB, 831 F.2d 1149, 1155 (1st Cir. 1987). The Board noted in its decision granting the Acting General Counsel's motion for summary judgment that the Center did not allege any special circumstances that would require the Board to reexamine the decisions made by the Regional Director in the representation proceeding. That was a missed opportunity that we cannot remedy here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center also assigns error to the Board's decision not to consider the affidavit of the Center's Coordinator of Social Services/Training which was proffered to the Board for the first time in response to the unfair labor practice charge. The Board refused to consider the affidavit, citing to its regulation prohibiting the relitigation of issues which could have been contested in the original representation proceeding absent exceptional circumstances. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 102.65(e)(1); see also Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 146, 162 (1941). The Center offers nothing exceptional to explain why this affidavit should be considered new evidence, merely stating that the Coordinator for Social Services/Training \"was out of state and not available for the initial hearing.\" We have previously stated that this exception for new (or newly available) evidence \"should be invoked sparingly, and a court should hesitate to second-guess the Board's assessment that particular circumstances do not qualify for it.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276-77. We have no occasion to second-guess the Board's determination in this instance; the Center did not establish the type of exceptional circumstance which requires a remand to re-open the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. The Supervisory Status Determinations</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center challenges the Board's determinations that particular employees are not \"supervisors\" within the definition of the Act. Because supervisors \"must represent the interests of their employer rather than the interests of their coworkers,\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 273, supervisors \"may not be included in a bargaining unit designated by the Board.\" Northeast Util. Serv. Corp. v. NLRB, 35 F.3d 621, 624 (1st Cir. 1994). The Act defines a \"supervisor\" as \"any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11). \"Because the [Act] is to be read in the disjunctive, any one of the enumerated powers may signify supervisory status.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 273. Nevertheless, because \"Congress intended to exclude 'straw bosses,' 'lead men,' and other low-level employees having modest supervisory authority from supervisor status. . . . even an enumerated power must involve the exercise of independent judgment in order to brand the holder of the power as a supervisor.\" Id. at 273-74 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \"[b]ecause of the serious consequences of an erroneous determination of supervisory status, particular caution is warranted before concluding that a worker is a supervisor despite the fact that the purported supervisory authority has not been exercised.\" Beverly Enterprises -- Mass., Inc. v. NLRB, 165 F.3d 960, 963 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 280-81 (1974) (noting Congress' intent to exclude only those supervisors who possess \"genuine management prerogatives\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination of supervisory status vel non, tinged as it is with policy implications, is within the particular expertise of the Board. See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951) (characterizing the Board as \"one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority of expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect\"). \"Given the myriad iterations of authority that are possible and the subtle distinctions that easily can be drawn, courts must afford great deference to the Board's expert determination of which workers fall into which classification.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274. We may not disturb the Board's findings as to which employees are supervisors and which are not \"unless those findings fail to derive support from substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\" Id. (citing Universal Camera, 340 U.S. at 488); see also Northeast Util., 35 F.3d at 625 (recognizing that the Board is entitled \"to wide latitude in determining which employees fall within the definition of 'supervisor'\"). \"Under Board precedent, the burden of proving supervisor status falls on the party making the assertion of supervisor status.\" NLRB v. Hilliard Dev. Corp., 187 F.3d 133, 143 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Beverly Enterprises -- Mass., Inc., 165 F.3d at 962; St. Alphonsus Hosp., 261 N.L.R.B. 620, 624 (1982), enforced, 703 F.2d 577 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these legal principles framing the analysis, we examine the evidence underlying the Board's supervisory status determinations, drawing all \"supportable inferences in a manner consistent with the Board's findings.\" Hilliard Dev. Corp., 187 F.3d at 137.  Of necessity, this examination requires an extensive marshaling of the facts. \"[T]he details of the [putative supervisor's] functions are critical in ascertaining whether he is a supervisor as that term is defined\" in the Act. See Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347, 359 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Record</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Overview</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center is run by its Executive Director, Doryl Rourke, who reports to the Center's Board of Directors, which sets job descriptions and personnel policies. Any new policies or changes in policy are communicated by the Board to Rourke, who is responsible for disseminating the information to her staff. An organizational chart introduced into the record by the Center shows the Coordinator of Billing and Operations, the Coordinator of Social Services/Training, and the Bookkeeper reporting directly to the Executive Director. The maintenance workers and the cooking staff report to the Executive Director through the Coordinator of Billing and Operations. According to the chart, the Head Teachers report to the Executive Director through the Coordinator of Social Services/Training.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The rest of the teaching staff reports through the Head Teachers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Coordinator of Billing and Operations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that the \"evidence is scant regarding any indicia of supervisory authority\" for the Coordinator of Billing and Operations (the Coordinator) (emphasis in original). The Center contends that the Coordinator is a supervisor because she has the authority (1) to adjust grievances and to discipline other employees and (2) to assign work and to responsibly direct other employees. We examine those claims in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Adjustment of Grievances and Discipline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center points to its Employee Handbook as evidence that the coordinator has the authority to adjust grievances. The Handbook does state that an employee's \"supervisor\" is the first step in the grievance process, but there is no indication that the Coordinator is a \"supervisor\" under the terms of the Handbook. Moreover, Rourke admitted that the Coordinator has never adjusted a grievance. See Beverly Enterprises - Mass., Inc. v. NLRB, 165 F.3d 960, 963 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (\"[A]bsent exercise, there must be other affirmative indications of authority.\"); see also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., 309 N.L.R.B. 59, 69 (1992) (stating that no weight is given to \"job descriptions that attribute supervisory authority where there is no independent evidence of its possession or exercise.\"). The evidence with respect to discipline is equally equivocal; while Rourke testified that the Coordinator has the authority to discipline the maintenance employees and the cook, she admitted that the Coordinator has never exercised this authority in the six years the position has been in existence, and there are no other affirmative indications of the Coordinator's actual authority to discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Assignment and Direction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rourke testified that the cook works \"fairly independently.\" The only indicia of the Coordinator's supervision of the cook is her responsibility, \"[i]n conjunction with the Executive Director,\" to \"monitor [the] menus in accordance with U.S.D.A. standards.\" Although Rourke testified that the coordinator reviews the menus and \"discuss[es]\" them with the cook, she went on to testify that \"[i]f there's any question, they would come to [the Executive Director.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the maintenance staff of two, the Coordinator does nominally \"assign\" work to them. Although the Coordinator has some role in prioritizing the requests for maintenance, Rourke testified that the prioritizing is a cooperative process due to the experience of the regular maintenance worker, prompting the Board to conclude that the maintenance worker \"often participates in the discussion of how to prioritize work, what to order to do the job, and how to do the work.\" The other maintenance employee, who is primarily responsible for housekeeping, works \"off hours\" and on weekends. The Coordinator rarely sees him; their contact is mainly over the telephone. See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274 (rejecting inference of supervisory authority where the subordinates \"require[d] minimal supervision\"). If the Coordinator receives a complaint that requested work has not been completed, the Coordinator calls the employee to inquire into the reason(s) why. However, Rourke testified that the Coordinator does not write up the omissions as infractions and generally does not assign unfinished work to the other maintenance worker, though if she did, \"she would tell me [the Executive Director] that she did that, but she has the authority to do it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be considered indicative of supervisory status, the authority to assign and direct has been held necessarily to include the responsibility \"to be answerable for the discharge of a duty or obligation.\" Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347, 361 (1st Cir. 1980) (quoting Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, 176 F.2d 385, 387 (6th Cir. 1949)). The evidence presented to the Board fails to demonstrate that the Coordinator is held accountable for the performance of the maintenance workers or the cook, or for their failure to perform. Therefore, the Center's evidence falls short of establishing the Coordinator's supervisory responsibility in this regard. See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 275 (\"[T]he record contains no compelling evidence that [the purported supervisor] is held accountable for the adequate performance of [the putative subordinates'] work. This distinction makes a world of difference.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rourke testified that the Coordinator had the authority to grant maintenance employees time off. No examples were provided, however, and Rourke also testified that \"[t]ime off is dictated by a policy within the whole agency\" and that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training \"does the scheduling for the staff.\" Moreover, the Board found that the Executive Director's testimony was directly contradicted by the Employee Handbook, which states that vacations may be taken \"as arranged by the Director.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in Telemundo, \"the mere fact that an employee gives other employees instructions from time to time does not in and of itself render him [or her] a supervisor under the Act.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274. The evidence must show that such employees \"possess authority to exercise independent judgment in overseeing other employees.\"  Id. A review of the entire record reveals substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the Coordinator does not exercise independent judgment as a supervisor, as required by the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Head Teachers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The members of the Center's staff that are assigned to the six classrooms are divided into three \"teams.\" Each Head Teacher leads one team, consisting of her or his classroom's staff plus one other classroom. An Assistant Head Teacher (or an Assistant Head Teacher in Training) runs the other classroom. In addition, the teaching complement in each classroom also includes one and sometimes two other teachers. These secondary teachers are either Assistant Head Teachers in Training, Assistant Teachers, or Assistant Teachers in Training. The Center contends that the Head Teachers satisfy the Act's \"supervisor\" definition by (1) assigning work and directing subordinates; (2) having authority to adjust grievances and discipline other employees; and (3) providing written evaluations of other teachers. We take each claim in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Assignment and Direction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. In the Classroom</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Head Teachers obviously exercise some supervisory control over their classrooms. However, the Board \"has generally and correctly said that employees who routinely direct other employees based solely on a higher skill level are not supervisors.\" Hilliard, 187 F.3d at 147-48.  The issue is whether they exercise \"independent judgment\" on behalf of the employer in the discharge of these responsibilities. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rourke asserted that relatively little direction is ordered by central administration (i.e., the Executive Director and the Coordinator of Social Services/Training) and that \"generally, the buck stops with the [H]ead [T]eacher\" on matters of classroom administration. Rourke also testified that Head Teachers are responsible for implementing the policies which are announced at the planning meetings (attended by the Executive Director, the Coordinator of Social Services/Training, and the Head Teachers). This implementation, she asserts, requires the Head Teachers to assign tasks to their subordinates and to direct them on execution of these tasks. Johnson, the Head Teacher, and Nordstrom, the Assistant Head Teacher in Training, described a more collaborative approach. The Board characterized Johnson's and Nordstrom's testimony as establishing \"that the Head Teachers do not order or direct anyone to perform certain tasks, they solicit ideas on how to implement the curriculum directives in their classrooms.\" This finding is amply supported in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, the Board found that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training \"observes the classrooms and instructs the teachers, including the [H]ead [T]eachers, regarding changes she wants made. [The Coordinator of Social Services/Training] has the authority to call teachers into her office and tell them to make changes, and she has done this with all levels of teachers, including those below the level of [H]ead [T]eacher, and without the [H]ead [T]eachers' involvement.\" The Executive Director admitted that she, too, has exercised her authority to disregard the Head Teachers and to instruct subordinate teachers directly. Such direct oversight by management without the participation or knowledge of the employee's \"supervisory\" Head Teacher is inconsistent with the Head Teachers' purported authority to \"responsibly direct subordinate teachers.\" See Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347, 361 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"To be responsible is to be answerable for the discharge of a duty or obligation.\" (quoting Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, 176 F.2d 385, 387 (6th Cir. 1949))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides point to a letter from the Coordinator of Social Services/Training to Head Teacher Johnson dated March 3, 1998. The letter instructed Johnson that she must \"keep [her] porch closed during the morning but [that she] may choose to open it in the afternoons;\" asked her to \"please remember good developmental practice suggests you keep yourself at children's level;\" and directed her to \"[c]ontinue to have one group eat in the room whenever possible. If you find you need your lunch time changed, please let me know and we will make some accommodations. You may also want to think about a better time for other team members to take morning break if coverage is an issue.\" While the letter could be construed to support some supervisory responsibility for the Head Teachers, the oversight and direction of such minutiae by the Coordinator of Social Services/Training supports the Board's finding that Head Teachers are not authorized to exercise independent judgment in carrying out their supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Authority to Set Schedules</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Head Teacher job description and some of Rourke's testimony support the position that the Head Teachers exercise supervisory authority over the schedules of their subordinates, other evidence supports the Board's contrary conclusion. Johnson and Nordstrom testified that the team sets the schedule cooperatively and that any modifications are made exclusively on a voluntary basis. Johnson testified that, to the extent a staff coverage issue had to be resolved through an involuntary assignment, she would have to consult Rourke for direction. See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276 (noting that \"the Board's determination is wholly consistent with the [putative supervisor's] stated self-perception that they are crew leaders, no more\"). As for substitutes and arrangements for covering absent teachers, Johnson testified that she possessed no authority to contact substitutes. As evidence, she said that she had no knowledge of who was covering her classroom at the time that she was testifying. She had called and informed the Center that she was taking the day off for personal reasons. She had no further responsibility or authority to address the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Authority to Grant Time Off</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rourke testified that Head Teachers could (and did) authorize subordinates to take time off, she also testified that all requests for time off are handled by the Coordinator of Social Services/Training. Johnson testified that she had no authority to authorize any time off. At one point in the hearing a distinction was drawn between regular time off and vacation time (apparently based on the duration of the requested leave time), but there was no dispute that vacation was authorized through a bid process administered by the Coordinator of Social Services/Training; no one contends that Head Teachers exercise supervisory authority over vacation time. Finally, conflicting evidence was offered on the authority to grant compensatory time for overtime. The Employee Handbook states that \"[e]mployees working beyond their regular hours . . . may adjust their hours on another day with approval of their supervisor.\" Again, the Handbook makes no attempt to define who is a \"supervisor.\" Rourke asserted that Head Teachers in fact possessed this authority, but provided no examples. Johnson testified in direct contradiction, stating that Head Teachers \"can't make any decisions about comp[ensatory] time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iv. Authority to Operate the Center</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center argues that Head Teachers must have authority to responsibly direct other employees because Head Teachers are occasionally left in charge of the Center. Rourke and Johnson both testified that in the absence of the Executive Director and the Coordinator of Social Services/Training, a Head Teacher is nominally left \"in charge\" of the Center. According to Johnson, however, when a Head Teacher is left in charge he/she is \"not allowed to make any decisions.\" Instead, Johnson testified that if a problem arises while a Head Teacher is nominally \"in charge,\" the Head Teachers have been given specific instructions to contact the Executive Director or the Coordinator for Social Services/Training, \"and if they're not available, then someone on the Board of Directors is to be contacted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that the \"spasmodic and infrequent assumption of a position of command and responsibility does not transform an otherwise rank and file worker into a supervisor.\" Fall River Sav. Bank v. NLRB, 649 F.2d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 1981) (quoting NLRB v. Quincy Steel Casting, 200 F.2d 293, 296 (1st Cir. 1952)); accord Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 275. The Board was justified in refusing to find supervisory status on the basis of this occasional, nominal authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Adjustment of Grievances and Discipline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear from the record whether Head Teachers have the authority to redress grievances. The Employee Handbook simply states that an employee should initiate the grievance process by first \"(d)iscuss[ing] the matter with his/her immediate supervisor.\" The Employee Handbook, however, contains no material defining \"immediate supervisor.\" Indeed, Assistant Head teacher Nordstrom testified that while she was on Johnson's \"team,\" Rourke was her supervisor. Given the testimony that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training instructed subordinate teachers directly without the involvement of Head Teachers, she could reasonably be considered an \"immediate supervisor\" under the plan as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While neither Rourke nor Johnson could recall any specific grievances, they had conflicting views as to how grievances were to be handled. Rourke reiterated the Handbook's policy that \"the first line\" in the Center's grievance procedure is for an employee to address his/her grievance to the \"supervisor.\" At another point, Rourke testified that employees should address their grievances \"to whomever, whether it be a teacher or whether, with whom they have an issue . . . .\" Johnson, like Rourke, could not remember a particular grievance but stated that subordinate teachers' grievances go directly to Rourke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on the issue of discipline follows a similar uncertain course. Without setting up a detailed procedure, the Employee Handbook offers the statement that \"Supervisors are the key people in ensuring that [the Center's] standards and rules are observed and are responsible for appropriate action for any violation of the standards and rules as set forth by the [Center].\" Again, the record is devoid of any instances where such authority has actually been exercised by a Head Teacher. The Executive Director did not speak to the Head Teachers' role in discipline per se, but did make references to the Head Teachers' responsibility \"to make sure that her subordinate is doing what is directed.\" Later, the Executive Director stated that the \"role [of the Head Teacher] is to make sure that the classroom runs smoothly, that the people are reporting to work on time . . . that they're doing what their, what their assigned duties are, and that if they're not, it is also [the Head Teachers'] responsibility to make sure that in some way this happens, either by reprimand, either by bringing it to my attention and dealing with it herself or sitting down with the person.\" At another point in her testimony, Rourke stated that in supervising subordinate teachers, Head Teachers have the ability to \"observe their teaching ability, to make suggestions and comments,  . . . [and] to come to [the Executive Director] if they feel there is a larger issue.\" This evidence is equivocal on whether Head Teachers have disciplinary authority. Johnson, however, was unequivocal in her insistence that as a Head Teacher she has no disciplinary authority. Johnson insisted that Rourke administered discipline at the Center. Understandably, on this record, the Board was uncertain about the disciplinary role of the teachers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Evaluations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Head Teachers prepare written evaluations of subordinate teachers on their \"teams.\" However, the frequency and the significance of these evaluations were disputed. While the Center's written policies called for annual evaluations, Johnson testified that she had not evaluated any of her subordinate teachers in the preceding two to three years. Rourke confirmed that \"it might go two or three years before [employees are] evaluated.\" Rourke also testified that \"evaluations have nothing to do with whether somebody gets a raise or doesn't get a raise\" and that \"[a]cross-the-board raises are voted by the Board on an annual basis.\" Nevertheless, the Center argues that evaluations \"are placed in the employee's personnel files,\" and that this fact alone \"demonstrates the importance of the evaluations and supports the supervisory status since the evaluations are reasonably calculated to affect the employee's status.\" The Center relies on NLRB v. Beacon Light Christian Nursing Home, 825 F.2d 1076 (6th Cir. 1987), to support this proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Light is unavailing. There, the allegedly supervisory nurses were \"expected and encouraged to [utilize evaluation and discipline forms] routinely,\" and \"[t]hree or four such citations could result in formal disciplinary action including discharge, suspension or demotion.\" Beacon Light, 825 F.2d at 1079. The authority of the disputed supervisors to \"effectively recommend\" employment decisions based on their own independent judgment, a hallmark of supervision under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11), was clear evidence of supervisory authority. See id. Here, the evidence allowed the Board reasonably to find that such evaluations \"have no impact on wages, promotions, or other terms and conditions of employment.\" See Hilliard, 187 F.3d at 144-45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful of the difficult judgments these fact-intensive cases require. The evidence supporting the Board's decision is close, particularly on the status of the Head Teachers. This closeness makes deference to the Board especially appropriate. \"It is particularly in the close cases that judges, who are generalists, should respect the specialized knowledge of the Board and accede to its factbound determinations as long as they are rooted in the record.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276. In the final analysis, the Board's determinations that the Coordinator of Billing and Operations and the Head Teachers are employees and not supervisors are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review, grant the cross-petition, and enforce the Board's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Center originally claimed that Assistant Head Teachers were also supervisors and therefore were also inappropriate to include in a bargaining unit.

Because the professional employees voted to be included in the bargaining unit with the non-professional employees, the condition for their inclusion was met and this is the bargaining unit at issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In its brief to this court, the Board did not respond directly to the argument that its procedure was flawed because of the refusal of the Regional Director to make credibility determinations. At oral argument, the Board did note that this argument was not properly before the court because the Center had not presented it to the Board. However, even if the Board had neglected this argument altogether we would in all probability refuse to take cognizance of it because &#167; 160(e) \"speaks to courts, not parties, and its plain language evinces an intent that the [Board] shall pass on issues arising under the Act, thereby bringing its expertise to bear on the resolution of those issues.\" EEOC v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., 476 U.S. 19, 23 (1986) (construing \"virtually identical\" language in the Civil Service Reform Act and citing Woelke, 456 U.S. at 665-66).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> It is undisputed that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training is a supervisor.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Only Rourke testified about the Coordinator's responsibilities; the Coordinator was not called to testify by either party. Therefore, the record with regard to the Coordinator is limited to Rourke's testimony and the documentary evidence offered by the Center, which included a job description listing the Coordinator's duties as follows:</p>\n        <p>1. Maintains client data base in order to submit monthly billing for state/federal contracts in accordance with all promulgated policies and procedures.</p>\n        <p>2. Responsible for management of all aspects of employee benefits, including group health/dental, disability, and unemployment services.</p>\n        <p>3. Responsible for management of agency's insurance policies, including workers compensation, client, and staff accident policies.</p>\n        <p>4. Coordinates housekeeping and general maintenance and capital improvements to the facility; oversees agency, staff, and outside contractors.</p>\n        <p>5. In conjunction with the Executive Director, coordinates nutrition staff including monitoring of menus in accordance with U.S.D.A. standards.</p>\n        <p>6. Coordinates ordering of and inventories general consumable supplies for maintenance, nutrition, classroom and office use.</p>\n        <p>7.

Attends seminars, inservice training and staff meetings as required.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The evidence on the Head Teacher's supervisory status was hotly contested. Again, Rourke testified for the Center. The Union called two additional witnesses: Head Teacher Gloria Johnson and Assistant Head Teacher in Training Nancy Nordstrom. The Center also presented a job description for the Head Teachers, which lists the duties of a Head Teacher as follows:</p>\n        <p>1.      Coordinates work of teaching staff with agency personnel and consultants.</p>\n        <p>2.      Maintains documentation and record keeping required by Office for Children, other social services and funding sources.</p>\n        <p>3.

The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. After reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence.

We begin our explanation with the procedural background.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, the Union filed a petition with the Board seeking to be certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all non-supervisory employees of the Center, a day care center in Worcester, Massachusetts that serves approximately 93 children \"in developmentally appropriate settings so the families can work or receive training for employment opportunities.\" The Center is open five days a week, 52 weeks a year and employs approximately 23 people (both full and part time). The Center challenged the Union's petition, claiming that the Union's proposed bargaining unit was inappropriate because it included three Head Teachers and the Coordinator of Billing and Operations, all allegedly supervisors within the meaning of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 1998, a hearing officer employed by the Regional Director for the First Region of the Board held a hearing as the Board's designee. Following that hearing, the Regional Director issued a Decision and Direction of Election on April 15, 1998, concluding that the Center had not established that the Head Teachers or the Coordinator of Billing and Operations were supervisors under the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, the Regional Director certified an exclusive bargaining unit including \"[a]ll full time and regular part-time head teachers, assistant head teachers in training, teachers in training, the coordinator of billing and operations, the cook, the assistant cooks, maintenance and housekeeping employees, and the bookkeeper.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Center sought review of the Regional Director's decision before the Board but such review was denied on May 13, 1998, because the Board determined that the Center raised \"no substantial issues warranting review.\" An election was held on May 15, 1998, in which (1) the professional employees (the head teachers) voted to be included in a bargaining unit with the non-professional employees, and (2) the Center's employees voted for the Union by a margin of fifteen to two. On May 27, 1998, the Board certified the Union as the bargaining unit's exclusive representative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispute then took a familiar path. Employers cannot obtain direct judicial review of union certification decisions. Therefore, \"if an employer is dissatisfied with the outcome of a representation proceeding, the option of choice is to refuse to bargain and to raise any infirmity in the certification decision as a defense to the unfair labor practice charge that almost inevitably will ensue.\" Telemundo de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740474\"><a href=\"/opinion/740474/telemundo-de-puerto-rico-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 272 (1st Cir. 1997). The Center refused to bargain with the Union because of its objection to the certification of the bargaining unit. In response, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge. The Board's Acting General Counsel issued an unfair labor practice complaint alleging that the Center had violated section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act (29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 158(a)(1)&amp;(5)) by refusing to recognize and bargain with the Union. The Center responded to the complaint by admitting that it refused to bargain and defending that refusal by challenging the validity of the certification on the basis of the Board's bargaining unit determination in the representation proceeding. Specifically, it claimed that the Head Teachers and the Coordinator of Billing and Operations were supervisors under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Acting General Counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the Center was merely attempting to relitigate matters which previously had been considered and upheld by the Board in the representation proceeding. On September 14, 1998, the Board issued a notice to Show Cause why the summary judgment motion should not be granted. In response, the Center reiterated its position that the earlier representation decision was erroneous because of the alleged supervisory status of the Head Teachers and the Coordinator of Billing and Operations. The Center also asked the Board to consider the affidavit of the Center's Coordinator for Social Services/Training, who had allegedly been unavailable to testify at the representation hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1998, the Board granted the Acting General Counsel's motion for summary judgment, ruling that all issues raised by the Center \"were or could have been litigated in the prior representation proceeding,\" that the Center did not adequately explain why its so-called \"new evidence\" was not adduced at the representation hearing, and that it did not allege any special circumstances that would require the Board to reexamine the decision made in the representation proceeding. The Board concluded that the Center had engaged in an unfair labor practice, and ordered the Center to recognize and bargain with the Union. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Challenges to the Decision-Making Process</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our legal analysis by considering two challenges to the way in which the Regional Director and the Board disposed of this case. First, the Center complains that the Regional Director, in making her supervisory status determinations, abdicated her responsibility to make credibility determinations. The Center notes in particular this statement in the Regional Director's decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever the evidence is in conflict or otherwise inconclusive on particular indicia of supervisory authority, the Board will find that supervisory status has not been established . . . . In regard to the [H]ead [T]eachers, much of the evidence is in dispute and is, therefore, unreliable for establishing supervisory authority. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the parties' urgings, I do not make credibility determinations regarding such contradictions in the evidence and, instead, look to examples of supervisory authority being exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center argues that this approach means that \"an employer could never demonstrate supervisory status if the Union introduced contradictory evidence regardless of the quality or credibility of that evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center raises a potentially important issue which was never presented to the Board during the unfair labor practice proceedings. This omission is fatal to the consideration of this issue here. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(e) (\"No objection that has not been urged before the Board . . . shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"); Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110713\"><a href=\"/opinion/110713/woelke-romero-framing-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 665 (1982) (holding that \"the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to consider th[e] question\" because \"[t]he issue was not raised during the proceedings before the Board, either by the General Counsel or by [the employer]\"); accord Pegasus Broad.of San Juan v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717467\"><a href=\"/opinion/717467/pegasus-broadcasting-of-san-juan-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 514 (1st Cir. 1996); Local Union No. 25 v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496585\"><a href=\"/opinion/496585/local-union-no-25-aw-international-brotherhood-of-teamsters-chauffeurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span>, 1155 (1st Cir. 1987). The Board noted in its decision granting the Acting General Counsel's motion for summary judgment that the Center did not allege any special circumstances that would require the Board to reexamine the decisions made by the Regional Director in the representation proceeding. That was a missed opportunity that we cannot remedy here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center also assigns error to the Board's decision not to consider the affidavit of the Center's Coordinator of Social Services/Training which was proffered to the Board for the first time in response to the unfair labor practice charge. The Board refused to consider the affidavit, citing to its regulation prohibiting the relitigation of issues which could have been contested in the original representation proceeding absent exceptional circumstances. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 102.65(e)(1); see also Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103517\"><a href=\"/opinion/103517/pittsburgh-glass-co-v-labor-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 162 (1941). The Center offers nothing exceptional to explain why this affidavit should be considered new evidence, merely stating that the Coordinator for Social Services/Training \"was out of state and not available for the initial hearing.\" We have previously stated that this exception for new (or newly available) evidence \"should be invoked sparingly, and a court should hesitate to second-guess the Board's assessment that particular circumstances do not qualify for it.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276-77. We have no occasion to second-guess the Board's determination in this instance; the Center did not establish the type of exceptional circumstance which requires a remand to re-open the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. The Supervisory Status Determinations</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center challenges the Board's determinations that particular employees are not \"supervisors\" within the definition of the Act. Because supervisors \"must represent the interests of their employer rather than the interests of their coworkers,\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 273, supervisors \"may not be included in a bargaining unit designated by the Board.\" Northeast Util. Serv. Corp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678493\"><a href=\"/opinion/678493/northeast-utilities-service-corporation-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 624 (1st Cir. 1994). The Act defines a \"supervisor\" as \"any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11). \"Because the [Act] is to be read in the disjunctive, any one of the enumerated powers may signify supervisory status.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 273. Nevertheless, because \"Congress intended to exclude 'straw bosses,' 'lead men,' and other low-level employees having modest supervisory authority from supervisor status. . . . even an enumerated power must involve the exercise of independent judgment in order to brand the holder of the power as a supervisor.\" Id. at 273-74 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \"[b]ecause of the serious consequences of an erroneous determination of supervisory status, particular caution is warranted before concluding that a worker is a supervisor despite the fact that the purported supervisory authority has not been exercised.\" Beverly Enterprises -- Mass., Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760881\"><a href=\"/opinion/760881/beverly-enterprises-massachusetts-inc-dba-east-village-nursing/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>, 963 (D.C.

See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 488 (1951) (characterizing the Board as \"one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority of expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect\"). \"Given the myriad iterations of authority that are possible and the subtle distinctions that easily can be drawn, courts must afford great deference to the Board's expert determination of which workers fall into which classification.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274. We may not disturb the Board's findings as to which employees are supervisors and which are not \"unless those findings fail to derive support from substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\" Id. (citing Universal Camera, 340 U.S. at 488); see also Northeast Util., 35 F.3d at 625 (recognizing that the Board is entitled \"to wide latitude in determining which employees fall within the definition of 'supervisor'\"). \"Under Board precedent, the burden of proving supervisor status falls on the party making the assertion of supervisor status.\" NLRB v.

Of necessity, this examination requires an extensive marshaling of the facts. \"[T]he details of the [putative supervisor's] functions are critical in ascertaining whether he is a supervisor as that term is defined\" in the Act.

The Record</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Overview</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center is run by its Executive Director, Doryl Rourke, who reports to the Center's Board of Directors, which sets job descriptions and personnel policies. Any new policies or changes in policy are communicated by the Board to Rourke, who is responsible for disseminating the information to her staff. An organizational chart introduced into the record by the Center shows the Coordinator of Billing and Operations, the Coordinator of Social Services/Training, and the Bookkeeper reporting directly to the Executive Director. The maintenance workers and the cooking staff report to the Executive Director through the Coordinator of Billing and Operations. According to the chart, the Head Teachers report to the Executive Director through the Coordinator of Social Services/Training.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The rest of the teaching staff reports through the Head Teachers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Coordinator of Billing and Operations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that the \"evidence is scant regarding any indicia of supervisory authority\" for the Coordinator of Billing and Operations (the Coordinator) (emphasis in original). The Center contends that the Coordinator is a supervisor because she has the authority (1) to adjust grievances and to discipline other employees and (2) to assign work and to responsibly direct other employees. We examine those claims in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Adjustment of Grievances and Discipline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center points to its Employee Handbook as evidence that the coordinator has the authority to adjust grievances. The Handbook does state that an employee's \"supervisor\" is the first step in the grievance process, but there is no indication that the Coordinator is a \"supervisor\" under the terms of the Handbook. Moreover, Rourke admitted that the Coordinator has never adjusted a grievance. See Beverly Enterprises - Mass., Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760881\"><a href=\"/opinion/760881/beverly-enterprises-massachusetts-inc-dba-east-village-nursing/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>, 963 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (\"[A]bsent exercise, there must be other affirmative indications of authority.\"); see also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 69 (1992) (stating that no weight is given to \"job descriptions that attribute supervisory authority where there is no independent evidence of its possession or exercise.\"). The evidence with respect to discipline is equally equivocal; while Rourke testified that the Coordinator has the authority to discipline the maintenance employees and the cook, she admitted that the Coordinator has never exercised this authority in the six years the position has been in existence, and there are no other affirmative indications of the Coordinator's actual authority to discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Assignment and Direction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rourke testified that the cook works \"fairly independently.\" The only indicia of the Coordinator's supervision of the cook is her responsibility, \"[i]n conjunction with the Executive Director,\" to \"monitor [the] menus in accordance with U.S.D.A. standards.\" Although Rourke testified that the coordinator reviews the menus and \"discuss[es]\" them with the cook, she went on to testify that \"[i]f there's any question, they would come to [the Executive Director.]\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the maintenance staff of two, the Coordinator does nominally \"assign\" work to them. Although the Coordinator has some role in prioritizing the requests for maintenance, Rourke testified that the prioritizing is a cooperative process due to the experience of the regular maintenance worker, prompting the Board to conclude that the maintenance worker \"often participates in the discussion of how to prioritize work, what to order to do the job, and how to do the work.\" The other maintenance employee, who is primarily responsible for housekeeping, works \"off hours\" and on weekends. The Coordinator rarely sees him; their contact is mainly over the telephone. See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274 (rejecting inference of supervisory authority where the subordinates \"require[d] minimal supervision\"). If the Coordinator receives a complaint that requested work has not been completed, the Coordinator calls the employee to inquire into the reason(s) why. However, Rourke testified that the Coordinator does not write up the omissions as infractions and generally does not assign unfinished work to the other maintenance worker, though if she did, \"she would tell me [the Executive Director] that she did that, but she has the authority to do it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be considered indicative of supervisory status, the authority to assign and direct has been held necessarily to include the responsibility \"to be answerable for the discharge of a duty or obligation.\" Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379477\"><a href=\"/opinion/379477/maine-yankee-atomic-power-company-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 361 (1st Cir. 1980) (quoting Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485005\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485005/ohio-power-co-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 387 (6th Cir. 1949)). The evidence presented to the Board fails to demonstrate that the Coordinator is held accountable for the performance of the maintenance workers or the cook, or for their failure to perform. Therefore, the Center's evidence falls short of establishing the Coordinator's supervisory responsibility in this regard. See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 275 (\"[T]he record contains no compelling evidence that [the purported supervisor] is held accountable for the adequate performance of [the putative subordinates'] work. This distinction makes a world of difference.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rourke testified that the Coordinator had the authority to grant maintenance employees time off. No examples were provided, however, and Rourke also testified that \"[t]ime off is dictated by a policy within the whole agency\" and that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training \"does the scheduling for the staff.\" Moreover, the Board found that the Executive Director's testimony was directly contradicted by the Employee Handbook, which states that vacations may be taken \"as arranged by the Director.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in Telemundo, \"the mere fact that an employee gives other employees instructions from time to time does not in and of itself render him [or her] a supervisor under the Act.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 274. The evidence must show that such employees \"possess authority to exercise independent judgment in overseeing other employees.\"  Id. A review of the entire record reveals substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the Coordinator does not exercise independent judgment as a supervisor, as required by the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Head Teachers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The members of the Center's staff that are assigned to the six classrooms are divided into three \"teams.\" Each Head Teacher leads one team, consisting of her or his classroom's staff plus one other classroom. An Assistant Head Teacher (or an Assistant Head Teacher in Training) runs the other classroom. In addition, the teaching complement in each classroom also includes one and sometimes two other teachers. These secondary teachers are either Assistant Head Teachers in Training, Assistant Teachers, or Assistant Teachers in Training. The Center contends that the Head Teachers satisfy the Act's \"supervisor\" definition by (1) assigning work and directing subordinates; (2) having authority to adjust grievances and discipline other employees; and (3) providing written evaluations of other teachers. We take each claim in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

In the Classroom</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Head Teachers obviously exercise some supervisory control over their classrooms. However, the Board \"has generally and correctly said that employees who routinely direct other employees based solely on a higher skill level are not supervisors.\" Hilliard, 187 F.3d at 147-48.  The issue is whether they exercise \"independent judgment\" on behalf of the employer in the discharge of these responsibilities. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rourke asserted that relatively little direction is ordered by central administration (i.e., the Executive Director and the Coordinator of Social Services/Training) and that \"generally, the buck stops with the [H]ead [T]eacher\" on matters of classroom administration. Rourke also testified that Head Teachers are responsible for implementing the policies which are announced at the planning meetings (attended by the Executive Director, the Coordinator of Social Services/Training, and the Head Teachers). This implementation, she asserts, requires the Head Teachers to assign tasks to their subordinates and to direct them on execution of these tasks. Johnson, the Head Teacher, and Nordstrom, the Assistant Head Teacher in Training, described a more collaborative approach. The Board characterized Johnson's and Nordstrom's testimony as establishing \"that the Head Teachers do not order or direct anyone to perform certain tasks, they solicit ideas on how to implement the curriculum directives in their classrooms.\" This finding is amply supported in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, the Board found that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training \"observes the classrooms and instructs the teachers, including the [H]ead [T]eachers, regarding changes she wants made. [The Coordinator of Social Services/Training] has the authority to call teachers into her office and tell them to make changes, and she has done this with all levels of teachers, including those below the level of [H]ead [T]eacher, and without the [H]ead [T]eachers' involvement.\" The Executive Director admitted that she, too, has exercised her authority to disregard the Head Teachers and to instruct subordinate teachers directly. Such direct oversight by management without the participation or knowledge of the employee's \"supervisory\" Head Teacher is inconsistent with the Head Teachers' purported authority to \"responsibly direct subordinate teachers.\" See Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379477\"><a href=\"/opinion/379477/maine-yankee-atomic-power-company-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 361 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"To be responsible is to be answerable for the discharge of a duty or obligation.\" (quoting Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485005\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485005/ohio-power-co-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 387 (6th Cir. 1949))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides point to a letter from the Coordinator of Social Services/Training to Head Teacher Johnson dated March 3, 1998. The letter instructed Johnson that she must \"keep [her] porch closed during the morning but [that she] may choose to open it in the afternoons;\" asked her to \"please remember good developmental practice suggests you keep yourself at children's level;\" and directed her to \"[c]ontinue to have one group eat in the room whenever possible. If you find you need your lunch time changed, please let me know and we will make some accommodations. You may also want to think about a better time for other team members to take morning break if coverage is an issue.\" While the letter could be construed to support some supervisory responsibility for the Head Teachers, the oversight and direction of such minutiae by the Coordinator of Social Services/Training supports the Board's finding that Head Teachers are not authorized to exercise independent judgment in carrying out their supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Authority to Set Schedules</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Head Teacher job description and some of Rourke's testimony support the position that the Head Teachers exercise supervisory authority over the schedules of their subordinates, other evidence supports the Board's contrary conclusion. Johnson and Nordstrom testified that the team sets the schedule cooperatively and that any modifications are made exclusively on a voluntary basis. Johnson testified that, to the extent a staff coverage issue had to be resolved through an involuntary assignment, she would have to consult Rourke for direction. See Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276 (noting that \"the Board's determination is wholly consistent with the [putative supervisor's] stated self-perception that they are crew leaders, no more\"). As for substitutes and arrangements for covering absent teachers, Johnson testified that she possessed no authority to contact substitutes. As evidence, she said that she had no knowledge of who was covering her classroom at the time that she was testifying. She had called and informed the Center that she was taking the day off for personal reasons. She had no further responsibility or authority to address the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Authority to Grant Time Off</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rourke testified that Head Teachers could (and did) authorize subordinates to take time off, she also testified that all requests for time off are handled by the Coordinator of Social Services/Training. Johnson testified that she had no authority to authorize any time off. At one point in the hearing a distinction was drawn between regular time off and vacation time (apparently based on the duration of the requested leave time), but there was no dispute that vacation was authorized through a bid process administered by the Coordinator of Social Services/Training; no one contends that Head Teachers exercise supervisory authority over vacation time. Finally, conflicting evidence was offered on the authority to grant compensatory time for overtime. The Employee Handbook states that \"[e]mployees working beyond their regular hours . . . may adjust their hours on another day with approval of their supervisor.\" Again, the Handbook makes no attempt to define who is a \"supervisor.\" Rourke asserted that Head Teachers in fact possessed this authority, but provided no examples. Johnson testified in direct contradiction, stating that Head Teachers \"can't make any decisions about comp[ensatory] time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iv. Authority to Operate the Center</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Center argues that Head Teachers must have authority to responsibly direct other employees because Head Teachers are occasionally left in charge of the Center. Rourke and Johnson both testified that in the absence of the Executive Director and the Coordinator of Social Services/Training, a Head Teacher is nominally left \"in charge\" of the Center. According to Johnson, however, when a Head Teacher is left in charge he/she is \"not allowed to make any decisions.\" Instead, Johnson testified that if a problem arises while a Head Teacher is nominally \"in charge,\" the Head Teachers have been given specific instructions to contact the Executive Director or the Coordinator for Social Services/Training, \"and if they're not available, then someone on the Board of Directors is to be contacted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that the \"spasmodic and infrequent assumption of a position of command and responsibility does not transform an otherwise rank and file worker into a supervisor.\" Fall River Sav.

NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390427\"><a href=\"/opinion/390427/fall-river-savings-bank-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir. 1981) (quoting NLRB v.

The Board was justified in refusing to find supervisory status on the basis of this occasional, nominal authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Adjustment of Grievances and Discipline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear from the record whether Head Teachers have the authority to redress grievances. The Employee Handbook simply states that an employee should initiate the grievance process by first \"(d)iscuss[ing] the matter with his/her immediate supervisor.\" The Employee Handbook, however, contains no material defining \"immediate supervisor.\" Indeed, Assistant Head teacher Nordstrom testified that while she was on Johnson's \"team,\" Rourke was her supervisor. Given the testimony that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training instructed subordinate teachers directly without the involvement of Head Teachers, she could reasonably be considered an \"immediate supervisor\" under the plan as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While neither Rourke nor Johnson could recall any specific grievances, they had conflicting views as to how grievances were to be handled. Rourke reiterated the Handbook's policy that \"the first line\" in the Center's grievance procedure is for an employee to address his/her grievance to the \"supervisor.\" At another point, Rourke testified that employees should address their grievances \"to whomever, whether it be a teacher or whether, with whom they have an issue . . . .\" Johnson, like Rourke, could not remember a particular grievance but stated that subordinate teachers' grievances go directly to Rourke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on the issue of discipline follows a similar uncertain course. Without setting up a detailed procedure, the Employee Handbook offers the statement that \"Supervisors are the key people in ensuring that [the Center's] standards and rules are observed and are responsible for appropriate action for any violation of the standards and rules as set forth by the [Center].\" Again, the record is devoid of any instances where such authority has actually been exercised by a Head Teacher. The Executive Director did not speak to the Head Teachers' role in discipline per se, but did make references to the Head Teachers' responsibility \"to make sure that her subordinate is doing what is directed.\" Later, the Executive Director stated that the \"role [of the Head Teacher] is to make sure that the classroom runs smoothly, that the people are reporting to work on time . . . that they're doing what their, what their assigned duties are, and that if they're not, it is also [the Head Teachers'] responsibility to make sure that in some way this happens, either by reprimand, either by bringing it to my attention and dealing with it herself or sitting down with the person.\" At another point in her testimony, Rourke stated that in supervising subordinate teachers, Head Teachers have the ability to \"observe their teaching ability, to make suggestions and comments,  . . . [and] to come to [the Executive Director] if they feel there is a larger issue.\" This evidence is equivocal on whether Head Teachers have disciplinary authority. Johnson, however, was unequivocal in her insistence that as a Head Teacher she has no disciplinary authority. Johnson insisted that Rourke administered discipline at the Center. Understandably, on this record, the Board was uncertain about the disciplinary role of the teachers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Evaluations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Head Teachers prepare written evaluations of subordinate teachers on their \"teams.\" However, the frequency and the significance of these evaluations were disputed. While the Center's written policies called for annual evaluations, Johnson testified that she had not evaluated any of her subordinate teachers in the preceding two to three years. Rourke confirmed that \"it might go two or three years before [employees are] evaluated.\" Rourke also testified that \"evaluations have nothing to do with whether somebody gets a raise or doesn't get a raise\" and that \"[a]cross-the-board raises are voted by the Board on an annual basis.\" Nevertheless, the Center argues that evaluations \"are placed in the employee's personnel files,\" and that this fact alone \"demonstrates the importance of the evaluations and supports the supervisory status since the evaluations are reasonably calculated to affect the employee's status.\" The Center relies on NLRB v. Beacon Light Christian Nursing Home, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492424\"><a href=\"/opinion/492424/national-labor-relations-board-v-beacon-light-christian-nursing-home/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span> (6th Cir. 1987), to support this proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Light is unavailing. There, the allegedly supervisory nurses were \"expected and encouraged to [utilize evaluation and discipline forms] routinely,\" and \"[t]hree or four such citations could result in formal disciplinary action including discharge, suspension or demotion.\" Beacon Light, 825 F.2d at 1079. The authority of the disputed supervisors to \"effectively recommend\" employment decisions based on their own independent judgment, a hallmark of supervision under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11), was clear evidence of supervisory authority. See id. Here, the evidence allowed the Board reasonably to find that such evaluations \"have no impact on wages, promotions, or other terms and conditions of employment.\" See Hilliard, 187 F.3d at 144-45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful of the difficult judgments these fact-intensive cases require. The evidence supporting the Board's decision is close, particularly on the status of the Head Teachers. This closeness makes deference to the Board especially appropriate. \"It is particularly in the close cases that judges, who are generalists, should respect the specialized knowledge of the Board and accede to its factbound determinations as long as they are rooted in the record.\" Telemundo, 113 F.3d at 276. In the final analysis, the Board's determinations that the Coordinator of Billing and Operations and the Head Teachers are employees and not supervisors are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review, grant the cross-petition, and enforce the Board's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Center originally claimed that Assistant Head Teachers were also supervisors and therefore were also inappropriate to include in a bargaining unit. The Center does not pursue this argument on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The hearing officer merely takes evidence and creates the record. The Regional Director then makes findings and conclusions on the basis of the record compiled by the hearing officer.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This unit was approved conditionally because it included \"professional employees,\" i.e., the head teachers. Because the professional employees voted to be included in the bargaining unit with the non-professional employees, the condition for their inclusion was met and this is the bargaining unit at issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In its brief to this court, the Board did not respond directly to the argument that its procedure was flawed because of the refusal of the Regional Director to make credibility determinations. At oral argument, the Board did note that this argument was not properly before the court because the Center had not presented it to the Board. However, even if the Board had neglected this argument altogether we would in all probability refuse to take cognizance of it because &#167; 160(e) \"speaks to courts, not parties, and its plain language evinces an intent that the [Board] shall pass on issues arising under the Act, thereby bringing its expertise to bear on the resolution of those issues.\" EEOC v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111659\"><a href=\"/opinion/111659/eeoc-v-flra/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1986) (construing \"virtually identical\" language in the Civil Service Reform Act and citing Woelke, 456 U.S. at 665-66).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> It is undisputed that the Coordinator of Social Services/Training is a supervisor.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Only Rourke testified about the Coordinator's responsibilities; the Coordinator was not called to testify by either party. Therefore, the record with regard to the Coordinator is limited to Rourke's testimony and the documentary evidence offered by the Center, which included a job description listing the Coordinator's duties as follows:</p>\n        <p>1. Maintains client data base in order to submit monthly billing for state/federal contracts in accordance with all promulgated policies and procedures.</p>\n        <p>2. Responsible for management of all aspects of employee benefits, including group health/dental, disability, and unemployment services.</p>\n        <p>3. Responsible for management of agency's insurance policies, including workers compensation, client, and staff accident policies.</p>\n        <p>4. Coordinates housekeeping and general maintenance and capital improvements to the facility; oversees agency, staff, and outside contractors.</p>\n        <p>5. In conjunction with the Executive Director, coordinates nutrition staff including monitoring of menus in accordance with U.S.D.A. standards.</p>\n        <p>6. Coordinates ordering of and inventories general consumable supplies for maintenance, nutrition, classroom and office use.</p>\n        <p>7. Assists with the coordination of summer program transportation.</p>\n        <p>8. Attends seminars, inservice training and staff meetings as required.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The evidence on the Head Teacher's supervisory status was hotly contested. Again, Rourke testified for the Center. The Union called two additional witnesses: Head Teacher Gloria Johnson and Assistant Head Teacher in Training Nancy Nordstrom. The Center also presented a job description for the Head Teachers, which lists the duties of a Head Teacher as follows:</p>\n        <p>1.      Coordinates work of teaching staff with agency personnel and consultants.</p>\n        <p>2.      Maintains documentation and record keeping required by Office for Children, other social services and funding sources.</p>\n        <p>3.      Supervises incoming team staff including assistants, aides and interns.</p>\n        <p>4.      Has daily contact with Assistant Teacher.</p>\n        <p>5.      Designates person on team in charge whenever absent from the agency.</p>\n        <p>6.      Assumes responsibility for coverage whenever a member of team is absent.</p>\n        <p>7.      Has regular conferences with Coordinator of S.S./Training.</p>\n        <p>8.      Keeps the workspace and classroom area appropriately neat, tidy and conducive to a safe learning environment.</p>\n        <p>9.      Coordinates weekly team meetings.</p>\n        <p>10.
