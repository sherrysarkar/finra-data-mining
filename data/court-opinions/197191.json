Richard Goldberg was  convicted\r                                      \r\n\nof two counts  of conspiracy to defraud the  Internal Revenue\r\n\nService,  18 U.S.C.    371,  and eight  counts of  aiding and\r\n\nassisting the filing of false income tax returns, 26 U.S.C.  \r\n\n7206(2).  Goldberg's  appeal is now before  us.  We  begin by\r\n\ndescribing  the factual  background  and  proceedings in  the\r\n\ndistrict court.\r\n\n     In the years prior to  his indictment in 1995,  Goldberg\r\n\nwas involved in several businesses in and around Boston.  His\r\n\nventures  included a billboard company, Logan Communications,\r\n\nand a partial interest in a \"Park 'N Fly\" lot located in East\r\n\nBoston near Logan Airport.   Goldberg also owned and operated\r\n\nLiverpool Lumber,  Inc., which Goldberg used  as a management\r\n\ncompany for various of his other enterprises.\r\n\n     In  or  around  1988,  Goldberg became  aware  that  the\r\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts  planned to take all or part of\r\n\nthe East  Boston Park 'N Fly lot by eminent domain as part of\r\n\nits Third Harbor Tunnel project.  The planned taking not only\r\n\nthreatened Goldberg's profitable  parking business, but  also\r\n\nhis billboard company,  since many of its signs  were located\r\n\non  the  parking  lot's  land.   Goldberg  began  an  intense\r\n\nlobbying  effort  against the  proposal  in  1988, eventually\r\n\nspending  over $1 million of  his and his  partners' money to\r\n\noppose the tunnel plans.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     Two  of  those hired  to  oppose  the project--community\r\n\nactivist  Robert A. Scopa  and consultant  Vernon Clark--were\r\n\nnamed as co-conspirators in the two separate conspiracies for\r\n\nwhich Goldberg was ultimately convicted.  Taking the evidence\r\n\nmost favorable  to the verdict,  the facts pertaining  to the\r\n\ntwo different conspiracies were as follows.\r\n\n     Scopa Conspiracy.  From  1990 to 1995, Goldberg employed\r                                 \r\n\nScopa to help organize the East Boston  community against the\r\n\ntunnel project and to  perform other services.  But  Goldberg\r\n\nnever  paid Scopa in Scopa's own name.  Instead, Goldberg had\r\n\nhis   Liverpool  Lumber  company  issue  paychecks  to  three\r\n\nsuccessive  \"straw\"   employees,  none  of  whom  worked  for\r\n\nGoldberg  and all  of whom agreed  to hand the  money over to\r\n\nScopa.  \r\n\n     To reflect the \"wages\"  of the straw employees, Goldberg\r\n\ndirected  his  bookkeeper  at  Liverpool  Lumber  to  prepare\r\n\nvarious W-2,  W-3, and  W-4 reporting statements,  which were\r\n\nthen filed with the  IRS.  These documents falsely  described\r\n\nwage  payments  to  straws  who  had performed  no  work  for\r\n\nLiverpool  Lumber.  The straws, in turn, falsely included the\r\n\nphantom wages from Liverpool on their own individual returns.\r\n\nReporting the money on the straws' returns instead of Scopa's\r\n\nresulted  in a  loss of  about $150  to the  Internal Revenue\r\n\nService.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     The  government claimed  at  trial that  the scheme  was\r\n\ndevised  so that Scopa would  seem to be  unemployed and thus\r\n\ncould continue to collect monthly benefits under a disability\r\n\ninsurance policy.  Evidence  also indicated that Scopa sought\r\n\nto hide the  payments in order to  preserve his status  as an\r\n\n\"independent\" activist  in the  East Boston community  and to\r\n\nprevent an  extramarital affair from being  discovered by his\r\n\nwife.  The  district court  later found that  Scopa, but  not\r\n\nGoldberg, was motivated by all of these objectives.  \r\n\n     Clark Conspiracy.  In  the course of opposing  the Third\r                                 \r\n\nHarbor Tunnel project, Goldberg also retained Vernon Clark, a\r\n\nlobbyist in  Washington, D.C., who performed various services\r\n\nto this  end.  Goldberg's companies owed  Clark a substantial\r\n\nsum of money in 1991 for  work performed in opposition to the\r\n\ntunnel project.  Rather  than pay the bill directly,  the two\r\n\nmen  agreed  with others  to  a more  complicated  method for\r\n\nGoldberg to discharge his debt to Clark.\r\n\n     At the time,  Clark was  having a secret  affair with  a\r\n\nwoman named  Patricia McNally.   The pair  occasionally spent\r\n\ntime in a Maine beach house of which  McNally was part owner.\r\n\nClark  sought to fund an expansion of the beach house without\r\n\nhis  wife's knowledge.  Goldberg  agreed to pay  the money he\r\n\nowed to Clark to  a landscaping company owned by  John Lango,\r\n\nMcNally's  brother-in-law, who  would  in turn  construct the\r\n\nbeach house expansion.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     Goldberg arranged for  the preparation  of two  separate\r\n\n$10,000 invoices to Park 'N Fly from Lango, dated October 15,\r\n\n1991 and  January 1, 1992,  respectively.  The  invoices were\r\n\nostensibly for landscaping services, although Lango performed\r\n\nno work for any  of Goldberg's companies.  The  invoices were\r\n\npaid  by  Park 'N  Fly.   Lango testified  at trial  that the\r\n\npayments were structured  in two installments so as to reduce\r\n\nhis taxes on the transaction.\r\n\n     The triangular  flow of money and  services involved the\r\n\npreparation and filing  of several false  tax documents.   At\r\n\nGoldberg's direction,  Park 'N Fly sent  forms 1099-MISC, one\r\n\nfor each $10,000 payment, to the IRS and to Lango.  The forms\r\n\nfalsely listed  the payments as non-employee  compensation to\r\n\nLango.  Lango in turn reported  the payments as income on his\r\n\nown income  tax returns  in  1991 and  1992.   Clark did  not\r\n\nreport the money.   The foreseeable tax loss to the IRS based\r\n\non this scheme was about $3,000.\r\n\n     A federal  grand jury indicted Goldberg on April 6, 1995\r\n\nfor  offenses   relating  to  the  above   activities.    The\r\n\nindictment charged Goldberg with  two counts of conspiring to\r\n\ndefraud  the  United  States  government, 18  U.S.C.     371,\r\n\nseveral counts of  aiding and assisting  the filing of  false\r\n\nincome tax returns,  26 U.S.C.   7206(2),  and several counts\r\n\nof mail fraud  based on  his alleged efforts  to conceal  his\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nemployment of Scopa from the latter's disability insurer.  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341.\r\n\n     After moving  unsuccessfully to dismiss  the indictment,\r\n\nGoldberg waived his  right to  a trial by  jury.   Goldberg's\r\n\ntrial  before the  district  judge took  eight  days, and  on\r\n\nSeptember 6,  1995, the court  announced its  findings.   The\r\n\ncourt  found Goldberg  guilty  of conspiring  to defraud  the\r\n\ngovernment and of aiding and assisting in  the preparation of\r\n\nfalse  tax  returns,  but acquitted  him  on  the  mail fraud\r\n\ncharges on the  ground that  his motive to  help defraud  the\r\n\ninsurer had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n     At Goldberg's  sentencing in December 1995, the district\r\n\ncourt made guideline calculations  (described below) but then\r\n\ndeparted downward  two levels  and sentenced Goldberg  at the\r\n\nbottom of the range.   The result was a  ten-month sentence--\r\n\nfive  months to  be served  in prison  and five  in community\r\n\nconfinement--as well as three years of supervised release and\r\n\na  $20,000  fine.    Goldberg now  appeals,  challenging  his\r\n\nconvictions and sentence.\r\n\n     The most important and difficult issues on appeal relate\r\n\nto Goldberg's conviction for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.   371\r\n\nto defraud  the IRS.  This  type of conspiracy is  known as a\r\n\nKlein  conspiracy,  taking  its  name from  an  earlier  case\r                 \r\n\ninvolving a complex scheme designed to escape taxes.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Klein, 247  F.2d 908  (2d  Cir. 1957).   Goldberg\r                             \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nargues  that  the district  court  misunderstood  the crime's\r\n\n\"purpose\" element  and that  the evidence did  not support  a\r\n\nconviction.\r\n\n     The defraud  clause  of  Section  371  criminalizes  any\r\n\nconspiracy  \"to  defraud the  United  States,  or any  agency\r\n\nthereof in any manner or for  any purpose.\"  18 U.S.C.   371.\r\n\nSuch conspiracies to  defraud are not limited to those aiming\r\n\nto deprive the government of  money or property, but  include\r\n\nconspiracy to  interfere  with government  functions.    See,\r                                                                         \r\n\ne.g., United States v. Tarvers, 833 F.2d 1068, 1075 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1987).  The crime with which Goldberg was charged, therefore,\r\n\nwas  that   he  conspired   to  interfere  with   the  proper\r\n\nfunctioning  of  the IRS,  through  the filing  of  false tax\r\n\ndocuments.\r\n\n     It  is commonly said that in such a conspiracy the fraud\r\n\nhas  to be  a purpose  or object  of the conspiracy,  and not\r                                            \r\n\nmerely  a  foreseeable  consequence  of   the  conspiratorial\r\n\nscheme.  Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 861 (1966); 1\r                                            \r\n\nSand et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions   19.02 (1990).\r                                                         \r\n\nConsider,  for example, the case  of a band  of bank robbers.\r\n\nAll know that the  agreed-upon robbery will generate \"income\"\r\n\nthat  none of  the  robbers will  report.   Yet  it would  be\r\n\nstraining to describe interference with  the IRS as a purpose\r\n\nor  object of the conspiracy.   E.g., United  States v. Vogt,\r                                                                        \r\n\n910 F.2d 1184, 1202 (4th Cir. 1990).\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     This  requirement  of  purpose  accords  generally  with\r\n\nconspiracy doctrine, United States v. Alvarez, 610 F.2d 1250,\r                                                         \r\n\n1256 (5th  Cir. 1980), but  it is especially  important under\r\n\nthe  defraud clause  of  section 371.    There are  not  many\r\n\nfinancial   crimes  without   some  implications   for  false\r\n\nreporting in someone's tax filings, if not for  tax liability\r\n\nitself.     If   section  371   embraced  every   foreseeable\r\n\nconsequence  of  a conspiracy,  many  joint  financial crimes\r\n\nhaving no other federal nexus--and perhaps  many non-criminal\r\n\nacts as well--would automatically become federal conspiracies\r\n\nto defraud the IRS.\r\n\n     The \"purpose\" requirement, however,  is easier to  state\r\n\nthan  to apply.  The  laundering of drug  money, for example,\r\n\nnormally involves  the deliberate concealment of  the money's\r\n\norigin.   The  primary  purpose  is almost  always  to  avoid\r\n\ndetection of the underlying  crime; but can a jury  also find\r\n\nan  implied secondary  objective to  conceal income  from the\r\n\nIRS?  We have held, on specific facts, that a jury could draw\r\n\nsuch an inference and  also find a violation of  section 371.\r\n\nE.g., United States v.  Cambara, 902 F.2d 144, 147  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1990); Tarvers, 833 F.2d at 1075-76.\r                          \r\n\n     Such cases  are the source of  Goldberg's first argument\r\n\non this issue.  He argues, inventively, that the conspirators\r\n\neither  must  have  as  their  primary  purpose  the  aim  of\r\n\nfrustrating  the IRS  or must  be agreeing  to  undertake the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nconduct  in question to conceal some other crime.  An example\r\n\nof the  first alternative  (primary purpose) is  Klein itself\r                                                                  \r\n\nwhere a web of shell companies and deceptive arrangements was\r\n\ndevised to evade  taxes; the second  alternative (concealment\r\n\nof crime) captures the money laundering precedents.\r\n\n     This view of section 371 might explain a number of cases\r\n\nand  create a  barrier against  overreaching by  prosecutors.\r\n\nBut  it  makes no  doctrinal sense.    A conspiracy  can have\r\n\nmultiple objects, Ingram v. United States, 360 U.S. 672, 679-\r                                                     \r\n\n80 (1959), and any agreed-upon object can be a purpose of the\r\n\nconspiracy and  used to  define its character.   The  central\r\n\nproblem,  which  ought  not  be shirked,  is  to  distinguish\r\n\nrationally  between cases  where interfering  with government\r\n\nfunctions  is  a  purpose and  those  where  it  is merely  a\r                         \r\n\nforeseeable effect of joint action taken for other reasons.\r\n\n     This  effort poses  subtle  problems  in  discriminating\r\n\n\"purpose\" from \"knowledge\" and in separating the objects of a\r\n\nconspiracy from its more  remote consequences.  Volumes could\r\n\nbe written on these subjects but--for cases like ours--a more\r\n\ncompact  solution is  at  hand: where  the conspirators  have\r\n\neffectively agreed  to falsify  IRS documents to  misstate or\r\n\nmisattribute  income,  we  think  that  (depending  upon  the\r\n\ncircumstances) the factfinder may  infer a purpose to defraud\r\n\nthe government by interfering with IRS functions in the sense\r\n\nendorsed by the Supreme Court in Dennis.    \r                                                   \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     It may well be that the conspirators in this case had no\r\n\nsubjective desire--primary or secondary--to throw sand in the\r                                         \r\n\nwheels of the  IRS, let alone a subjective aim  to reduce tax\r\n\nliability.    Goldberg's argument  on  this  point, with  one\r\n\nqualification as  to the Clark conspiracy,  may be plausible.\r\n\nBut  filing a  number of  false tax  documents misattributing\r\n\nincome  can interfere  so  clearly and  proximately with  IRS\r\n\nfunctions--or at least a factfinder  could (but need not)  so\r\n\nfind--that  we see  no  sharp distinction  under section  371\r\n\nbetween a purpose  to file  such documents and  a purpose  to\r\n\ninterfere.\r\n\n     In permitting  a factfinder to equate  the two purposes,\r\n\nwe  leave untouched  the general  precept, namely,  that mere\r\n\ncollateral  effects of  jointly agreed-to  activity, even  if\r\n\ngenerally foreseeable, are not  mechanically to be treated as\r\n\nan object of  the conspiracy.  This would be a different case\r\n\nif, without  filing false tax documents,  Goldberg had agreed\r\n\nwith  his partners to pay Jones under the table, knowing that\r\n\nJones had no intention of reporting the money to the IRS.  If\r\n\nthe difference is in degree, then here the degree matters.\r\n\n     This  brings us  to the  evidentiary question  raised by\r\n\nGoldberg  which we  rephrase to  accord with  our just-stated\r\n\nview of  the law:  does  the evidence in this  case show that\r\n\nGoldberg and at least one other conspirator shared  a purpose\r\n\nto interfere with IRS functions by the filing of false income\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nreports  with the  IRS?   This  question  must be  asked  and\r\n\nanswered separately  as to  each conspiracy, as  Goldberg was\r\n\nconvicted of two separate  conspiracies under section 371 and\r\n\neach conviction involves a separate assessment.\r\n\n     In each conspiracy, the  illicit purpose that gives rise\r\n\nto  section 371  violation  must be  shared  by two  or  more\r\n\nconspirators.   Although the government's brief  stresses the\r\n\nevidence pertaining  to Goldberg's own role  and knowledge, a\r\n\nconspiracy to  defraud requires at  least two who  share that\r\n\naim. Innocent third parties  may be the unwitting instruments\r\n\nof a conspiracy.   But  when it comes  to characterizing  the\r\n\npurposes or objects of  the conspiracy, it is those  that are\r\n\nshared  by  at least  two  co-conspirators that  make  up the\r\n\nillegal agreement between them.   United States v. Krasovich,\r                                                                        \r\n\n819 F.2d 253, 255 (9th Cir. 1987).\r\n\n     Here, the  district court  found that  a purpose of  the\r\n\nconspirators, in  each conspiracy, was to  interfere with the\r\n\nIRS.   As  we have  said,  such a  purpose  can be  inferred,\r\n\ndepending  upon the facts, where  the very acts  agreed to by\r\n\nthe conspirators included the  filing of false income-related\r\n\ntax  documents.    This  purpose can  fairly  be  imputed  to\r\n\nGoldberg  who arranged  for the creation  of several  or more\r\n\nfalse  tax  documents  in  each scheme.    The  duration  and\r\n\ncomplexity of the schemes, and Goldberg's own sophistication,\r\n\nadd to the inference.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     There is no evidence  that Goldberg discussed the filing\r\n\nof false tax documents with other conspirators.  Yet we think\r\n\nthat such  conduct was an  integral and self-evident  part of\r\n\neach  conspiracy,  permitting the  inference  that other  co-\r\n\nconspirators  shared in  that purpose.   In  the case  of the\r\n\nScopa conspiracy,  false W-2s were  given to the  straws, who\r\n\nwere  participants in  the scheme,  over an  extended period.\r\n\nScopa himself signed a  tax return with his wife, who was one\r\n\nof the straws, that incorporated a false W-2.  \r\n\n     As  to the  Clark conspiracy,  Lango received  the false\r\n\nform 1099s, and he in turn  reported the false figures to the\r\n\nIRS.  Indeed, Lango asked that the amount be  divided so that\r\n\nit could be reported in two different years, testifying later\r\n\nthat Clark had  made the  suggestion.  This  indicates a  tax\r\n\nmotive  but, in addition, shows  that both men  knew that the\r\n\nfiling of false  tax documents  was an integral  part of  the\r\n\nscheme,  and both shared in  this purpose with  Goldberg.  In\r\n\nsum, the  evidence supports the  trial court's findings  of a\r\n\ncommon purpose to interfere with IRS functions.\r\n\n     In  addition to \"the danger [of injustice] inherent in a\r\n\ncriminal  conspiracy charge,\"  Dennis, 384  U.S. at  860, the\r                                                 \r\n\ndefraud clause  of section  371  has a  special capacity  for\r\n\nabuse because of the vagueness  of the concept of interfering\r\n\nwith  a proper government function.  For that reason, we have\r\n\nexamined with special  care both the concept and the evidence\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nin  this case.    But having  done so,  we conclude  that the\r\n\nconduct and purpose of the defendants, although markedly less\r\n\nsinister  than in  Klein,  could properly  be  found to  fall\r                                    \r\n\nwithin the outer bounds of section 371.\r\n\n     Goldberg next  challenges the admission at  trial of two\r\n\nout-of-court conversations between Lango  and Clark, in which\r\n\nthey  discussed  the  false   landscaping  invoices  and  the\r\n\nsolicitation  of  Goldberg's  participation  in  the  scheme.\r\n\nThese statements were admitted, over Goldberg's  objection at\r\n\ntrial, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), which provides\r\n\nthat \"a statement by  a co-conspirator of a party  during the\r\n\ncourse  and   in  furtherance  of  the   conspiracy\"  is  not\r\n\nconsidered hearsay.  \r\n\n     Goldberg does not dispute that  Lango and Clark made the\r\n\nchallenged  statements  during  and  in  furtherance  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy,  but  he  argues  that the  statements  were  not\r\n\nadmissible  against  him because  they  were  made before  he\r\n\njoined.  He relies heavily on our opinion in United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nPetrozziello, 548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir. 1977), where we said that\r                        \r\n\n\"if  it is more  likely than not  that the  declarant and the\r\n\ndefendant  were  members of  a  conspiracy  when the  hearsay\r\n\nstatement was made, and that the statement was in furtherance\r\n\nof the conspiracy, the hearsay is admissible.\"  Id. at 23.\r                                                              \r\n\n     Although this language has been cited with approval in a\r\n\nfew later cases, e.g.,   United States v.

No  special guarantee  of reliability  attends such\r\n\nstatements,   save  to   the   extent   that  they   resemble\r\n\ndeclarations against  interest.   The exception  derives from\r\n\nagency  law, an analogy that  is useful in  some contexts but\r\n\n(as  the Advisory  Committee noted)  is \"at  best  a fiction\"\r\n\nhere.  The most  that can be said is that  the co-conspirator\r\n\nexception  to  hearsay  is  of  long  standing  and  makes  a\r\n\ndifficult-to-detect crime easier to  prove.

Finally, he\r\n\npointed to  the fact that  several of his  co-conspirators in\r\n\nthe  two  schemes,  including  Clark and  Lango,  were  never\r\n\nindicted.  \r\n\n     The  government filed  several affidavits  to  rebut the\r\n\nclaim.   It denied that  the prosecutor in  question made the\r\n\nalleged statement to Goldberg's  attorney.  It explained that\r\n\nthe  initials  \"D.D.\"  on  the file  that  raised  Goldberg's\r\n\nsuspicion in fact referred  not to David Davis but  to Denise\r\n\nDoherty,  an  FBI agent  assigned to  the  case.   In another\r\n\ndistrict court paper, the government described the origins of\r\n\nits  investigation  into   Goldberg's  activities  and   gave\r\n\nexamples  of other  recent  prosecutions for  mail fraud  and\r\n\nKlein conspiracies.\r                 \r\n\n     The district court  ultimately denied a hearing,  saying\r\n\nthat Goldberg's claims  were \"close to conclusory.\"   We have\r\n\nreviewed the complete filings of both sides and  the district\r\n\ncourt's  explanation.

Here,  the district  court  did not  abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n     The claim of selectivity  was quite weak; the government\r\n\nlargely explained  its choice  mainly to pursue  Goldberg and\r\n\nScopa.   And  the rather  modest evidence of  wrongful motive\r\n\nalso melted away, leaving only a single dispute.  As to this,\r\n\nfour prosecutors  denied under  oath that the  alleged remark\r\n\nhad been made.   But it is  in any event too  thin a reed  to\r\n\nrequire an evidentiary hearing, given the lack of surrounding\r\n\nevidence to support a selective prosecution claim.\r\n\n     Even less need be said about Goldberg's later  new trial\r\n\nmotion,  whose summary  denial is  also cited  as error.   In\r\n\nsubstance  Goldberg complained  that  the government  did not\r\n\nfollow its  own internal rules for tax prosecutions or reveal\r\n\nto  him information  about this  decision.   The government's\r\n\nprocedures do not create substantive rights, United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMichaud, 860 F.2d 495,  499 (1st Cir. 1988), and  there is no\r                   \r\n\nsubstantial basis for believing that  the government withheld\r\n\nBrady material,  Brady v. Maryland,  373 U.S. 83  (1963), let\r                                              \r\n\nalone that its actions were prejudicial.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\n     Goldberg's last claim of error  concerns his sentencing.\r\n\nIn   fixing  the  sentence,   the  district   court  enhanced\r\n\nGoldberg's  base offense  level  of 10,  by four  levels--two\r\n\nlevels  for his role in the offense, U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c), and\r\n\ntwo more levels  for obstruction of justice,  id.   3C1.1--to\r                                                             \r\n\narrive  at an adjusted offense  level of 14.   (All citations\r\n\nare  to  the  November   1995  edition  of  the  guidelines).\r\n\nHowever, the court departed downward two levels to 12 because\r\n\nit thought  Goldberg's  conduct was  outside the  \"heartland\"\r\n\ncontemplated  by the  Klein conspiracy  sentencing guideline.\r                                       \r\n\nId.   2T1.9.\r               \r\n\n     The  district  judge  stated  that  although  Goldberg's\r\n\nconduct \"as  a matter of law constitutes  a Klein conspiracy,\r                                                             \r\n\nas a matter of  sentencing law, it seems to  me inappropriate\r\n\nto  apply the  Klein  conspiracy guidelines.\"    He chose  to\r                                \r\n\ndepart downward  two levels because he  thought the guideline\r\n\nsection for aiding and  assisting tax fraud,   2T1.4,  with a\r\n\nbase  offense level  of 8  (when  the tax  loss is  $3,001 to\r\n\n$5,000), was  more reflective of Goldberg's  conduct than the\r\n\nKlein conspiracy guideline,   2T1.9, which has a base offense\r                 \r\n\nlevel of 10.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2The ten-month  sentence--five  months to  be served  in\r\nprison and five in community confinement--was the minimum end\r\nof  the resulting guideline range of 12.  U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt.\r\nA (10-16 months at offense level 12).\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\n     The government, sensibly in our view,  has chosen not to\r\n\npursue  an appeal from the downward departure.  But Goldberg,\r\n\nas is his right, challenges  the district court's decision to\r\n\nimpose  a  two-level   enhancement  for  his   managerial  or\r\n\nsupervisory role  in the Scopa  and Clark conspiracies.   The\r\n\napplicable guideline calls for  an increase if \"the defendant\r\n\nwas  an  organizer, leader,  manager,  or  supervisor in  any\r\n\ncriminal activity.\"  U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(c).  In such a case, a\r\n\ntwo-level  increase applies to  joint criminal  activity that\r\n\ninvolved fewer  than five participants and  was not otherwise\r\n\nextensive.  Id.\r                           \r\n\n     Goldberg  says  that  the  only  person  he  managed  or\r\n\nsupervised  was his  bookkeeper, Arlene  Meucci.   Meucci, he\r\n\nargues, does  not count under  the guideline because  she was\r\n\nnot  a culpable participant.  See United States v. Morillo, 8\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  864,  872 &amp;  n.13 (1st  Cir.  1993); U.S.S.G.    3B1.1,\r\n\ncomment  n.1.    However,  at  the  sentencing  hearing,  the\r\n\ndistrict court found that Goldberg \"had a management role\" in\r\n\nconnection with  false payroll and tax documentation directed\r\n\nto the straw employees in the Scopa conspiracy.  \r\n\n     We review  a district court's factfinding  at sentencing\r\n\nunder  a  clearly  erroneous  standard.    United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nThompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994).  On the record before\r                    \r\n\nus,  ample evidence  shows  that Goldberg  superintended  the\r\n\nstraws'  receipt of false tax  documents.  Goldberg says that\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\nScopa  and  Clark   were  the   true  leaders   of  the   two\r\n\nconspiracies.   But a defendant need  not be at the  top of a\r\n\ncriminal scheme to be a manager or supervisor.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Here,\r                      \r\n\nGoldberg's role was sufficient for the enhancement even if we\r\n\nassume that  Scopa conceived of  the payroll  scheme and  may\r\n\nhave exercised primary supervision over the straws.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n",

Richard Goldberg was  convicted\r                                      \r\n\nof two counts  of conspiracy to defraud the  Internal Revenue\r\n\nService,  18 U.S.C.    371,  and eight  counts of  aiding and\r\n\nassisting the filing of false income tax returns, 26 U.S.C.  \r\n\n7206(2).  Goldberg's  appeal is now before  us.  We  begin by\r\n\ndescribing  the factual  background  and  proceedings in  the\r\n\ndistrict court.\r\n\n     In the years prior to  his indictment in 1995,  Goldberg\r\n\nwas involved in several businesses in and around Boston.  His\r\n\nventures  included a billboard company, Logan Communications,\r\n\nand a partial interest in a \"Park 'N Fly\" lot located in East\r\n\nBoston near Logan Airport.   Goldberg also owned and operated\r\n\nLiverpool Lumber,  Inc., which Goldberg used  as a management\r\n\ncompany for various of his other enterprises.\r\n\n     In  or  around  1988,  Goldberg became  aware  that  the\r\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts  planned to take all or part of\r\n\nthe East  Boston Park 'N Fly lot by eminent domain as part of\r\n\nits Third Harbor Tunnel project.  The planned taking not only\r\n\nthreatened Goldberg's profitable  parking business, but  also\r\n\nhis billboard company,  since many of its signs  were located\r\n\non  the  parking  lot's  land.   Goldberg  began  an  intense\r\n\nlobbying  effort  against the  proposal  in  1988, eventually\r\n\nspending  over $1 million of  his and his  partners' money to\r\n\noppose the tunnel plans.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     Two  of  those hired  to  oppose  the project--community\r\n\nactivist  Robert A. Scopa  and consultant  Vernon Clark--were\r\n\nnamed as co-conspirators in the two separate conspiracies for\r\n\nwhich Goldberg was ultimately convicted.  Taking the evidence\r\n\nmost favorable  to the verdict,  the facts pertaining  to the\r\n\ntwo different conspiracies were as follows.\r\n\n     Scopa Conspiracy.  From  1990 to 1995, Goldberg employed\r                                 \r\n\nScopa to help organize the East Boston  community against the\r\n\ntunnel project and to  perform other services.  But  Goldberg\r\n\nnever  paid Scopa in Scopa's own name.  Instead, Goldberg had\r\n\nhis   Liverpool  Lumber  company  issue  paychecks  to  three\r\n\nsuccessive  \"straw\"   employees,  none  of  whom  worked  for\r\n\nGoldberg  and all  of whom agreed  to hand the  money over to\r\n\nScopa.  \r\n\n     To reflect the \"wages\"  of the straw employees, Goldberg\r\n\ndirected  his  bookkeeper  at  Liverpool  Lumber  to  prepare\r\n\nvarious W-2,  W-3, and  W-4 reporting statements,  which were\r\n\nthen filed with the  IRS.  These documents falsely  described\r\n\nwage  payments  to  straws  who  had performed  no  work  for\r\n\nLiverpool  Lumber.  The straws, in turn, falsely included the\r\n\nphantom wages from Liverpool on their own individual returns.\r\n\nReporting the money on the straws' returns instead of Scopa's\r\n\nresulted  in a  loss of  about $150  to the  Internal Revenue\r\n\nService.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     The  government claimed  at  trial that  the scheme  was\r\n\ndevised  so that Scopa would  seem to be  unemployed and thus\r\n\ncould continue to collect monthly benefits under a disability\r\n\ninsurance policy.  Evidence  also indicated that Scopa sought\r\n\nto hide the  payments in order to  preserve his status  as an\r\n\n\"independent\" activist  in the  East Boston community  and to\r\n\nprevent an  extramarital affair from being  discovered by his\r\n\nwife.  The  district court  later found that  Scopa, but  not\r\n\nGoldberg, was motivated by all of these objectives.  \r\n\n     Clark Conspiracy.  In  the course of opposing  the Third\r                                 \r\n\nHarbor Tunnel project, Goldberg also retained Vernon Clark, a\r\n\nlobbyist in  Washington, D.C., who performed various services\r\n\nto this  end.  Goldberg's companies owed  Clark a substantial\r\n\nsum of money in 1991 for  work performed in opposition to the\r\n\ntunnel project.  Rather  than pay the bill directly,  the two\r\n\nmen  agreed  with others  to  a more  complicated  method for\r\n\nGoldberg to discharge his debt to Clark.\r\n\n     At the time,  Clark was  having a secret  affair with  a\r\n\nwoman named  Patricia McNally.   The pair  occasionally spent\r\n\ntime in a Maine beach house of which  McNally was part owner.\r\n\nClark  sought to fund an expansion of the beach house without\r\n\nhis  wife's knowledge.  Goldberg  agreed to pay  the money he\r\n\nowed to Clark to  a landscaping company owned by  John Lango,\r\n\nMcNally's  brother-in-law, who  would  in turn  construct the\r\n\nbeach house expansion.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     Goldberg arranged for  the preparation  of two  separate\r\n\n$10,000 invoices to Park 'N Fly from Lango, dated October 15,\r\n\n1991 and  January 1, 1992,  respectively.  The  invoices were\r\n\nostensibly for landscaping services, although Lango performed\r\n\nno work for any  of Goldberg's companies.  The  invoices were\r\n\npaid  by  Park 'N  Fly.   Lango testified  at trial  that the\r\n\npayments were structured  in two installments so as to reduce\r\n\nhis taxes on the transaction.\r\n\n     The triangular  flow of money and  services involved the\r\n\npreparation and filing  of several false  tax documents.   At\r\n\nGoldberg's direction,  Park 'N Fly sent  forms 1099-MISC, one\r\n\nfor each $10,000 payment, to the IRS and to Lango.  The forms\r\n\nfalsely listed  the payments as non-employee  compensation to\r\n\nLango.  Lango in turn reported  the payments as income on his\r\n\nown income  tax returns  in  1991 and  1992.   Clark did  not\r\n\nreport the money.   The foreseeable tax loss to the IRS based\r\n\non this scheme was about $3,000.\r\n\n     A federal  grand jury indicted Goldberg on April 6, 1995\r\n\nfor  offenses   relating  to  the  above   activities.    The\r\n\nindictment charged Goldberg with  two counts of conspiring to\r\n\ndefraud  the  United  States  government, 18  U.S.C.     371,\r\n\nseveral counts of  aiding and assisting  the filing of  false\r\n\nincome tax returns,  26 U.S.C.   7206(2),  and several counts\r\n\nof mail fraud  based on  his alleged efforts  to conceal  his\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nemployment of Scopa from the latter's disability insurer.  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341.\r\n\n     After moving  unsuccessfully to dismiss  the indictment,\r\n\nGoldberg waived his  right to  a trial by  jury.   Goldberg's\r\n\ntrial  before the  district  judge took  eight  days, and  on\r\n\nSeptember 6,  1995, the court  announced its  findings.   The\r\n\ncourt  found Goldberg  guilty  of conspiring  to defraud  the\r\n\ngovernment and of aiding and assisting in  the preparation of\r\n\nfalse  tax  returns,  but acquitted  him  on  the  mail fraud\r\n\ncharges on the  ground that  his motive to  help defraud  the\r\n\ninsurer had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\n     At Goldberg's  sentencing in December 1995, the district\r\n\ncourt made guideline calculations  (described below) but then\r\n\ndeparted downward  two levels  and sentenced Goldberg  at the\r\n\nbottom of the range.   The result was a  ten-month sentence--\r\n\nfive  months to  be served  in prison  and five  in community\r\n\nconfinement--as well as three years of supervised release and\r\n\na  $20,000  fine.    Goldberg now  appeals,  challenging  his\r\n\nconvictions and sentence.\r\n\n     The most important and difficult issues on appeal relate\r\n\nto Goldberg's conviction for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.   371\r\n\nto defraud  the IRS.  This  type of conspiracy is  known as a\r\n\nKlein  conspiracy,  taking  its  name from  an  earlier  case\r                 \r\n\ninvolving a complex scheme designed to escape taxes.

There are  not  many\r\n\nfinancial   crimes  without   some  implications   for  false\r\n\nreporting in someone's tax filings, if not for  tax liability\r\n\nitself.     If   section  371   embraced  every   foreseeable\r\n\nconsequence  of  a conspiracy,  many  joint  financial crimes\r\n\nhaving no other federal nexus--and perhaps  many non-criminal\r\n\nacts as well--would automatically become federal conspiracies\r\n\nto defraud the IRS.\r\n\n     The \"purpose\" requirement, however,  is easier to  state\r\n\nthan  to apply.  The  laundering of drug  money, for example,\r\n\nnormally involves  the deliberate concealment of  the money's\r\n\norigin.   The  primary  purpose  is almost  always  to  avoid\r\n\ndetection of the underlying  crime; but can a jury  also find\r\n\nan  implied secondary  objective to  conceal income  from the\r\n\nIRS?  We have held, on specific facts, that a jury could draw\r\n\nsuch an inference and  also find a violation of  section 371.\r\n\nE.g., United States v.  Cambara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540782\"><a href=\"/opinion/540782/united-states-v-joaquin-cambara-united-states-of-america-v-jose-cambara/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1990); Tarvers, 833 F.2d at 1075-76.\r                          \r\n\n     Such cases  are the source of  Goldberg's first argument\r\n\non this issue.  He argues, inventively, that the conspirators\r\n\neither  must  have  as  their  primary  purpose  the  aim  of\r\n\nfrustrating  the IRS  or must  be agreeing  to  undertake the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nconduct  in question to conceal some other crime.

A conspiracy  can have\r\n\nmultiple objects, Ingram v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105936\"><a href=\"/opinion/105936/ingram-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 679-\r                                                     \r\n\n80 (1959), and any agreed-upon object can be a purpose of the\r\n\nconspiracy and  used to  define its character.   The  central\r\n\nproblem,  which  ought  not  be shirked,  is  to  distinguish\r\n\nrationally  between cases  where interfering  with government\r\n\nfunctions  is  a  purpose and  those  where  it  is merely  a\r                         \r\n\nforeseeable effect of joint action taken for other reasons.\r\n\n     This  effort poses  subtle  problems  in  discriminating\r\n\n\"purpose\" from \"knowledge\" and in separating the objects of a\r\n\nconspiracy from its more  remote consequences.  Volumes could\r\n\nbe written on these subjects but--for cases like ours--a more\r\n\ncompact  solution is  at  hand: where  the conspirators  have\r\n\neffectively agreed  to falsify  IRS documents to  misstate or\r\n\nmisattribute  income,  we  think  that  (depending  upon  the\r\n\ncircumstances) the factfinder may  infer a purpose to defraud\r\n\nthe government by interfering with IRS functions in the sense\r\n\nendorsed by the Supreme Court in Dennis.    \r                                                   \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     It may well be that the conspirators in this case had no\r\n\nsubjective desire--primary or secondary--to throw sand in the\r                                         \r\n\nwheels of the  IRS, let alone a subjective aim  to reduce tax\r\n\nliability.    Goldberg's argument  on  this  point, with  one\r\n\nqualification as  to the Clark conspiracy,  may be plausible.\r\n\nBut  filing a  number of  false tax  documents misattributing\r\n\nincome  can interfere  so  clearly and  proximately with  IRS\r\n\nfunctions--or at least a factfinder  could (but need not)  so\r\n\nfind--that  we see  no  sharp distinction  under section  371\r\n\nbetween a purpose  to file  such documents and  a purpose  to\r\n\ninterfere.\r\n\n     In permitting  a factfinder to equate  the two purposes,\r\n\nwe  leave untouched  the general  precept, namely,  that mere\r\n\ncollateral  effects of  jointly agreed-to  activity, even  if\r\n\ngenerally foreseeable, are not  mechanically to be treated as\r\n\nan object of  the conspiracy.  This would be a different case\r\n\nif, without  filing false tax documents,  Goldberg had agreed\r\n\nwith  his partners to pay Jones under the table, knowing that\r\n\nJones had no intention of reporting the money to the IRS.  If\r\n\nthe difference is in degree, then here the degree matters.\r\n\n     This  brings us  to the  evidentiary question  raised by\r\n\nGoldberg  which we  rephrase to  accord with  our just-stated\r\n\nview of  the law:  does  the evidence in this  case show that\r\n\nGoldberg and at least one other conspirator shared  a purpose\r\n\nto interfere with IRS functions by the filing of false income\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nreports  with the  IRS?   This  question  must be  asked  and\r\n\nanswered separately  as to  each conspiracy, as  Goldberg was\r\n\nconvicted of two separate  conspiracies under section 371 and\r\n\neach conviction involves a separate assessment.\r\n\n     In each conspiracy, the  illicit purpose that gives rise\r\n\nto  section 371  violation  must be  shared  by two  or  more\r\n\nconspirators.   Although the government's brief  stresses the\r\n\nevidence pertaining  to Goldberg's own role  and knowledge, a\r\n\nconspiracy to  defraud requires at  least two who  share that\r\n\naim. Innocent third parties  may be the unwitting instruments\r\n\nof a conspiracy.   But  when it comes  to characterizing  the\r\n\npurposes or objects of  the conspiracy, it is those  that are\r\n\nshared  by  at least  two  co-conspirators that  make  up the\r\n\nillegal agreement between them.   United States v. Krasovich,\r                                                                        \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488655\"><a href=\"/opinion/488655/united-states-v-george-krasovich/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (9th Cir. 1987).\r\n\n     Here, the  district court  found that  a purpose of  the\r\n\nconspirators, in  each conspiracy, was to  interfere with the\r\n\nIRS.   As  we have  said,  such a  purpose  can be  inferred,\r\n\ndepending  upon the facts, where  the very acts  agreed to by\r\n\nthe conspirators included the  filing of false income-related\r\n\ntax  documents.    This  purpose can  fairly  be  imputed  to\r\n\nGoldberg  who arranged  for the creation  of several  or more\r\n\nfalse  tax  documents  in  each scheme.    The  duration  and\r\n\ncomplexity of the schemes, and Goldberg's own sophistication,\r\n\nadd to the inference.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     There is no evidence  that Goldberg discussed the filing\r\n\nof false tax documents with other conspirators.  Yet we think\r\n\nthat such  conduct was an  integral and self-evident  part of\r\n\neach  conspiracy,  permitting the  inference  that other  co-\r\n\nconspirators  shared in  that purpose.   In  the case  of the\r\n\nScopa conspiracy,  false W-2s were  given to the  straws, who\r\n\nwere  participants in  the scheme,  over an  extended period.\r\n\nScopa himself signed a  tax return with his wife, who was one\r\n\nof the straws, that incorporated a false W-2.  \r\n\n     As  to the  Clark conspiracy,  Lango received  the false\r\n\nform 1099s, and he in turn  reported the false figures to the\r\n\nIRS.  Indeed, Lango asked that the amount be  divided so that\r\n\nit could be reported in two different years, testifying later\r\n\nthat Clark had  made the  suggestion.  This  indicates a  tax\r\n\nmotive  but, in addition, shows  that both men  knew that the\r\n\nfiling of false  tax documents  was an integral  part of  the\r\n\nscheme,  and both shared in  this purpose with  Goldberg.  In\r\n\nsum, the  evidence supports the  trial court's findings  of a\r\n\ncommon purpose to interfere with IRS functions.\r\n\n     In  addition to \"the danger [of injustice] inherent in a\r\n\ncriminal  conspiracy charge,\"  Dennis, 384  U.S. at  860, the\r                                                 \r\n\ndefraud clause  of section  371  has a  special capacity  for\r\n\nabuse because of the vagueness  of the concept of interfering\r\n\nwith  a proper government function.  For that reason, we have\r\n\nexamined with special  care both the concept and the evidence\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nin  this case.    But having  done so,  we conclude  that the\r\n\nconduct and purpose of the defendants, although markedly less\r\n\nsinister  than in  Klein,  could properly  be  found to  fall\r                                    \r\n\nwithin the outer bounds of section 371.\r\n\n     Goldberg next  challenges the admission at  trial of two\r\n\nout-of-court conversations between Lango  and Clark, in which\r\n\nthey  discussed  the  false   landscaping  invoices  and  the\r\n\nsolicitation  of  Goldberg's  participation  in  the  scheme.\r\n\nThese statements were admitted, over Goldberg's  objection at\r\n\ntrial, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), which provides\r\n\nthat \"a statement by  a co-conspirator of a party  during the\r\n\ncourse  and   in  furtherance  of  the   conspiracy\"  is  not\r\n\nconsidered hearsay.  \r\n\n     Goldberg does not dispute that  Lango and Clark made the\r\n\nchallenged  statements  during  and  in  furtherance  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy,  but  he  argues  that the  statements  were  not\r\n\nadmissible  against  him because  they  were  made before  he\r\n\njoined.
