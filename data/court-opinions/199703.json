Morris E. Lasker, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Saris,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Brian P. Carey, with whom Nicholas C. Theodorou, John A.\nShope, and Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP, were on brief, for\npetitioner, appellant.\n     James J. Arguin, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau, with whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on\nbrief, for respondent, appellee.\n\n\n\n\n    *Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f                             November    27, 2001\n\n     Per curiam.      Michael Morrissette appeals from the district\n\ncourt's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,\n\nclaiming that his 1991 state court conviction for second-degree\n\nmurder was tainted by the admission of trial evidence obtained\n\nin   violation   of    his    Fifth     Amendment   right   against   self-\n\nincrimination. Given the highly deferential standard applicable\n\nto review of state court judgments by federal courts under the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n\nsee 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), we affirm.\n\n     We state the facts briefly.            Petitioner was one of three\n\nyoung males charged in the stabbing death of a 73-year-old man\n\nin an alley in Lowell, Massachusetts, late on the night of\n\nSeptember 18, 1988. Two of the young men, including petitioner,\n\nwere charged as joint venturers, with only the third accused of\n\ndirectly committing the attack.              Trial evidence pointed to\n\npetitioner as owner of one of two knives used in the killing,\n\nand he was alleged to have encouraged the friend who initiated\n\nthe stabbing to \"finish off\" the seriously wounded victim to\n\nprevent identification.\n\n     Several hours after the crime, at about 3 a.m., petitioner\n\nwas stopped in the vicinity for questioning by police officers.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fHe was asked to remove a shoe for comparison with footprints\n\nfound at the murder scene and was told his print matched, an\n\nassertion   that     appears       to     have    been      an   intentional\n\nmisrepresentation.1   Petitioner agreed to accompany the officers\n\nto the police station.           He was given Miranda warnings and\n\neventually signed two statements admitting his presence at the\n\ncrime scene.   He also agreed to a blood test that showed traces\n\nof another individual's blood on his hand.                 Petitioner claims\n\nthese   statements    and       blood     test   results     were   obtained\n\ninvoluntarily and thus were admitted into evidence in violation\n\nof the Fifth Amendment. See Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503,\n\n513-14 (1963).\n\n    Petitioner     cites    a    number    of    factors    to   support   his\n\ncontention that the officers obtained the challenged evidence by\n\noverbearing his will, including his age (seventeen), his limited\n\neducation (ninth grade), the time of day (early hours of the\n\nmorning), his fatigue, his lack of contact with a lawyer or\n\nguardian, and the officers' intentional misstatement that they\n\nhad evidence placing him at the murder scene.                He asserts that\n\n\n\n    1 A police report detailed this exchange between petitioner\nand officers, but the officers involved testified at a\nsuppression hearing more than two years later that they did not\nrecall asking for the shoe or observing that it matched\nfootprints at the crime scene.    Testimony at trial indicated\nthat, in fact, no footprints had been found at the scene.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe totality of these circumstances compels the conclusion that\n\nhis cooperation with the officers was involuntary, requiring\n\nsuppression     of   the   inculpatory     evidence    resulting   from      the\n\ninterview.\n\n    Whether or not this would be a close case on direct review,\n\nit is far from that in its present posture.            To obtain a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus, petitioner must show both that the Commonwealth\n\ndenied his constitutional rights and that the Massachusetts\n\ncourts   made    a   determination    that    was     contrary   to,    or   an\n\nunreasonable application of, federal law in rejecting his claim.\n\nSee McCambridge v. Hall, 266 F.3d 12, 17 (lst Cir. 2001);\n\nHurtado v. Tucker, 245 F.3d 7, 16 (lst Cir. 2001); 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d)(1).2     A state court determination is unreasonable only\n\nif it is \"so offensive to existing precedent, so devoid of\n\nrecord support, or so arbitrary, as to indicate that it is\n\noutside the universe of plausible, credible outcomes.\"                 O'Brien\n\nv. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 25 (lst Cir. 1998); see also Williams v.\n\nMatesanz, 230 F.3d 421, 425 (lst Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n    2 Petitioner does not argue that the state court ruling was\n\"contrary to\" clearly established federal law or, under 28\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(2), that it was \"based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding.\" We therefore consider only whether\nthe decision represented an \"unreasonable application\" of\nclearly established federal law.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f      This is not such a case.      During his six hours of detention,\n\npetitioner was unrestrained, afforded access to a restroom, and\n\noffered coffee.       He was advised of his Miranda rights before\n\ngiving the statements or consenting to the blood test.             Although\n\nthe   hour    was   late,   the   trial    court   found   no   evidence   of\n\nweariness, and petitioner can point to no evidence in the record\n\nthat he was sleep-deprived.         He was stopped on the street, not\n\ntaken from his home.        Indeed, petitioner was alert enough, and\n\ncomfortable enough, to point out a typographical error in the\n\ntranscription of his first statement.          The officers' fabrication\n\nof evidence adverse to petitioner – the supposed footprints – is\n\ninsufficient in this context to render unreasonable the state\n\ncourts' conclusion that he acted voluntarily.                   There is no\n\nevidence of a causal connection between the deception and either\n\npetitioner's willingness to accompany the officers to the police\n\nstation or his later decision, after           Miranda warnings, to give\n\na statement and allow the blood test.               See United States v.\n\nByram, 145 F.3d 405, 408 (lst Cir. 1998) (\"trickery is not\n\nautomatically coercion\").\n\n      Petitioner maintains that the state trial court's decision\n\nwas unreasonable because the judge did not explicitly consider\n\nall of the relevant factors in a \"totality of the circumstances\"\n\nreview.      He points out, for example, that the judge's decision\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ffailed to address his age, lack of education, and the footprint\n\ndeception.   The district court, however, carefully reviewed each\n\nof the factors raised by petitioner in concluding that, even\n\n\"taken together,\" they do not permit a finding that the state\n\ncourt unreasonably applied federal law in rejecting petitioner's\n\nFifth Amendment claim.    Our own review leads us to the same\n\ndetermination.   Accordingly, the district court did not err in\n\ndenying the application for a writ.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
