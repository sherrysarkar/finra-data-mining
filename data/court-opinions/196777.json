See State\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The students  eventually testified for  the\r\n\nstate  at  the trial  of Smart,  who  was convicted  of first\r\n\ndegree  murder, conspiracy  to  murder and  tampering with  a\r\n\nwitness.  Id. at 1200, 1202.  For their roles  in the murder,\r                         \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nRandall  and  Flynn are  currently  serving  prison terms  of\r\n\nforty-years-to-life, and Lattime is  serving thirty-years-to-\r\n\nlife (each  with twelve years  deferred).  Cecelia  Pierce, a\r\n\nformer student  intern of  Smart's  who had  known about  the\r\n\nmurder plan  before it  was carried out,  eventually assisted\r\n\nthe authorities  in securing  information leading  to Smart's\r\n\narrest.   Id. at  1201-02.  Pierce  was not charged  with, or\r                         \r\n\nconvicted of, any crime related to the murder.1\r\n\n          In 1993, Lattime, Randall, Flynn and their parents,\r\n\nNaomi and Vance Lattime, Sr., Patricia and Frank Randall, and\r\n\nElaine  Flynn, filed a  lawsuit in New  Hampshire state court\r\n\nalleging  that   Winnacunnet  was  negligent  in  hiring  and\r\n\nsupervising   Smart.     They   claimed   that  Winnacunnet's\r\n\nnegligence  resulted  in  \"inappropriate   relationships  and\r\n\ndangerous effects\"  and caused  Smart to commit  various acts\r\n\nthat, in turn, led to:\r\n\n          injuries  including  but  not limited  to\r\n          emotional  distress,  mental instability,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  facts at  trial,  see Smart,  622  A.2d at  1200-02,\r                                                \r\nestablished that Smart  became involved sexually with  Flynn.\r\nDuring the affair, Smart  told Flynn that they would  have to\r\nkill her husband if their relationship was to continue.  They\r\nplanned  the murder in detail,  and Smart frequently spoke to\r\nPierce of the plans.  Flynn enlisted the help  of Randall and\r\nLattime after  his first  attempt at murdering  Gregory Smart\r\nfailed.  On the day of the murder, Flynn, Randall and Lattime\r\n(with  another boy)  drove to  Smart's empty  residence, and,\r\nwhile Lattime waited in the  car, Flynn and Randall ransacked\r\nthe  home to  create  the appearance  of  a burglary.    When\r\nGregory Smart returned home, Flynn and Randall forced  him to\r\nhis  knees, and  while Randall  held his  head down  at knife\r\npoint, Flynn shot him once in the head.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          physical  incarceration,  impairment   of\r\n          judgment, thereby causing them  to suffer\r\n          criminal responsibilities, incarceration,\r\n          irreparable harm through loss of liberty,\r\n          lost earnings, earning capacity,  loss of\r\n          education  by and  through [Winnacunnet],\r\n          financial  loss,  separation of  Students\r\n          from  their parents  and family,  loss of\r\n          consortium  by  the   parents,  loss   of\r\n          consortium  by the Students, etc.; all to\r\n          the damage of the plaintiffs.\r\n\n          In a  separate state  action, Pierce sued  SAU #21,\r\n\nthe entity  that oversees the operations  of Winnacunnet High\r\n\nSchool,2 alleging  that it was negligent  in hiring, training\r\n\nand  supervising  Smart.   Pierce  claimed  that the  alleged\r\n\nnegligence  caused  her \"loss  of  education,  loss of  past,\r\n\npresent and future earnings,  loss of reputation and standing\r\n\nin the  community, and  mental  anguish.\"3   Neither writ  of\r\n\nsummons4   in  the  underlying   state  actions  specifically\r\n\nmentioned the murder of Gregory Smart.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Interestingly, Pierce  named only SAU #21  as a defendant\r\nwhile  the  other  students  and  their  parents  named  only\r\nWinnacunnet.   Both  actions  allege,  inter alia,  negligent\r                                                             \r\nhiring/employment  although it  appears from the  record that\r\nSAU  #21 is  the entity that  hired Smart.   In  any case, no\r\nparty has raised  any issue in this regard to us, and because\r\nthe policies  issued  to  SAU  #21  list  Winnacunnet  as  an\r\nadditional insured, we treat the present coverage question as\r\nunaffected  by   the  difference  in   the  underlying  named\r\ndefendants.\r\n\n3.  At oral argument, the parties informed us that Pierce has\r\nreceived $9,000 in settlement of her claim.\r\n\n4.  In New  Hampshire,  a  writ  of summons  is  the  initial\r\npleading in a civil  action at law.  For  simplicity, we will\r\nrefer to this pleading as a \"writ.\"\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Winnacunnet   and   SAU  #21   (collectively,  \"the\r\n\nSchool\")  turned to  National Union  to defend  and indemnify\r\n\nthem in  the state actions under  consecutive \"School Leaders\r\n\nErrors and Omissions\" insurance policies, issued for one-year\r\n\nperiods  beginning November  17, 1990  and 1991.   Under  the\r\n\npolicies, National  Union was obligated to  defend any action\r\n\nand  pay damages resulting from  \"any Wrongful Act (as herein\r\n\ndefined)  of the  Insured or  of any  other person  for whose\r\n\nactions the  Insured is  legally responsible.\"   The policies\r\n\ndefined \"Wrongful Act\"  as \"any actual  or alleged breach  of\r\n\nduty,  neglect, error, misstatement,  misleading statement or\r\n\nomission committed solely in the performance of duties.\"\r\n\n          National  Union  declined   coverage,  citing   the\r\n\nfollowing policy exclusions:\r\n\n          This policy does not apply:\r\n\n          (a)  to  any claim involving  allegations\r\n          of fraud, dishonesty  or criminal acts or\r\n          omissions; however, the Insured  shall be\r\n          reimbursed  for  all amounts  which would\r\n          have been collectible  under this  policy\r\n          if such allegations are  not subsequently\r\n          proven;\r\n\n          (b)  to any  claims  arising  out of  (1)\r\n          false arrest,  detention or imprisonment;\r\n          (2)  libel,  slander  or   defamation  of\r\n          character;  (3)  assault or  battery; (4)\r\n          wrongful entry or  eviction, or  invasion\r\n          of any right of privacy;\r\n\n          (c) to  any claim  arising out  of bodily\r\n          injury to, or  sickness, disease or death\r\n          of   any   person,   or   damage   to  or\r\n          destruction  of  any property,  including\r\n          the loss of use thereof.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Upon  National  Union's  denial  of  coverage,  the\r\n\nSchool  petitioned  the  New  Hampshire  Superior  Court  for\r\n\nRockingham  County   for  a  declaratory   judgment  ordering\r\n\nNational  Union  to  defend   and  provide  coverage  in  the\r\n\nstudents'   and   parents'   (the  \"underlying   plaintiffs\")\r\n\nlawsuits.    National  Union  removed the  action,  based  on\r\n\ndiversity jurisdiction,  to the United States  District Court\r\n\nfor  the District  of New  Hampshire.   On cross  motions for\r\n\nsummary judgment,  the  district court  denied  the  School's\r\n\nmotions and granted National Union's motions, reasoning  that\r\n\npolicy  exclusions (b)  and (c)  barred coverage  because the\r\n\nunderlying claims  arose out of the  assault, battery, bodily\r\n\ninjury and death of Gregory Smart.  The court did not discuss\r\n\nthe applicability of exclusion (a).

Analysis\r                        \r\n\n           The School contends  that exclusions (b) and  (c),\r\n\nwhich preclude coverage for \"any claims arising out of  . . .\r\n\nassault  or battery\"  and  \"any claim  arising out  of bodily\r\n\ninjury to . . . or death of any person,\" do not apply because\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthe  underlying writs  alleged none  of these  excluded acts.\r\n\nMoreover, the School argues, the assault and death of Gregory\r\n\nSmart  need not be shown  to prove the  negligence claims and\r\n\nthus, they do not \"arise out of\" those acts.   National Union\r\n\nresponds  that  the  exclusions  apply  because  the  alleged\r\n\ninjuries,  which   constitute  a  critical  element   of  the\r\n\nnegligence  actions, are  entirely related  to the  murder of\r\n\nGregory Smart and its aftermath.5\r\n\n          New  Hampshire  courts  have   consistently  viewed\r\n\n\"arising out of\" as a \"`very broad, general and comprehensive\r\n\nterm .  . .  meaning originating  from or  growing out  of or\r\n\nflowing from.'\"   Merrimack Sch.

Whether or  not\r\n\nthat is true, however, does not resolve the dispositive issue\r\n\nin  this appeal:  whether  the underlying  plaintiffs' claims\r\n\n\"arise out of\" the murder of Gregory Smart.\r\n\n          An essential element of the negligence claim is the\r\n\nresulting  damage.  See Trudeau v.

Here, if  the underlying plaintiffs cannot prevail\r\n\non  their negligence claims without showing how the murder of\r\n\nGregory Smart  affected them,  then their claims  must \"arise\r\n\nout of\" the excluded acts of assault, battery, bodily  injury\r\n\nand death.\r\n\n          All of  the evidence in  the record  points to  the\r\n\nmurder and its aftermath as the  source of the injuries.  For\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nexample, Pierce  testified in her deposition  that the reason\r\n\nfor her  \"loss of education\" was that she missed many days of\r\n\nschool  because   she  had  to  testify   at  Smart's  trial,\r\n\neventually left  Winnacunnet during her junior  year, and had\r\n\ntrouble getting  into college  because she was  uncomfortable\r\n\nasking  Winnacunnet  for help  with  her  applications.   She\r\n\nstated that her  \"loss of earnings\"  resulted from having  to\r\n\nquit her job  in order  to testify and  assist in the  trial.\r\n\nShe  attributed her \"loss of reputation\" to the fact that she\r\n\nwas  recognizable  from  her  involvement in  the  trial  and\r\n\ncomplained  that she lost friends  as a result.   Pierce also\r\n\ntestified that her mental  anguish stemmed from the foregoing\r\n\nand acknowledged that if Gregory Smart had not been murdered,\r\n\nshe would not have sued.\r\n\n          During Randall's deposition,  he asserted, \"I'm not\r\n\nsuing  the school because I'm in jail,\" but also stated \"[i]f\r\n\nI never got caught for killing Greg Smart, I would have never\r\n\nbrought  a lawsuit.\"  He  agreed that his  involvement in the\r\n\nmurder and  subsequent incarceration were the  reasons why he\r\n\n(1) lost  his liberty  and employment opportunities,  (2) was\r\n\nunable  to finish  high school,  (3) was  separated from  his\r\n\nparents  and  fellow Winnacunnet  students, and  (4) suffered\r\n\nemotional pain.   While  he declared,  \"I still  suffered the\r\n\nharm  whether I  got caught or  whether I got  away with [the\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nmurder],\" that assertion  does not negate  the fact that  his\r\n\ninjuries derived from his involvement in the murder.\r\n\n          Flynn testified  that he believed  that because  of\r\n\nthe  School's negligence,  \"something happened that  may have\r\n\nbeen  averted,\"  and  acknowledged his  incarceration  is the\r\n\nreason why he suffers from being separated from  his parents.\r\n\nLattime acknowledged  that neither  he nor his  parents would\r\n\nhave brought the action  if he had not  been involved in  the\r\n\nmurder.\r\n\n          The  parents'  deposition testimony  on  this issue\r\n\nalso  reveals  that  the   injuries  were  related  to  their\r\n\nchildren's involvement in the  murder.  For example, Patricia\r\n\nRandall  testified that  she brought  the lawsuit  \"[b]ecause\r\n\nwhat happened  to my son  I don't  want to happen  to anybody\r\n\nelse\" and  acknowledged that \"what  happened\" to her  son was\r\n\nhis  incarceration for his involvement  in the murder.  Frank\r\n\nRandall  testified that  while he  thought Smart  should have\r\n\nbeen properly supervised, he  was also suing because his  son\r\n\nwas incarcerated.  Elaine Flynn testified that her reason for\r\n\nbringing the suit was her belief that the School's negligence\r\n\ncaused \"the  situation that occurred.\"   Naomi Lattime stated\r\n\nthat  \"had [the  School]  followed  up  or done  anything  to\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ninvestigate a faculty/student  relationship, .  . .  possibly\r\n\nthis never would have happened or gone as far as it did.\"7\r\n\n          While the School's alleged negligence in hiring and\r\n\nsupervising Smart could have caused the underlying plaintiffs\r\n\ninjuries  unrelated  to the  murder,  nothing  in the  record\r\n\nsupports the  existence of any  such injury.   The underlying\r\n\nplaintiffs' allocation  of blame  for their  suffering, while\r\n\nindicative of their belief that the School was at fault, does\r\n\nnot  obviate the  fact that  the record  evidence establishes\r\n\nthat  all of  the alleged  damages (e.g.,  harm from  loss of\r                                                    \r\n\nliberty,  lost education and earnings, separation of students\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Further  support  for  the  conclusion  that  the alleged\r\ndamages flow  entirely from the students'  involvement in the\r\nmurder is found in  the notice of claim sent  to Winnacunnet,\r\nwhich states in part:\r\n\n          [Winnacunnet's    negligence]    directly\r\n          resulted in the manipulative relationship\r\n          with   Pamela  Smart,   which  ultimately\r\n          caused  the  loss   of  liberty  to  [the\r\n          students].  Moreover, their  parents lost\r\n          any  rights  of  parental enjoyment  with\r\n          their sons, including  but not limited to\r\n          loss   of   parental   rights,  loss   of\r\n          consortium,  etc.    [Lattime's  parents]\r\n          were also required  to expend  exorbitant\r\n          funds,  in  excess   of  $70,000.00,   in\r\n          defense   of  criminal   charges  brought\r\n          against their son.   As a result of these\r\n          damages, the  Plaintiff[s] demand maximum\r\n          amount  of   monetary  damages  allowable\r\n          under  the  Statutes  and/or  the  policy\r\n          limits of  the  insurance of  the  School\r\n          insurance policy, whichever is greater.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nand parents) originate from, or \"arise  out of,\" the murder.8\r\n\nThe School has  failed to rebut, with evidence  sufficient to\r\n\nraise  a genuine  issue  of material  fact, National  Union's\r\n\nshowing   that  the   exclusive  source  of   the  underlying\r\n\nplaintiffs' injuries (and, therefore,  their claims) was  the\r\n\nmurder of  Gregory Smart and  its attendant excluded  acts of\r\n\nassault, battery, bodily injury and death.\r\n\n          The  facts of this case are not unlike those in All\r                                                                         \r\n\nAm.

We note  that the  district court carefully  reviewed the\r\nSchool's motions to  reconsider its summary judgment  ruling,\r\npermitting the  parties to supplement their  pleadings on the\r\nvery issue of the source of the claimed injuries.  The School\r\nfailed  then to  produce evidence  establishing any  issue of\r\nmaterial fact  on this question.   Finally, at  oral argument\r\nbefore this court, counsel for the School  stated that Pierce\r\n\"felt much anguish\" on the night of the murder, and thus, she\r\nsuffered  whether or  not  the murder  was  committed.   This\r\nassertion is too little to late.   Not only is it unsupported\r\nby any  record evidence,  the purported \"anguish\"  stems from\r\nthe murder  conspiracy and likely falls  within exclusion (a)\r\nwhich bars coverage for \"any claim involving allegations of .\r\n. . criminal acts.\"\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ndepends  not  only upon  a breach  of  duty, \"`but  also upon\r\n\ndamage or injury  suffered by the plaintiff as  a consequence\r\n\nof the  violation of duty.'\"   Id.

Thus,  the court found\r                      \r\n\nthat the general negligence  allegations in the complaint did\r\n\nnot compel  coverage because the claimed  injuries undeniably\r\n\nstemmed from the sexual assault.

These cases held that coverage\r\n\nwas barred  because the  excluded acts, assault  and battery,\r\n\nwere the immediate  cause of  the injury giving  rise to  the\r\n\naction.\r\n\n          The School  argues that these cases  are completely\r\n\ninapposite  because  (1) unlike  those cases,  the underlying\r\n\nplaintiffs here are not the ones who suffered the assault and\r\n\n(2) in any event, the writs do not allege a negligent failure\r\n\nto  prevent assault.   We  are not  persuaded.

See State v. Smart, 136 N.H. 639, 622 A.2d 1197, 1202 , cert. denied, 510 U.S. 917, 114 S.Ct. 309, 126 L.Ed.2d 256 (1993).  The students eventually testified for the state at the trial of Smart, who was convicted of first degree murder, conspiracy to murder and tampering with a witness.  Id. 622 A.2d at 1200, 1202.   For their roles in the murder, Randall and Flynn are currently serving prison terms of forty-years-to-life, and Lattime is serving thirty-years-to-life (each with twelve years deferred).  Cecelia Pierce, a former student intern of Smart's who had known about the murder plan before it was carried out, eventually assisted the authorities in securing information leading to Smart's arrest.  Id. 622 A.2d at 1201-02.   Pierce was not charged with, or convicted of, any crime related to the murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Lattime, Randall, Flynn and their parents, Naomi and Vance Lattime, Sr., Patricia and Frank Randall, and Elaine Flynn, filed a lawsuit in New Hampshire state court alleging that Winnacunnet was negligent in hiring and supervising Smart.  They claimed that Winnacunnet's negligence resulted in \"inappropriate relationships and dangerous effects\" and caused Smart to commit various acts that, in turn, led to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>injuries including but not limited to emotional distress, mental instability, physical incarceration, impairment of judgment, thereby causing them to suffer criminal responsibilities, incarceration, irreparable harm through loss of liberty, lost earnings, earning capacity, loss of education by and through [Winnacunnet], financial loss, separation of Students from their parents and family, loss of consortium by the parents, loss of consortium by the Students, etc.;   all to the damage of the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate state action, Pierce sued SAU # 21, the entity that oversees the operations of Winnacunnet High School,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> alleging that it was negligent in hiring, training and supervising Smart.  Pierce claimed that the alleged negligence caused her \"loss of education, loss of past, present and future earnings, loss of reputation and standing in the community, and mental anguish.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Neither writ of summons<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> in the underlying state actions specifically mentioned the murder of Gregory Smart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Winnacunnet and SAU # 21 (collectively, \"the School\") turned to National Union to defend and indemnify them in the state actions under consecutive \"School Leaders Errors and Omissions\" insurance policies, issued for one-year periods beginning November 17, 1990 and 1991.  Under the policies, National Union was obligated to defend any action and pay damages resulting from \"any Wrongful Act (as herein defined) of the Insured or of any other person for whose actions the Insured is legally responsible.\"   The policies defined \"Wrongful Act\" as \"any actual or alleged breach of duty, neglect, error, misstatement, misleading statement or omission committed solely in the performance of duties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Union declined coverage, citing the following policy exclusions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">This policy does not apply:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>(a) to any claim involving allegations of fraud, dishonesty or criminal acts or omissions;  however, the Insured shall be reimbursed for all amounts which would have been collectible under this policy if such allegations are not subsequently proven;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>(b) to any claims arising out of (1) false arrest, detention or imprisonment;  (2) libel, slander or defamation of character;  (3) assault or battery;  (4) wrongful entry or eviction, or invasion of any right of privacy;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>(c) to any claim arising out of bodily injury to, or sickness, disease or death of any person, or damage to or destruction of any property, including the loss of use thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon National Union's denial of coverage, the School petitioned the New Hampshire Superior Court for Rockingham County for a declaratory judgment ordering National Union to defend and provide coverage in the students' and parents' (the \"underlying plaintiffs\") lawsuits.  National Union removed the action, based on diversity jurisdiction, to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.  On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court denied the School's motions and granted National Union's motions, reasoning that policy exclusions (b) and (c) barred coverage because the underlying claims arose out of the assault, battery, bodily injury and death of Gregory Smart.  The court did not discuss the applicability of exclusion (a).  The School appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <p>A.

Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp., 63 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1113, 116 S.Ct. 914, 133 L.Ed.2d 845 (1996).  Summary judgment is warranted when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the summary judgment victor, National Union, bore the burden of proving lack of coverage.  See N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 491:22-a (providing that, in petitions to determine liability insurance coverage, the burden of proof is on the insurer).  Where, as here, \"the moving party will bear the burden of persuasion at trial, that party must support its motion with credible evidence--using any of the materials specified in Rule 56(c)--that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 331, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2557, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (Brennan, J., dissenting on other grounds).  In response, the non-moving party must either submit a supportable request for additional discovery time or \"produce evidentiary materials that demonstrate the existence of a 'genuine issue' for trial,\" id., and in so doing, that party \"may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleading.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School contends that exclusions (b) and (c), which preclude coverage for \"any claims arising out of ... assault or battery\" and \"any claim arising out of bodily injury to ... or death of any person,\" do not apply because the underlying writs alleged none of these excluded acts.  Moreover, the School argues, the assault and death of Gregory Smart need not be shown to prove the negligence claims and thus, they do not \"arise out of\" those acts.  National Union responds that the exclusions apply because the alleged injuries, which constitute a critical element of the negligence actions, are entirely related to the murder of Gregory Smart and its aftermath.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire courts have consistently viewed \"arising out of\" as a \" 'very broad, general and comprehensive term ... meaning originating from or growing out of or flowing from.' \"  Merrimack Sch. Dist. v. National Sch. Bus Serv., Inc., 140 N.H. 9, 661 A.2d 1197, 1199 (1995) (reading phrase broadly in context of indemnity agreement which is itself strictly construed) (quoting Carter v. Bergeron, 102 N.H. 464, 160 A.2d 348, 353 (1960) (internal alteration omitted) (construing insurance policy)).  Indeed, the concept embodied in the phrase \"arising out of\" appears to be something broader than the concept of proximate causation.  See Carter, 160 A.2d at 353 (observing that injuries need not have been \"directly and proximately caused by the use of the insured vehicle\" to be deemed to \"arise out of\" that use).  Here, if the underlying plaintiffs' negligence claims arise out of any of the excluded acts, National Union need not defend or indemnify the School against those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a duty to defend<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> may be found solely on the facts pleaded in the cause of action, a court may inquire into the underlying facts \"to avoid permitting the pleading strategies, whims, and vagaries of third party claimants to control the rights of parties to an insurance contract.\"  M. Mooney Corp. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 136 N.H. 463, 618 A.2d 793, 796-97 (1992);  see also Titan Holdings Syndicate, Inc. v. City of Keene, 898 F.2d 265, 271 (1st Cir.1990) (noting that a court must review the facts alleged in the underlying suit and that \"the legal nomenclature the plaintiff uses to frame the suit is relatively unimportant\") (discussing New Hampshire law).  We find it appropriate in this case to look beyond the conclusory pleadings to determine the applicability of the disputed exclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their depositions, all of the underlying plaintiffs state that the reason they brought the action was their belief that the school was negligent in hiring Smart and in supervising her activities with the students.  Thus, not surprisingly, and consistent with their writs, the underlying plaintiffs unanimously conclude that the School's alleged breach of duty caused their harm.  Whether or not that is true, however, does not resolve the dispositive issue in this appeal:  whether the underlying plaintiffs' claims \"arise out of\" the murder of Gregory Smart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An essential element of the negligence claim is the resulting damage.  See Trudeau v. Manchester Coal &amp; Ice Co., 89 N.H. 83, 192 A. 491, 492 (1937) (explaining that \"actual damage is an essential element\" of negligence actions that \"[are] brought not to vindicate a right but to recover compensation for negligently inflicted personal injuries\").  Thus, where the damages arise entirely out of excluded acts, the whole claim does as well.  Cf. All Am.  Ins. Co. v. Burns, 971 F.2d 438, 442 (10th Cir.1992) (concluding that alleged injuries in otherwise-covered negligence action triggered exclusions);  Continental Casualty Co. v. City of Richmond, 763 F.2d 1076, 1081 (9th Cir.1985) (finding no coverage where the plaintiffs would have no claim for relief against the insured if the alleged misconduct \"[had] not manifested itself in the injury\").  Here, if the underlying plaintiffs cannot prevail on their negligence claims without showing how the murder of Gregory Smart affected them, then their claims must \"arise out of\" the excluded acts of assault, battery, bodily injury and death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the evidence in the record points to the murder and its aftermath as the source of the injuries.  For example, Pierce testified in her deposition that the reason for her \"loss of education\" was that she missed many days of school because she had to testify at Smart's trial, eventually left Winnacunnet during her junior year, and had trouble getting into college because she was uncomfortable asking Winnacunnet for help with her applications.  She stated that her \"loss of earnings\" resulted from having to quit her job in order to testify and assist in the trial.  She attributed her \"loss of reputation\" to the fact that she was recognizable from her involvement in the trial and complained that she lost friends as a result.  Pierce also testified that her mental anguish stemmed from the foregoing and acknowledged that if Gregory Smart had not been murdered, she would not have sued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Randall's deposition, he asserted, \"I'm not suing the school because I'm in jail,\" but also stated \"[i]f I never got caught for killing Greg Smart, I would have never brought a lawsuit.\"   He agreed that his involvement in the murder and subsequent incarceration were the reasons why he (1) lost his liberty and employment opportunities, (2) was unable to finish high school, (3) was separated from his parents and fellow Winnacunnet students, and (4) suffered emotional pain.  While he declared, \"I still suffered the harm whether I got caught or whether I got away with [the murder],\" that assertion does not negate the fact that his injuries derived from his involvement in the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn testified that he believed that because of the School's negligence, \"something happened that may have been averted,\" and acknowledged his incarceration is the reason why he suffers from being separated from his parents.  Lattime acknowledged that neither he nor his parents would have brought the action if he had not been involved in the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parents' deposition testimony on this issue also reveals that the injuries were related to their children's involvement in the murder.  For example, Patricia Randall testified that she brought the lawsuit \"[b]ecause what happened to my son I don't want to happen to anybody else\" and acknowledged that \"what happened\" to her son was his incarceration for his involvement in the murder.  Frank Randall testified that while he thought Smart should have been properly supervised, he was also suing because his son was incarcerated.  Elaine Flynn testified that her reason for bringing the suit was her belief that the School's negligence caused \"the situation that occurred.\"   Naomi Lattime stated that \"had [the School] followed up or done anything to investigate a faculty/student relationship, ... possibly this never would have happened or gone as far as it did.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the School's alleged negligence in hiring and supervising Smart could have caused the underlying plaintiffs injuries unrelated to the murder, nothing in the record supports the existence of any such injury.  The underlying plaintiffs' allocation of blame for their suffering, while indicative of their belief that the School was at fault, does not obviate the fact that the record evidence establishes that all of the alleged damages (e.g., harm from loss of liberty, lost education and earnings, separation of students and parents) originate from, or \"arise out of,\" the murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The School has failed to rebut, with evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact, National Union's showing that the exclusive source of the underlying plaintiffs' injuries (and, therefore, their claims) was the murder of Gregory Smart and its attendant excluded acts of assault, battery, bodily injury and death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are not unlike those in All Am.  Ins. Co. v. Burns, 971 F.2d 438, 440 (10th Cir.1992), involving a church bus driver who was convicted of sexually assaulting two children whom he was transporting.  The victims sued the church and its board members alleging, inter alia, negligent hiring.  Id.  The board members turned to their insurer for defense and indemnification, but the court found applicable a policy exclusion for \"personal injury arising out of the willful violation of a penal statute.\"  Id. at 441.   The court explained that a negligence action depends not only upon a breach of duty, \" 'but also upon damage or injury suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the violation of duty.' \"  Id. (quoting 57A Am.Jur.2d Negligence &#167; 142, at 202-03 (1989)).  Thus, the court found that the general negligence allegations in the complaint did not compel coverage because the claimed injuries undeniably stemmed from the sexual assault.  Id. at 442.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of this case is consistent with cases in other jurisdictions, relied upon by the district court, recognizing that an exclusion for a claim arising out of an assault also bars coverage for a claim that an insured negligently allowed an assault to occur.  See, e.g., United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Entertainment Group, Inc., 945 F.2d 210, 213-14 (7th Cir.1991) (applying Illinois law);   Audubon Indem. Co. v. Patel, 811 F.Supp. 264, 265 (S.D.Tex.1993) (applying Texas law);  St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. 1401 Dixon's Inc., 582 F.Supp. 865, 867-68 (E.D.Pa.1984) (applying Pennsylvania law).  These cases held that coverage was barred because the excluded acts, assault and battery, were the immediate cause of the injury giving rise to the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School argues that these cases are completely inapposite because (1) unlike those cases, the underlying plaintiffs here are not the ones who suffered the assault and (2) in any event, the writs do not allege a negligent failure to prevent assault.  We are not persuaded.  The School's first \"distinction\" runs afoul of exclusion (c), which applies in the case of bodily injury or death of \"any person.\"   As to the second, from the evidence pertaining to the alleged damages here, it is as if the underlying plaintiffs, though styling their claims as negligent hiring/supervision, have alleged that the School negligently permitted an assault to occur.  Cf. United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. The Tunnel, Inc., 988 F.2d 351, 354 (2d Cir.1993) (denying coverage where \"plaintiff is seeking to recover by 'dressing up the substance' of one claim, here a battery, in the 'garments' of another, here negligence\").  Finally, it would make little sense to bar coverage for an action brought by the estate of Gregory Smart--the one who suffered the bodily injury and death--but find coverage for an action by those who actually inflicted the injury and who claim damages relating entirely to that event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While undoubtedly there are cases in which a negligent hiring or supervision claim does not seek compensation for damages arising entirely out of excluded acts, this is not one of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The facts at trial, see Smart, 622 A.2d at 1200-02, established that Smart became involved sexually with Flynn.  During the affair, Smart told Flynn that they would have to kill her husband if their relationship was to continue.

Moreover, the School argues, the assault and death of Gregory Smart need not be shown to prove the negligence claims and thus, they do not \"arise out of\" those acts.  National Union responds that the exclusions apply because the alleged injuries, which constitute a critical element of the negligence actions, are entirely related to the murder of Gregory Smart and its aftermath.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire courts have consistently viewed \"arising out of\" as a \" 'very broad, general and comprehensive term ... meaning originating from or growing out of or flowing from.' \"  Merrimack Sch.

She stated that her \"loss of earnings\" resulted from having to quit her job in order to testify and assist in the trial.  She attributed her \"loss of reputation\" to the fact that she was recognizable from her involvement in the trial and complained that she lost friends as a result.

While he declared, \"I still suffered the harm whether I got caught or whether I got away with [the murder],\" that assertion does not negate the fact that his injuries derived from his involvement in the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flynn testified that he believed that because of the School's negligence, \"something happened that may have been averted,\" and acknowledged his incarceration is the reason why he suffers from being separated from his parents.  Lattime acknowledged that neither he nor his parents would have brought the action if he had not been involved in the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parents' deposition testimony on this issue also reveals that the injuries were related to their children's involvement in the murder.  For example, Patricia Randall testified that she brought the lawsuit \"[b]ecause what happened to my son I don't want to happen to anybody else\" and acknowledged that \"what happened\" to her son was his incarceration for his involvement in the murder.  Frank Randall testified that while he thought Smart should have been properly supervised, he was also suing because his son was incarcerated.  Elaine Flynn testified that her reason for bringing the suit was her belief that the School's negligence caused \"the situation that occurred.\"   Naomi Lattime stated that \"had [the School] followed up or done anything to investigate a faculty/student relationship, ... possibly this never would have happened or gone as far as it did.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the School's alleged negligence in hiring and supervising Smart could have caused the underlying plaintiffs injuries unrelated to the murder, nothing in the record supports the existence of any such injury.  The underlying plaintiffs' allocation of blame for their suffering, while indicative of their belief that the School was at fault, does not obviate the fact that the record evidence establishes that all of the alleged damages (e.g., harm from loss of liberty, lost education and earnings, separation of students and parents) originate from, or \"arise out of,\" the murder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The School has failed to rebut, with evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact, National Union's showing that the exclusive source of the underlying plaintiffs' injuries (and, therefore, their claims) was the murder of Gregory Smart and its attendant excluded acts of assault, battery, bodily injury and death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are not unlike those in All Am.  Ins. Co. v. Burns, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587718\"><a href=\"/opinion/587718/all-american-insurance-co-v-david-l-burns-james-o-wilde-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 440 (10th Cir.1992), involving a church bus driver who was convicted of sexually assaulting two children whom he was transporting.  The victims sued the church and its board members alleging, inter alia, negligent hiring.  Id.  The board members turned to their insurer for defense and indemnification, but the court found applicable a policy exclusion for \"personal injury arising out of the willful violation of a penal statute.\"  Id. at 441.   The court explained that a negligence action depends not only upon a breach of duty, \" 'but also upon damage or injury suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the violation of duty.' \"  Id. (quoting 57A Am.Jur.2d Negligence &#167; 142, at 202-03 (1989)).  Thus, the court found that the general negligence allegations in the complaint did not compel coverage because the claimed injuries undeniably stemmed from the sexual assault.  Id. at 442.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of this case is consistent with cases in other jurisdictions, relied upon by the district court, recognizing that an exclusion for a claim arising out of an assault also bars coverage for a claim that an insured negligently allowed an assault to occur.  See, e.g., United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Entertainment Group, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568582\"><a href=\"/opinion/568582/united-national-insurance-company-v-entertainment-group-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 213-14 (7th Cir.1991) (applying Illinois law);   Audubon Indem. Co. v. Patel, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span>, 265 (S.D.Tex.1993) (applying Texas law);  St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. 1401 Dixon's Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1760497\"><a href=\"/opinion/1760497/st-paul-surplus-lines-ins-co-v-1401-dixons/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>, 867-68 (E.D.Pa.1984) (applying Pennsylvania law).  These cases held that coverage was barred because the excluded acts, assault and battery, were the immediate cause of the injury giving rise to the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School argues that these cases are completely inapposite because (1) unlike those cases, the underlying plaintiffs here are not the ones who suffered the assault and (2) in any event, the writs do not allege a negligent failure to prevent assault.  We are not persuaded.  The School's first \"distinction\" runs afoul of exclusion (c), which applies in the case of bodily injury or death of \"any person.\"   As to the second, from the evidence pertaining to the alleged damages here, it is as if the underlying plaintiffs, though styling their claims as negligent hiring/supervision, have alleged that the School negligently permitted an assault to occur.  Cf. United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. The Tunnel, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602359\"><a href=\"/opinion/602359/united-national-ins-co-v-the-tunnel-inc-v-jeffrey-bernstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 354 (2d Cir.1993) (denying coverage where \"plaintiff is seeking to recover by 'dressing up the substance' of one claim, here a battery, in the 'garments' of another, here negligence\").  Finally, it would make little sense to bar coverage for an action brought by the estate of Gregory Smart--the one who suffered the bodily injury and death--but find coverage for an action by those who actually inflicted the injury and who claim damages relating entirely to that event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While undoubtedly there are cases in which a negligent hiring or supervision claim does not seek compensation for damages arising entirely out of excluded acts, this is not one of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The facts at trial, see Smart, 622 A.2d at 1200-02, established that Smart became involved sexually with Flynn.  During the affair, Smart told Flynn that they would have to kill her husband if their relationship was to continue.  They planned the murder in detail, and Smart frequently spoke to Pierce of the plans.  Flynn enlisted the help of Randall and Lattime after his first attempt at murdering Gregory Smart failed.  On the day of the murder, Flynn, Randall and Lattime (with another boy) drove to Smart's empty residence, and, while Lattime waited in the car, Flynn and Randall ransacked the home to create the appearance of a burglary.  When Gregory Smart returned home, Flynn and Randall forced him to his knees, and while Randall held his head down at knife point, Flynn shot him once in the head</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Interestingly, Pierce named only SAU # 21 as a defendant while the other students and their parents named only Winnacunnet.  Both actions allege, inter alia, negligent hiring/employment although it appears from the record that SAU # 21 is the entity that hired Smart.  In any case, no party has raised any issue in this regard to us, and because the policies issued to SAU # 21 list Winnacunnet as an additional insured, we treat the present coverage question as unaffected by the difference in the underlying named defendants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, the parties informed us that Pierce has received $9,000 in settlement of her claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In New Hampshire, a writ of summons is the initial pleading in a civil action at law.

Moreover, their parents lost any rights of parental enjoyment with their sons, including but not limited to loss of parental rights, loss of consortium, etc.  [Lattime's parents] were also required to expend exorbitant funds, in excess of $70,000.00, in defense of criminal charges brought against their son.  As a result of these damages, the Plaintiff[s] demand maximum amount of monetary damages allowable under the Statutes and/or the policy limits of the insurance of the School insurance policy, whichever is greater.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We note that the district court carefully reviewed the School's motions to reconsider its summary judgment ruling, permitting the parties to supplement their pleadings on the very issue of the source of the claimed injuries.  The School failed then to produce evidence establishing any issue of material fact on this question.  Finally, at oral argument before this court, counsel for the School stated that Pierce \"felt much anguish\" on the night of the murder, and thus, she suffered whether or not the murder was committed.  This assertion is too little to late.  Not only is it unsupported by any record evidence, the purported \"anguish\" stems from the murder conspiracy and likely falls within exclusion (a) which bars coverage for \"any claim involving allegations of ... criminal acts.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The School relies on Durham City Bd. of Educ. v.

In that case, a student who allegedly had been raped by a school coach sued the school board for, inter alia, negligent hiring and supervision.  Id. 426 S.E.2d at 454.   In a brief and conclusory analysis, the court found that the exclusions did not bar the duty to defend because the allegations were for \"money damages suffered as a result of ... negligent supervision\" and did not include the rape as a \"necessary feature.\"  Id. 426 S.E.2d at 456, 457</p>\n        <p>We find this perfunctory treatment unpersuasive.
