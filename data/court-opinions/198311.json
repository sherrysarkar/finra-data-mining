Ruiz-Santiago, Assistant United\r\nStates Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n              February 3, 1999\r\n                                           HALL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendants Jos Miguel\r\nMateo-Snchez (\"Mateo\"), Santos de Aza-Pez (\"de Aza\"), Rafael\r\nPrez-Cabrera (\"Prez\"), Carlos Julio Cipriano (\"Cipriano\"), and\r\nVictor Hernndez-Canario (\"Hernndez\") appeal their convictions and\r\nsentences for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 380\r\nkilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1) and\r\n846.  The district court sentenced Mateo, de Aza, Cipriano, and\r\nHernndez to 292 months in prison, and sentenced Prez to 151\r\nmonths in prison.  We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291 and\r\n18 U.S.C.  3742(a), and we affirm.\r\n                   FACTS\r\nActing on a tip from an informant that drugs were to be\r\nsmuggled into the Los Colchos area on the night of May 2, 1996, a\r\njoint task force of U.S. Customs agents and Puerto Rico police\r\nofficers set up surveillance of the area.  Los Colchos is a heavily\r\nwooded and uninhabited coastal area that borders a naval base.  The\r\narea can be accessed only by a small dirt road (\"Los Colchos Road\")\r\nthat connects to a major road (\"Road #3\").  During a perimeter\r\ninspection of the area, agents found a black Mazda pickup truck\r\nhidden by bushes that fit the description of the truck that the\r\ninformant had claimed would be used in the smuggling operation.  In\r\naddition, while driving along Los Colchos Road towards Road #3,\r\nagents and officers passed within inches of a three-car caravan. \r\nThe officers saw a green station wagon with one occupant, followed\r\nby a red Mazda pickup truck with two occupants and a gray Dodge\r\npickup truck with two occupants.  The officers left the scene to\r\nmeet with other agents, and then returned to Los Colchos Road,\r\nwhere they positioned themselves in a wooded area approximately 150\r\nfeet from a gate (\"Algodones gate\"), which blocks vehicular access\r\nto a dirt road that leads from Los Colchos Road to Algodones beach.\r\nAt approximately 10:30 p.m., with a bright moon in the\r\nsky, agents heard the sound of a motor boat approaching, and\r\nobserved the black Mazda pickup previously seen parked in the\r\nbushes, and the green station wagon and the red Mazda pickup that\r\nhad been part of the caravan, drive down Los Colchos Road and stop\r\nat the Algodones gate.  The agents watched as five individuals got\r\nout of the vehicles and met together for several minutes.  The\r\nagents were unable to see the individuals' faces or to hear what\r\nthey said.\r\nTwo of the individuals got into the black Mazda and drove\r\nup Los Colchos Road towards Road #3.  The agents radioed ahead to\r\nother agents, who were positioned at the entrance to Los Colchos\r\nRoad, and requested them to detain the black Mazda.  As the black\r\nMazda approached the agents, the passenger, Cipriano, threw a\r\ncellular telephone out the window.  Agents detained both Cipriano\r\nand the driver, Hernndez.  A second cell phone was found next to\r\nHernndez.  Cipriano was wearing black clothing.\r\nAbout five to ten minutes later, the agents at Algodones\r\ngate observed one of the remaining three individuals get into the\r\ngreen station wagon and drive towards Road #3.  Agents radioed\r\nahead, and the green station wagon was also stopped.  The agents\r\ndetained the driver, Mateo, and found a third cell phone in the\r\npickup.  Mateo was wearing black clothing.\r\nAt the same time that the individual got into the green\r\nstation wagon, the other two remaining individuals started walking\r\ndown the dirt road towards Algodones beach.  Shortly thereafter,\r\nagents observed five or six individuals walk up the trail to\r\nAlgodones gate while carrying packs on their shoulders.  These\r\nindividuals placed the packs between some bushes, and walked back\r\ntowards Algodones beach.  These individuals were not seen again.  \r\nA short time later, agents observed the two individuals\r\nwho had been seen meeting at Algodones gate walk up the trail to\r\nAlgodones gate while carrying packs on their shoulders.  The\r\nindividuals placed their packs in the bushes with the other packs,\r\ngot into the red Mazda pickup, and drove up Los Colchos Road\r\ntowards Road #3.  The agents again radioed ahead, and agents\r\nstopped the red Mazda as it approached Road #3.  The agents\r\ndetained the driver, Cabrera, and the passenger, de Aza.  Cabrera\r\nand de Aza were both wearing black clothing that was wet and\r\ncovered with sand.  It did not rain that night.\r\nThe agents waited a while longer, and then investigated\r\nthe scene.  The agents seized a total of eight packs from the\r\nbushes, six large sacks and two smaller ones.  The sacks weighed\r\napproximately 380 kilograms, and their contents tested positive for\r\ncocaine.  In addition, the agents found an assault rifle with the\r\nsacks.  Nearby, the agents also found the grey Dodge pickup truck\r\nthat was seen in the first three-vehicle caravan.  Inside the\r\npickup, the agents found ammunition, a knitted black cap, and a\r\nblack T-shirt.\r\nCipriano, Hernndez, Mateo, Prez, and de Aza were\r\nindicted on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to\r\ndistribute approximately 380 kilograms of cocaine.  All five\r\ndefendants pled not guilty.  At the close of the government's case,\r\nthe district court denied all five defendants' Rule 29 motions for\r\njudgment of acquittal.  The defendants did not testify at trial,\r\nand all five defendants were convicted.  Cipriano, Hernndez,\r\nMateo, and de Aza were sentenced to 292 months in prison.  Prez\r\nwas sentenced to 151 months in prison.\r\n                 DISCUSSION\r\n                     I\r\nHernndez and Cipriano contend that the police lacked\r\nprobable cause to arrest them.  However, both Hernndez and\r\nCipriano failed to make a pretrial challenge to the indictment, and\r\nhave therefore failed to preserve this issue for review on appeal. \r\nUnited States v. Latorre, 922 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1990), cert.\r\ndenied, 502 U.S. 876 (1991).\r\n                     II\r\nAll five defendants contend that the district court erred\r\nby denying their Rule 29 motions for judgment as a matter of law\r\nbecause there was insufficient evidence to support their\r\nconvictions.  The defendants argue that the evidence established\r\ntheir mere presence at the scene without establishing their actual\r\nparticipation in the conspiracy.  We will reverse the district\r\ncourt's denial of the defendants' Rule 29 motions only if, viewing\r\nthe entirety of the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\ngovernment and drawing all legitimate inferences from that\r\nevidence, no rational trier of fact could have found the defendants\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Reed, 977\r\nF.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).  The district court did not err.\r\nThe government introduced evidence that showed that the\r\nfive defendants passed within inches of agents as they drove in a\r\ncaravan down a dirt road to an isolated beach.  The defendants then\r\nmet with each other late at night, in a deserted and heavily wooded\r\narea that had limited access, as a motor boat approached at the\r\ntime and place where an informer had told police drugs would be\r\nsmuggled, and where in fact approximately 380 kilograms of cocaine\r\nwas offloaded.  The defendants were wearing dark clothing, carrying\r\ncell phones, and driving pick up trucks and a station wagon to help\r\ntransport the large quantity of cocaine.  Prez and de Aza were\r\nseen carrying the packs that contained cocaine.  An assault weapon\r\nwas found with the cocaine, and one of the trucks driven into the\r\narea contained a bag with ammunition.  The defendants offered no\r\nplausible explanation for their presence in this area so late at\r\nnight.  The evidence therefore supported the jury's verdict for\r\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute approximately 380\r\nkilograms of cocaine.  See United States v. Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d\r\n986, 999 (1st Cir. 1995) (circumstances in which presence implies\r\nparticipation); United States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 213 (1st\r\nCir. 1992) (jurors allowed to use common sense and draw reasonable\r\ninferences based on \"natural inclinations of human beings\"); United\r\nStates v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992) (inference that\r\ncriminals rarely invite innocent persons to witness crimes), cert.\r\ndenied, 506 U.S. 1063 (1993).\r\n                    III\r\nHernndez and Cipriano contend that the district court\r\nerred by attributing to them at sentencing an improper amount of\r\ncocaine because there was no evidence to demonstrate that such a\r\nlarge amount of cocaine was foreseeable.  We will reverse the\r\ndistrict court's quantity determination only if it was clearly\r\nerroneous.  See United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 524\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  The district court did not err.\r\nIt was proper to attribute to Hernndez and Cipriano all\r\nreasonably foreseeable quantities of cocaine that were within the\r\nscope of the conspiracy.  See id.  Hernndez and Cipriano were\r\npresent at the smuggling location with three other coconspirators\r\nwhere they were to meet a boatload of smugglers, suggesting a\r\nlarge-scale operation.  The conspirators used three pick up trucks\r\nand a station wagon, suggesting that a large quantity of drugs\r\nwould need to be transported.  An assault weapon was found with the\r\ncocaine, suggesting that the amount of drugs would be worth\r\nprotecting.  The district court's finding that Hernndez and\r\nCipriano were liable for the full amount of cocaine was therefore\r\nnot clearly erroneous.\r\n\n                     IV\r\nHernndez, Cipriano, Prez, and de Aza contend that the \r\ndistrict court erred by denying their requests for a two-level\r\ndownward departure for their roles as minor participants under\r\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.2.  We will reverse the district court's denial of\r\na request for a minimal participant downward departure only if its\r\nfinding that the defendants were not minor participants was clearly\r\nerroneous.  See United States v. Gonzlez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64, 73\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  The defendants had the burden to prove their\r\nentitlement to a minor participant downward departure.  See id. \r\nThe district court did not clearly err because the defendants\r\nfailed to satisfy their burden.  See United States v. Coneo-\r\nGuerrero, 148 F.3d 44, 50 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming district\r\ncourt's denial of minor participant departure to defendants who\r\nclaimed status as transporters of cocaine with less responsibility\r\nthan deceased boat captain).\r\nIn addition, Prez argues that the district court\r\ndeprived him of his due process right to be sentenced on the basis\r\nof substantially correct information because the court limited its\r\nconsideration of the participants in the conspiracy to his\r\ncodefendants.  This argument is without merit because the district\r\ncourt specifically considered individuals implicated in the\r\nconspiracy other than Prez's codefendants.  After considering the\r\nevidence that Prez wished the district court to consider, the\r\ndistrict court concluded that the evidence fell far short of\r\nconvincing the court that Prez's role in the offense was minor. \r\nThe district court therefore did not deprive Prez of his due\r\nprocess rights.\r\n                     V\r\nAll five defendants contend that the district court erred\r\nby enhancing their sentences under U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1) for\r\npossession of a weapon in connection with the conspiracy.  We\r\nreview the factual findings underlying the district court's\r\ndangerous weapon enhancement for clear error.  United States v. Lagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1996).  The district court did\r\nnot err.\r\nAmmunition was found in one of the pickup trucks that was\r\ninitially driven down the Los Colchos Road.  The presence of\r\nammunition in that truck suggests that the weapon was possessed by\r\nthe coconspirators well before the boat was offloaded.  In\r\naddition, Prez and de Aza were seen placing sacks of cocaine where\r\nthe gun was found.  From this location, the weapon was readily\r\navailable to protect both the conspirators and the drugs.  Once the\r\ngovernment demonstrated that the weapon was \"readily available to\r\nprotect either the participants themselves during the commission of\r\nthe illegal activity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug\r\nbusiness,\" the burden shifted to the defendants to persuade the\r\ncourt \"that a connection between the weapon and the crime [wa]s\r\nclearly improbable.\"  See United States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 10\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (government's burden satisfied by showing gun found\r\nin bathroom of defendant's house that was command post for drug-\r\ntrafficking activities).  The defendants, however, failed to\r\nsatisfy their burden of demonstrating that the connection between\r\nthe weapon and the conspiracy was clearly improbable.  See id.(defendant failed to satisfy burden by failing to provide\r\nevidentiary support for denial of knowledge of weapon or to suggest\r\nexplanation for presence of gun).  Therefore, the district court\r\ndid not err by enhancing the defendants' sentences under U.S.S.G.\r\n2D1.1.\r\n                     VI\r\nPrez and de Aza contend that they were deprived of their\r\nright to a fair trial because the district court failed to strike\r\nas irrelevant and prejudicial references made at the trial to the\r\nassault weapon and ammunition found at the scene.  Although Prez\r\nwaived this argument by failing to object when the government\r\noffered the gun into evidence, see United States v. Taylor, 54\r\nF.3d 967, 972-73 (1st Cir. 1995), we will give him the benefit of\r\nthe doubt and address the merits of his claim.\r\nPrez and de Aza argue that the weapon was irrelevant\r\nbecause the government failed to introduce evidence linking them to\r\nthe weapon.  However, as discussed above, ammunition found in one\r\nof the trucks suggests that the weapon was available to the\r\nconspirators well before the boat was offloaded.  In addition, de\r\nAza was seen placing a sack of cocaine with other sacks of cocaine\r\nwhere the weapon was found.  Consequently, the government did\r\nprovide evidence connecting Prez and de Aza to the weapon.\r\nPrez and de Aza argue that, although the weapon was\r\nmentioned in the indictment, the weapon was not relevant to any\r\nelement of the offense charged.  We disagree.  The assault weapon\r\nwas relevant because it was one of the means by which the\r\ndefendants protected themselves and the cocaine conspiracy.  SeeUnited States v. Cresta, 825 F.2d 538, 554 (1st Cir. 1987), cert.\r\ndenied sub nom., Impemba v. United States, 486 U.S. 1042 (1988).\r\nPrez and de Aza also argue that the weapon was\r\nprejudicial to their defense because it presented a clear danger of\r\noverwhelming the evidence.  Although evidence unfavorable to the\r\ndefense is always to some extent prejudicial, the weapon was not\r\nimpermissibly prejudicial.  Cf. id.  In addition, the admission of\r\nthe weapon could not have overwhelmed the 380 kilograms of cocaine\r\nunloaded in furtherance of the conspiracy.\r\n                    VII\r\nMateo contends that the district court erred by allowing\r\nthe government to comment on his silence at trial.  Specifically,\r\nMateo argues that when the prosecutor framed arguments to the jury\r\nin the form of, \"Ask yourselves\" what the defendants were doing in\r\nthe Los Colchos area on the night in question, the prosecutor was\r\nin fact commenting on the fact that Mateo had not testified at\r\ntrial.  We disagree.  The prosecutor's statements cannot be\r\nconstrued as a comment on Mateo's silence.  See United States v.  \r\nLavoie, 721 F.2d 407, 408 (1st Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S.\r\n1069 (1984).  Therefore, there was no error.\r\n                 CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court.\r\nAFFIRMED.\n",

Defendants Jos Miguel\r\nMateo-Snchez (\"Mateo\"), Santos de Aza-Pez (\"de Aza\"), Rafael\r\nPrez-Cabrera (\"Prez\"), Carlos Julio Cipriano (\"Cipriano\"), and\r\nVictor Hernndez-Canario (\"Hernndez\") appeal their convictions and\r\nsentences for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 380\r\nkilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1) and\r\n846.  The district court sentenced Mateo, de Aza, Cipriano, and\r\nHernndez to 292 months in prison, and sentenced Prez to 151\r\nmonths in prison.  We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291 and\r\n18 U.S.C.  3742(a), and we affirm.\r\n                   FACTS\r\nActing on a tip from an informant that drugs were to be\r\nsmuggled into the Los Colchos area on the night of May 2, 1996, a\r\njoint task force of U.S. Customs agents and Puerto Rico police\r\nofficers set up surveillance of the area.  Los Colchos is a heavily\r\nwooded and uninhabited coastal area that borders a naval base.  The\r\narea can be accessed only by a small dirt road (\"Los Colchos Road\")\r\nthat connects to a major road (\"Road #3\").  During a perimeter\r\ninspection of the area, agents found a black Mazda pickup truck\r\nhidden by bushes that fit the description of the truck that the\r\ninformant had claimed would be used in the smuggling operation.  In\r\naddition, while driving along Los Colchos Road towards Road #3,\r\nagents and officers passed within inches of a three-car caravan. \r\nThe officers saw a green station wagon with one occupant, followed\r\nby a red Mazda pickup truck with two occupants and a gray Dodge\r\npickup truck with two occupants.  The officers left the scene to\r\nmeet with other agents, and then returned to Los Colchos Road,\r\nwhere they positioned themselves in a wooded area approximately 150\r\nfeet from a gate (\"Algodones gate\"), which blocks vehicular access\r\nto a dirt road that leads from Los Colchos Road to Algodones beach.\r\nAt approximately 10:30 p.m., with a bright moon in the\r\nsky, agents heard the sound of a motor boat approaching, and\r\nobserved the black Mazda pickup previously seen parked in the\r\nbushes, and the green station wagon and the red Mazda pickup that\r\nhad been part of the caravan, drive down Los Colchos Road and stop\r\nat the Algodones gate.  The agents watched as five individuals got\r\nout of the vehicles and met together for several minutes.  The\r\nagents were unable to see the individuals' faces or to hear what\r\nthey said.\r\nTwo of the individuals got into the black Mazda and drove\r\nup Los Colchos Road towards Road #3.  The agents radioed ahead to\r\nother agents, who were positioned at the entrance to Los Colchos\r\nRoad, and requested them to detain the black Mazda.  As the black\r\nMazda approached the agents, the passenger, Cipriano, threw a\r\ncellular telephone out the window.  Agents detained both Cipriano\r\nand the driver, Hernndez.  A second cell phone was found next to\r\nHernndez.  Cipriano was wearing black clothing.\r\nAbout five to ten minutes later, the agents at Algodones\r\ngate observed one of the remaining three individuals get into the\r\ngreen station wagon and drive towards Road #3.  Agents radioed\r\nahead, and the green station wagon was also stopped.  The agents\r\ndetained the driver, Mateo, and found a third cell phone in the\r\npickup.  Mateo was wearing black clothing.\r\nAt the same time that the individual got into the green\r\nstation wagon, the other two remaining individuals started walking\r\ndown the dirt road towards Algodones beach.  Shortly thereafter,\r\nagents observed five or six individuals walk up the trail to\r\nAlgodones gate while carrying packs on their shoulders.  These\r\nindividuals placed the packs between some bushes, and walked back\r\ntowards Algodones beach.  These individuals were not seen again.  \r\nA short time later, agents observed the two individuals\r\nwho had been seen meeting at Algodones gate walk up the trail to\r\nAlgodones gate while carrying packs on their shoulders.  The\r\nindividuals placed their packs in the bushes with the other packs,\r\ngot into the red Mazda pickup, and drove up Los Colchos Road\r\ntowards Road #3.  The agents again radioed ahead, and agents\r\nstopped the red Mazda as it approached Road #3.  The agents\r\ndetained the driver, Cabrera, and the passenger, de Aza.  Cabrera\r\nand de Aza were both wearing black clothing that was wet and\r\ncovered with sand.  It did not rain that night.\r\nThe agents waited a while longer, and then investigated\r\nthe scene.  The agents seized a total of eight packs from the\r\nbushes, six large sacks and two smaller ones.  The sacks weighed\r\napproximately 380 kilograms, and their contents tested positive for\r\ncocaine.  In addition, the agents found an assault rifle with the\r\nsacks.  Nearby, the agents also found the grey Dodge pickup truck\r\nthat was seen in the first three-vehicle caravan.  Inside the\r\npickup, the agents found ammunition, a knitted black cap, and a\r\nblack T-shirt.\r\nCipriano, Hernndez, Mateo, Prez, and de Aza were\r\nindicted on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to\r\ndistribute approximately 380 kilograms of cocaine.  All five\r\ndefendants pled not guilty.  At the close of the government's case,\r\nthe district court denied all five defendants' Rule 29 motions for\r\njudgment of acquittal.  The defendants did not testify at trial,\r\nand all five defendants were convicted.  Cipriano, Hernndez,\r\nMateo, and de Aza were sentenced to 292 months in prison.  Prez\r\nwas sentenced to 151 months in prison.\r\n                 DISCUSSION\r\n                     I\r\nHernndez and Cipriano contend that the police lacked\r\nprobable cause to arrest them.  However, both Hernndez and\r\nCipriano failed to make a pretrial challenge to the indictment, and\r\nhave therefore failed to preserve this issue for review on appeal. \r\nUnited States v.

The defendants argue that the evidence established\r\ntheir mere presence at the scene without establishing their actual\r\nparticipation in the conspiracy.  We will reverse the district\r\ncourt's denial of the defendants' Rule 29 motions only if, viewing\r\nthe entirety of the evidence in the light most favorable to the\r\ngovernment and drawing all legitimate inferences from that\r\nevidence, no rational trier of fact could have found the defendants\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592213\"><a href=\"/opinion/592213/united-states-v-daniel-l-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).  The district court did not err.\r\nThe government introduced evidence that showed that the\r\nfive defendants passed within inches of agents as they drove in a\r\ncaravan down a dirt road to an isolated beach.  The defendants then\r\nmet with each other late at night, in a deserted and heavily wooded\r\narea that had limited access, as a motor boat approached at the\r\ntime and place where an informer had told police drugs would be\r\nsmuggled, and where in fact approximately 380 kilograms of cocaine\r\nwas offloaded.  The defendants were wearing dark clothing, carrying\r\ncell phones, and driving pick up trucks and a station wagon to help\r\ntransport the large quantity of cocaine.  Prez and de Aza were\r\nseen carrying the packs that contained cocaine.  An assault weapon\r\nwas found with the cocaine, and one of the trucks driven into the\r\narea contained a bag with ammunition.  The defendants offered no\r\nplausible explanation for their presence in this area so late at\r\nnight.  The evidence therefore supported the jury's verdict for\r\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute approximately 380\r\nkilograms of cocaine.  See United States v.

We will reverse the\r\ndistrict court's quantity determination only if it was clearly\r\nerroneous.  See United States v. Miranda-Santiago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  The district court did not err.\r\nIt was proper to attribute to Hernndez and Cipriano all\r\nreasonably foreseeable quantities of cocaine that were within the\r\nscope of the conspiracy.  See id.  Hernndez and Cipriano were\r\npresent at the smuggling location with three other coconspirators\r\nwhere they were to meet a boatload of smugglers, suggesting a\r\nlarge-scale operation.  The conspirators used three pick up trucks\r\nand a station wagon, suggesting that a large quantity of drugs\r\nwould need to be transported.  An assault weapon was found with the\r\ncocaine, suggesting that the amount of drugs would be worth\r\nprotecting.  The district court's finding that Hernndez and\r\nCipriano were liable for the full amount of cocaine was therefore\r\nnot clearly erroneous.\r\n\n                     IV\r\nHernndez, Cipriano, Prez, and de Aza contend that the \r\ndistrict court erred by denying their requests for a two-level\r\ndownward departure for their roles as minor participants under\r\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.2.  We will reverse the district court's denial of\r\na request for a minimal participant downward departure only if its\r\nfinding that the defendants were not minor participants was clearly\r\nerroneous.  See United States v. Gonzlez-Soberal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  The defendants had the burden to prove their\r\nentitlement to a minor participant downward departure.  See id. \r\nThe district court did not clearly err because the defendants\r\nfailed to satisfy their burden.  See United States v. Coneo-\r\nGuerrero, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198050\"><a href=\"/opinion/198050/united-states-v-coneo-guerrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming district\r\ncourt's denial of minor participant departure to defendants who\r\nclaimed status as transporters of cocaine with less responsibility\r\nthan deceased boat captain).\r\nIn addition, Prez argues that the district court\r\ndeprived him of his due process right to be sentenced on the basis\r\nof substantially correct information because the court limited its\r\nconsideration of the participants in the conspiracy to his\r\ncodefendants.  This argument is without merit because the district\r\ncourt specifically considered individuals implicated in the\r\nconspiracy other than Prez's codefendants.  After considering the\r\nevidence that Prez wished the district court to consider, the\r\ndistrict court concluded that the evidence fell far short of\r\nconvincing the court that Prez's role in the offense was minor. \r\nThe district court therefore did not deprive Prez of his due\r\nprocess rights.\r\n                     V\r\nAll five defendants contend that the district court erred\r\nby enhancing their sentences under U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1) for\r\npossession of a weapon in connection with the conspiracy.  We\r\nreview the factual findings underlying the district court's\r\ndangerous weapon enhancement for clear error.  United States v. Lagasse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196833\"><a href=\"/opinion/196833/united-states-v-lagasse/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1996).  The district court did\r\nnot err.\r\nAmmunition was found in one of the pickup trucks that was\r\ninitially driven down the Los Colchos Road.  The presence of\r\nammunition in that truck suggests that the weapon was possessed by\r\nthe coconspirators well before the boat was offloaded.  In\r\naddition, Prez and de Aza were seen placing sacks of cocaine where\r\nthe gun was found.  From this location, the weapon was readily\r\navailable to protect both the conspirators and the drugs.  Once the\r\ngovernment demonstrated that the weapon was \"readily available to\r\nprotect either the participants themselves during the commission of\r\nthe illegal activity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug\r\nbusiness,\" the burden shifted to the defendants to persuade the\r\ncourt \"that a connection between the weapon and the crime [wa]s\r\nclearly improbable.\"  See United States v. McDonald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744603\"><a href=\"/opinion/744603/united-states-v-cecilio-f-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (government's burden satisfied by showing gun found\r\nin bathroom of defendant's house that was command post for drug-\r\ntrafficking activities).  The defendants, however, failed to\r\nsatisfy their burden of demonstrating that the connection between\r\nthe weapon and the conspiracy was clearly improbable.  See id.(defendant failed to satisfy burden by failing to provide\r\nevidentiary support for denial of knowledge of weapon or to suggest\r\nexplanation for presence of gun).  Therefore, the district court\r\ndid not err by enhancing the defendants' sentences under U.S.S.G.\r\n2D1.1.\r\n                     VI\r\nPrez and de Aza contend that they were deprived of their\r\nright to a fair trial because the district court failed to strike\r\nas irrelevant and prejudicial references made at the trial to the\r\nassault weapon and ammunition found at the scene.  Although Prez\r\nwaived this argument by failing to object when the government\r\noffered the gun into evidence, see United States v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972-73 (1st Cir. 1995), we will give him the benefit of\r\nthe doubt and address the merits of his claim.\r\nPrez and de Aza argue that the weapon was irrelevant\r\nbecause the government failed to introduce evidence linking them to\r\nthe weapon.  However, as discussed above, ammunition found in one\r\nof the trucks suggests that the weapon was available to the\r\nconspirators well before the boat was offloaded.  In addition, de\r\nAza was seen placing a sack of cocaine with other sacks of cocaine\r\nwhere the weapon was found.  Consequently, the government did\r\nprovide evidence connecting Prez and de Aza to the weapon.\r\nPrez and de Aza argue that, although the weapon was\r\nmentioned in the indictment, the weapon was not relevant to any\r\nelement of the offense charged.  We disagree.  The assault weapon\r\nwas relevant because it was one of the means by which the\r\ndefendants protected themselves and the cocaine conspiracy.  SeeUnited States v. Cresta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492349\"><a href=\"/opinion/492349/united-states-v-robert-d-cresta-united-states-of-america-v-john-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (1st Cir. 1987), cert.\r\ndenied sub nom., Impemba v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).\r\nPrez and de Aza also argue that the weapon was\r\nprejudicial to their defense because it presented a clear danger of\r\noverwhelming the evidence.  Although evidence unfavorable to the\r\ndefense is always to some extent prejudicial, the weapon was not\r\nimpermissibly prejudicial.  Cf. id.  In addition, the admission of\r\nthe weapon could not have overwhelmed the 380 kilograms of cocaine\r\nunloaded in furtherance of the conspiracy.\r\n                    VII\r\nMateo contends that the district court erred by allowing\r\nthe government to comment on his silence at trial.  Specifically,\r\nMateo argues that when the prosecutor framed arguments to the jury\r\nin the form of, \"Ask yourselves\" what the defendants were doing in\r\nthe Los Colchos area on the night in question, the prosecutor was\r\nin fact commenting on the fact that Mateo had not testified at\r\ntrial.  We disagree.  The prosecutor's statements cannot be\r\nconstrued as a comment on Mateo's silence.  See United States v.  \r\nLavoie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427317\"><a href=\"/opinion/427317/united-states-v-george-lavoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408 (1st Cir. 1983), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1069</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984).  Therefore, there was no error.\r\n                 CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court.\r\nAFFIRMED.\n</pre>",
