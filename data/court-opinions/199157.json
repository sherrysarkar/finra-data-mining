This case involves an effort\n\nby   a judgment creditor to reach both certain assets of the\n\ndebtor nominally owned by the debtor's wife, and all assets\n\nowned by the debtor's alleged corporate \"alter ego,\" Kalif\n\nTrading, Inc.     The judgment creditor is Goya Foods, Inc., a\n\nmajor business founded in the 1930s which is now a Delaware\n\ncorporation with its principal place of business in New Jersey.\n\nThe debtor is Ulpiano Unanue-Casal, known as Charles, and his\n\nbankruptcy estate.     The factual background and prior proceedings\n\nare as follows.\n\n          From the late 1940s until 1969, Charles served as one\n\nof the chief officers of Goya, a company founded by his father.\n\nIn June 1969, in a quarrel among family members, Charles was\n\ndismissed and litigation ensued.        As a result of settlements in\n\n1972 and 1974, Charles received more than $4 million from Goya\n\nand, in exchange, gave up his interest in Goya.          Charles also\n\nagreed not to bring any further claim or suit regarding his\n\nfather's will or estate.      The agreement provided for liquidated\n\ndamages   of   twice   the   winning    side's   litigation   expenses,\n\nincluding attorney's fees, if any signatory wrongfully initiated\n\nnew litigation against another signatory.\n\n          In 1987, Charles made a claim for a share of the\n\ninheritance from his parents, and litigation in New Jersey state\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcourt followed, with his brothers seeking a declaration that\n\nCharles had no interest in either his father's estate or his\n\ninter vivos trust.     In 1990, while the New Jersey litigation\n\nproceeded, Charles filed for bankruptcy in Puerto Rico, and his\n\nbankruptcy estate thereafter became a party to the New Jersey\n\nlitigation.   In February 1995, the New Jersey court entered a\n\njudgment against both Charles and his estate for about $6.9\n\nmillion, representing liquidated damages for Goya, a signatory\n\nof the 1974 settlement that Charles had violated by making his\n\ninheritance claims.1\n\n           Meanwhile, prior to this New Jersey judgment, Goya had\n\nbegun   adversary   proceedings   in    Charles'   bankruptcy   case   in\n\nPuerto Rico, asserting that Charles was concealing his own\n\nassets under the names of his wife, Liliane, and two other\n\ncompanies, Emperor Equities, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly\n\nowned by Liliane, and Kalif Trading, a Panamanian corporation\n\nwhich was organized by Charles. 2         On September 12, 1995, the\n\n\n\n    1The New Jersey judgment was entered, In re Unanue, No. M-\n128817, slip op. (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. Feb. 23, 1995), and\nhas since been affirmed, 710 A.2d 1036, 1041 (N.J. Super. Ct.\nApp. Div.), cert. denied, 724 A.2d 801 (N.J. 1998).\n    2In 1991, after Emperor sold a piece of real property and\nproceeds were transferred to a Swiss bank account in Liliane's\nname, the bankruptcy court restrained remaining sales of real\nproperty pendente lite. See Quiros-Lopez v. Unanue-Casal (In re\nUnanue-Casal), 144 B.R. 604, 606-07 (D.P.R. 1992).\n\n                                  -4-\n\fbankruptcy court dismissed Charles' bankruptcy case without\n\ngranting him a discharge.                 In re Unanue-Casal, No. 90-04490,\n\nslip op. at 5 (Bankr. D.P.R. Sept. 12, 1995).\n\n              In November 1995, nine months after obtaining the New\n\nJersey judgment for $6.9 million, Goya brought the present\n\naction in federal district court in Puerto Rico against Charles,\n\nLiliane, and Kalif Trading, seeking to enforce the New Jersey\n\njudgment      against      Charles   and     against       properties      that    Goya\n\nclaimed belonged to Charles but were held in the name of Liliane\n\nor Kalif Trading.           A ten-day bench trial ensued in the district\n\ncourt in July 1997, and both Charles and Liliane testified.                          On\n\nOctober 31, 1997, the court filed a lengthy decision in Goya's\n\nfavor,      Goya    Foods,    Inc.   v.    Unanue-Casal,      982    F.    Supp.    103\n\n(D.P.R. 1997).        Clarifying amendments to the judgment followed\n\non March 10 and December 14, 1998.\n\n              The district court concluded that Charles was the true\n\nowner of specified cash, securities and various real properties\n\nheld   in    the    names    of   Liliane,       Emperor    Equities,      and    Kalif\n\nTrading.      The court rejected as false assertions by Charles and\n\nLiliane that Kalif Trading was owned by a wealthy Arab (who did\n\nnot appear at trial), and that a supposed fortune inherited by\n\nLiliane      from    her    family   accounted      for    various    of    the    real\n\nproperties held in her name.\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f          The judgment, as finally amended, determined that Kalif\n\nTrading was Charles' alter ego and was therefore responsible for\n\nthe New Jersey judgment to the full extent of its assets.               As\n\nfor Liliane, the court's judgment provided that Goya could\n\nexecute only against the following:           (1) the proceeds of the\n\nSutton House apartment Liliane had earlier owned in New York but\n\nsince sold; (2) \"any residence registered to her name, including\n\nthe Fuengirola, Malaga, Spain villa, and the Paris apartment\";3\n\nand (3) the stock of Emperor Equities, all of which was held in\n\nLiliane's name, and which the court directed Liliane to deposit\n\nwith the court.\n\n           Charles, Liliane and Kalif Trading have now appealed\n\nfrom the district court's judgment.         They contest the findings\n\nof fact and legal conclusions that led the district court to\n\nimpose liability for the New Jersey judgment on property held in\n\nthe name Liliane, Kalif Trading and Emperor Equities.            They also\n\ncontend   that   the   statute   of    limitations   and   a   contractual\n\nrelease debar Goya's claims and say that the district court\n\n\n\n\n    3Fairly read, the judgment encompasses another New York\napartment on Park Avenue which was the subject of evidence at\ntrial and was held in Liliane's name at the time of the\njudgment.  Apart from these three real properties, it is not\nclear what other real property held in Liliane's name at the\ntime of the judgment was meant to be included.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcommitted various procedural errors.       We consider the merits of\n\nthose arguments that have not been forfeited.\n\n           1. Kalif Trading.     It is easiest to begin with the\n\ndistrict   court's   treatment   of    Kalif   Trading,   an   off-shore\n\ncompany that Charles organized in 1979 and for which he and\n\nLiliane have had general power of attorney since incorporation.\n\nIn November 1980, Charles transferred over $1 million to Kalif\n\nTrading in assets from his own securities account.             At about\n\nthis time, he ceased to pay alimony to a former wife and also\n\nstopped paying taxes, claiming that he no longer had any income\n\nor assets.   In August 1983, Kalif Trading was also given title\n\nof a penthouse apartment in Puerto Rico previously held by\n\nEmperor Equities and apparently acquired with Charles' assets.\n\n           At trial, Charles claimed that Kalif Trading was owned\n\nby one Mohammed Kalif, but the court found that there was no\n\nevidence that Mohammed Kalif existed (he did not appear at\n\ntrial), and that the company was a vehicle used by Charles to\n\nconceal his own assets.    This finding was supported not only by\n\nCharles' effective control of the assets, but also by his use of\n\nKalif Trading's bank accounts to pay hundreds of thousands of\n\ndollars in bills for Charles and his wife, by the transfer of\n\nassets from Charles to Kalif Trading, and by the timing of Kalif\n\nTrading's creation.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f         In imposing liability on Kalif Trading, the district\n\ncourt applied New York law, after finding that Puerto Rico\n\ncourts would apply a \"most significant contacts\" test,               A.M.\n\nCapen's Co. v. American Trading & Prod. Corp., 74 F.3d 317, 320\n\n(1st Cir. 1996), and that New York's contacts with transactions\n\ninvolving Kalif Trading were greater than those of any other\n\nrelevant jurisdiction.     The brief filed for Liliane and Kalif\n\nTrading does not dispute the decision to apply New York law;\n\nCharles does so in his reply brief, but his arguments are terse,\n\nunpersuasive and too late.       Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea,\n\n959 F.2d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).4\n\n         Under     New   York   law,    the   corporate   veil    may   be\n\ndisregarded where the challenger shows two facts:          (1) complete\n\ndomination of the corporation by its alleged alter ego, and (2)\n\nuse of that domination to commit a fraud or wrong against the\n\nplaintiff.   Morris v. New York State Dep't of Taxation & Fin.,\n\n623 N.E.2d 1157,     1160-61 (N.Y. 1993);       see also New York v.\n\nEaston, 647 N.Y.S.2d 904, 908 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995).              Although\n\n\n\n    4 Panama, as the state of incorporation, may well supply the\npresumptively applicable legal regime for veil piercing claims;\nbut under the Restatement rule, apparently followed in Puerto\nRico, New York law could nevertheless be applied where, as here,\nKalif Trading's business activities occurred primarily in New\nYork and have no connection to Panama. See Wadsworth, Inc. v.\nSchwarz-Nin, 951 F. Supp. 314, 320-21 (D.P.R. 1996) (citing\nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 309 (1971)).\n\n                                  -8-\n\fveil piercing is usually employed to make an individual or a\n\ncorporate parent liable for the debts of a corporation, so-\n\ncalled \"reverse piercing\" (which makes the corporation liable\n\nfor the debts of its owner or parent) is allowed under New York\n\nlaw where the assets at issue are held by the target corporation\n\nand the liability is that of the individual who dominates the\n\ncorporation and is using it to perpetrate a fraud or wrong.              Wm.\n\nPassalacqua Builders, Inc. v. Resnick Developers S., Inc., 933\n\nF.2d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1991).\n\n            It may be open to dispute whether Kalif Trading was\n\ninitially formed for the purpose of shielding assets from Goya.\n\nAlthough the district court's decision so suggests, New York law\n\nrequires    \"clear     and   convincing\"     evidence   of   such   fraud,\n\nLowendahl v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., 287 N.Y.S. 62, 76 (N.Y.\n\nApp. Div.), aff'd, 6 N.E.2d 56 (N.Y. 1936), and such evidence\n\nseems lacking because Kalif Trading's formation and the transfer\n\nof Charles' assets to it took place after Charles' original\n\nlitigation with Goya had been settled (in 1972 and 1974) and\n\nbefore Charles made his 1987 claim for a share of his parents'\n\nestate.\n\n            Nevertheless, even if Kalif Trading's origin is not\n\ntainted by fraud, New York still permits veil piercing where the\n\ncorporate    vehicle    is   being    used   to   inflict    \"wrongful    or\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\finequitable consequences.\"     TNS Holdings, Inc. v. MKI Sec.\n\nCorp., 703 N.E.2d 749, 751 (N.Y. 1998).     New York courts have\n\nheld that this test can be satisfied when a corporation is \"a\n\nmere shell dominated and controlled by another for the latter's\n\nown purposes.\"5   Guptill Holding Corp. v. New York, 307 N.Y.S.2d\n\n970, 973-74 (N.Y. App. Div. 1970), aff’d, 292 N.E.2d 782 (N.Y.\n\n1972), is inapposite here because, given Charles' denial of\n\nownership of Kalif Trading, there is no easy way for Goya to\n\nlevy directly on Charles' formal ownership interest in Kalif\n\nTrading.\n\n           There is ample proof that Kalif Trading is effectively\n\nthe alter ego of Charles--who created it, initially funded it\n\nwith his own assets, managed it, and paid his own and his wife's\n\nexpenses with its assets.     Whether or not it was originally\n\ncreated to shield assets from creditors, it is not a business\n\nseparate from Charles, and there is no indication it has any\n\nowners other than Charles.   It appears to us, as to the district\n\ncourt, to be nothing other than Charles himself under another\n\nname, and therefore under New York law it is permissible to\n\nstrip away the corporate fig leaf.\n\n\n     5\n     888 7th Ave. Assocs. Ltd. P'ship v. Arlen Corp., 569\nN.Y.S.2d 16, 17 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991); see also National Union\nFire Ins. Co. v. Bodek, 705 N.Y.S.2d 42, 43 (N.Y. App. Div.\n2000); Austin Powder Co. v. McCullough, 628 N.Y.S.2d 855, 857\n(N.Y. App. Div. 1995).\n\n                               -10-\n\f            2. Assets in Liliane's Name. The claim as to Liliane's\n\nassets is more complicated.     In 1968, Liliane and Charles took\n\njoint title to an apartment in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and in\n\n1971, during the earlier round of litigation between Charles and\n\nGoya, the title to the apartment was transferred to Emperor\n\nEquities, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly owned by Liliane.\n\nDuring and after 1972, the year in which Charles received the\n\nfirst installment of payments from Goya, Liliane and Emperor\n\nEquities developed a pattern of real estate acquisitions in\n\nwhich they obtained title to other luxury residences in Puerto\n\nRico, New York, France, and Spain.\n\n            At trial, Liliane claimed that these properties had\n\nbeen acquired with assets provided by her once wealthy Bulgarian\n\nfamily.     However, the district court concluded that this story\n\nwas untrue, being uncorroborated and inconsistent with other\n\nevidence.    It also concluded that the properties in question had\n\nbeen purchased by Charles, who used and enjoyed all of the\n\nresidences \"and in many occasions referred to them as his own in\n\nletters to third parties.\"    Goya Foods, 982 F. Supp. at 112.   In\n\nsubstance, the court found that Charles was \"hiding his assets\n\nin the name of his wife for the purpose of impairing his\n\ncreditors.\"    Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f            Liliane's brief makes no persuasive attack on the\n\ndistrict    court's     findings,        which        we   find     were       adequately\n\nsupported.       Rather, the brief concentrates its criticism on the\n\ndistrict court's theory of liability.                       Because the district\n\ncourt described Liliane as Charles' \"alter ego\" in relation to\n\nthe acquisitions, Liliane says that the district court wrongly\n\napplied to a human being a theory that is only valid in relation\n\nto corporations.       See, e.g., Werner-Jacobsen v. Bednarik, 946\n\nP.2d 744, 747-48 (Utah Ct. App. 1997) (\"An individual cannot be\n\nthe 'alter ego' of another.\").             Further, says Liliane, property\n\nheld in her name belongs to her \"even if it were assumed that\n\nLiliane obtained her properties with Charles' money and not with\n\nher own . . . .\"\n\n            The district court's use of the \"alter ego\" language\n\nto describe the relationship between Charles and Liliane may be\n\ninapt--no    New     York       decision      appears       to     use    it     in     such\n\ncircumstances--and         in    New   York     the    property      of     one       spouse\n\ncertainly is not automatically subject to seizure for the debts\n\nof   the   other    spouse.        But   New     York      courts    have        used    the\n\nequitable theory of \"constructive trust\" to allow a third-party\n\ncreditor    to    execute       judgment   on    assets       nominally          owned    by\n\nsomeone    other    than    the     debtor      but,       based    on     the    court's\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\ffindings, actually owned by the debtor himself.6                It appears to\n\nus that, in using the alter ego language, the district court\n\nmeant   only    that   the       properties   in    question   were    Charles'\n\nproperty but were merely held in his wife's name.\n\n              In some circumstances, even an intended transfer of\n\nownership can be set aside.          For example, if a specific transfer\n\nfrom one spouse to another were made without consideration to\n\ndefraud   a    creditor,     a    different   set   of   New   York   doctrines\n\n(\"actual or constructive fraud\") could be invoked, see Scola v.\n\nMorgan, 412 N.Y.S.2d 893, 895 (N.Y. App. Div. 1979); 30 N.Y.\n\nJur. 2d Creditors' Rts. & Remedies §§ 300-71 (1997); but in this\n\ncase there are no detailed findings with respect to each of the\n\nindividual transactions at issue that would establish fraudulent\n\nintent, see In re Montclair Homes, 200 B.R. 84, 96 (E.D.N.Y.\n\n1996), or constructive fraud, see N.Y. Debtor & Creditor Law §§\n\n273-75 (McKinney 1990), nor did the district court purport to\n\nmake such findings.\n\n              However, under the theory of constructive trust, no\n\nsuch specific findings are required if the purchases were with\n\nCharles' own funds, the transfers of title to Charles' wife\n\n\n\n    6Duncan v.

Father Divine, 85 N.E.2d 168,\n170 (N.Y. 1949).\n\n                                       -13-\n\fLiliane were merely nominal, and the parties intended that\n\nCharles     continue     to    possess    beneficial      ownership    of    the\n\nproperties.       See Bankers Sec. Life Ins. Soc'y v. Shakerdge, 406\n\nN.E.2d 440, 440 (N.Y. 1980).             This, in substance, is what the\n\ndistrict court found.            It does not make Liliane personally\n\nliable for her husband's debts; but it does mean that the\n\nproperty which he beneficially owns but which happens to be held\n\nin   her   name    can   be   reached    through   the    constructive      trust\n\ndoctrine for the benefit of his creditors.\n\n            Here,    the      circumstantial   evidence      of   an   implicit\n\nunderstanding is strong.            The timing of the transactions in\n\nrelation to prospective litigation, Charles' continued treatment\n\nof the properties as his own, the parallels to the deceptive\n\noperation of Kalif Trading, and the inferences to be drawn from\n\nLiliane's baseless claim that the properties were paid for with\n\nfamily funds all contribute to the conclusion that the real\n\nestate in question was Charles' and not Liliane's.                 Given that\n\nCharles and Liliane's \"agreement\" could be inferred from the\n\ncircumstances, see In re Estate of Knappen, 655 N.Y.S.2d 110,\n\n111-12 (N.Y. App. Div.),           cert. denied, 683 N.E.2d 335 (N.Y.\n\n1997),     there    is   enough    to    sustain    the    district    court's\n\nassessment of the situation under a clear error standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f                 Two New York cases, not cited by the parties, make\n\nclear that a constructive trust is not automatically justified\n\nto   undo        a    property     transfer   between      spouses    even   when   the\n\npurpose of the transfer (in each case, one involving the marital\n\nresidence) is to protect against present or future claims by the\n\ncreditors of the transferring spouse.7                  However, those cases are\n\ndistinguishable, for they involved what the New York courts\n\nfound       to       be   genuine    transfers      that    occurred     without     an\n\nunderstanding between the parties that the property would remain\n\nthat of the transferring spouse.                   In our case, by contrast, the\n\nthrust of the district court's findings is that ownership was\n\nconveyed in name only.\n\n                 This lack of an effective conveyance (and the resulting\n\napplicability of constructive trust theory) also answers the\n\nargument of Charles and Liliane that the statute of limitations\n\nbars       the       effort   to   reach   property   held    in     Liliane's    name.\n\nAlthough the New York statute of limitations requires that suit\n\nbased on fraudulent conveyance be brought within six years of\n\nthe transfer or two of discovery (actual or constructive) of the\n\nfraud, Wall St. Assocs. v. Brodsky, 684 N.Y.S.2d 244, 248 (N.Y.\n\nApp. Div. 1999), that is not the theory of recovery.                             In the\n\n\n       7\n     Macina v. Macina, 455 N.E.2d 1258, 1259 (N.Y. 1983), aff’g\n463 N.Y.S.2d 43 (N.Y. App. Div. 1983); Rossignol v. Silvernail,\n635 N.Y.S.2d 772, 773 (N.Y. App. Div. 1995).\n\n                                            -15-\n\fcase of a constructive trust, the limitations period (six years,\n\nMaric Piping, Inc. v. Maric, 705 N.Y.S.2d 684, 685 (N.Y. App.\n\nDiv. 2000)) begins to run only when \"the wrongful withholding\"\n\noccurs, Augustine v. Szwed, 432 N.Y.S.2d 962, 965 (N.Y. App.\n\nDiv. 1980); accord Whalen v. Gerzof, 564 N.E.2d 656, 657 (N.Y.\n\n1990), and the original date of transfer is not relevant.\n\n          The district court's rationale justifies its judgment\n\nto the extent that it recognizes Goya's right to execute against\n\nthe   identified   real   property     held   in   Liliane's   name,\n\nspecifically, the three named properties in New York, Paris, and\n\nMalaga.   However, despite its broad literal wording, Goya Foods,\n\n982 F. Supp. at 112, we do not construe the district court\n\njudgment as extending to any residence held in Liliane's name\n\nthat has not yet been identified in this litigation.             The\n\nconstructive trust doctrine cannot easily be applied to property\n\nwhose identity and circumstances of acquisition are unknown.\n\n          3. Emperor Equities.       Next, we consider the various\n\nissues raised by Liliane's ownership of Emperor Equities.        One\n\nset of the real properties at issue were three condominium\n\napartments in Puerto Rico.   One was acquired by Charles in 1968,\n\ntitle being taken in the joint names of Charles and Liliane; in\n\n1971, during Charles' litigation with Goya, this property was\n\ntransferred to Emperor, a corporation whose sole shareholder was\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fLiliane.    Two further condominiums in San Juan were acquired in\n\n1972, after Charles received a large initial payment from Goya.\n\nThey too became properties of Emperor.             One was transferred in\n\n1983 to Kalif Trading, but the other remained in Emperor's name\n\nuntil being sold to a third party in 1991.\n\n            Despite its involvement in Charles' and Liliane's real\n\nestate transactions, Emperor was not named as a defendant in\n\nGoya's district court action seeking to reach assets of Charles\n\nheld in the names of third parties.           Liliane says that this is\n\nbecause Emperor was a Delaware corporation and, as this was also\n\ntrue   of   Goya,   naming   Emperor   as    the   defendant   would   have\n\ndestroyed diversity jurisdiction.            Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7\n\nU.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 267 (1806).            Liliane says that it was an\n\nerror for the district court to order Emperor, a non-party to\n\nthe litigation, to forfeit its property, since Emperor was not\n\nitself a party to the case.\n\n            The short answer is that the district court judgment\n\ndid not purport to reach properties held by Emperor at all.\n\nInstead, as clarified by the amended judgment of December 14,\n\n1998, the district court directed that the \"stock certificates\n\nand shares\" of Emperor held by Liliane (it is unclear why both\n\nwords were used) should be deposited with the court so that they\n\ncould be used to satisfy the judgment.               Such a judgment was\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fwithin the district court's power, for Liliane was a party to\n\nthe case, and reaching securities that she owns does not require\n\nthat the securities' issuer be a party.\n\n          4. Miscellany.     There remain two other arguments of\n\nimportance.   First, in his opening brief on appeal, Charles\n\nclaims that, in seeking to enforce the New Jersey judgment, Goya\n\noverlooked a procedural precondition.        Since the New Jersey\n\njudgment was not initially entered by another federal court, it\n\ncould not merely be registered in the federal district court in\n\nPuerto Rico under 28 U.S.C. § 1963 (1994).      Rather, enforcement\n\nwas governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a), providing that federal\n\nproceedings to enforce any out-of-state judgment of a state\n\ncourt should follow the practice of the state in which the\n\nfederal district court sits.\n\n          Charles asserts that, under Puerto Rico law, for a\n\nforeign judgment to be enforceable in Commonwealth courts, it\n\nmust first be validated and domesticated in an \"exequatur\"\n\nproceeding in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.           Ex parte\n\nMarquez   Estrella,   128   D.P.R.   243,   247-56   (1991).     This\n\nproceeding allows interested parties to raise certain limited\n\ndefenses against the enforcement of a foreign judgment.        Charles\n\nsays that Goya failed to have the New Jersey judgment validated\n\nin this manner, that the New Jersey judgment was therefore \"not\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fproperly   before   the   District   Court,\"   and   that   lack   of   an\n\nexequatur proceeding deprived Charles of his right to challenge\n\nvalidation of the judgment on the permitted grounds.\n\n           It may be (we take no position on the matter) that to\n\nenforce a state court judgment in the federal district court in\n\nPuerto Rico, there must be a prior exequatur proceeding8 or some\n\nequivalent   opportunity     to   challenge    the   non-Commonwealth\n\njudgment in the federal proceeding itself.       However, Charles and\n\nLiliane first made their exequatur argument in July 1999, more\n\nthan a year and a half after the district court had initially\n\nentered judgment against them.       Thus, this argument was not made\n\nin a timely fashion, whether viewed as subject to the ten-day\n\nrule of Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or the more relaxed one-year or\n\nreasonable-time restrictions of Fed. R. Civ. 60(b).9\n\n           The exequatur objection is not one that goes to the\n\ndistrict court's subject matter jurisdiction and which might\n\n\n    8Compare Hibbs v. Yashar, 522 F. Supp. 247, 249-54 (D.R.I.\n1981) (Rhode Island statute requiring preliminary judicial\nscreening of medical malpractice cases), with Feinstein v.\nMassachusetts Gen. Hosp., 643 F.2d 880, 889 (1st Cir. 1981)\n(Massachusetts law requiring screening of medical malpractice\nclaims by an administrative tribunal). See generally 19 Wright,\nMiller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4511 (1996).\n    9Neither of the amended judgments substantively altered the\noriginal judgment or provided any other excuse for the failure\nto raise the exequatur issue in timely fashion.     See Berwick\nGrain Co. v. Illinois Dep't of Agric., 189 F.3d 556, 560 (7th\nCir. 1999).\n\n                                  -19-\n\ftherefore     be     exempt   from    the    ordinary   requirements     of\n\ntimeliness.        See Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Ceramica Europa II,\n\nInc., 160 F.3d 849, 852 (1st Cir. 1998).                Nor, it is worth\n\nadding, is there any indication that Charles and Liliane were\n\nprecluded from raising in the district court any substantive\n\nobjections to the enforcement of the New Jersey judgment that\n\nmight have been asserted in a Commonwealth exequatur proceeding.\n\nCharles did claim that the New Jersey court lacked jurisdiction\n\nto enter the judgment against him, but he did not pursue this\n\nissue on appeal in his opening brief, and it is therefore\n\nforfeited.\n\n            Second, Liliane claims that the district court erred\n\nby entering a default judgment against her and, later, by not\n\naffording her a jury trial even though the court ultimately\n\nallowed her to present her case on the merits.               The district\n\ncourt entered a default against Liliane in March 1997 as a\n\nsanction for repeated failures to comply with court orders.\n\nLiliane's earlier demand for a jury trial was then struck on\n\nGoya's motion (no other party having made a timely request for\n\na   jury   trial).     Nevertheless,    at   trial   the   district   court\n\nreversed field and allowed Liliane’s counsel to offer witnesses\n\nand to present a defense, and it then resolved the claims\n\nagainst her on the merits.           At no time during the trial did\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fLiliane offer an objection to the bench trial or ask the court\n\nto reinstate her jury trial request.\n\n             On this appeal, little need be said about Liliane’s\n\nchallenge to the original default.                 Although the remedy was\n\nsevere, it followed obstreperous acts and clear advance warning\n\nfrom the district court, and it was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nCf. Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 1999); John's\n\nInsulation, Inc. v. L. Addison & Assocs., Inc., 156 F.3d 101,\n\n108-10     (1st   Cir.   1998).      The    more   troublesome      question    is\n\nwhether, insofar as the district court proceeded to try and\n\ndecide     Liliane’s     case   on   the    merits,   it     should    also   have\n\nafforded her the jury trial she originally demanded.                    In posing\n\nthis question, we assume dubitante that the original jury trial\n\nrequest was proper.10\n\n             Assuming that a right to jury trial otherwise existed,\n\nit   was    not   preserved.         Once   the    default    was     effectively\n\nwithdrawn, Liliane could not proceed to present her case without\n\ntelling the district court that she wanted the jury request\n\n\n\n      10\n      Imposition of a constructive trust is equitable in nature\nand, thus, may not trigger the right to a jury trial under the\nSeventh Amendment. See Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492\nU.S. 33, 40-42 (1989); RTC v. Pasquariello, 16 F.3d 525, 531 (3d\nCir. 1994); see also Latham v. Father Divine, 85 N.E.2d 168, 170\n(N.Y. 1949) (\"[A] constructive trust is merely the formula\nthrough which the conscience of equity finds expression . . . .\"\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n\n                                       -21-\n\freinstated and then, after losing, complain that a jury should\n\nhave   been    afforded.    This   kind    of    mouse-trapping,    whether\n\ndeliberate or inadvertent, is forbidden.            Daigle v. Maine Med.\n\nCtr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687-88 (1st Cir. 1994).               A claim to a\n\njury   trial    can   be   forfeited      just    like   any   other   non-\n\njurisdictional request or objection.\n\n          Appellants present other arguments, including claims\n\nthat personal jurisdiction over Charles and Liliane was lacking,\n\nthat Charles was denied adequate discovery, that Charles was\n\nentitled to rely on Liliane's request for jury trial, that\n\n(according to Charles) New York law does not apply, and that\n\nmisconduct by Goya warranted sanction and dismissal.               However,\n\nall of these claims have been raised only in reply briefs, and\n\nit is well-settled that the attempt to present issues in this\n\nmanner is untimely and that such claims therefore need not be\n\nconsidered.     Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Finally, the appellants argue that a 1974 contractual\n\nrelease given by Goya precludes Goya's present claims.                 This\n\nargument was admittedly not presented to the district court and\n\nis therefore forfeited in this court.            It is doubtful that such\n\na defense, if not seasonably asserted, could ever be rescued by\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fthe   plain   error   doctrine,   but    in   any   event   there   is   no\n\nmiscarriage of justice in its forfeiture here.\n\n          The appellants also have made, or at least insinuated,\n\na variety of other arguments; to the extent these arguments are\n\nproperly before us, we believe that they are without merit, and\n\nwe reject them without detailed discussion.            For the reasons\n\nstated, the judgment of the district court is affirmed with the\n\nclarification that insofar as the judgment permits Goya to levy\n\nagainst real properties held in Liliane's name at the time of\n\njudgment, it extends only to those real properties identified in\n\nthe district court proceedings and not other unnamed properties.\n\nAppellants have pending a motion for reconsideration of our\n\nprior order striking various exhibits, and we now deny the\n\nmotion to reconsider.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f",

The judgment creditor is Goya Foods, Inc., a major business  founded in the 1930s which is now a Delaware corporation with its principal  place of business in New Jersey. The debtor is Ulpiano Unanue-Casal, known as  Charles, and his bankruptcy estate. The factual background and prior proceedings  are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the late 1940s until 1969, Charles served as one of the chief officers of  Goya, a company founded by his father. In June 1969, in a quarrel among family  members, Charles was dismissed and litigation ensued. As a result of settlements  in 1972 and 1974, Charles received more than $4 million from Goya and, in  exchange, gave up his interest in Goya. Charles also agreed not to bring any  further claim or suit regarding his father's will or estate. The agreement  provided for liquidated damages of twice the winning side's litigation expenses,  including attorney's fees, if any signatory wrongfully initiated new litigation  against another signatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Charles made a claim for a share of the inheritance from his parents,  and litigation in New Jersey state court followed, with his brothers seeking a  declaration that Charles had no interest in either his father's estate or his  inter vivos trust. In 1990, while the New Jersey litigation proceeded, Charles  filed for bankruptcy in Puerto Rico, and his bankruptcy estate thereafter became  a party to the New Jersey litigation. In February 1995, the New Jersey court  entered a judgment against both Charles and his estate for about $6.9 million,  representing liquidated damages for Goya, a signatory of the 1974 settlement  that Charles had violated by making his inheritance claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, prior to this New Jersey judgment, Goya had begun adversary  proceedings in Charles' bankruptcy case in Puerto Rico, asserting that Charles  was concealing his own assets under the names of his wife, Liliane, and two  other companies, Emperor Equities, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly owned by  Liliane, and Kalif Trading, a Panamanian corporation which was organized by  Charles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On September 12, 1995, the bankruptcy court dismissed Charles'  bankruptcy case without granting him a discharge. In re Unanue-Casal, No.  90-04490, slip op. at 5 (Bankr. D.P.R. Sept. 12, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1995, nine months after obtaining the New Jersey judgment for $6.9  million, Goya brought the present action in federal district court in Puerto  Rico against Charles, Liliane, and Kalif Trading, seeking to enforce the New  Jersey judgment against Charles and against properties that Goya claimed  belonged to Charles but were held in the name of Liliane or Kalif Trading. A  ten-day bench trial ensued in the district court in July 1997, and both Charles  and Liliane testified. On October 31, 1997, the court filed a lengthy decision  in Goya's favor, Goya Foods, Inc. v. Unanue-Casal, 982 F. Supp. 103 (D.P.R.  1997). Clarifying amendments to the judgment followed on March 10 and December  14, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Charles was the true owner of specified cash,  securities and various real properties held in the names of Liliane, Emperor  Equities, and Kalif Trading. The court rejected as false assertions by Charles  and Liliane that Kalif Trading was owned by a wealthy Arab (who did not appear  at trial), and that a supposed fortune inherited by Liliane from her family  accounted for various of the real properties held in her name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment, as finally amended, determined that Kalif Trading was Charles'  alter ego and was therefore responsible for the New Jersey judgment to the full  extent of its assets. As for Liliane, the court's judgment provided that Goya  could execute only against the following: (1) the proceeds of the Sutton House  apartment Liliane had earlier owned in New York but since sold; (2) \"any  residence registered to her name, including the Fuengirola, Malaga, Spain villa,  and the Paris apartment\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and (3) the stock of Emperor Equities, all of which  was held in Liliane's name, and which the court directed Liliane to deposit with  the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles, Liliane and Kalif Trading have now appealed from the district court's  judgment. They contest the findings of fact and legal conclusions that led the  district court to impose liability for the New Jersey judgment on property held  in the name Liliane, Kalif Trading and Emperor Equities. They also contend that  the statute of limitations and a contractual release debar Goya's claims and say  that the district court committed various procedural errors. We consider the  merits of those arguments that have not been forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Kalif Trading. It is easiest to begin with the district court's treatment of  Kalif Trading, an off-shore company that Charles organized in 1979 and for which  he and Liliane have had general power of attorney since incorporation. In  November 1980, Charles transferred over $1 million to Kalif Trading in assets  from his own securities account. At about this time, he ceased to pay alimony to  a former wife and also stopped paying taxes, claiming that he no longer had any  income or assets. In August 1983, Kalif Trading was also given title of a  penthouse apartment in Puerto Rico previously held by Emperor Equities and  apparently acquired with Charles' assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Charles claimed that Kalif Trading was owned by one Mohammed Kalif,  but the court found that there was no evidence that Mohammed Kalif existed (he  did not appear at trial), and that the company was a vehicle used by Charles to  conceal his own assets. This finding was supported not only by Charles'  effective control of the assets, but also by his use of Kalif Trading's bank  accounts to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills for Charles and his  wife, by the transfer of assets from Charles to Kalif Trading, and by the timing  of Kalif Trading's creation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In imposing liability on Kalif Trading, the district court applied New York law,  after finding that Puerto Rico courts would apply a \"most significant contacts\"  test, A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading &amp; Prod. Corp., 74 F.3d 317, 320 (1st  Cir. 1996), and that New York's contacts with transactions involving Kalif  Trading were greater than those of any other relevant jurisdiction. The brief  filed for Liliane and Kalif Trading does not dispute the decision to apply New  York law; Charles does so in his reply brief, but his arguments are terse,  unpersuasive and too late. Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 354  (1st Cir. 1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under New York law, the corporate veil may be disregarded where the challenger  shows two facts: (1) complete domination of the corporation by its alleged alter  ego, and (2) use of that domination to commit a fraud or wrong against the  plaintiff. Morris v. New York State Dep't of Taxation &amp; Fin., 623 N.E.2d 1157,  1160-61 (N.Y. 1993); see also New York v. Easton, 647 N.Y.S.2d 904, 908 (N.Y.  Sup. Ct. 1995). Although veil piercing is usually employed to make an individual  or a corporate parent liable for the debts of a corporation, so-called \"reverse  piercing\" (which makes the corporation liable for the debts of its owner or  parent) is allowed under New York law where the assets at issue are held by the  target corporation and the liability is that of the individual who dominates the  corporation and is using it to perpetrate a fraud or wrong. Wm. Passalacqua  Builders, Inc. v. Resnick Developers S., Inc., 933 F.2d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be open to dispute whether Kalif Trading was initially formed for the  purpose of shielding assets from Goya. Although the district court's decision so  suggests, New York law requires \"clear and convincing\" evidence of such fraud,  Lowendahl v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., 287 N.Y.S. 62, 76 (N.Y. App. Div.),  aff'd, 6 N.E.2d 56 (N.Y. 1936), and such evidence seems lacking because Kalif  Trading's formation and the transfer of Charles' assets to it took place after Charles' original litigation with Goya had been settled (in 1972 and 1974) and  before Charles made his 1987 claim for a share of his parents' estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, even if Kalif Trading's origin is not tainted by fraud, New York  still permits veil piercing where the corporate vehicle is being used to inflict  \"wrongful or inequitable consequences.\" TNS Holdings, Inc. v. MKI Sec. Corp.,  703 N.E.2d 749, 751 (N.Y. 1998). New York courts have held that this test can be  satisfied when a corporation is \"a mere shell dominated and controlled by  another for the latter's own purposes.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Guptill Holding Corp. v. New York,  307 N.Y.S.2d 970, 973-74 (N.Y. App. Div. 1970), aff'd, 292 N.E.2d 782 (N.Y.  1972), is inapposite here because, given Charles' denial of ownership of Kalif  Trading, there is no easy way for Goya to levy directly on Charles' formal  ownership interest in Kalif Trading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample proof that Kalif Trading is effectively the alter ego of  Charles--who created it, initially funded it with his own assets, managed it,  and paid his own and his wife's expenses with its assets. Whether or not it was  originally created to shield assets from creditors, it is not a business  separate from Charles, and there is no indication it has any owners other than  Charles. It appears to us, as to the district court, to be nothing other than  Charles himself under another name, and therefore under New York law it is  permissible to strip away the corporate fig leaf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Assets in Liliane's Name. The claim as to Liliane's assets is more  complicated. In 1968, Liliane and Charles took joint title to an apartment in  San Juan, Puerto Rico, and in 1971, during the earlier round of litigation  between Charles and Goya, the title to the apartment was transferred to Emperor  Equities, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly owned by Liliane. During and after  1972, the year in which Charles received the first installment of payments from  Goya, Liliane and Emperor Equities developed a pattern of real estate  acquisitions in which they obtained title to other luxury residences in Puerto  Rico, New York, France, and Spain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Liliane claimed that these properties had been acquired with assets  provided by her once wealthy Bulgarian family. However, the district court  concluded that this story was untrue, being uncorroborated and inconsistent with  other evidence. It also concluded that the properties in question had been  purchased by Charles, who used and enjoyed all of the residences \"and in many  occasions referred to them as his own in letters to third parties.\" Goya Foods,  982 F. Supp. at 112. In substance, the court found that Charles was \"hiding his  assets in the name of his wife for the purpose of impairing his creditors.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liliane's brief makes no persuasive attack on the district court's findings,  which we find were adequately supported. Rather, the brief concentrates its  criticism on the district court's theory of liability. Because the district  court described Liliane as Charles' \"alter ego\" in relation to the acquisitions,  Liliane says that the district court wrongly applied to a human being a theory  that is only valid in relation to corporations. See, e.g., Werner-Jacobsen v.  Bednarik, 946 P.2d 744, 747-48 (Utah Ct. App. 1997) (\"An individual cannot be  the 'alter ego' of another.\"). Further, says Liliane, property held in her name  belongs to her \"even if it were assumed that Liliane obtained her properties  with Charles' money and not with her own . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's use of the \"alter ego\" language to describe the  relationship between Charles and Liliane may be inapt--no New York decision  appears to use it in such circumstances--and in New York the property of one  spouse certainly is not automatically subject to seizure for the debts of the  other spouse. But New York courts have used the equitable theory of  \"constructive trust\" to allow a third-party creditor to execute judgment on  assets nominally owned by someone other than the debtor but, based on the  court's findings, actually owned by the debtor himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It appears to us  that, in using the alter ego language, the district court meant only that the  properties in question were Charles' property but were merely held in his wife's  name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some circumstances, even an intended transfer of ownership can be set aside.  For example, if a specific transfer from one spouse to another were made without  consideration to defraud a creditor, a different set of New York doctrines  (\"actual or constructive fraud\") could be invoked, see Scola v. Morgan, 412  N.Y.S.2d 893, 895 (N.Y. App. Div. 1979); 30 N.Y. Jur. 2d Creditors' Rts. &amp;  Remedies  300-71 (1997); but in this case there are no detailed findings with  respect to each of the individual transactions at issue that would establish  fraudulent intent, see In re Montclair Homes, 200 B.R. 84, 96 (E.D.N.Y. 1996),  or constructive fraud, see N.Y. Debtor &amp; Creditor Law  273-75 (McKinney 1990),  nor did the district court purport to make such findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, under the theory of constructive trust, no such specific findings are  required if the purchases were with Charles' own funds, the transfers of title  to Charles' wife Liliane were merely nominal, and the parties intended that  Charles continue to possess beneficial ownership of the properties. See Bankers  Sec. Life Ins. Soc'y v. Shakerdge, 406 N.E.2d 440, 440 (N.Y. 1980). This, in  substance, is what the district court found. It does not make Liliane personally  liable for her husband's debts; but it does mean that the property which he  beneficially owns but which happens to be held in her name can be reached  through the constructive trust doctrine for the benefit of his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the circumstantial evidence of an implicit understanding is strong. The  timing of the transactions in relation to prospective litigation, Charles'  continued treatment of the properties as his own, the parallels to the deceptive  operation of Kalif Trading, and the inferences to be drawn from Liliane's  baseless claim that the properties were paid for with family funds all  contribute to the conclusion that the real estate in question was Charles' and  not Liliane's. Given that Charles and Liliane's \"agreement\" could be inferred  from the circumstances, see In re Estate of Knappen, 655 N.Y.S.2d 110, 111-12  (N.Y. App. Div.), cert. denied, 683 N.E.2d 335 (N.Y. 1997), there is enough to  sustain the district court's assessment of the situation under a clear error  standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two New York cases, not cited by the parties, make clear that a constructive  trust is not automatically justified to undo a property transfer between spouses  even when the purpose of the transfer (in each case, one involving the marital  residence) is to protect against present or future claims by the creditors of  the transferring spouse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> However, those cases are distinguishable, for they  involved what the New York courts found to be genuine transfers that occurred  without an understanding between the parties that the property would remain that  of the transferring spouse. In our case, by contrast, the thrust of the district  court's findings is that ownership was conveyed in name only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lack of an effective conveyance (and the resulting applicability of  constructive trust theory) also answers the argument of Charles and Liliane that  the statute of limitations bars the effort to reach property held in Liliane's  name. Although the New York statute of limitations requires that suit based on  fraudulent conveyance be brought within six years of the transfer or two of  discovery (actual or constructive) of the fraud, Wall St. Assocs. v. Brodsky,  684 N.Y.S.2d 244, 248 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999), that is not the theory of recovery.  In the case of a constructive trust, the limitations period (six years, Maric  Piping, Inc. v. Maric, 705 N.Y.S.2d 684, 685 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000)) begins to  run only when \"the wrongful withholding\" occurs, Augustine v. Szwed, 432  N.Y.S.2d 962, 965 (N.Y. App. Div. 1980); accord Whalen v. Gerzof, 564 N.E.2d  656, 657 (N.Y. 1990), and the original date of transfer is not relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's rationale justifies its judgment to the extent that it  recognizes Goya's right to execute against the identified real property held in  Liliane's name, specifically, the three named properties in New York, Paris, and  Malaga. However, despite its broad literal wording, Goya Foods, 982 F. Supp. at  112, we do not construe the district court judgment as extending to any  residence held in Liliane's name that has not yet been identified in this  litigation. The constructive trust doctrine cannot easily be applied to property  whose identity and circumstances of acquisition are unknown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Emperor Equities. Next, we consider the various issues raised by Liliane's  ownership of Emperor Equities. One set of the real properties at issue were  three condominium apartments in Puerto Rico. One was acquired by Charles in  1968, title being taken in the joint names of Charles and Liliane; in 1971,  during Charles' litigation with Goya, this property was transferred to Emperor,  a corporation whose sole shareholder was Liliane. Two further condominiums in  San Juan were acquired in 1972, after Charles received a large initial payment  from Goya. They too became properties of Emperor. One was transferred in 1983 to  Kalif Trading, but the other remained in Emperor's name until being sold to a  third party in 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its involvement in Charles' and Liliane's real estate transactions,  Emperor was not named as a defendant in Goya's district court action seeking to  reach assets of Charles held in the names of third parties. Liliane says that  this is because Emperor was a Delaware corporation and, as this was also true of  Goya, naming Emperor as the defendant would have destroyed diversity  jurisdiction. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 267 (1806). Liliane  says that it was an error for the district court to order Emperor, a non-party  to the litigation, to forfeit its property, since Emperor was not itself a party  to the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer is that the district court judgment did not purport to reach  properties held by Emperor at all. Instead, as clarified by the amended judgment  of December 14, 1998, the district court directed that the \"stock certificates  and shares\" of Emperor held by Liliane (it is unclear why both words were used)  should be deposited with the court so that they could be used to satisfy the  judgment. Such a judgment was within the district court's power, for Liliane was  a party to the case, and reaching securities that she owns does not require that  the securities' issuer be a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Miscellany.  There remain two other arguments of importance. First, in his  opening brief on appeal, Charles claims that, in seeking to enforce the New  Jersey judgment, Goya overlooked a procedural precondition. Since the New Jersey  judgment was not initially entered by another federal court, it could not merely  be registered in the federal district court in Puerto Rico under 28 U.S.C.   1963 (1994). Rather, enforcement was governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a),  providing that federal proceedings to enforce any out-of-state judgment of a  state court should follow the practice of the state in which the federal  district court sits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles asserts that, under Puerto Rico law, for a foreign judgment to be  enforceable in Commonwealth courts, it must first be validated and domesticated  in an \"exequatur\" proceeding in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. Ex parte  Marquez Estrella, 128 D.P.R. 243, 247-56 (1991). This proceeding allows  interested parties to raise certain limited defenses against the enforcement of  a foreign judgment. Charles says that Goya failed to have the New Jersey  judgment validated in this manner, that the New Jersey judgment was therefore  \"not properly before the District Court,\" and that lack of an exequatur  proceeding deprived Charles of his right to challenge validation of the judgment  on the permitted grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be (we take no position on the matter) that to enforce a state court  judgment in the federal district court in Puerto Rico, there must be a prior  exequatur proceeding<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> or some equivalent opportunity to challenge the  non-Commonwealth judgment in the federal proceeding itself. However, Charles and  Liliane first made their exequatur argument in July 1999, more than a year and a  half after the district court had initially entered judgment against them. Thus,  this argument was not made in a timely fashion, whether viewed as subject to the  ten-day rule of Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or the more relaxed one-year or  reasonable-time restrictions of Fed. R. Civ. 60(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exequatur objection is not one that goes to the district court's subject  matter jurisdiction and which might therefore be exempt from the ordinary  requirements of timeliness. See Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Ceramica Europa II,  Inc., 160 F.3d 849, 852 (1st Cir. 1998). Nor, it is worth adding, is there any  indication that Charles and Liliane were precluded from raising in the district  court any substantive objections to the enforcement of the New Jersey judgment  that might have been asserted in a Commonwealth exequatur proceeding. Charles  did claim that the New Jersey court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment  against him, but he did not pursue this issue on appeal in his opening brief,  and it is therefore forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Liliane claims that the district court erred by entering a default  judgment against her and, later, by not affording her a jury trial even though  the court ultimately allowed her to present her case on the merits. The district  court entered a default against Liliane in March 1997 as a sanction for repeated  failures to comply with court orders. Liliane's earlier demand for a jury trial  was then struck on Goya's motion (no other party having made a timely request  for a jury trial). Nevertheless, at trial the district court reversed field and  allowed Liliane's counsel to offer witnesses and to present a defense, and it  then resolved the claims against her on the merits. At no time during the trial  did Liliane offer an objection to the bench trial or ask the court to reinstate  her jury trial request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, little need be said about Liliane's challenge to the original  default. Although the remedy was severe, it followed obstreperous acts and clear  advance warning from the district court, and it was not an abuse of discretion.  Cf. Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 1999); John's Insulation, Inc. v.  L. Addison &amp; Assocs., Inc., 156 F.3d 101, 108-10 (1st Cir. 1998). The more  troublesome question is whether, insofar as the district court proceeded to try  and decide Liliane's case on the merits, it should also have afforded her the  jury trial she originally demanded. In posing this question, we assume dubitante  that the original jury trial request was proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that a right to jury trial otherwise existed, it was not preserved.  Once the default was effectively withdrawn, Liliane could not proceed to present  her case without telling the district court that she wanted the jury request  reinstated and then, after losing, complain that a jury should have been  afforded. This kind of mouse-trapping, whether deliberate or inadvertent, is  forbidden. Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687-88 (1st Cir. 1994).  A claim to a jury trial can be forfeited just like any other non-jurisdictional  request or objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants present other arguments, including claims that personal jurisdiction  over Charles and Liliane was lacking, that Charles was denied adequate  discovery, that Charles was entitled to rely on Liliane's request for jury  trial, that (according to Charles) New York law does not apply, and that  misconduct by Goya warranted sanction and dismissal. However, all of these  claims have been raised only in reply briefs, and it is well-settled that the  attempt to present issues in this manner is untimely and that such claims  therefore need not be considered. Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d  349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellants argue that a 1974 contractual release given by Goya  precludes Goya's present claims. This argument was admittedly not presented to  the district court and is therefore forfeited in this court. It is doubtful that  such a defense, if not seasonably asserted, could ever be rescued by the plain  error doctrine, but in any event there is no miscarriage of justice in its  forfeiture here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also have made, or at least insinuated, a variety of other  arguments; to the extent these arguments are properly before us, we believe that  they are without merit, and we reject them without detailed discussion. For the  reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is affirmed with the  clarification that insofar as the judgment permits Goya to levy against real  properties held in Liliane's name at the time of judgment, it extends only to  those real properties identified in the district court proceedings and not other  unnamed properties. Appellants have pending a motion for reconsideration of our  prior order striking various exhibits, and we now deny the motion to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The New Jersey judgment was entered, In re Unanue, No. M-128817, slip op.

The judgment creditor is Goya Foods, Inc., a major business  founded in the 1930s which is now a Delaware corporation with its principal  place of business in New Jersey. The debtor is Ulpiano Unanue-Casal, known as  Charles, and his bankruptcy estate. The factual background and prior proceedings  are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the late 1940s until 1969, Charles served as one of the chief officers of  Goya, a company founded by his father. In June 1969, in a quarrel among family  members, Charles was dismissed and litigation ensued. As a result of settlements  in 1972 and 1974, Charles received more than $4 million from Goya and, in  exchange, gave up his interest in Goya. Charles also agreed not to bring any  further claim or suit regarding his father's will or estate. The agreement  provided for liquidated damages of twice the winning side's litigation expenses,  including attorney's fees, if any signatory wrongfully initiated new litigation  against another signatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Charles made a claim for a share of the inheritance from his parents,  and litigation in New Jersey state court followed, with his brothers seeking a  declaration that Charles had no interest in either his father's estate or his  inter vivos trust. In 1990, while the New Jersey litigation proceeded, Charles  filed for bankruptcy in Puerto Rico, and his bankruptcy estate thereafter became  a party to the New Jersey litigation. In February 1995, the New Jersey court  entered a judgment against both Charles and his estate for about $6.9 million,  representing liquidated damages for Goya, a signatory of the 1974 settlement  that Charles had violated by making his inheritance claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, prior to this New Jersey judgment, Goya had begun adversary  proceedings in Charles' bankruptcy case in Puerto Rico, asserting that Charles  was concealing his own assets under the names of his wife, Liliane, and two  other companies, Emperor Equities, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly owned by  Liliane, and Kalif Trading, a Panamanian corporation which was organized by  Charles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On September 12, 1995, the bankruptcy court dismissed Charles'  bankruptcy case without granting him a discharge. In re Unanue-Casal, No.  90-04490, slip op. at 5 (Bankr. D.P.R. Sept. 12, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1995, nine months after obtaining the New Jersey judgment for $6.9  million, Goya brought the present action in federal district court in Puerto  Rico against Charles, Liliane, and Kalif Trading, seeking to enforce the New  Jersey judgment against Charles and against properties that Goya claimed  belonged to Charles but were held in the name of Liliane or Kalif Trading. A  ten-day bench trial ensued in the district court in July 1997, and both Charles  and Liliane testified. On October 31, 1997, the court filed a lengthy decision  in Goya's favor, Goya Foods, Inc. v. Unanue-Casal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1527801\"><a href=\"/opinion/1527801/goya-foods-inc-v-ulpiano-unanue-casal/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span> (D.P.R.  1997). Clarifying amendments to the judgment followed on March 10 and December  14, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Charles was the true owner of specified cash,  securities and various real properties held in the names of Liliane, Emperor  Equities, and Kalif Trading. The court rejected as false assertions by Charles  and Liliane that Kalif Trading was owned by a wealthy Arab (who did not appear  at trial), and that a supposed fortune inherited by Liliane from her family  accounted for various of the real properties held in her name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment, as finally amended, determined that Kalif Trading was Charles'  alter ego and was therefore responsible for the New Jersey judgment to the full  extent of its assets. As for Liliane, the court's judgment provided that Goya  could execute only against the following: (1) the proceeds of the Sutton House  apartment Liliane had earlier owned in New York but since sold; (2) \"any  residence registered to her name, including the Fuengirola, Malaga, Spain villa,  and the Paris apartment\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and (3) the stock of Emperor Equities, all of which  was held in Liliane's name, and which the court directed Liliane to deposit with  the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles, Liliane and Kalif Trading have now appealed from the district court's  judgment. They contest the findings of fact and legal conclusions that led the  district court to impose liability for the New Jersey judgment on property held  in the name Liliane, Kalif Trading and Emperor Equities. They also contend that  the statute of limitations and a contractual release debar Goya's claims and say  that the district court committed various procedural errors. We consider the  merits of those arguments that have not been forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Kalif Trading. It is easiest to begin with the district court's treatment of  Kalif Trading, an off-shore company that Charles organized in 1979 and for which  he and Liliane have had general power of attorney since incorporation. In  November 1980, Charles transferred over $1 million to Kalif Trading in assets  from his own securities account. At about this time, he ceased to pay alimony to  a former wife and also stopped paying taxes, claiming that he no longer had any  income or assets. In August 1983, Kalif Trading was also given title of a  penthouse apartment in Puerto Rico previously held by Emperor Equities and  apparently acquired with Charles' assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Charles claimed that Kalif Trading was owned by one Mohammed Kalif,  but the court found that there was no evidence that Mohammed Kalif existed (he  did not appear at trial), and that the company was a vehicle used by Charles to  conceal his own assets. This finding was supported not only by Charles'  effective control of the assets, but also by his use of Kalif Trading's bank  accounts to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills for Charles and his  wife, by the transfer of assets from Charles to Kalif Trading, and by the timing  of Kalif Trading's creation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In imposing liability on Kalif Trading, the district court applied New York law,  after finding that Puerto Rico courts would apply a \"most significant contacts\"  test, A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading &amp; Prod. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196521\"><a href=\"/opinion/196521/am-capens-co-v-american-trading/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 320 (1st  Cir. 1996), and that New York's contacts with transactions involving Kalif  Trading were greater than those of any other relevant jurisdiction. The brief  filed for Liliane and Kalif Trading does not dispute the decision to apply New  York law; Charles does so in his reply brief, but his arguments are terse,  unpersuasive and too late.

Agosto-Alicea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 354  (1st Cir. 1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under New York law, the corporate veil may be disregarded where the challenger  shows two facts: (1) complete domination of the corporation by its alleged alter  ego, and (2) use of that domination to commit a fraud or wrong against the  plaintiff.

Although veil piercing is usually employed to make an individual  or a corporate parent liable for the debts of a corporation, so-called \"reverse  piercing\" (which makes the corporation liable for the debts of its owner or  parent) is allowed under New York law where the assets at issue are held by the  target corporation and the liability is that of the individual who dominates the  corporation and is using it to perpetrate a fraud or wrong.

Although the district court's decision so  suggests, New York law requires \"clear and convincing\" evidence of such fraud,  Lowendahl v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span>, 76 (N.Y.

Whether or not it was  originally created to shield assets from creditors, it is not a business  separate from Charles, and there is no indication it has any owners other than  Charles. It appears to us, as to the district court, to be nothing other than  Charles himself under another name, and therefore under New York law it is  permissible to strip away the corporate fig leaf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Assets in Liliane's Name. The claim as to Liliane's assets is more  complicated. In 1968, Liliane and Charles took joint title to an apartment in  San Juan, Puerto Rico, and in 1971, during the earlier round of litigation  between Charles and Goya, the title to the apartment was transferred to Emperor  Equities, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly owned by Liliane. During and after  1972, the year in which Charles received the first installment of payments from  Goya, Liliane and Emperor Equities developed a pattern of real estate  acquisitions in which they obtained title to other luxury residences in Puerto  Rico, New York, France, and Spain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Liliane claimed that these properties had been acquired with assets  provided by her once wealthy Bulgarian family. However, the district court  concluded that this story was untrue, being uncorroborated and inconsistent with  other evidence. It also concluded that the properties in question had been  purchased by Charles, who used and enjoyed all of the residences \"and in many  occasions referred to them as his own in letters to third parties.\" Goya Foods,  982 F. Supp. at 112. In substance, the court found that Charles was \"hiding his  assets in the name of his wife for the purpose of impairing his creditors.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liliane's brief makes no persuasive attack on the district court's findings,  which we find were adequately supported. Rather, the brief concentrates its  criticism on the district court's theory of liability. Because the district  court described Liliane as Charles' \"alter ego\" in relation to the acquisitions,  Liliane says that the district court wrongly applied to a human being a theory  that is only valid in relation to corporations. See, e.g., Werner-Jacobsen v.  Bednarik, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1124198\"><a href=\"/opinion/1124198/werner-jacobsen-v-bednarik/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span>, 747-48 (Utah Ct. App. 1997) (\"An individual cannot be  the 'alter ego' of another.\"). Further, says Liliane, property held in her name  belongs to her \"even if it were assumed that Liliane obtained her properties  with Charles' money and not with her own . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's use of the \"alter ego\" language to describe the  relationship between Charles and Liliane may be inapt--no New York decision  appears to use it in such circumstances--and in New York the property of one  spouse certainly is not automatically subject to seizure for the debts of the  other spouse. But New York courts have used the equitable theory of  \"constructive trust\" to allow a third-party creditor to execute judgment on  assets nominally owned by someone other than the debtor but, based on the  court's findings, actually owned by the debtor himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It appears to us  that, in using the alter ego language, the district court meant only that the  properties in question were Charles' property but were merely held in his wife's  name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some circumstances, even an intended transfer of ownership can be set aside.  For example, if a specific transfer from one spouse to another were made without  consideration to defraud a creditor, a different set of New York doctrines  (\"actual or constructive fraud\") could be invoked, see Scola v. Morgan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></span>, 895 (N.Y. App. Div. 1979); 30 N.Y. Jur. 2d Creditors' Rts. &amp;  Remedies  300-71 (1997); but in this case there are no detailed findings with  respect to each of the individual transactions at issue that would establish  fraudulent intent, see In re Montclair Homes, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></span>, 96 (E.D.N.Y. 1996),  or constructive fraud, see N.Y. Debtor &amp; Creditor Law  273-75 (McKinney 1990),  nor did the district court purport to make such findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, under the theory of constructive trust, no such specific findings are  required if the purchases were with Charles' own funds, the transfers of title  to Charles' wife Liliane were merely nominal, and the parties intended that  Charles continue to possess beneficial ownership of the properties. See Bankers  Sec. Life Ins. Soc'y v. Shakerdge, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></span>, 440 (N.Y. 1980). This, in  substance, is what the district court found. It does not make Liliane personally  liable for her husband's debts; but it does mean that the property which he  beneficially owns but which happens to be held in her name can be reached  through the constructive trust doctrine for the benefit of his creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the circumstantial evidence of an implicit understanding is strong. The  timing of the transactions in relation to prospective litigation, Charles'  continued treatment of the properties as his own, the parallels to the deceptive  operation of Kalif Trading, and the inferences to be drawn from Liliane's  baseless claim that the properties were paid for with family funds all  contribute to the conclusion that the real estate in question was Charles' and  not Liliane's. Given that Charles and Liliane's \"agreement\" could be inferred  from the circumstances, see In re Estate of Knappen, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></span>, 111-12  (N.Y.

In our case, by contrast, the thrust of the district  court's findings is that ownership was conveyed in name only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lack of an effective conveyance (and the resulting applicability of  constructive trust theory) also answers the argument of Charles and Liliane that  the statute of limitations bars the effort to reach property held in Liliane's  name. Although the New York statute of limitations requires that suit based on  fraudulent conveyance be brought within six years of the transfer or two of  discovery (actual or constructive) of the fraud, Wall St. Assocs. v. Brodsky,  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></span>, 248 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999), that is not the theory of recovery.  In the case of a constructive trust, the limitations period (six years, Maric  Piping, Inc. v. Maric, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span>, 685 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000)) begins to  run only when \"the wrongful withholding\" occurs, Augustine v. Szwed, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></span>, 965 (N.Y. App. Div. 1980); accord Whalen v. Gerzof, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">656</span></span>, 657 (N.Y. 1990), and the original date of transfer is not relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's rationale justifies its judgment to the extent that it  recognizes Goya's right to execute against the identified real property held in  Liliane's name, specifically, the three named properties in New York, Paris, and  Malaga. However, despite its broad literal wording, Goya Foods, 982 F. Supp. at  112, we do not construe the district court judgment as extending to any  residence held in Liliane's name that has not yet been identified in this  litigation. The constructive trust doctrine cannot easily be applied to property  whose identity and circumstances of acquisition are unknown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Emperor Equities. Next, we consider the various issues raised by Liliane's  ownership of Emperor Equities. One set of the real properties at issue were  three condominium apartments in Puerto Rico. One was acquired by Charles in  1968, title being taken in the joint names of Charles and Liliane; in 1971,  during Charles' litigation with Goya, this property was transferred to Emperor,  a corporation whose sole shareholder was Liliane. Two further condominiums in  San Juan were acquired in 1972, after Charles received a large initial payment  from Goya. They too became properties of Emperor. One was transferred in 1983 to  Kalif Trading, but the other remained in Emperor's name until being sold to a  third party in 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite its involvement in Charles' and Liliane's real estate transactions,  Emperor was not named as a defendant in Goya's district court action seeking to  reach assets of Charles held in the names of third parties. Liliane says that  this is because Emperor was a Delaware corporation and, as this was also true of  Goya, naming Emperor as the defendant would have destroyed diversity  jurisdiction. Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 267 (1806). Liliane  says that it was an error for the district court to order Emperor, a non-party  to the litigation, to forfeit its property, since Emperor was not itself a party  to the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer is that the district court judgment did not purport to reach  properties held by Emperor at all. Instead, as clarified by the amended judgment  of December 14, 1998, the district court directed that the \"stock certificates  and shares\" of Emperor held by Liliane (it is unclear why both words were used)  should be deposited with the court so that they could be used to satisfy the  judgment. Such a judgment was within the district court's power, for Liliane was  a party to the case, and reaching securities that she owns does not require that  the securities' issuer be a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Miscellany.  There remain two other arguments of importance. First, in his  opening brief on appeal, Charles claims that, in seeking to enforce the New  Jersey judgment, Goya overlooked a procedural precondition. Since the New Jersey  judgment was not initially entered by another federal court, it could not merely  be registered in the federal district court in Puerto Rico under 28 U.S.C.   1963 (1994). Rather, enforcement was governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a),  providing that federal proceedings to enforce any out-of-state judgment of a  state court should follow the practice of the state in which the federal  district court sits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles asserts that, under Puerto Rico law, for a foreign judgment to be  enforceable in Commonwealth courts, it must first be validated and domesticated  in an \"exequatur\" proceeding in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. Ex parte  Marquez Estrella, 128 D.P.R. 243, 247-56 (1991). This proceeding allows  interested parties to raise certain limited defenses against the enforcement of  a foreign judgment. Charles says that Goya failed to have the New Jersey  judgment validated in this manner, that the New Jersey judgment was therefore  \"not properly before the District Court,\" and that lack of an exequatur  proceeding deprived Charles of his right to challenge validation of the judgment  on the permitted grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be (we take no position on the matter) that to enforce a state court  judgment in the federal district court in Puerto Rico, there must be a prior  exequatur proceeding<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> or some equivalent opportunity to challenge the  non-Commonwealth judgment in the federal proceeding itself. However, Charles and  Liliane first made their exequatur argument in July 1999, more than a year and a  half after the district court had initially entered judgment against them. Thus,  this argument was not made in a timely fashion, whether viewed as subject to the  ten-day rule of Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or the more relaxed one-year or  reasonable-time restrictions of Fed. R. Civ. 60(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exequatur objection is not one that goes to the district court's subject  matter jurisdiction and which might therefore be exempt from the ordinary  requirements of timeliness. See Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Ceramica Europa II,  Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198220\"><a href=\"/opinion/198220/sea-land-service-v-ceramica-europa-ii/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 852 (1st Cir. 1998). Nor, it is worth adding, is there any  indication that Charles and Liliane were precluded from raising in the district  court any substantive objections to the enforcement of the New Jersey judgment  that might have been asserted in a Commonwealth exequatur proceeding. Charles  did claim that the New Jersey court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment  against him, but he did not pursue this issue on appeal in his opening brief,  and it is therefore forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Liliane claims that the district court erred by entering a default  judgment against her and, later, by not affording her a jury trial even though  the court ultimately allowed her to present her case on the merits. The district  court entered a default against Liliane in March 1997 as a sanction for repeated  failures to comply with court orders. Liliane's earlier demand for a jury trial  was then struck on Goya's motion (no other party having made a timely request  for a jury trial). Nevertheless, at trial the district court reversed field and  allowed Liliane's counsel to offer witnesses and to present a defense, and it  then resolved the claims against her on the merits. At no time during the trial  did Liliane offer an objection to the bench trial or ask the court to reinstate  her jury trial request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, little need be said about Liliane's challenge to the original  default. Although the remedy was severe, it followed obstreperous acts and clear  advance warning from the district court, and it was not an abuse of discretion.  Cf. Faigin v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir. 1999); John's Insulation, Inc. v.  L. Addison &amp; Assocs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198117\"><a href=\"/opinion/198117/johns-v-l-addison/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 108-10 (1st Cir. 1998). The more  troublesome question is whether, insofar as the district court proceeded to try  and decide Liliane's case on the merits, it should also have afforded her the  jury trial she originally demanded. In posing this question, we assume dubitante  that the original jury trial request was proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that a right to jury trial otherwise existed, it was not preserved.  Once the default was effectively withdrawn, Liliane could not proceed to present  her case without telling the district court that she wanted the jury request  reinstated and then, after losing, complain that a jury should have been  afforded. This kind of mouse-trapping, whether deliberate or inadvertent, is  forbidden. Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 687-88 (1st Cir. 1994).  A claim to a jury trial can be forfeited just like any other non-jurisdictional  request or objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants present other arguments, including claims that personal jurisdiction  over Charles and Liliane was lacking, that Charles was denied adequate  discovery, that Charles was entitled to rely on Liliane's request for jury  trial, that (according to Charles) New York law does not apply, and that  misconduct by Goya warranted sanction and dismissal. However, all of these  claims have been raised only in reply briefs, and it is well-settled that the  attempt to present issues in this manner is untimely and that such claims  therefore need not be considered. Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellants argue that a 1974 contractual release given by Goya  precludes Goya's present claims. This argument was admittedly not presented to  the district court and is therefore forfeited in this court. It is doubtful that  such a defense, if not seasonably asserted, could ever be rescued by the plain  error doctrine, but in any event there is no miscarriage of justice in its  forfeiture here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also have made, or at least insinuated, a variety of other  arguments; to the extent these arguments are properly before us, we believe that  they are without merit, and we reject them without detailed discussion. For the  reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is affirmed with the  clarification that insofar as the judgment permits Goya to levy against real  properties held in Liliane's name at the time of judgment, it extends only to  those real properties identified in the district court proceedings and not other  unnamed properties. Appellants have pending a motion for reconsideration of our  prior order striking various exhibits, and we now deny the motion to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The New Jersey judgment was entered, In re Unanue, No. M-128817, slip op.
