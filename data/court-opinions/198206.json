Albert,\r\nFoley, Hoag &amp; Eliot LLP, David J. Stone, Illana B. Chill, Victor L.\r\nHou and Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nNovember 12, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This is an appeal by Ocean Spray\r\nCranberries, Inc. (\"Ocean Spray\") from a district court order\r\ndenying Ocean Spray a preliminary injunction against PepsiCo, Inc.\r\n(\"Pepsi\").  The dispute between the two companies centers on their\r\ndistribution agreement, whose exclusivity clause has apparently\r\nbeen breached by Pepsi.  Although the appeal is not without\r\nsubstance, we sustain the district court's refusal to grant the\r\ninjunctive relief sought.\r\nOcean Spray is an agricultural cooperative owned by about\r\n950 cranberry and citrus growers.  It is a leading producer of\r\ncanned and bottled juices and juice-flavored beverages; its annual \r\nsales appear to be well over $1 billion.  Most of its revenue and\r\nprofits come from so-called \"multiserve\" juice products (containers\r\nwith more than 20 ounces), which are sold through brokers and\r\nwholesalers.\r\nThe issue in this case is Ocean Spray's sale of so-called\r\n\"single-serve\" juice products (containers of 20 ounces or less). \r\nStarting in 1992, Pepsi became Ocean Spray's exclusive distributor\r\nfor single-serve juice products.  By 1997, Ocean Spray was deriving\r\nabout $125 million from the sale of such products through Pepsi's\r\ncompany-owned bottlers.  It earned another $100 million or so by\r\nsales through independent bottlers licensed by Pepsi to handle\r\nPepsi's own products, but the contracts between Ocean Spray and\r\nthese independent Pepsi bottlers are not at issue in this case.\r\nPepsi's company-owned bottlers supply retailers with\r\nPepsi products in territories not served by the independent\r\nlicensed Pepsi bottlers.  When Pepsi became the exclusive\r\ndistributor for Ocean Spray, its company-owned bottlers ceased to\r\nhandle the juices of companies competing with Ocean Spray (such as\r\nWelch's and Mott's).  Since 1992, Ocean Spray has enjoyed the use\r\nof Pepsi's company-owned bottlers not only to distribute Ocean\r\nSpray's single-serve products, but also for a range of related\r\nservices for those products, including promotion, the securing of\r\nnational contracts, purchase of shelf space, and installation of\r\ncoolers in grocery stores and restaurants.  \r\nThe original 1992 agreement between Pepsi and Ocean Spray\r\nwas a long-term agreement but did not work smoothly.  It was\r\nreplaced in 1995 by a new, short-term agreement that Pepsi then\r\nsought to terminate.  Shortly before the termination date, the\r\nparties entered into the present agreement in March 1998; the\r\nagreement provided for Pepsi to distribute through its company-\r\nowned bottlers covered single-serve Ocean Spray juice products. \r\nThe precise definition of a covered single-serve product is not in\r\ndispute.\r\nThe 1998 agreement included Pepsi's promise not only to\r\ndistribute the covered products but also to employ \"reasonable best\r\nefforts\" to promote and sell the Ocean Spray products it\r\ndistributes.  It included exclusivity provisions shortly to be\r\ndescribed.  And since 1991, when the parties first entered into\r\nnegotiations, both have been bound by a separate contract to\r\nprotect each other's confidential information, from marketing and\r\ndistribution strategy to research and product formulae.\r\nThe 1998 agreement is exclusive in both directions.  With\r\nlimited exceptions, Pepsi agreed that it would not distribute any\r\nnoncarbonated juice or juice-containing beverage that competed with\r\ncovered Ocean Spray products.  One limited exception permitted\r\nPepsi to distribute certain juice products that compete with Ocean\r\nSpray covered products if made by Pepsi itself and not acquired\r\nfrom a third party by a stock or asset purchase or otherwise. \r\nConversely, Ocean Spray agreed that it would not distribute--other\r\nthan through Pepsi--its own covered products in the territories of\r\nPepsi bottlers. \r\nThe 1998 agreement provided for termination by either\r\nparty, but the earliest notice Pepsi could give is in 1999, and\r\neven then the agreement was to continue until December 31, 2000. \r\nNevertheless, in July 1998, four months after executing the new\r\ndistribution agreement with Ocean Spray, Pepsi announced that it\r\nwas purchasing Tropicana Products, Inc. (\"Tropicana\"), a leading\r\nproducer of juices and a major competitor of Ocean Spray,\r\nespecially in the supply of single-serve containers of orange\r\njuice.\r\nOn August 10, 1998, Ocean Spray filed a complaint and\r\nmotion for preliminary injunction in the district court.  Ocean\r\nSpray charged that Pepsi was breaching the 1998 distribution\r\nagreement, which barred it from distributing \"directly or\r\nindirectly\"  products that competed with Ocean Spray's covered\r\nsingle-serve products.  Specifically, Ocean Spray sought to enjoin\r\nTropicana \"upon acquisition by Pepsi\" from selling competing\r\nsingle-serve juice products for the duration of the Pepsi-Ocean\r\nSpray 1998 agreement.  Pepsi's acquisition of Tropicana was\r\ncompleted on August 25, 1998.  \r\nPepsi opposed Ocean Spray's motion in the district court,\r\nand both sides filed extensive affidavits.  On August 20, 1998, the\r\ndistrict court entered an order denying Ocean Spray's motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction, and on September 4, 1998, the district\r\ncourt entered a memorandum and order reaffirming the denial and\r\nsetting forth reasons.  The primary basis for denying the\r\npreliminary injunction was a finding of lack of irreparable injury\r\nto Ocean Spray.  \r\nOn this appeal, Ocean Spray argues that Pepsi has\r\nbreached its exclusivity obligation under the 1998 agreement, that\r\nPepsi will inevitably (if it has not already) violate the best\r\nefforts and confidentiality agreements, and that damages would be\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to calculate fully.  Pepsi insists\r\nthat its company-owned bottlers continue faithfully to distribute\r\nand market Ocean Spray products and will not handle competing\r\nTropicana products during the remainder of the 1998 agreement's\r\nterm.  Pepsi also denies that it has breached or will breach the\r\nconfidentiality agreement.   \r\nUnder federal law, a preliminary injunction depends upon\r\nthe familiar four-part test requiring the moving party to show\r\nlikelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury, and a\r\nfavorable balance of the equities, including effects on the public\r\ninterest.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., F.3d\r\n12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996).  Massachusetts standards for a preliminary\r\ninjunction do not seem markedly different, see Packaging Indus.\r\nGroup, Inc. v. Cheney, 405 N.E.2d 106, 112 (Mass. 1980), and in any\r\nevent, neither side here argues that there is a pertinent state-law\r\ndifference that would govern a federal court in a diversity matter. \r\nCf. A.W. Chesterton Co., Inc. v. Chesterton, 907 F. Supp. 19, 25\r\nn.9 (D. Mass. 1995).  The standard of review in this court is\r\ndeferential.\r\nIn this case, Pepsi scarcely disputes that the\r\nacquisition of Tropicana violated its exclusivity obligation under\r\nthe agreement as long as Tropicana continues to distribute covered\r\nproducts.  Ocean Spray seizes on this (occasionally hedged)\r\nconcession to argue that the only remaining issue is irreparable\r\ninjury; it assumes that the equities are favorable to it (Pepsi's\r\nbreach being deliberate), and that the public interest is served by\r\nforcing businesses to adhere to their contracts.  The situation is\r\nslightly more complicated than Ocean Spray suggests.  \r\nThe likelihood of success that is relevant here where an\r\ninjunction is sought is the likelihood that Ocean Spray would,\r\nafter  trial, be entitled to a permanent injunction to restrain\r\nTropicana  from distributing competing products during the duration\r\nof the 1998 agreement.  One might suppose that such relief would\r\nfollow from Pepsi's concession that Pepsi's ownership of Tropicana\r\nis itself a breach of the exclusivity clause.  Instead, as first-\r\nyear law students quickly learn, the enforcement of contracts by\r\ninjunction is the exception rather than the rule.\r\nHistorically, equity would not supply relief where legal\r\nremedies sufficed, and damages at law usually do provide remedies\r\nfor breach of contract. See Farnsworth, Contracts  12.4, at 852\r\n(2d ed. 1990).  A famous formulation is Justice Holmes's statement\r\nthat \"[t]he duty to keep a contract in law means a prediction that\r\nyou must pay damages if you do not keep it,--and nothing else.\" \r\nHolmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 462 (1897). \r\nModern theorists have explained why it is often \"efficient\" to\r\nlimit the remedy to damages and exclude injunctive relief.  E.g.,\r\nPatton v. Mid-Continent Sys., Inc., 841 F.2d 742, 750 (7th Cir.\r\n1988) (Posner, J.).\r\nStill, injunctive relief requiring performance of a\r\ncontract may ordinarily be granted (if other prerequisites are met)\r\nwhere monetary damages will not afford complete relief.  A common\r\nexample is agreements involving the sale of real property; specific\r\nperformance is often granted because property is considered unique. \r\nSee, e.g., Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Property  Co., 966 F.2d 273,\r\n278 (7th Cir. 1992).  The same principle applies where harm caused\r\nby a breach, although economic in nature, is impossible to measure\r\naccurately.  See Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 19.\r\nAccurate measurement, of course, is a matter of degree. \r\nCourts have sometimes refused injunctions to enforce franchise or\r\nsimilar contracts involving ongoing business relationships--\r\nsituations in which it would ordinarily be difficult to prove with\r\nperfect accuracy the revenues lost as a result of the breach.  \r\nSee, e.g., Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d\r\n70, 72 (2d Cir. 1979); Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Audi of America,\r\nInc., 755 F. Supp. 30, 33 (D. Mass. 1991).  Thus, some measure of\r\nuncertainty does not automatically avoid Holmes's precept.\r\nYet in other cases, uncertainty has been deemed to\r\nwarrant injunctions.  For example, in K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental\r\nPlaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907 (1st Cir. 1989), this court upheld a\r\npreliminary injunction for K-Mart where a shopping mall-landlord\r\nthreatened to construct new retail space in a parking lot in front\r\nof the K-Mart, apparently contrary to the terms of the parties' 20-\r\nyear lease agreement.  We agreed that \"the loss of revenues\r\nresulting from considerations such as diminished visibility,\r\nrestricted access, less commodious parking, and the like are\r\nsufficiently problematic as to defy precise dollar quantification.\" \r\nId. at 915.\r\nIn this case, Pepsi's acquisition of Tropicana alters its\r\nincentives to promote Ocean Spray if--and this is a large \"if\"--one\r\ndisregards possible sanctions against Pepsi.  Without Tropicana,\r\nPepsi's incentives in pricing and promotion of Ocean Spray's\r\ncovered products are largely aligned with those of Ocean Spray,\r\nassuming that the distribution contract was competently drafted. \r\nAs one of Ocean Spray's experts points out in his affidavit,\r\nTropicana's acquisition inserts a conflicting incentive, namely,\r\nthat successful promotion of Ocean Spray can take sales away from\r\nTropicana, in which Pepsi now has an economic interest.\r\nOf course, the change in incentive is limited.  The\r\ncustomer sales representatives who work for Pepsi's company-owned\r\nbottlers apparently receive compensation based on a percentage of\r\nsales.  Pepsi also has an incentive to keep content the retailers\r\nto whom it supplies Pepsi, as well as Ocean Spray, products. \r\nStill, especially at higher levels of the Pepsi company, strategy\r\nas to distribution, Pepsi's pricing of Ocean Spray products, its\r\npromotion expenditures, and other decisions could be affected by\r\nthe prospect that Pepsi's long-term interests are now aligned with\r\nTropicana.\r\nOcean Spray's affidavit also makes a plausible case that,\r\nto the extent that Pepsi does slacken its efforts to promote Ocean\r\nSpray's covered products during the remaining (probably brief) life\r\nof the 1998 agreement, the impact could go beyond the loss of sales\r\nand profits.  One affiant points to so-called \"spillover\" effects\r\nby which diminished promotion of Ocean Spray's widely available\r\nsingle-serve products could in turn diminish sales of its larger\r\ncontainer products; and consequences may endure beyond the\r\ntermination of the agreement, whether viewed as longer-term loss of\r\nsales or impairment of  the value of Ocean Spray's trademark. \r\nDamages may be difficult to prove with complete accuracy.\r\nNevertheless, there is another side to the story.  Pepsi\r\nand Ocean Spray have a relationship stretching back to 1992;\r\nalthough the contracts differed during this period, this history\r\nprovides some benchmark for making judgments as to Pepsi's future\r\nefforts.  Prior sales levels and other prior conduct of Pepsi vis\r\nvis Ocean Spray's products, may make it much easier for Ocean\r\nSpray to detect Pepsi's failure to use its best efforts hereafter\r\nto promote Ocean Spray's products.  Certainly difficulties in\r\ndetecting immediate lost sales and profits appear to be\r\nconsiderably less than in calculating the amount of spillover or\r\nlong-term effects.\r\nIf we assume that any slackening of effort can be\r\ndetected, Pepsi has counter-incentives to continue behaving as it\r\nwould if Tropicana had never been acquired.  While contract\r\nviolations do not normally give rise to punitive damages, a\r\ndeliberate breach of Pepsi's best efforts obligations could give\r\nrise to multiple damages under Massachusetts's chapter 93A, a claim\r\nthat Ocean Spray has already asserted in its complaint.  And there\r\nis nothing that would prevent Ocean Spray from renewing its request\r\nfor injunctive relief if it could detect and establish that Pepsi\r\nwas not using its best efforts on behalf of Ocean Spray.\r\nIn this important respect, Ocean Spray's situation is\r\nvery different from that of the plaintiffs in K-Mart and Ross\r\nSimons.  There, the defendants' proposed actions would have had\r\nimmediate adverse effect on the plaintiffs (construction of an\r\nobstructing building in one case and the cut-off of supplies in the\r\nother).  Here, Pepsi's company-owned bottler distribution channel\r\nremains open to Ocean Spray, and the only question is whether Pepsi\r\nwill let its pricing and promotion behavior be influenced by the\r\nTropicana acquisition.  Although businesses act in their economic\r\nbest interests, those interests in this case include avoiding\r\nmultiple damages and the risk of devastating injunctive relief.\r\nThe second consideration is duration.  Pepsi can give\r\nnotice of termination as early as January 1, 1999 (although it\r\nwould then continue distributing Ocean Spray until the end of the\r\nyear 2000).  Ocean Spray had to know that during that contractually\r\nestablished transition period Pepsi might consider aligning its\r\nfortunes with another supplier.  In fact, the 1998 agreement\r\nprovided for arbitration if there was a claim by Ocean Spray of\r\nlost sales during this transition.\r\nThis is in stark contrast to a case like K-Mart in which\r\nthe obligation being breached was a 20-year commitment.  See K-\r\nMart, 875 F.2d at 915-16.  Not only is the harm potentially much\r\ngreater as the period stretches out, but so also the difficulties\r\nof calculating damages.  See id.  We do not say that there is some\r\nbasic dividing line between one year and 20, but only that this is\r\na further consideration that limits the significance of any claim\r\nof irreparable damages.\r\nFinally, if Pepsi did wrongfully reduce its efforts on\r\nbehalf of Ocean Spray and that fact were proved, the jury would\r\nthen be entitled to very considerable latitude in estimating the\r\ndamages, both from direct and indirect effects.  It is well settled\r\nthat the jury is given a good deal of freedom in estimating damages\r\nagainst a defendant who created the risk of uncertainty as to\r\ndamages by its own wrongdoing.  See Jay Edwards, Inc. v. New\r\nEngland Toyota Distrib., Inc., 708 F.2d 814, 821 (1st Cir. 1983),\r\ncert. denied, 104 S. Ct. 241 (1983); Computer Sys. Eng., Inc. v.\r\nQantel Corp., 740 F.2d 59, 67 (1st Cir. 1984) (Massachusetts law). \r\nAnd, if any up-side error is likely to be doubled or tripled under\r\nchapter 93A, the risks for Pepsi are multiplied.\r\nOne other consideration affecting equities although not\r\ndamages is the drastic relief sought by Ocean Spray.  Effectively,\r\nOcean Spray is asking that after the acquisition, Tropicana be\r\nforbidden from continuing to use its own channels to distribute its\r\nown single-serve juices at all in geographic areas in which Ocean\r\nSpray distributes its competing products.  Tropicana is a leading\r\ncompetitor, and the effect of so drastic a solution would be\r\ngreatly to benefit Ocean Spray by undercutting competition from\r\nTropicana that existed long before the acquisition was a twinkle in\r\nPepsi's eye.\r\nWe turn now to a different claim by Ocean Spray:  that\r\nPepsi has breached and will continue to breach its obligation under\r\nthe 1991 agreement to keep confidential Ocean Spray's business\r\ninformation.  Ocean Spray complains that at the top level of Pepsi\r\nmanagement, the same individuals are responsible not only for Ocean\r\nSpray but for Tropicana.  Ocean Spray points to cases in which the\r\ncourts have granted injunctions merely to prevent conduct creating\r\na risk that confidential information will be divulged or misused. \r\nSee, e.g., Crane Co. v. Briggs Manufacturing Co., 280 F.2d 747, 750\r\n(6th Cir. 1960); Lumex, Inc. v. Highsmith, 919 F. Supp. 624, 636\r\n(E.D.N.Y. 1996).\r\nOcean Spray does not spend much time on this issue in its\r\nbrief, addressing it in only a few paragraphs.  The case law\r\nsuggests that almost everything turns upon the facts, including the\r\nnature of the transaction, the threat of wrongful disclosure, the\r\nconsequences if it occurs, and the reach of the relief sought. \r\nNothing that we can discern in reviewing the affidavits persuades\r\nus that there is anything inevitable about the misuse by Pepsi of\r\nwhatever information Ocean Spray has given or chooses to give in\r\nthe future.\r\nFurthermore, Ocean Spray's claim as to disclosure is\r\noffered only to support the far-reaching injunction it seeks\r\nrestraining Tropicana from distributing competing products for the\r\nlife of the agreement.  Nothing prevents Ocean Spray from seeking\r\nnarrower relief, if this should prove warranted, enjoining the\r\nmisuse of confidential information, limiting its distribution\r\nwithin Pepsi, or otherwise tailoring relief to meet the claimed\r\nthreat of harm.  Whether blatant misuse might justify even broader\r\nrelief against Tropicana's distribution activity is an issue that\r\nneed not now be faced.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

On August 20, 1998, the district court entered an order denying Ocean Spray's motion for a preliminary injunction, and on September 4, 1998, the district court entered a memorandum and order reaffirming the denial and setting forth reasons.  The primary basis for denying the preliminary injunction was a finding of lack of irreparable injury to Ocean Spray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Ocean Spray argues that Pepsi has breached its exclusivity obligation under the 1998 agreement, that Pepsi will inevitably (if it has not already) violate the best efforts and confidentiality agreements, and that damages would be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate fully.  Pepsi insists that its company-owned bottlers continue faithfully to distribute and market Ocean Spray products and will not handle competing Tropicana products during the remainder of the 1998 agreement's term.  Pepsi also denies that it has breached or will breach the confidentiality agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under federal law, a preliminary injunction depends upon the familiar four-part test requiring the moving party to show likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury, and a favorable balance of the equities, including effects on the public interest.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1996).  Massachusetts standards for a preliminary injunction do not seem markedly different, see Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609, 405 N.E.2d 106, 112 (Mass.1980), and in any event, neither side here argues that there is a pertinent state-law difference that would govern a federal court in a diversity matter.  Cf. A.W. Chesterton Co., Inc. v. Chesterton, 907 F.Supp. 19, 25 n. 9 (D.Mass.1995).  The standard of review in this court is deferential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Pepsi scarcely disputes that the acquisition of Tropicana violated its exclusivity obligation under the agreement as long as Tropicana continues to distribute covered products.  Ocean Spray seizes on this (occasionally hedged) concession to argue that the only remaining issue is irreparable injury;  it assumes that the equities are favorable to it (Pepsi's breach being deliberate), and that the public interest is served by forcing businesses to adhere to their contracts.  The situation is slightly more complicated than Ocean Spray suggests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The likelihood of success that is relevant here where an injunction is sought is the likelihood that Ocean Spray would, after trial, be entitled to a permanent injunction to restrain Tropicana from distributing competing products during the duration of the 1998 agreement.  One might suppose that such relief would follow from Pepsi's concession that Pepsi's ownership of Tropicana is itself a breach of the exclusivity clause.  Instead, as first-year law students quickly learn, the enforcement of contracts by injunction is the exception rather than the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, equity would not supply relief where legal remedies sufficed, and damages at law usually do provide remedies for breach of contract.  See Farnsworth, Contracts &#167; 12.4, at 852 (2d ed.1990).  A famous formulation is Justice Holmes's statement that \"[t]he duty to keep a contract in law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it,--and nothing else.\"   Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.  L.Rev. 457, 462 (1897).  Modern theorists have explained why it is often \"efficient\" to limit the remedy to damages and exclude injunctive relief.  E.g., Patton v. Mid-Continent Sys., Inc., 841 F.2d 742, 750 (7th Cir.1988) (Posner, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, injunctive relief requiring performance of a contract may ordinarily be granted (if other prerequisites are met) where monetary damages will not afford complete relief.  A common example is agreements involving the sale of real property;  specific performance is often granted because property is considered unique.  See, e.g., Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Property Co., 966 F.2d 273, 278 (7th Cir.1992).  The same principle applies where harm caused by a breach, although economic in nature, is impossible to measure accurately.  See Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accurate measurement, of course, is a matter of degree.  Courts have sometimes refused injunctions to enforce franchise or similar contracts involving ongoing business relationships--situations in which it would ordinarily be difficult to prove with perfect accuracy the revenues lost as a result of the breach.  See, e.g., Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1979);  Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Audi of America, Inc., 755 F.Supp. 30, 33 (D.Mass.1991).  Thus, some measure of uncertainty does not automatically avoid Holmes's precept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in other cases, uncertainty has been deemed to warrant injunctions.  For example, in K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907 (1st Cir.1989), this court upheld a preliminary injunction for K-Mart where a shopping mall-landlord threatened to construct new retail space in a parking lot in front of the K-Mart, apparently contrary to the terms of the parties' 20-year lease agreement.  We agreed that \"the loss of revenues resulting from considerations such as diminished visibility, restricted access, less commodious parking, and the like are sufficiently problematic as to defy precise dollar quantification.\"  Id. at 915.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Pepsi's acquisition of Tropicana alters its incentives to promote Ocean Spray if--and this is a large \"if\"--one disregards possible sanctions against Pepsi.  Without Tropicana, Pepsi's incentives in pricing and promotion of Ocean Spray's covered products are largely aligned with those of Ocean Spray, assuming that the distribution contract was competently drafted.  As one of Ocean Spray's experts points out in his affidavit, Tropicana's acquisition inserts a conflicting incentive, namely, that successful promotion of Ocean Spray can take sales away from Tropicana, in which Pepsi now has an economic interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the change in incentive is limited.  The customer sales representatives who work for Pepsi's company-owned bottlers apparently receive compensation based on a percentage of sales.  Pepsi also has an incentive to keep content the retailers to whom it supplies Pepsi, as well as Ocean Spray, products.  Still, especially at higher levels of the Pepsi company, strategy as to distribution, Pepsi's pricing of Ocean Spray products its promotion expenditures, and other decisions could be affected by the prospect that Pepsi's long-term interests are now aligned with Tropicana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocean Spray's affidavit also makes a plausible case that, to the extent that Pepsi does slacken its efforts to promote Ocean Spray's covered products during the remaining (probably brief) life of the 1998 agreement, the impact could go beyond the loss of sales and profits.  One affiant points to so-called \"spillover\" effects by which diminished promotion of Ocean Spray's widely available single-serve products could in turn diminish sales of its larger container products;  and consequences may endure beyond the termination of the agreement, whether viewed as longer-term loss of sales or impairment of the value of Ocean Spray's trademark.  Damages may be difficult to prove with complete accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there is another side to the story.  Pepsi and Ocean Spray have a relationship stretching back to 1992;  although the contracts differed during this period, this history provides some benchmark for making judgments as to Pepsi's future efforts.  Prior sales levels and other prior conduct of Pepsi vis a vis Ocean Spray's products, may make it much easier for Ocean Spray to detect Pepsi's failure to use its best efforts hereafter to promote Ocean Spray's products.  Certainly difficulties in detecting immediate lost sales and profits appear to be considerably less than in calculating the amount of spillover or long-term effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we assume that any slackening of effort can be detected, Pepsi has counter-incentives to continue behaving as it would if Tropicana had never been acquired.  While contract violations do not normally give rise to punitive damages, a deliberate breach of Pepsi's best efforts obligations could give rise to multiple damages under Massachusetts's chapter 93A, a claim that Ocean Spray has already asserted in its complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And there is nothing that would prevent Ocean Spray from renewing its request for injunctive relief if it could detect and establish that Pepsi was not using its best efforts on behalf of Ocean Spray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this important respect, Ocean Spray's situation is very different from that of the plaintiffs in K-Mart and Ross-Simons.   There, the defendants' proposed actions would have had immediate adverse effect on the plaintiffs (construction of an obstructing building in one case and the cut-off of supplies in the other).  Here, Pepsi's company-owned bottler distribution channel remains open to Ocean Spray, and the only question is whether Pepsi will let its pricing and promotion behavior be influenced by the Tropicana acquisition.  Although businesses act in their economic best interests, those interests in this case include avoiding multiple damages and the risk of devastating injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second consideration is duration.  Pepsi can give notice of termination as early as January 1, 1999 (although it would then continue distributing Ocean Spray until the end of the year 2000).  Ocean Spray had to know that during that contractually established transition period Pepsi might consider aligning its fortunes with another supplier.  In fact, the 1998 agreement provided for arbitration if there were a claim by Ocean Spray of lost sales during this transition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is in stark contrast to a case like K-Mart in which the obligation being breached was a 20-year commitment.  See KMart, 875 F.2d at 915-16.   Not only is the harm potentially much greater as the period stretches out, but so also the difficulties of calculating damages.  See id.   We do not say that there is some basic dividing line between one year and 20, but only that this is a further consideration that limits the significance of any claim of irreparable damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, if Pepsi did wrongfully reduce its efforts on behalf of Ocean Spray and that fact were proved, the jury would then be entitled to very considerable latitude in estimating the damages, both from direct and indirect effects.  It is well settled that the jury is given a good deal of freedom in estimating damages against a defendant who created the risk of uncertainty as to damages by its own wrongdoing.  See Jay Edwards, Inc. v. New England Toyota Distrib., Inc., 708 F.2d 814, 821 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 894, 104 S.Ct. 241, 78 L.Ed.2d 231 (1983);  Computer Sys. Eng., Inc. v. Qantel Corp., 740 F.2d 59, 67 (1st Cir.1984) (Massachusetts law).  And, if any up-side error is likely to be doubled or tripled under chapter 93A, the risks for Pepsi are multiplied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other consideration affecting equities although not damages is the drastic relief sought by Ocean Spray.  Effectively, Ocean Spray is asking that after the acquisition, Tropicana be forbidden from continuing to use its own channels to distribute its own single-serve juices at all in geographic areas in which Ocean Spray distributes its competing products.  Tropicana is a leading competitor, and the effect of so drastic a solution would be greatly to benefit Ocean Spray by undercutting competition from Tropicana that existed long before the acquisition was a twinkle in Pepsi's eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to a different claim by Ocean Spray:  that Pepsi has breached and will continue to breach its obligation under the 1991 agreement to keep confidential Ocean Spray's business information.  Ocean Spray complains that at the top level of Pepsi management, the same individuals are responsible not only for Ocean Spray but for Tropicana.  Ocean Spray points to cases in which the courts have granted injunctions merely to prevent conduct creating a risk that confidential information will be divulged or misused.  See, e.g., Crane Co. v. Briggs Manufacturing Co., 280 F.2d 747, 750 (6th Cir.1960);  Lumex, Inc. v. Highsmith, 919 F.Supp. 624, 636 (E.D.N.Y.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocean Spray does not spend much time on this issue in its brief, addressing it in only a few paragraphs.  The case law suggests that almost everything turns upon the facts, including the nature of the transaction, the threat of wrongful disclosure, the consequences if it occurs, and the reach of the relief sought.  Nothing that we can discern in reviewing the affidavits persuades us that there is anything inevitable about the misuse by Pepsi of whatever information Ocean Spray has given or chooses to give in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Ocean Spray's claim as to disclosure is offered only to support the far-reaching injunction it seeks restraining Tropicana from distributing competing products for the life of the agreement.  Nothing prevents Ocean Spray from seeking narrower relief, if this should prove warranted, enjoining the misuse of confidential information, limiting its distribution within Pepsi, or otherwise tailoring relief to meet the claimed threat of harm.  Whether blatant misuse might justify even broader relief against Tropicana's distribution activity is an issue that need not now be faced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The usual rubric refers to abuse of discretion, see Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16, but this phrasing is most pertinent to issues of judgment and the balancing of conflicting factors;  rulings on abstract legal issues remain reviewable de novo, and findings of fact are assessed for clear error, see American Bd. of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc. v.

Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 2 (1997).  The statute allows for double or treble damages for its willful or knowing violation.  See id. &#167; 11.  Under this statutory scheme, courts have made clear that breach of contract \" 'in disregard of known contractual arrangements' and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party\" may give rise to 93A liability.

(\"Ocean Spray\") from a district court order denying Ocean Spray a preliminary injunction against PepsiCo, Inc.  (\"Pepsi\").  The dispute between the two companies centers on their distribution agreement, whose exclusivity clause has apparently been breached by Pepsi.  Although the appeal is not without substance, we sustain the district court's refusal to grant the injunctive relief sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocean Spray is an agricultural cooperative owned by about 950 cranberry and citrus growers.  It is a leading producer of canned and bottled juices and juice-flavored beverages;  its annual sales appear to be well over $1 billion.  Most of its revenue and profits come from so-called \"multiserve\" juice products (containers with more than 20 ounces), which are sold through brokers and wholesalers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue in this case is Ocean Spray's sale of so-called \"single-serve\" juice products (containers of 20 ounces or less).  Starting in 1992, Pepsi became Ocean Spray's exclusive distributor for single-serve juice products.  By 1997, Ocean Spray was deriving about $125 million from the sale of such products through Pepsi's company-owned bottlers.  It earned another $100 million or so by sales through independent bottlers licensed by Pepsi to handle Pepsi's own products, but the contracts between Ocean Spray and these independent Pepsi bottlers are not at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pepsi's company-owned bottlers supply retailers with Pepsi products in territories not served by the independent licensed Pepsi bottlers.  When Pepsi became the exclusive distributor for Ocean Spray, its company-owned bottlers ceased to handle the juices of companies competing with Ocean Spray (such as Welch's and Mott's).  Since 1992, Ocean Spray has enjoyed the use of Pepsi's company-owned bottlers not only to distribute Ocean Spray's single-serve products, but also for a range of related services for those products, including promotion, the securing of national contracts, purchase of shelf space, and installation of coolers in grocery stores and restaurants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original 1992 agreement between Pepsi and Ocean Spray was a long-term agreement but did not work smoothly.  It was replaced in 1995 by a new, short-term agreement that Pepsi then sought to terminate.  Shortly before the termination date, the parties entered into the present agreement in March 1998;  the agreement provided for Pepsi to distribute through its company-owned bottlers covered single-serve Ocean Spray juice products.  The precise definition of a covered single-serve product is not in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1998 agreement included Pepsi's promise not only to distribute the covered products but also to employ \"reasonable best efforts\" to promote and sell the Ocean Spray products it distributes.  It included exclusivity provisions shortly to be described.  And since 1991, when the parties first entered into negotiations, both have been bound by a separate contract to protect each other's confidential information, from marketing and distribution strategy to research and product formulae.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1998 agreement is exclusive in both directions.  With limited exceptions, Pepsi agreed that it would not distribute any noncarbonated juice or juice-containing beverage that competed with covered Ocean Spray products.  One limited exception permitted Pepsi to distribute certain juice products that compete with Ocean Spray covered products if made by Pepsi itself and not acquired from a third party by a stock or asset purchase or otherwise.  Conversely, Ocean Spray agreed that it would not distribute--other than through Pepsi--its own covered products in the territories of Pepsi bottlers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1998 agreement provided for termination by either party, but the earliest notice Pepsi could give is in 1999, and even then the agreement was to continue until December 31, 2000.  Nevertheless, in July 1998, four months after executing the new distribution agreement with Ocean Spray, Pepsi announced that it was purchasing Tropicana Products, Inc.  (\"Tropicana\"), a leading producer of juices and a major competitor of Ocean Spray, especially in the supply of single-serve containers of orange juice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 10, 1998, Ocean Spray filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction in the district court.  Ocean Spray charged that Pepsi was breaching the 1998 distribution agreement, which barred it from distributing \"directly or indirectly\" products that competed with Ocean Spray's covered single-serve products.  Specifically, Ocean Spray sought to enjoin Tropicana \"upon acquisition by Pepsi\" from selling competing single-serve juice products for the duration of the Pepsi-Ocean Spray 1998 agreement.  Pepsi's acquisition of Tropicana was completed on August 25, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pepsi opposed Ocean Spray's motion in the district court, and both sides filed extensive affidavits.  On August 20, 1998, the district court entered an order denying Ocean Spray's motion for a preliminary injunction, and on September 4, 1998, the district court entered a memorandum and order reaffirming the denial and setting forth reasons.  The primary basis for denying the preliminary injunction was a finding of lack of irreparable injury to Ocean Spray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Ocean Spray argues that Pepsi has breached its exclusivity obligation under the 1998 agreement, that Pepsi will inevitably (if it has not already) violate the best efforts and confidentiality agreements, and that damages would be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate fully.  Pepsi insists that its company-owned bottlers continue faithfully to distribute and market Ocean Spray products and will not handle competing Tropicana products during the remainder of the 1998 agreement's term.  Pepsi also denies that it has breached or will breach the confidentiality agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under federal law, a preliminary injunction depends upon the familiar four-part test requiring the moving party to show likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury, and a favorable balance of the equities, including effects on the public interest.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1996).  Massachusetts standards for a preliminary injunction do not seem markedly different, see Packaging Indus.

The standard of review in this court is deferential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Pepsi scarcely disputes that the acquisition of Tropicana violated its exclusivity obligation under the agreement as long as Tropicana continues to distribute covered products.  Ocean Spray seizes on this (occasionally hedged) concession to argue that the only remaining issue is irreparable injury;  it assumes that the equities are favorable to it (Pepsi's breach being deliberate), and that the public interest is served by forcing businesses to adhere to their contracts.  The situation is slightly more complicated than Ocean Spray suggests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The likelihood of success that is relevant here where an injunction is sought is the likelihood that Ocean Spray would, after trial, be entitled to a permanent injunction to restrain Tropicana from distributing competing products during the duration of the 1998 agreement.  One might suppose that such relief would follow from Pepsi's concession that Pepsi's ownership of Tropicana is itself a breach of the exclusivity clause.  Instead, as first-year law students quickly learn, the enforcement of contracts by injunction is the exception rather than the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, equity would not supply relief where legal remedies sufficed, and damages at law usually do provide remedies for breach of contract.  See Farnsworth, Contracts &#167; 12.4, at 852 (2d ed.1990).  A famous formulation is Justice Holmes's statement that \"[t]he duty to keep a contract in law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it,--and nothing else.\"   Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.  L.Rev. 457, 462 (1897).  Modern theorists have explained why it is often \"efficient\" to limit the remedy to damages and exclude injunctive relief.  E.g., Patton v. Mid-Continent Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502737\"><a href=\"/opinion/502737/james-patton-rl-hildebrand-burns-harbor-plaza-inc-and-rl/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 750 (7th Cir.1988) (Posner, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, injunctive relief requiring performance of a contract may ordinarily be granted (if other prerequisites are met) where monetary damages will not afford complete relief.  A common example is agreements involving the sale of real property;  specific performance is often granted because property is considered unique.  See, e.g., Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Property Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584238\"><a href=\"/opinion/584238/walgreen-company-v-sara-creek-property-company-b-v-aka-sara-creek/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 278 (7th Cir.1992).  The same principle applies where harm caused by a breach, although economic in nature, is impossible to measure accurately.  See Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accurate measurement, of course, is a matter of degree.  Courts have sometimes refused injunctions to enforce franchise or similar contracts involving ongoing business relationships--situations in which it would ordinarily be difficult to prove with perfect accuracy the revenues lost as a result of the breach.  See, e.g., Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365454\"><a href=\"/opinion/365454/jackson-dairy-inc-v-h-p-hood-sons-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 72 (2d Cir.1979);  Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Audi of America, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></span>, 33 (D.Mass.1991).  Thus, some measure of uncertainty does not automatically avoid Holmes's precept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in other cases, uncertainty has been deemed to warrant injunctions.  For example, in K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524046\"><a href=\"/opinion/524046/k-mart-corporation-v-oriental-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989), this court upheld a preliminary injunction for K-Mart where a shopping mall-landlord threatened to construct new retail space in a parking lot in front of the K-Mart, apparently contrary to the terms of the parties' 20-year lease agreement.  We agreed that \"the loss of revenues resulting from considerations such as diminished visibility, restricted access, less commodious parking, and the like are sufficiently problematic as to defy precise dollar quantification.\"  Id. at 915.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Pepsi's acquisition of Tropicana alters its incentives to promote Ocean Spray if--and this is a large \"if\"--one disregards possible sanctions against Pepsi.  Without Tropicana, Pepsi's incentives in pricing and promotion of Ocean Spray's covered products are largely aligned with those of Ocean Spray, assuming that the distribution contract was competently drafted.  As one of Ocean Spray's experts points out in his affidavit, Tropicana's acquisition inserts a conflicting incentive, namely, that successful promotion of Ocean Spray can take sales away from Tropicana, in which Pepsi now has an economic interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the change in incentive is limited.  The customer sales representatives who work for Pepsi's company-owned bottlers apparently receive compensation based on a percentage of sales.  Pepsi also has an incentive to keep content the retailers to whom it supplies Pepsi, as well as Ocean Spray, products.  Still, especially at higher levels of the Pepsi company, strategy as to distribution, Pepsi's pricing of Ocean Spray products its promotion expenditures, and other decisions could be affected by the prospect that Pepsi's long-term interests are now aligned with Tropicana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocean Spray's affidavit also makes a plausible case that, to the extent that Pepsi does slacken its efforts to promote Ocean Spray's covered products during the remaining (probably brief) life of the 1998 agreement, the impact could go beyond the loss of sales and profits.  One affiant points to so-called \"spillover\" effects by which diminished promotion of Ocean Spray's widely available single-serve products could in turn diminish sales of its larger container products;  and consequences may endure beyond the termination of the agreement, whether viewed as longer-term loss of sales or impairment of the value of Ocean Spray's trademark.  Damages may be difficult to prove with complete accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there is another side to the story.  Pepsi and Ocean Spray have a relationship stretching back to 1992;  although the contracts differed during this period, this history provides some benchmark for making judgments as to Pepsi's future efforts.  Prior sales levels and other prior conduct of Pepsi vis a vis Ocean Spray's products, may make it much easier for Ocean Spray to detect Pepsi's failure to use its best efforts hereafter to promote Ocean Spray's products.  Certainly difficulties in detecting immediate lost sales and profits appear to be considerably less than in calculating the amount of spillover or long-term effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we assume that any slackening of effort can be detected, Pepsi has counter-incentives to continue behaving as it would if Tropicana had never been acquired.  While contract violations do not normally give rise to punitive damages, a deliberate breach of Pepsi's best efforts obligations could give rise to multiple damages under Massachusetts's chapter 93A, a claim that Ocean Spray has already asserted in its complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And there is nothing that would prevent Ocean Spray from renewing its request for injunctive relief if it could detect and establish that Pepsi was not using its best efforts on behalf of Ocean Spray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this important respect, Ocean Spray's situation is very different from that of the plaintiffs in K-Mart and Ross-Simons.   There, the defendants' proposed actions would have had immediate adverse effect on the plaintiffs (construction of an obstructing building in one case and the cut-off of supplies in the other).  Here, Pepsi's company-owned bottler distribution channel remains open to Ocean Spray, and the only question is whether Pepsi will let its pricing and promotion behavior be influenced by the Tropicana acquisition.  Although businesses act in their economic best interests, those interests in this case include avoiding multiple damages and the risk of devastating injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second consideration is duration.  Pepsi can give notice of termination as early as January 1, 1999 (although it would then continue distributing Ocean Spray until the end of the year 2000).  Ocean Spray had to know that during that contractually established transition period Pepsi might consider aligning its fortunes with another supplier.  In fact, the 1998 agreement provided for arbitration if there were a claim by Ocean Spray of lost sales during this transition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is in stark contrast to a case like K-Mart in which the obligation being breached was a 20-year commitment.  See KMart, 875 F.2d at 915-16.   Not only is the harm potentially much greater as the period stretches out, but so also the difficulties of calculating damages.  See id.   We do not say that there is some basic dividing line between one year and 20, but only that this is a further consideration that limits the significance of any claim of irreparable damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, if Pepsi did wrongfully reduce its efforts on behalf of Ocean Spray and that fact were proved, the jury would then be entitled to very considerable latitude in estimating the damages, both from direct and indirect effects.  It is well settled that the jury is given a good deal of freedom in estimating damages against a defendant who created the risk of uncertainty as to damages by its own wrongdoing.  See Jay Edwards, Inc. v. New England Toyota Distrib., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419602\"><a href=\"/opinion/419602/jay-edwards-inc-v-new-england-toyota-distributor-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span>, 821 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And, if any up-side error is likely to be doubled or tripled under chapter 93A, the risks for Pepsi are multiplied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other consideration affecting equities although not damages is the drastic relief sought by Ocean Spray.  Effectively, Ocean Spray is asking that after the acquisition, Tropicana be forbidden from continuing to use its own channels to distribute its own single-serve juices at all in geographic areas in which Ocean Spray distributes its competing products.  Tropicana is a leading competitor, and the effect of so drastic a solution would be greatly to benefit Ocean Spray by undercutting competition from Tropicana that existed long before the acquisition was a twinkle in Pepsi's eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to a different claim by Ocean Spray:  that Pepsi has breached and will continue to breach its obligation under the 1991 agreement to keep confidential Ocean Spray's business information.  Ocean Spray complains that at the top level of Pepsi management, the same individuals are responsible not only for Ocean Spray but for Tropicana.  Ocean Spray points to cases in which the courts have granted injunctions merely to prevent conduct creating a risk that confidential information will be divulged or misused.  See, e.g., Crane Co. v. Briggs Manufacturing Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"251566\"><a href=\"/opinion/251566/crane-company-an-illinois-corporation-and-v-briggs-manufacturing/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, 750 (6th Cir.1960);  Lumex, Inc. v. Highsmith, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span>, 636 (E.D.N.Y.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocean Spray does not spend much time on this issue in its brief, addressing it in only a few paragraphs.  The case law suggests that almost everything turns upon the facts, including the nature of the transaction, the threat of wrongful disclosure, the consequences if it occurs, and the reach of the relief sought.  Nothing that we can discern in reviewing the affidavits persuades us that there is anything inevitable about the misuse by Pepsi of whatever information Ocean Spray has given or chooses to give in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Ocean Spray's claim as to disclosure is offered only to support the far-reaching injunction it seeks restraining Tropicana from distributing competing products for the life of the agreement.  Nothing prevents Ocean Spray from seeking narrower relief, if this should prove warranted, enjoining the misuse of confidential information, limiting its distribution within Pepsi, or otherwise tailoring relief to meet the claimed threat of harm.  Whether blatant misuse might justify even broader relief against Tropicana's distribution activity is an issue that need not now be faced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The usual rubric refers to abuse of discretion, see Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16, but this phrasing is most pertinent to issues of judgment and the balancing of conflicting factors;  rulings on abstract legal issues remain reviewable de novo, and findings of fact are assessed for clear error, see American Bd. of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc. v.

We noted that apart from direct loss of sales of the crystal, Baccarat's withdrawal would undermine Ross-Simons' wedding registry service, alienating the retailer's potential registrants and diminishing its reputation--goodwill and reputation in particular being \"not easily measured or fully compensable in damages.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts forbids by statute \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in the course of commerce.
