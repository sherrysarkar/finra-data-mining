This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether a borrower's assertion of the right to rescind a loan\n\ntransaction subject to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1601 et seq., has the effect of voiding the transaction without\n\nresort to the arbitration procedure called for by a provision in\n\nthe loan agreement between the parties.                  Concluding that the mere\n\nassertion of the right of rescission does not undo the obligation\n\nto take the rescission claim to arbitration, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of defendant-lender's motion to compel arbitration.\n\nWe also conclude that plaintiffs' motion to conduct discovery on\nthe question of the costs of arbitration is moot.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n                  The relevant facts are undisputed.         William E. Large and\n\nDiane A. Large purchased a home in Johnston, Rhode Island, in\nSeptember of 1998.            On March 28, 2000, the Larges obtained a\n$20,000 mortgage loan from Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. at an\n\nannual percentage rate of 20.192%.                 A year later, on March 20,\n2001,       the    Larges   wrote   to   Conseco    to    give   notice   of   their\nrescission of the transaction based on Conseco's alleged failure to\nmake accurate material disclosures concerning the rate of interest,\n\nas required under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et\n\nseq.1       The statute grants the borrower an unconditional right of\n\n        1\n        Because of the high interest rate, Conseco was required to\nmake special disclosures regarding the interest rate pursuant to 15\nU.S.C. § 1639 and 12 C.F.R. § 226.32(c). The Larges alleged that\nConseco's disclosure understated the annual percentage rate for the\nloan, and included an additional item, \"Nominal Interest Rate,\"\nwhich the statute does not require, and which \"contradicts and\n\n                                         -2-\n\frescission for the first three days following the consummation of\n\nthe transaction.        It also grants a right of rescission if the\n\ncreditor fails to deliver certain forms and to disclose certain\ninformation.      The statute provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              in   the   case   of   any   consumer   credit\n              transaction . . . in which a security\n              interest . . . is or will be retained or\n              acquired in any property which is used as the\n              principal dwelling of the person to whom\n              credit is extended, the obligor shall have the\n              right    to     rescind    the     transaction\n              until midnight of the third business day\n              following the consummation of the transaction\n              or the delivery of the information and\n              rescission forms required under this section\n              together with a statement containing the\n              material disclosures required under this\n              subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying\n              the creditor, in accordance with regulations\n              of the Board, of his intention to do so.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1635(a). Section 1635(f) establishes a three-year time\n\nlimit on the exercise of the conditional right of rescission.                It\nis the conditional, three-year right of rescission that is at issue\n\nin this case.        As noted, the Larges acted well within that time\n\nframe.\n\n              In their March 20, 2001, letter the Larges indicated to\n\nConseco that because of its alleged violation of TILA's disclosure\n\nrules,   it    had   \"twenty   days   after   receipt   of   this   notice   of\n\nrescission to return all monies paid and to take any action\n\nnecessary and appropriate to reflect termination of [Conseco's]\n\nsecurity interest\" in the Larges' home, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1635(b).       Conseco replied nine days later, stating that it\n\n\nundermines the conspicuousness of the required annual percentage\nrate disclosure.\"\n\n                                      -3-\n\f\"fail[ed] to see any issues with regard to the disclosures made,\"\n\nand therefore would \"not comply with this disputed rescission\n\nrequest.\"\n            Before receiving Conseco's letter, the Larges filed a\n\ncomplaint in federal district court on March 26, 2001, seeking to\n\nenforce their alleged rescission of the transaction.                   An amended\ncomplaint was filed on April 26.            Conseco filed an answer on May\n\n11, 2001, and moved to compel arbitration of the Larges' claims\n\npursuant to the following arbitration clause in the loan agreement:\n\n            All disputes, claims, or controversies arising\n            from or relating to this note or the\n            relationships which result from this note, or\n            the validity of this arbitration clause or the\n            entire note, shall be resolved by binding\n            arbitration by one arbitrator selected by\n            [Conseco] with [the borrower's] consent.\nThe Larges opposed Conseco's motion to compel arbitration on the\n\nground     that   the   arbitration        clause   had   been    automatically\n\nrescinded, along with the remainder of the loan contract, when the\nLarges gave Conseco notice of rescission on March 20, 2001.                    The\n\nLarges also requested discovery on the question of the costs of\narbitration.      On June 18, 2001, Conseco wrote to the Larges\n\noffering    \"to   pay   all   costs   of    arbitration\"    and   to    hold   the\n\narbitration in Rhode Island \"as a convenience\" to the Larges.\n\n            On July 26, 2001, the district court granted Conseco's\n\nmotion to compel arbitration, denied the Larges' request for\n\ndiscovery, and dismissed the action.            The district court rejected\n\nthe Larges' \"claim that their notice of rescission under the TILA\n\ninvalidated all provisions of the mortgage contract, including the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\farbitration clause.\" The court explained that \"absent an attack on\n\nthe specific arbitration clause included within a contract, general\n\nrescission claims are resolvable by arbitration.\"              The court also\nrejected    the   Larges'   request    for    discovery   on   the    costs   of\n\narbitration, noting that Conseco had offered to pay their costs and\n\nto   hold   the   arbitration   in    Rhode   Island,   and    that   the   TILA\nauthorized the award of costs and attorney's fees if the Larges\n\nprevailed.    See 15 U.S.C. § 1640(a)(3).        The Larges filed a timely\n\nappeal.\n\n                  II. The Motion to Compel Arbitration\n\n            The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) \"requires a federal\n\ncourt in which suit has been brought 'upon any issue referable to\narbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration' to\nstay the court action pending arbitration once it is satisfied that\n\nthe issue is arbitrable under the agreement.\" Prima Paint Corp. v.\n\nFlood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 400 (1967) (quoting 9\n\nU.S.C. § 3).       The FAA establishes a \"'liberal federal policy\n\nfavoring arbitration agreements.'\"2            Green Tree Fin. Corp. v.\n\n\n\n      2\n        The core provision of the FAA is found in 9 U.S.C. § 2,\nwhich provides:\n\n      A written provision in any maritime transaction or a\n      contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to\n      settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising\n      out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to\n      perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in\n      writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy\n      arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal,\n      shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon\n      such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\n      revocation of any contract.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fRandolph, 531 U.S. 79, 91 (2000) (quoting Moses H. Cone Memorial\n\nHosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983)).                 However,\n\n\"'arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be\nrequired to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not\n\nagreed so to submit.'\"         McCarthy v. Azure, 22 F.3d 351, 354 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (quoting AT&T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers,\n475 U.S. 643, 648 (1986)).           Although the Larges acknowledge having\n\nsigned a loan agreement containing an arbitration clause, they take\n\nthe position that rescission under the TILA is automatic, and that\n\nonce they notified Conseco of their intention to rescind, the loan\n\nagreement ceased to exist, leaving them with no further obligation\n\nto Conseco.     If the loan agreement ceased to exist, the Larges\n\nreason, so did the arbitration clause embedded in it.\n             The problem with this argument is that the right to\n\nrescind under the TILA does not extend beyond three days unless the\n\nlender fails to \"deliver[] . . . the information and rescission\nforms   required     under    this    section    together   with    a   statement\n\ncontaining     the    material        disclosures      required     under   this\n\nsubchapter.\"    15 U.S.C. § 1635(a).             Since the right to rescind\n\nafter three days is conditioned on the lender failing to make\n\ncertain disclosures required under the TILA, a borrower is not\n\nentitled to rescind after the initial three-day period has ended\n\nunless the required disclosures have in fact not been made.                   The\n\nquestion,    then,    is     who   should     decide   whether    the   statutory\n\ndisclosure requirements have been met: the district court, or the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\farbitrator provided for in the loan agreement which the Larges\n\nclaim to have rescinded?\n\n           The Supreme Court addressed this issue in Prima Paint,\nconcluding    that   an   arbitration    clause   is   severable    from   the\n\ncontract in which it is embedded.        388 U.S. at 402-07.       As we have\n\nexplained, \"'a broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass\narbitration of the claim that the contract itself was induced by\n\nfraud.'\"     Unionmutual Stock Life Ins. Co. v. Beneficial Life Ins.\n\nCo., 774 F.2d 524, 528 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting Prima Paint, 388\n\nU.S. at 402).      The severability doctrine applies unless \"the claim\n\nis fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,\" in\n\nwhich case the arbitration clause does not govern a challenge to\n\nits own validity.     Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 403.      We have said that\n\"[t]he basis of the underlying challenge to the contract does not\n\nalter the severability principle.\" Unionmutual, 774 F.2d at 529\n\n(\"[T]he fact that [the] attempt to rescind the entire agreement is\nbased on the grounds of frustration of purpose rather than on fraud\n\nin the inducement does not change applicability of the severability\ndoctrine.\").       In sum, \"[t]he teaching of Prima Paint is that a\n\nfederal court must not remove from the arbitrator[] consideration\n\nof a substantive challenge to a contract unless there has been an\n\nindependent challenge to the making of the arbitration clause\n\nitself.\"     Id.\n\n           The Larges do not allege that Conseco engaged in illegal\n\nconduct with respect to the arbitration clause itself.                 Prima\n\nPaint, therefore, would seem to support the district court's\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fdecision to grant Conseco's motion to compel arbitration.                  The\n\nLarges counter that the district court \"overlooked the recent\n\nclarifications by the majority of circuits, which found that the\n[Prima Paint severability] doctrine does not apply to allegations\n\nof    nonexistent   contracts.\"     However,      the   Larges    cite   cases\n\ninvolving allegations that the contract with the arbitration clause\nnever existed.      The \"clarification\" of Prima Paint in these cases\n\ndoes not bear on a dispute over a purported rescission of a\n\ncontract that is acknowledged to have once existed, but is alleged\n\nto have been rescinded subsequently.\n\n            For example, in Three Valleys Municipal Water District v.\n\nE.F. Hutton & Co., Inc., 925 F.2d 1136, 1137-42 (9th Cir. 1991),\n\nthe    Ninth   Circuit   refused   to    compel   arbitration      where   the\nplaintiffs claimed that an agreement to arbitrate was void because\n\nthe individual who signed the agreement lacked the authority to\n\nbind the plaintiffs.     The court observed that the holding of Prima\n\nPaint was \"limited to challenges seeking to avoid or rescind a\n\ncontract,\" as the Larges are doing here, and was inapplicable to\n\n\"challenges going to the very existence of a contract that a party\n\nclaims never to have agreed to.\"3           Id. at 1140.         Likewise, in\n\nSandvik AB v. Advent Int'l Corp., 220 F.3d 99, 100, 101 (3rd Cir.\n\n2000), the Third Circuit refused to compel arbitration where the\n\nparty opposed to arbitration asserted that \"the agent who signed\n\n\n       3\n        The court observed that \"[a] contrary rule would lead to\nuntenable results.    Party A could forge party B's name to a\ncontract and compel party B to arbitrate the question of the\ngenuineness of its signature.\" Three Valleys, 925 F.2d at 1140.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthe agreement on its behalf lacked authority to do so.\"          The court\n\nindicated that Prima Paint's \"doctrine of severability [of the\n\narbitration clause from the challenged agreement] presumes an\nunderlying, existent[] agreement.\"        Id. at 106.    Although \"[s]uch\n\nan agreement exists, under the Prima Paint doctrine, even if one of\n\nthe parties seeks to rescind it on the basis of fraud in the\ninducement,\" no such agreement can be said to exist if the parties\n\nnever entered into a contract in the first place.                Id.     Our\n\ndecision in McCarthy -- holding that an arbitration clause in a\n\ncontract signed by a corporate officer in his official capacity\n\ncould not be enforced in an action against the officer in his\n\nindividual capacity -- also turned on the fact that no contract had\n\never existed between the plaintiff and the corporate officer in his\nindividual capacity.4    22 F.3d at 353, 357; see also Sphere Drake\n\nIns. Ltd., v. All Am. Ins. Co., 256 F.3d 587 (7th Cir. 2001);\n\nChastain v. Robinson-Humphrey Co., Inc., 957 F.2d 851, 855 (11th\nCir. 1992)    (\"Prima   Paint has    never    been   extended   to   require\n\narbitrators   to   adjudicate   a   party's   contention,   supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence, that a contract never existed at all.\"\n\n(emphasis in original)); I.S. Joseph Co., Inc. v. Mich. Sugar Co.,\n\n\n     4\n       The Larges cite Matterhorn, Inc. v. NCR Corp., 763 F.2d 866\n(7th Cir. 1985), for the proposition that \"[t]he fact that a\ncontract may have arguably once existed does not matter.\"\nMatterhorn is easily distinguishable. The plaintiff there did not\nchallenge the validity of the contract containing the arbitration\nclause, but instead argued that a subsequent transaction had\ncreated a new contract that did not include an arbitration clause.\nId. at 871-72. The court upheld the jury's finding that the new\ncontract (which governed the dispute) did not include an\narbitration clause. Id. at 874-75.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f803 F.2d 396, 400 (8th Cir. 1986) (directing district court rather\n\nthan arbitrator to decide whether purported assignee could enforce\n\nan arbitration clause in a contract to which it was not an original\nparty).\n\n          Here, it is undisputed that the loan agreement existed\n\nbetween March 28, 2000, and March 20, 2001.    The Larges contend,\nhowever, that their letter of March 20, 2001, had the automatic and\n\nimmediate effect of voiding the entire transaction. In their view,\n\nthe letter did not simply demand rescission of the transaction, but\n\nin fact rescinded the transaction the moment it was mailed.   They\n\nargue that the loan agreement (and with it the arbitration clause)\n\nceased to exist with the dispatch of the March 20, 2001, letter,\n\nand therefore has no more force at this point than a contract that\nnever existed in the first place.\n\n          In support of their theory of automatic rescission, the\n\nLarges point to 15 U.S.C. § 1635(b), which states that \"[w]hen an\nobligor exercises his right to rescind under [§ 1635(a)], he is not\n\nliable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest\n\ngiven by the obligor, including any such interest arising by\n\noperation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission.\"         In\n\naddition, the TILA provides that, \"[w]ithin 20 days after receipt\n\nof a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor\n\nany money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or\n\notherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to\n\nreflect the termination of any security interest created under the\n\ntransaction.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1635(b). Likewise, Federal Reserve Board\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fRegulation    Z    stipulates      that    \"[w]hen    a    consumer    rescinds   a\n\ntransaction, the security interest giving rise to the right of\n\nrescission becomes void and the consumer shall not be liable for\nany amount, including any finance charge.\"                   12 C.F.R. § 226.23\n\n(d)(1).\n\n            The Larges misread these provisions. Neither the statute\nnor the regulation establishes that a borrower's mere assertion of\n\nthe right of rescission has the automatic effect of voiding the\n\ncontract.     Section     1635(b)     states       that,     \"[w]hen   an   obligor\n\nexercises his right to rescind,\" the creditor's security interest\n\n\"becomes void.\"      The natural reading of this language is that the\n\nsecurity interest becomes void when the obligor exercises a right\n\nto rescind that is available in the particular case, either because\nthe   creditor     acknowledges      that    the     right    of   rescission     is\n\navailable,    or    because   the    appropriate      decision     maker    has   so\n\ndetermined.       If a lender disputes a borrower's purported right to\nrescind, the designated decision maker -- here an arbitrator --\n\nmust decide whether the conditions for rescission have been met.\n\nUntil such decision is made, the Larges have only advanced a claim\n\nseeking rescission. The agreement remains in force, and is subject\n\nto the general rule that \"a federal court must not remove from the\n\narbitrator[] consideration of a substantive challenge to a contract\n\nunless there has been an independent challenge to the making of the\n\narbitration clause itself.\"         Unionmutual, 774 F.2d at 529.            If the\n\nTILA language on which the Larges rely created an exception to this\n\nwell-established       rule   of    law,     a   borrower      could   rescind    a\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\ftransaction without any statutory justification simply by alleging\n\nthat the statutory requirements for rescission had been met.                   That\n\nis an untenable proposition.\n              The Larges cite several cases from other jurisdictions in\n\nan attempt to muster support for their claim that rescission under\n\nthe TILA is automatic upon the giving of notice, even if the lender\ndenies      that    the    requirements    for     rescission    have   been   met.\n\nHowever, most of those cases are inapposite because the lender,\n\nunlike Conseco here, had conceded that there had been a violation\n\nof the TILA's disclosure rules.                See In re Quenzer, 266 B.R. 760,\n\n762 (Bankr. D. Kan. 2001) (the lender \"concedes the notice given\n\nviolated the TILA\"); In re Whitley, 177 B.R. 142, 144 (Bankr. D.\n\nMass. 1995) (defendant's counsel \"conceded that a violation of\nTILA . . . had occurred\").             At issue in these cases was the power\n\nof    the   court     to   impose     additional     conditions,    beyond     those\n\nstipulated in the TILA, on the borrower's acknowledged right to\nrescind.      See Quenzer, 266 B.R. at 763 (\"[the lender argues] that\n\nthe Court has the power to . . . condition the voiding of the\n\nsecurity interest on the debtors' repayment of the loan\"); Whitley,\n\n177 B.R. at 152 (\"[t]his Court can conceive of circumstances where\n\nthe statutory        right    to     rescind    might   be   conditioned   upon   an\n\nobligor's tender\").           Thus, the language in these cases suggesting\n\nthat rescission under the TILA is automatic does not apply where\n\nthe   lender       disputes    the    borrower's    claim    that   rescission    is\n\nwarranted under the TILA in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\f             The    Eleventh   Circuit   has   explained   the   meaning   of\n\nreferences to \"automatic\" rescission under the TILA.             In Williams\n\nv. Homestake Mortgage Co., 968 F.2d 1137, 1140 (11th Cir. 1992),\none of those cases where the creditor agreed that grounds for\n\nrescission existed, the court noted that under the TILA, \"all the\n\nconsumer need do is notify the creditor of his intent to rescind.\nThe agreement is then automatically rescinded and the creditor\n\nmust, ordinarily, tender first.\" In describing the TILA rescission\n\nright as \"automatic,\" the Williams court was contrasting TILA\n\nrescission with common law rescission, where \"the rescinding party\n\nmust first tender the property that he has received under the\n\nagreement before the contract may be considered void.\"               Id. at\n\n1140.    Rescission under the TILA is \"automatic\" in the sense that,\nin contrast to common law rescission, the borrower need not first\n\nreturn the loan proceeds received under the agreement to effect a\n\nrescission.5       The purpose of the TILA's reordering of common law\nrescission rules is to put the consumer in a stronger bargaining\n\nposition.     Id.    Contrary to what the Larges suggest, however, the\n\n     5\n       The procedure for effecting a rescission under the TILA is\nas follows:\n\n        Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission,\n        the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or\n        property given as earnest money, downpayment, or\n        otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or\n        appropriate to reflect the termination of any security\n        interest created under the transaction. If the creditor\n        has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor\n        may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the\n        creditor's obligations under this section, the obligor\n        shall tender the property to the creditor . . . .\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1635(b).\n\n                                    -13-\n\fuse of the word \"automatic\" in Williams presupposes that the\n\ngrounds for rescission have been established, either by agreement\n\nor by an appropriate decision maker.\n          The one case the Larges cite that offers some support for\n\ntheir position is Wilson v. Par Builders II, Inc., 879 F. Supp.\n\n1187 (M.D. Fla. 1995).6   In Wilson, the borrowers sent the lender\nnotice of rescission pursuant to the TILA, and then filed an action\n\nin federal district court seeking to enforce their statutory\n\nrights.   Id. at 1190.    The district court denied the lender's\n\nmotion to compel arbitration, finding that the question of \"the\n\neffect, if any, of the [borrowers'] notice of rescission\" was \"an\n\nissue for the district court.\"    Id.\n\n          We find more compelling the holding of Dorsey v. H.C.P.\n\nSales, Inc., 46 F. Supp. 2d 804, 806 (N.D. Ill. 1999), where the\n\ncourt, on essentially the same facts as in this case, rejected the\n\nargument the Larges advance here.       The outcome in Dorsey, unlike\nthat in Wilson, is consistent with Prima Paint and Unionmutual. We\n\ntherefore conclude that the district court was correct to grant the\n\nmotion to compel arbitration.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       Franklin v. Hartland Mortgage Centers, Inc., No. 01 C 2041,\n2001 WL 726986, at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 28, 2001), does not help the\nLarges, as the arbitration clause in that case specifically\nexcluded disputes arising out of \"the exercise of any self-help\nremedies,\" and the court found that the debtor's exercise of the\nTILA rescission right qualified as a self-help remedy. Nor do we\nfind persuasive the two Florida state court cases (not dealing with\nTILA) which the Larges cite.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f               III. Discovery on the Costs of Arbitration\n\n            In Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79 (2000)\n\na TILA plaintiff argued that her \"arbitration agreement's silence\n\nwith respect to costs and fees creates a risk that she will be\n\nrequired to bear prohibitive arbitration costs if she pursues her\n\nclaims in an arbitral forum, and thereby forces her to forgo any\n\nclaims   she     may   have.\"     Id.   at     90   (internal   quotation    marks\n\nomitted).        The Court rejected this argument on the ground that\n\n\"[t]he risk that [plaintiff] will be saddled with prohibitive costs\n\nis too speculative to justify the invalidation of the arbitration\nagreement.\"      Id. at 91.     The Court indicated that the outcome might\n\nhave been different if the plaintiff had demonstrated during\ndiscovery    a   likelihood      that   she    would   in   fact   have   incurred\nprohibitive costs:\n\n            where . . . a party seeks to invalidate an\n            arbitration agreement on the ground that\n            arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,\n            that party bears the burden of showing the\n            likelihood    of   incurring    such    costs.\n            [Plaintiff] did not meet that burden.      How\n            detailed the showing of prohibitive expense\n            must be before the party seeking arbitration\n            must come forward with contrary evidence is a\n            matter we need not discuss; for in this case\n            neither during discovery nor when the case was\n            presented on the merits was there any timely\n            showing at all on the point.\nId. at 92.       Here, however, no such showing is possible because\nConseco has agreed to cover the costs of arbitration.                     Conseco's\n\noffer to pay the costs of arbitration and to hold the arbitration\nin the Larges' home state of Rhode Island mooted the issue of\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\farbitration costs.      The district court did not err in refusing to\n\npermit the Larges to take discovery on the costs of arbitration.\n\n             We explained the controlling principle in Ortiz-Gonzalez\n\nv. Fonovisa, 277 F.3d 59 (1st Cir. 2002).         A   party who had agreed\n\nnot to collect any award of attorney's fees nevertheless appealed\n\nthe district court's denial of its claim for attorney's fees, on\nthe ground that a \"judgement for attorney's fees would be valuable\n\nto deter other potential plaintiffs from filing frivolous claims.\"\n\nId. at 64.    We held that, \"[a]lthough possibly being of some value\n\nin future situations, a judgment by the district court on the issue\n\nof attorney's fees would be superfluous because of the agreement\n\n[not to collect].\"     Id. at 65.     We explained that \"[c]ourts are not\n\nrequired to go through the symbolic step of entering a judgment\nwhich the beneficiary has already agreed not to collect\" for no\n\nother reason than to establish a precedent for use in future cases.\n\nId.   Likewise here, the district court was not required to permit\ndiscovery on an issue that no longer had any bearing on the outcome\n\nof the dispute before it.\n             The Larges cite Perez v. Globe Airport Security Services,\n\nInc., 253 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir. 2001), for the proposition that an\n\narbitration agreement is invalid on its face if it limits the\n\njudicial remedies available to the plaintiffs.             The arbitration\n\nagreement in Perez stipulated that all fees and costs would be\n\nborne equally by the parties.         Id. at 1282.    The Eleventh Circuit\n\nheld that     the   agreement   was   illegal   because   it   required   the\n\nplaintiff to waive her statutory right under Title VII to recover\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\ffees and costs if she prevailed.       Id. at 1285.   Perez is not on\n\npoint, however, because the arbitration clause here does not\n\ndeprive the Larges of any statutory rights in connection with the\ncosts of arbitration.   The arbitration clause states: \"The parties\n\nagree and understand that the arbitrator shall have all powers\n\nprovided by law and the note.   These powers shall include all legal\nand equitable remedies, including, but not limited to, money\n\ndamages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.\"      It does not\n\nlimit the power of the arbitrator to award statutory relief to the\n\nLarges pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1640(a)(3) (authorizing award of\n\ncosts and attorney's fees to prevailing parties).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

Concluding that the mere assertion of the right of rescission does not undo the obligation to take the rescission claim to arbitration, we affirm the district court's grant of defendant-lender's motion to compel arbitration.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are undisputed. William E. Large and Diane A. Large purchased a home in Johnston, Rhode Island, in September of 1998. On March 28, 2000, the Larges obtained a $20,000 mortgage loan from Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. at an annual percentage rate of 20.192%. A year later, on March 20, 2001, the Larges wrote to Conseco to give notice of their rescission of the transaction based on Conseco's alleged failure to make accurate rate material disclosures concerning the rate of interest, as required under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1601 <i>et seq.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The statute grants the borrower an unconditional right of rescission for the first three days following the consummation of the transaction. It also grants a right of rescission if the creditor fails to deliver certain forms and to disclose certain information. The statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">in the case of any consumer credit transaction... in which a security interest... is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Board, of his intention to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). Section 1635(f) establishes a three-year time limit on the exercise of the conditional right of rescission. It is the conditional, three-year right of rescission that is at issue in this case. As noted, the Larges acted well within that time frame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their March 20, 2001, letter the Larges indicated to Conseco that because of its alleged violation of TILA's disclosure rules, it had \"twenty days after receipt of this notice of rescission to return all monies paid and to take any action necessary and appropriate to reflect termination of [Conseco's] security interest\" in the Larges' home, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(b). Conseco replied nine days later, stating that it \"fail[ed] to see any issues with regard to the disclosures made,\" and therefore would \"not comply with this disputed rescission request.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before receiving Conseco's letter, the Larges filed a complaint in federal district court on March 26, 2001, seeking to enforce their alleged rescission of the transaction. An amended complaint was filed on April 26. Conseco filed an answer on May 11, 2001, and moved to compel arbitration of the Larges' claims pursuant to the following arbitration clause in the loan agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to this note or the relationships which result from this note, or the validity of this arbitration clause or the entire note, shall be resolved by binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected by [Conseco] with [the borrower's] consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges opposed Conseco's motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the arbitration clause had been automatically rescinded, along with the remainder of the loan contract, when the Larges gave Conseco notice of rescission on March 20, 2001. The Larges also requested discovery on the question of the costs of arbitration. On June 18, 2001, Conseco wrote to the Larges offering \"to pay all costs of arbitration\" and to hold the arbitration in Rhode Island \"as a convenience\" to the Larges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 2001, the district court granted Conseco's motion to compel arbitration, denied the Larges' request for discovery, and dismissed the action. The district court rejected the Larges' \"claim that their notice of rescission under the TILA invalidated all provisions of the mortgage contract, including the arbitration clause.\" The court explained that \"absent an attack on the specific arbitration clause included within a contract, general rescission claims are resolvable by arbitration.\" The court also rejected the Larges' request for discovery on the costs of arbitration, noting that Conseco had offered to pay their costs and to hold the arbitration in Rhode Island, and that the TILA authorized the award of costs and attorney's fees if the Larges prevailed. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1640(a)(3). The Larges filed a timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Motion to Compel Arbitration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) \"requires a federal court in which suit has been brought `upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration' to stay the court action pending arbitration once it is satisfied that the issue is arbitrable under the agreement.\" <i>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</i> 388 U.S. 395, 400, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967) (quoting 9 U.S.C. &#167; 3). The FAA establishes a \"`liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph,</i> 531 U.S. 79, 91, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000) (quoting <i>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)). However, \"`arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.'\" <i>McCarthy v. Azure,</i> 22 F.3d 351, 354 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers,</i> 475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986)). Although the Larges acknowledge having signed a loan agreement containing an arbitration clause, they take the position that rescission under the TILA is automatic, and that once they notified Conseco of their intention to rescind, the loan agreement ceased to exist, leaving them with no further obligation to Conseco. If the loan agreement ceased to exist, the Larges reason, so did the arbitration clause embedded in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this argument is that the right to rescind under the TILA does not extend beyond three days unless the lender fails to \"deliver[] ... the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). Since the right to rescind after three days is conditioned on the lender failing to make certain disclosures required under the TILA, a borrower is not entitled to rescind after the initial three-day period has ended unless the required disclosures have in fact not been made. The question, then, is who should decide whether the statutory disclosure requirements have been met: the district court, or the arbitrator provided for in the loan agreement which the Larges claim to have rescinded?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court addressed this issue in <i>Prima Paint,</i> concluding that an arbitration clause is severable from the contract in which it is embedded. 388 U.S. at 402-07, 87 S.Ct. 1801. As we have explained, \"`a broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of the claim that the contract itself was induced by fraud.'\" <i>Unionmutual Stock Life Ins. Co. v. Beneficial Life Ins. Co.,</i> 774 F.2d 524, 528 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Prima Paint,</i> 388 U.S. at 402, 87 S.Ct. 1801). The severability doctrine applies unless \"the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,\" in which case the arbitration clause does not govern a challenge to its own validity. <i>Prima Paint,</i> 388 U.S. at 403, 87 S.Ct. 1801. We have said that \"[t]he basis of the underlying challenge to the contract does not alter the severability principle.\" <i>Unionmutual,</i> 774 F.2d at 529 (\"[T]he fact that [the] attempt to rescind the entire agreement is based on the grounds of frustration of purpose rather than on fraud in the inducement does not change applicability of the severability doctrine.\"). In sum, \"[t]he teaching of <i>Prima Paint</i> is that a federal court must not remove from the arbitrator[] consideration of a substantive challenge to a contract unless there has been an independent challenge to the making of the arbitration clause itself.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges do not allege that Conseco engaged in illegal conduct with respect to the arbitration clause itself. <i>Prima Paint,</i> therefore, would seem to support the district court's decision to grant Conseco's motion to compel arbitration. The Larges counter that the district court \"overlooked the recent clarifications by the majority of circuits, which found that the [<i>Prima Paint</i> severability] doctrine does not apply to allegations of nonexistent contracts.\" However, the Larges cite cases involving allegations that the contract with the arbitration clause <i>never</i> existed. The \"clarification\" of <i>Prima Paint</i> in these cases does not bear on a dispute over a purported rescission of a contract that is acknowledged to have once existed, but is alleged to have been rescinded subsequently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in <i>Three Valleys Municipal Water District v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., Inc.,</i> 925 F.2d 1136, 1137-42 (9th Cir.1991), the Ninth Circuit refused to compel arbitration where the plaintiffs claimed that an agreement to arbitrate was void because the individual who signed the agreement lacked the authority to bind the plaintiffs. The court observed that the holding of <i>Prima Paint</i> was \"limited to challenges seeking to <i>avoid</i> or <i>rescind</i> a contract,\" as the Larges are doing here, and was inapplicable to \"challenges going to the very existence of a contract that a party claims never to have agreed to.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1140. Likewise, in <i>Sandvik AB v. Advent Int'l Corp.,</i> 220 F.3d 99, 100, 101 (3rd Cir.2000), the Third Circuit refused to compel arbitration where the party opposed to arbitration asserted that \"the agent who signed the agreement on its behalf lacked authority to do so.\" The court indicated that <i>Prima Paint's</i> \"doctrine of severability [of the arbitration clause from the challenged agreement] presumes an underlying, existent[] agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 106. Although \"[s]uch an agreement exists, under the <i>Prima Paint</i> doctrine, even if one of the parties seeks to rescind it on the basis of fraud in the inducement,\" no such agreement can be said to exist if the parties never entered into a contract in the first place. <i>Id.</i> Our decision in <i>McCarthy</i> &#8212; holding that an arbitration clause in a contract signed by a corporate officer in his official capacity could not be enforced in an action against the officer in his individual capacity &#8212; also turned on the fact that no contract had ever existed between the plaintiff and the corporate officer in his individual capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> 22 F.3d at 353, 357; <i>see also Sphere Drake Ins.

In their view, the letter did not simply demand rescission of the transaction, but in fact rescinded the transaction the moment it was mailed. They argue that the loan agreement (and with it the arbitration clause) ceased to exist with the dispatch of the March 20, 2001, letter, and therefore has no more force at this point than a contract that never existed in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their theory of automatic rescission, the Larges point to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(b), which states that \"[w]hen an obligor exercises his right to rescind under [&#167; 1635(a)], he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission.\" In addition, the TILA provides that, \"[w]ithin 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(b). Likewise, Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z stipulates that \"[w]hen a consumer rescinds a transaction, the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void and the consumer shall not be liable for any amount, including any finance charge.\" 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges misread these provisions. Neither the statute nor the regulation establishes that a borrower's mere assertion of the right of rescission has the automatic effect of voiding the contract. Section 1635(b) states that, \"[w]hen an obligor exercises his right to rescind,\" the creditor's security interest \"becomes void.\" The natural reading of this language is that the security interest becomes void when the obligor exercises a right to rescind that is available in the particular case, either because the creditor acknowledges that the right of rescission is available, or because the appropriate decision maker has so determined. If a lender disputes a borrower's purported right to rescind, the designated decision maker &#8212; here an arbitrator &#8212; must decide whether the conditions for rescission have been met. Until such decision is made, the Larges have only advanced a claim seeking rescission. The agreement remains in force, and is subject to the general rule that \"a federal court must not remove from the arbitrator[] consideration of a substantive challenge to a contract unless there has been an independent challenge to the making of the arbitration clause itself.\" <i>Unionmutual,</i> 774 F.2d at 529. If the TILA language on which the Larges rely created an exception to this well-established rule of law, a borrower could rescind a transaction without any statutory justification simply by alleging that the statutory requirements for rescission had been met. That is an untenable proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges cite several cases from other jurisdictions in an attempt to muster support for their claim that rescission under the TILA is automatic upon the giving of notice, even if the lender denies that the requirements for rescission have been met. However, most of those cases are inapposite because the lender, unlike Conseco here, had <i>conceded</i> that there had been a violation of the TILA's disclosure rules. <i>See In re Quenzer,</i> 266 B.R. 760, 762 (Bankr.D.Kan.2001) (the lender \"concedes the notice given violated the TILA\"); <i>In re Whitley,</i> 177 B.R. 142, 144 (Bankr.D.Mass.1995) (defendant's counsel \"conceded that a violation of TILA ... had occurred\"). At issue in these cases was the power of the court to impose additional conditions, beyond those stipulated in the TILA, on the borrower's acknowledged right to rescind. <i>See Quenzer,</i> 266 B.R. at 763 (\"[the lender argues] that the Court has the power to ... condition the voiding of the security interest on the debtors' repayment of the loan\"); <i>Whitley,</i> 177 B.R. at 152 (\"[t]his Court can conceive of circumstances where the statutory right to rescind might be conditioned upon an obligor's tender\"). Thus, the language in these cases suggesting that rescission under the TILA is automatic does not apply where the lender disputes the borrower's claim that rescission is warranted under the TILA in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit has explained the meaning of references to \"automatic\" rescission under the TILA. In <i>Williams v. Homestake Mortgage Co.,</i> 968 F.2d 1137, 1140 (11th Cir.1992), one of those cases where the creditor agreed that grounds for rescission existed, the court noted that under the TILA, \"all the consumer need do is notify the creditor of his intent to rescind. The agreement is then automatically rescinded and the creditor must, ordinarily, tender first.\" In describing the TILA rescission right as \"automatic,\" the <i>Williams</i> court was contrasting TILA rescission with common law rescission, where \"the rescinding party must first tender the property that he has received under the agreement before the contract may be considered void.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1140. Rescission under the TILA is \"automatic\" in the sense that, in contrast to common law rescission, the borrower need not first return the loan proceeds received under the agreement to effect a rescission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The purpose of the TILA's reordering of common law rescission rules is to put the consumer in a stronger bargaining position. <i>Id.</i> Contrary to what the Larges suggest, however, the use of the word \"automatic\" in <i>Williams</i> presupposes that the grounds for rescission have been established, either by agreement or by an appropriate decision maker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one case the Larges cite that offers some support for their position is <i>Wilson v. Par Builders II, Inc.,</i> 879 F.Supp. 1187 (M.D.Fla.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In <i>Wilson,</i> the borrowers sent the lender notice of rescission pursuant to the TILA, and then filed an action in federal district court seeking to enforce their statutory rights. <i>Id.</i> at 1190. The district court denied the lender's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the question of \"the effect, if any, of the [borrowers'] notice of rescission\" was \"an issue for the district court.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find more compelling the holding of <i>Dorsey v. H.C.P. Sales, Inc.,</i> 46 F.Supp.2d 804, 806 (N.D.Ill.1999), where the court, on essentially the same facts as in this case, rejected the argument the Larges advance here. The outcome in <i>Dorsey,</i> unlike that in <i>Wilson,</i> is consistent with <i>Prima Paint</i> and <i>Unionmutual.</i> We therefore conclude that the district court was correct to grant the motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discovery on the Costs of Arbitration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Randolph,</i> 531 U.S. 79, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000) a TILA plaintiff argued that her \"arbitration agreement's silence with respect to costs and fees creates a risk that she will be required to bear prohibitive arbitration costs if she pursues her claims in an arbitral forum, and thereby forces her to forgo any claims she may have.\" <i>Id.</i> at 90, 121 S.Ct. 513 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court rejected this argument on the ground that \"[t]he risk that [plaintiff] will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of the arbitration agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 91, 121 S.Ct. 513. The Court indicated that the outcome might have been different if the plaintiff had demonstrated during discovery a likelihood that she would in fact have incurred prohibitive costs:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">where ... a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs. [Plaintiff] did not meet that burden. How detailed the showing of prohibitive expense must be before the party seeking arbitration must come forward with contrary evidence is a matter we need not discuss; for in this case neither during discovery nor when the case was presented on the merits was there any timely showing at all on the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 92. Here, however, no such showing is possible because Conseco has agreed to cover the costs of arbitration. Conseco's offer to pay the costs of arbitration and to hold the arbitration in the Larges' home state of Rhode Island mooted the issue of arbitration costs. The district court did not err in refusing to permit the Larges to take discovery on the costs of arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explained the controlling principle in <i>Ortiz-Gonzalez v. Fonovisa,</i> 277 F.3d 59 (1st Cir.2002). A party who had agreed not to collect any award of attorney's fees nevertheless appealed the district court's denial of its claim for attorney's fees, on the ground that a \"judgement for attorney's fees would be valuable to deter other potential plaintiffs from filing frivolous claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 64. We held that, \"[a]lthough possibly being of some value in future situations, a judgment by the district court on the issue of attorney's fees would be superfluous because of the agreement [not to collect].\" <i>Id.</i> at 65. We explained that \"[c]ourts are not required to go through the symbolic step of entering a judgment which the beneficiary has already agreed not to collect\" for no other reason than to establish a precedent for use in future cases. <i>Id.</i> Likewise here, the district court was not required to permit discovery on an issue that no longer had any bearing on the outcome of the dispute before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges cite <i>Perez v. Globe Airport Security Services, Inc.,</i> 253 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir.2001), for the proposition that an arbitration agreement is invalid on its face if it limits the judicial remedies available to the plaintiffs. The arbitration agreement in <i>Perez</i> stipulated that all fees and costs would be borne equally by the parties. <i>Id.</i> at 1282. The Eleventh Circuit held that the agreement was illegal because it required the plaintiff to waive her statutory right under Title VII to recover fees and costs if she prevailed. <i>Id.</i> at 1285. <i>Perez</i> is not on point, however, because the arbitration clause here does not deprive the Larges of any statutory rights in connection with the costs of arbitration. The arbitration clause states: \"The parties agree and understand that the arbitrator shall have all powers provided by law and the note. These powers shall include all legal and equitable remedies, including, but not limited to, money damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.\" It does not limit the power of the arbitrator to award statutory relief to the Larges pursuant to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1640(a)(3) (authorizing award of costs and attorney's fees to prevailing parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because of the high interest rate, Conseco was required to make special disclosures regarding the interest rate pursuant to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1639 and 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.32(c). The Larges alleged that Conseco's disclosure understated the annual percentage rate for the loan, and included an additional item, \"Nominal Interest Rate,\" which the statute does not require, and which \"contradicts and undermines the conspicuousness of the required annual percentage rate disclosure.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The core provision of the FAA is found in 9 U.S.C. &#167; 2, which provides:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The court observed that \"[a] contrary rule would lead to untenable results.

Concluding that the mere assertion of the right of rescission does not undo the obligation to take the rescission claim to arbitration, we affirm the district court's grant of defendant-lender's motion to compel arbitration. We also conclude that plaintiffs' motion to conduct discovery on the question of the costs of arbitration is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are undisputed. William E. Large and Diane A. Large purchased a home in Johnston, Rhode Island, in September of 1998. On March 28, 2000, the Larges obtained a $20,000 mortgage loan from Conseco Finance Servicing Corp. at an annual percentage rate of 20.192%. A year later, on March 20, 2001, the Larges wrote to Conseco to give notice of their rescission of the transaction based on Conseco's alleged failure to make accurate rate material disclosures concerning the rate of interest, as required under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1601 <i>et seq.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The statute grants the borrower an unconditional right of rescission for the first three days following the consummation of the transaction. It also grants a right of rescission if the creditor fails to deliver certain forms and to disclose certain information. The statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">in the case of any consumer credit transaction... in which a security interest... is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Board, of his intention to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). Section 1635(f) establishes a three-year time limit on the exercise of the conditional right of rescission. It is the conditional, three-year right of rescission that is at issue in this case. As noted, the Larges acted well within that time frame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their March 20, 2001, letter the Larges indicated to Conseco that because of its alleged violation of TILA's disclosure rules, it had \"twenty days after receipt of this notice of rescission to return all monies paid and to take any action necessary and appropriate to reflect termination of [Conseco's] security interest\" in the Larges' home, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(b). Conseco replied nine days later, stating that it \"fail[ed] to see any issues with regard to the disclosures made,\" and therefore would \"not comply with this disputed rescission request.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before receiving Conseco's letter, the Larges filed a complaint in federal district court on March 26, 2001, seeking to enforce their alleged rescission of the transaction. An amended complaint was filed on April 26. Conseco filed an answer on May 11, 2001, and moved to compel arbitration of the Larges' claims pursuant to the following arbitration clause in the loan agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to this note or the relationships which result from this note, or the validity of this arbitration clause or the entire note, shall be resolved by binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected by [Conseco] with [the borrower's] consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges opposed Conseco's motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the arbitration clause had been automatically rescinded, along with the remainder of the loan contract, when the Larges gave Conseco notice of rescission on March 20, 2001. The Larges also requested discovery on the question of the costs of arbitration. On June 18, 2001, Conseco wrote to the Larges offering \"to pay all costs of arbitration\" and to hold the arbitration in Rhode Island \"as a convenience\" to the Larges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 2001, the district court granted Conseco's motion to compel arbitration, denied the Larges' request for discovery, and dismissed the action. The district court rejected the Larges' \"claim that their notice of rescission under the TILA invalidated all provisions of the mortgage contract, including the arbitration clause.\" The court explained that \"absent an attack on the specific arbitration clause included within a contract, general rescission claims are resolvable by arbitration.\" The court also rejected the Larges' request for discovery on the costs of arbitration, noting that Conseco had offered to pay their costs and to hold the arbitration in Rhode Island, and that the TILA authorized the award of costs and attorney's fees if the Larges prevailed. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1640(a)(3).

The Larges contend, however, that their letter of March 20, 2001, had the automatic and immediate effect of voiding the entire transaction. In their view, the letter did not simply demand rescission of the transaction, but in fact rescinded the transaction the moment it was mailed. They argue that the loan agreement (and with it the arbitration clause) ceased to exist with the dispatch of the March 20, 2001, letter, and therefore has no more force at this point than a contract that never existed in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their theory of automatic rescission, the Larges point to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(b), which states that \"[w]hen an obligor exercises his right to rescind under [&#167; 1635(a)], he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission.\" In addition, the TILA provides that, \"[w]ithin 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(b). Likewise, Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z stipulates that \"[w]hen a consumer rescinds a transaction, the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void and the consumer shall not be liable for any amount, including any finance charge.\" 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges misread these provisions. Neither the statute nor the regulation establishes that a borrower's mere assertion of the right of rescission has the automatic effect of voiding the contract. Section 1635(b) states that, \"[w]hen an obligor exercises his right to rescind,\" the creditor's security interest \"becomes void.\" The natural reading of this language is that the security interest becomes void when the obligor exercises a right to rescind that is available in the particular case, either because the creditor acknowledges that the right of rescission is available, or because the appropriate decision maker has so determined. If a lender disputes a borrower's purported right to rescind, the designated decision maker &#8212; here an arbitrator &#8212; must decide whether the conditions for rescission have been met. Until such decision is made, the Larges have only advanced a claim seeking rescission. The agreement remains in force, and is subject to the general rule that \"a federal court must not remove from the arbitrator[] consideration of a substantive challenge to a contract unless there has been an independent challenge to the making of the arbitration clause itself.\" <i>Unionmutual,</i> 774 F.2d at 529. If the TILA language on which the Larges rely created an exception to this well-established rule of law, a borrower could rescind a transaction without any statutory justification simply by alleging that the statutory requirements for rescission had been met. That is an untenable proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Larges cite several cases from other jurisdictions in an attempt to muster support for their claim that rescission under the TILA is automatic upon the giving of notice, even if the lender denies that the requirements for rescission have been met. However, most of those cases are inapposite because the lender, unlike Conseco here, had <i>conceded</i> that there had been a violation of the TILA's disclosure rules. <i>See In re Quenzer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1930413\"><a href=\"/opinion/1930413/in-re-quenzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, 762 (Bankr.D.Kan.2001) (the lender \"concedes the notice given violated the TILA\"); <i>In re Whitley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1977777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1977777/in-re-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span>, 144 (Bankr.D.Mass.1995) (defendant's counsel \"conceded that a violation of TILA ... had occurred\"). At issue in these cases was the power of the court to impose additional conditions, beyond those stipulated in the TILA, on the borrower's acknowledged right to rescind. <i>See Quenzer,</i> 266 B.R. at 763 (\"[the lender argues] that the Court has the power to ... condition the voiding of the security interest on the debtors' repayment of the loan\"); <i>Whitley,</i> 177 B.R. at 152 (\"[t]his Court can conceive of circumstances where the statutory right to rescind might be conditioned upon an obligor's tender\"). Thus, the language in these cases suggesting that rescission under the TILA is automatic does not apply where the lender disputes the borrower's claim that rescission is warranted under the TILA in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit has explained the meaning of references to \"automatic\" rescission under the TILA.

The agreement is then automatically rescinded and the creditor must, ordinarily, tender first.\" In describing the TILA rescission right as \"automatic,\" the <i>Williams</i> court was contrasting TILA rescission with common law rescission, where \"the rescinding party must first tender the property that he has received under the agreement before the contract may be considered void.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1140. Rescission under the TILA is \"automatic\" in the sense that, in contrast to common law rescission, the borrower need not first return the loan proceeds received under the agreement to effect a rescission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The purpose of the TILA's reordering of common law rescission rules is to put the consumer in a stronger bargaining position. <i>Id.</i> Contrary to what the Larges suggest, however, the use of the word \"automatic\" in <i>Williams</i> presupposes that the grounds for rescission have been established, either by agreement or by an appropriate decision maker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one case the Larges cite that offers some support for their position is <i>Wilson v.

The district court denied the lender's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the question of \"the effect, if any, of the [borrowers'] notice of rescission\" was \"an issue for the district court.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find more compelling the holding of <i>Dorsey v.

The court upheld the jury's finding that the new contract (which governed the dispute) did not include an arbitration clause. <i>Id.</i> at 874-75.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The procedure for effecting a rescission under the TILA is as follows:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction.

June 28, 2001), does not help the Larges, as the arbitration clause in that case specifically excluded disputes arising out of \"the exercise of any self-help remedies,\" and the court found that the debtor's exercise of the TILA rescission right qualified as a self-help remedy. Nor do we find persuasive the two Florida state court cases (not dealing with TILA) which the Larges cite.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
