As\r\n\nall claims raised on  appeal were either unpreserved or  patently\r\n\nmeritless,  we  affirm the  district  court  judgment and  impose\r\n\nmonetary sanctions against Jacobsen  and its counsel as requested\r\n\nby appellee. \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          First, Jacobsen has not approached the required  demon-\r\n\nstration of clear error  in its frontal attack on the findings of\r\n\nfact  made by the  trial judge.   See Johnson  v. Watts Regulator\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  63 F.3d 1129, 1138  (1st Cir. 1995)  (\"[W]hen there are two\r             \r\n\npermissible  views  of  the  evidence,  the  factfinder's  choice\r\n\nbetween  them cannot  be  clearly erroneous.\").   In  particular,\r\n\nPimentel presented testimony by the  Captain of the Valkyrie that\r\n\nthe helmsman  knew the location  of the  submerged cables.   As a\r\n\ngeneral rule, credibility determinations are rather well insulat-\r\n\ned from appellate  challenge.  See Gamma  Audio &amp; Video,  Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nEan-Chea,  11 F.3d 1106, 1115  (1st Cir. 1993)  (noting that \"the\r                  \r\n\ntrial judge is in the best position to assess the credibility  of\r\n\nwitnesses\").  So it is here.1  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Similarly, Jacobsen's assault on  the trial judge's refusal\r\nto draw an  adverse inference from an inadvertent  destruction of\r\nevidence suggests neither clear error nor an abuse of discretion.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          Second,  having presented  no evidence  on compensatory\r                                                 \r\n\ndamages, Jacobsen's contention  that the award made  by the trial\r\n\njudge  was excessive utterly fails to  establish error, let alone\r\n\nclear error.  See Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 166 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1988) (noting that trial judge's factual findings, including\r\n\nits  \"determination of  damages,\"  are reviewed  \"only for  clear\r\n\nerror\").  Furthermore, Jacobsen's  remaining claims     including\r\n\nits  contention that  the  district  court improperly  reimbursed\r\n\nPimentel for costs incurred for the services of an expert witness\r\n\n   were not preserved below.   See Poliquin v. Garden Way,  Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n989 F.2d 527, 531 (1st Cir. 1993).  \r\n\n          Accordingly, we  limit further discussion  to the vari-\r\n\nable interest rate  calculation employed by the district court in\r\n\nawarding  prejudgment  interest.    The  district  court  awarded\r\n\nprejudgment interest  at a  variable rate, utilizing  the average\r\n\nprice of 52-week Treasury Bills for each year within the relevant\r\n\nprejudgment  period.   Recourse to  a  variable interest  rate is\r\n\nneither unprecedented, see George's  Radio &amp; Television Co., Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Moreover, Jacobsen managed no demonstration\r\n\nthat the variable-rate prejudgment  interest award in the instant\r\n\ncase  constituted an abuse  of discretion.   See Independent Bulk\r                                                                           \r\n\nTransp., Inc. v.

This, unquestionably, is such a case.\r\n\n          The  claim  that  Jacobsen  is not  liable  in  damages\r\n\ndirectly challenged the trial  judge's factual findings,  thereby\r\n\nengaging  one of the more formidable standards of review known to\r\n\nfederal appellate practice.  See Johnson, 63 F.3d at 1138.  Then,\r                                                  \r\n\nrelying  on even  shakier ground,  Jacobsen mounted  an appellate\r\n\nchallenge to the size  of the award without having  presented any\r\n\nevidence  on damages.  Finally, the arguments Jacobsen raised for\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthe first time on appeal did not begin to suggest \"plain  error,\"\r\n\nsee  United States  v.

See Poliquin 989 F.2d at 531.\r                                                          \r\n\nThus, it was clear  from the outset that Jacobsen's  prospects of\r\n\nsuccess  on appeal were all but nonexistent, and that no \"respon-\r\n\nsible  litigant or lawyer should have gone forward with an appeal\r\n\nin these straitened circumstances.\"  La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRobles,  937 F.2d 689, 692  (1st Cir. 1991)  (appellate attack on\r                \r\n\njury  verdict  held  frivolous  given  conflicting  evidence  and\r\n\nfailure to preserve claims). \r\n\n          Although  at first blush  Jacobsen's brief  suggests an\r\n\nappeal with  some substance, the illusion  dissolves upon cursory\r\n\ninvestigation.   Its many citations to  authorities supposedly on\r\n\npoint frequently turn out to  be readily distinguishable.   Unfa-\r\n\nvorable  First  Circuit  authority  frequently  is  bypassed  for\r\n\nsomewhat less unfavorable  authorities from other  jurisdictions.\r\n\nThe  unhelpfulness  of  these  litigation  tactics  exposed  both\r\n\nJacobsen and its  counsel to sanctions.2   Commonwealth Elec.

Jacobsen's opposition to\r\nthe motion  for sanctions  nonetheless indicated that  though bad\r\nfaith is not  an essential element of frivolousness,  it may be a\r\nnecessary  predicate  for sanctions  under  Fed.

As all claims raised on appeal were either unpreserved or patently meritless, we affirm the district court judgment and impose monetary sanctions against Jacobsen and its counsel as requested by appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* DISCUSSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Jacobsen has not approached the required demonstration of clear error in its frontal attack on the findings of fact made by the trial judge.  See Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1138 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[W]hen there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\").  In particular, Pimentel presented testimony by the Captain of the Valkyrie that the helmsman knew the location of the submerged cables.  As a general rule, credibility determinations are rather well insulated from appellate challenge.  See Gamma Audio &amp; Video, Inc. v. Ean-Chea, 11 F.3d 1106, 1115 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that \"the trial judge is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses\").  So it is here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, having presented no evidence on compensatory damages, Jacobsen's contention that the award made by the trial judge was excessive utterly fails to establish error, let alone clear error.  See Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 166 (1st Cir.1988) (noting that trial judge's factual findings, including its \"determination of damages,\" are reviewed \"only for clear error\").  Furthermore, Jacobsen's remaining claims--including its contention that the district court improperly reimbursed Pimentel for costs incurred for the services of an expert witness--were not preserved below.  See Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 531 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we limit further discussion to the variable interest rate calculation employed by the district court in awarding prejudgment interest.  The district court awarded prejudgment interest at a variable rate, utilizing the average price of 52-week Treasury Bills for each year within the relevant prejudgment period.  Recourse to a variable interest rate is neither unprecedented, see George's Radio &amp; Television Co., Inc. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 536 F.Supp. 681, 685 (D.Md.), judgment amended, 549 F.Supp. 1014 (D.Md.1982), nor unreasonable per se, especially since the result normally will approximate an acceptable average for the prejudgment period, see Cement Div., Nat'l Gypsum Co. v. City of Milwaukee, 31 F.3d 581, 587 (7th Cir.1994), aff'd, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2091, 132 L.Ed.2d 148 (1995);  Ingersoll Milling Mach. Co. v. M/V/ Bodena, 829 F.2d 293, 311 (2d Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1042, 108 S.Ct. 774, 98 L.Ed.2d 860 (1988);  Bosnor S.A. de C.V. v. Tug L.A. Barrios, 796 F.2d 776, 786-87 (5th Cir.1986).  Indeed, we have suggested that utilization of a prime rate average would be reasonable.  See City of Boston v. S.S. Texaco Texas, 773 F.2d 1396, 1401 (1st Cir.1985) (dicta).  Moreover, Jacobsen managed no demonstration that the variable-rate prejudgment interest award in the instant case constituted an abuse of discretion.  See Independent Bulk Transp., Inc. v. The Vessel \"Morania Abaco\", 676 F.2d 23, 25 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we consider Pimentel's motion for sanctions.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 states:  \"If a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may ... award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\"   An appeal is frivolous \"if the result is obvious or the arguments are 'wholly without merit.' \"  Cronin v. Town of Amesbury, 81 F.3d 257, 261 (1st Cir.1996) (emphasis added) (quoting  Westcott Constr.  Corp. v. Firemen's Fund of N.J., 996 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1993)).  This, unquestionably, is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim that Jacobsen is not liable in damages directly challenged the trial judge's factual findings, thereby engaging one of the more formidable standards of review known to federal appellate practice.  See Johnson, 63 F.3d at 1138.   Then, relying on even shakier ground, Jacobsen mounted an appellate challenge to the size of the award without having presented any evidence on damages.  Finally, the arguments Jacobsen raised for the first time on appeal did not begin to suggest \"plain error,\" see United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), as no \"miscarriage of justice\" obtained.  See Poliquin 989 F.2d at 531.   Thus, it was clear from the outset that Jacobsen's prospects of success on appeal were all but nonexistent, and that no \"responsible litigant or lawyer should have gone forward with an appeal in these straitened circumstances.\"  La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc. v. Robles, 937 F.2d 689, 692 (1st Cir.1991) (appellate attack on jury verdict held frivolous given conflicting evidence and failure to preserve claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although at first blush Jacobsen's brief suggests an appeal with some substance, the illusion dissolves upon cursory investigation.  Its many citations to authorities supposedly on point frequently turn out to be readily distinguishable.  Unfavorable First Circuit authority frequently is bypassed for somewhat less unfavorable authorities from other jurisdictions.  The unhelpfulness of these litigation tactics exposed both Jacobsen and its counsel to sanctions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Commonwealth Elec. Co. v. Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., 754 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir.1985) (imposing sanctions on counsel for submitting brief which \"added a significant burden on appellee's counsel and the court\");  see also Fed.R.App.P. 38;  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1927 (\"Any attorney ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\");  Cronin, 81 F.3d at 261-62 (imposing sanctions under Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1927 for frivolous appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed.  Double costs are assessed exclusively against Jacobsen;  $8,406.00 in attorney fees to appellee's counsel are assessed directly and exclusively against appellant's counsel, the firm of Clinton &amp; Muzyka, P.C., and Messrs. Clinton and Collins, jointly and severally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Similarly, Jacobsen's assault on the trial judge's refusal to draw an adverse inference from an inadvertent destruction of evidence suggests neither clear error nor an abuse of discretion.  See Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir.1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Counsel continued to press these tactics in opposition to the motion for sanctions, notwithstanding a prior warning from Pimentel's counsel that a motion for sanctions would be forthcoming in the event of a frivolous appeal.  Jacobsen's opposition to the motion for sanctions nonetheless indicated that though bad faith is not an essential element of frivolousness, it may be a necessary predicate for sanctions under Fed.R.App.P. 38, citing as authority a single case from another circuit.  In so doing, counsel conveniently ignored longstanding First Circuit caselaw which holds, unequivocally, that Rule 38 sanctions may be imposed without a finding of bad faith.  E.g., Applewood Landscape &amp; Nursery Co. v. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1508 (1st Cir.1989)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Clinton and Collins, jointly and severally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Similarly, Jacobsen's assault on the trial judge's refusal to draw an adverse inference from an inadvertent destruction of evidence suggests neither clear error nor an abuse of discretion.  See Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196700\"><a href=\"/opinion/196700/blinzler-v-marriott-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1158 (1st Cir.1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Counsel continued to press these tactics in opposition to the motion for sanctions, notwithstanding a prior warning from Pimentel's counsel that a motion for sanctions would be forthcoming in the event of a frivolous appeal.  Jacobsen's opposition to the motion for sanctions nonetheless indicated that though bad faith is not an essential element of frivolousness, it may be a necessary predicate for sanctions under Fed.R.App.P. 38, citing as authority a single case from another circuit.  In so doing, counsel conveniently ignored longstanding First Circuit caselaw which holds, unequivocally, that Rule 38 sanctions may be imposed without a finding of bad faith.

Hollingsworth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529277\"><a href=\"/opinion/529277/applewood-landscape-nursery-co-inc-v-wayne-b-hollingsworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span>, 1508 (1st Cir.1989)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
