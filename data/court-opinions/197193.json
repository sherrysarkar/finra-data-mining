In  1977 the  Massachusetts\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nlegislature  enacted  a statute,  Mass.  Gen.  Laws ch.  175,\r\n\n  112, which  provided that,  for certain types  of liability\r\n\ninsurance,  the Commonwealth would adopt a \"notice prejudice\"\r\n\nrule.  This new statutory  rule departed from the traditional\r\n\ncommon law rule which had strictly enforced notice provisions\r\n\nin  insurance policies, allowing forfeiture of coverage where\r\n\nnotice  to  an insurer  of a  claim  was late.    The Supreme\r\n\nJudicial  Court of  Massachusetts  subsequently extended,  by\r\n\ncommon law, and  then limited  the extension  of, the  notice\r\n\nprejudice rule  for liability  insurance policies.   At issue\r\n\nhere  is whether  the notice  due under  a fidelity  bond was\r\n\nlate.   If  so, does  the state  common law  notice prejudice\r\n\nrule,  under which an insurer must show prejudice in order to\r\n\nbe excused from coverage by the insured's late notice, extend\r\n\nto the Financial Institution Bond at issue. \r\n\n          The  import here is  whether a suit  by the Federal\r\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation  (\"FDIC\"), as receiver  for the\r\n\nfailed  Bank  for Savings,  may  proceed  against the  Bank's\r\n\ninsurer, the Insurance Company  of North America (\"INA\"), for\r\n\ncoverage of losses due to certain dishonest acts committed by\r\n\na Bank officer  and by a  lawyer retained by  the Bank.   The\r\n\nloss to the Bank from these activities is asserted  to be $10\r\n\nmillion.    The  FDIC,  as  receiver  for  the   Bank,  seeks\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nreimbursement for these losses to the  full amount covered by\r\n\nthe Financial Institution Bond issued by INA, $4 million.  \r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          The Bank  gave INA  notice of potential  loss under\r\n\nthe Bond on January 16, 1990.   The insurer declined to  pay,\r\n\nand the Bank brought suit.  The district  court, interpreting\r\n\nthe Bond provisions  on a motion  for summary judgment,  held\r\n\nthat the Bank's notice was late because it had not been filed\r\n\nwithin  30 days  of  discovery of  loss  as required  by  the\r\n\npolicy.   FDIC v. Insurance Co.  of N. Am., 928  F. Supp. 54,\r                                                      \r\n\n62-63  (D. Mass. 1996).   The court  granted summary judgment\r\n\nfor  the defendant.   Id.   The  Bank appeals,  disputing the\r                                     \r\n\ndistrict  court's  analysis  of  the date  of  discovery  and\r\n\nclaiming  that  its notice  was  timely.   The  Bank  further\r\n\nasserts that, even if its notice was late, the district court\r\n\nerred  in failing to apply  the notice prejudice  rule to the\r\n\nBond.1\r\n\n          Our  review of  a grant  of summary judgment  is de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo.  Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 927 (1st Cir. 1996).  We\r                                  \r\n\nhold that the  district court was plainly correct  in holding\r\n\nthat the notice was  late, but we do so  on different grounds\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The parties have  agreed that Massachusetts law  applies.\r\nThe FDIC here sues  as the receiver of a  Massachusetts bank,\r\nand  we  discern no  conflict between  state law  and federal\r\nstatutory   provisions   or  significant   federal  policies.\r\nO'Melveny  &amp; Myers  v. FDIC,  114 S.  Ct. 2048,  2055 (1994);\r                                       \r\nWallis v. Pan Am. Petroleum Corp., 384 U.S. 63, 68 (1966).\r                                             \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nthan  the district  court.   We  also  hold that  the  notice\r\n\nprejudice rule does not apply in this instance.2\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The facts of the employee misconduct underlying the\r\n\nBank's  losses  are taken  from  the  Bank's Bond  claim  and\r\n\naccepted  as true for present  purposes.  From  1987 to 1989,\r\n\nDolores DiCologero,  an Assistant Vice President  of the Bank\r\n\nand  the  manager  of   the  mortgage  department,  and  Paul\r\n\nBonaiuto,  an  attorney retained  to  represent  the Bank  in\r\n\nmortgage closings, conspired  with a condominium  development\r\n\ngroup,  the Rostoff Group, to make hundreds of mortgage loans\r\n\nusing inflated appraisals and purchase prices in violation of\r\n\nBank regulations and the law.  \r\n\n          The   Bank  made  loans   on  condominium  projects\r\n\ndeveloped by the Rostoff Group until February 1989.  Although\r\n\ninternal  regulations forbade the  Bank from participating in\r\n\nmore than one-third of the units in a particular development,\r\n\nthe  Bank   exceeded  these   limits  as  to   Rostoff  Group\r\n\nproperties.  In addition, despite regulations prohibiting the\r\n\nfinancing  of  more  than 80%  of  the  purchase  price of  a\r\n\nproperty,  the Bank  made loans  to purchasers  for the  full\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  INA originally brought a third-party claim in this action\r\nagainst the  dishonest Bank employees who  caused the claimed\r\nlosses.   The district  court dismissed  INA's claim  as moot\r\nbecause it held that,  under the Bond, INA had  no liability.\r\nINA appeals  that  dismissal.    As we  affirm  the  district\r\ncourt's  finding that INA  has no liability,  INA's appeal on\r\nthis issue is moot.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nvalue of condominiums in  Rostoff Group properties.  Bonaiuto\r\n\nprepared closing documents overstating the purchase  price of\r\n\nthe condominiums  and falsely indicating  that the purchasers\r\n\nhad equity in the property.  The loan documentation reflected\r\n\nnonexistent down payments.  In fact, the \"down payments\" took\r\n\nthe  form of  discounts  on the  purchase price.   DiCologero\r\n\nexpedited approval of the mortgages without any investigation\r\n\nof the creditworthiness of the applicants, many  of whom were\r\n\nnot  creditworthy for  the loans  given.  The  aggregate face\r\n\nvalue of the  loans was approximately  $30 million, and  many\r\n\nculminated in default. \r\n\n          Other DiCologero family  members also  participated\r\n\nin the scheme, to their profit.  The overstated values of the\r\n\ncondominiums   were  supported  by   appraisals  prepared  by\r\n\nDiCologero's  son.  He earned more than $33,000 for his work;\r\n\nDiCologero's daughter received $4,550 from the  Rostoff Group\r\n\nfor secretarial work.  DiCologero's husband received  $12,000\r\n\nin referral  fees for  directing potential purchasers  to the\r\n\nRostoff  Group and  purchased a  condominium  himself without\r\n\npaying a deposit, although the Bank records falsely reflected\r\n\nthat he had  done so.  Other aspects of  this tale of avarice\r\n\nand corruption need not  be detailed.  The Bank  was declared\r\n\ninsolvent  on March  20,  1992, and  the  FDIC was  appointed\r\n\nreceiver.   The FDIC asserts  that these events  helped bring\r\n\ndown the Bank.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          In  March 1989,  the  Bank received  a letter  from\r\n\ncounsel for Erna  Hooton, a former bookkeeper of  the Rostoff\r\n\nGroup and a mortgagee on six Rostoff Group units.  Ms. Hooton\r\n\nhad  defaulted   on  the  loans,  and  the   Bank  had  begun\r\n\nforeclosure proceedings.   The letter said that  the Bank had\r\n\nmisrepresented in the loan documents that Ms. Hooton had made\r\n\ndown payments on the  properties.  The letter also  said that\r\n\nMs. Hooton's financial position should  have led the Bank  to\r\n\nrefuse  financing.   The  letter  claimed  that Bonaiuto,  as\r\n\nclosing counsel on the  Hooton loans, was aware of  the false\r\n\ndocumentation.     The   Bank  investigated   these  charges;\r\n\nrepresentatives  of  the  Bank  met with  Steven  Rostoff,  a\r\n\nprincipal of the Rostoff  Group, on March 21, 1989.   Rostoff\r\n\nsaid  that the  down payment  for some  loans, including  Ms.\r\n\nHooton's, had taken the form of a discounted  purchase price.\r\n\nHe denied that anyone  associated with the Bank was  aware of\r\n\nthis.      DiCologero   also   denied   knowledge   of    any\r\n\nirregularities.  The Bank  responded to the Hooton letter  by\r\n\ndenying the allegations.   Because Ms. Hooton did  not pursue\r\n\nthe matter, neither did the Bank.\r\n\n          Then, in August 1989, Herbert and Deanna Bello, two\r\n\ndefaulting  borrowers on  six Rostoff  Group units,  sued the\r\n\nBank for damages and  asserted counterclaims in a foreclosure\r\n\naction brought  by the Bank.  The Bellos asserted, as had Ms.\r\n\nHooton,  that Bonaiuto was aware  that they had  not made the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndown payments reflected in the closing  documents.  They also\r\n\nalleged  that when  they told  Steven  Rostoff that  they had\r\n\npreviously been  unable to obtain financing,  he replied that\r\n\nthey would \"not have to worry about financing\" because he had\r\n\nmade  a \"deal\"  with the  Bank.   The Bank, the  Bellos said,\r\n\nnever asked for financial information from them.   The Bellos\r\n\nfurther alleged that, at one closing, they had pointed out to\r\n\nBonaiuto  that  the  closing  documents  stated  an  inflated\r\n\npurchase  price  and  an  inflated down  payment.    Bonaiuto\r\n\nreferred  them to Rostoff, who  said this was  \"what the Bank\r\n\nwanted.\"  In the foreclosure action, the Bellos' counterclaim\r\n\nspecifically  alleged  that   the  Bank  knowingly  permitted\r\n\nRostoff's misrepresentations.\r\n\n          Another  couple  who  had  purchased  Rostoff Group\r\n\nproperties,  Edward  and  Dorothy  Giamette,  filed  suit  on\r\n\nSeptember  22,   1989  against  the  Bank   and  the  Rostoff\r\n\nprincipals.   Again the complaint alleged  that down payments\r\n\nwere falsely  represented  on  the  closing  documents,  that\r\n\nSteven Rostoff told  the plaintiffs  that the  Bank knew  the\r\n\nfigures were false,  that the appraisals, which were  done by\r\n\nDiCologero's son, were for more than the fair market value of\r\n\nthe properties,  and that this scheme had  been repeated with\r\n\nat least eight  other purchasers  who had bought  a total  of\r\n\nforty-five condominiums.  Earlier, on September 11, 1989, Mr.\r\n\nGiamette had  made similar  allegations in a  counterclaim in\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthe Bank's foreclosure action against him.  None   of   these\r\n\nclaims,  however, prompted the Bank to notify INA of possible\r\n\nlosses due to alleged employee  misconduct.   What eventually\r\n\ndid  lead  the Bank  to  submit  a   notice  of  claim was  a\r\n\nconversation in  October 1989  between DiCologero and  a Vice\r\n\nPresident of  the Bank during which  DiCologero remarked that\r\n\nher  husband had  purchased  a condominium  from the  Rostoff\r\n\nGroup without  making  a down  payment.   The Vice  President\r\n\nreported DiCologero's remark to the Bank's President, who met\r\n\nwith the Bank's Audit Committee on November 6, 1989.  Outside\r\n\nlegal counsel from Gaston &amp; Snow were present at the meeting.\r\n\nThe Committee  discussed \"the possibility of  100% loans, the\r\n\nunknown extent of these loans, employee involvement and legal\r\n\nramifications.\"    Gaston  &amp;  Snow was  asked  to  prepare  a\r\n\npreliminary  analysis  which was  submitted  on  November 15,\r\n\n1989.  Gaston &amp;  Snow then investigated and reported  back to\r\n\nthe Bank on December 18, 1989.  The report recommended, among\r\n\nother  measures, that  the Bank  refer the matter  to federal\r\n\nauthorities, notify INA, and dismiss DiCologero.  On December\r\n\n27, 1989, the Bank filed a Report of  Apparent Crime with the\r\n\nFDIC, advising that it had learned of suspected violations of\r\n\nfederal law on December 18, 1989.  The Bank also notified the\r\n\nFBI and  the U.S.  Attorney's Office.   DiCologero, Bonaiuto,\r\n\nand  the development  group were  later convicted  on federal\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nbank fraud and conspiracy charges.  United States v. Rostoff,\r                                                                        \r\n\n53 F.3d 398 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          On  January 16, 1990, the Bank gave INA notice of a\r\n\npotential loss  arising from  employee misconduct.   The Bank\r\n\nenclosed copies of the complaints in the Giamettes' state and\r\n\nfederal lawsuits with its letter of notice.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          As is  customary in the banking  industry, the Bank\r\n\nhad obtained a Financial  Institution Bond, Standard Form No.\r\n\n24, from INA.  The Bond period originally ran from January 1,\r\n\n1988 to April 1, 1989, and was later extended by agreement to\r\n\nApril 1, 1990.   Insured losses include  those resulting from\r\n\nemployee  dishonesty and  fraud.3   For present  purposes, we\r\n\nassume that the actions of DiCologero and Bonaiuto caused the\r\n\nBank to sustain losses  of the type covered by  the \"INSURING\r\n\nAGREEMENTS FIDELITY\" section of the Bond.4  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Other types of losses covered under other portions of the\r\nBond are not pertinent here.\r\n\n4.  That provision reads:\r\n\n                     INSURING AGREEMENTS\r\n                           FIDELITY\r\n\n          Loss resulting directly from dishonest or\r\n          fraudulent acts committed by  an Employee\r\n          acting alone or in collusion with others.\r\n          Such dishonest or fraudulent acts must be\r\n          committed  by  the   Employee  with   the\r\n          manifest intent:\r\n\n          (a)  to cause the Insured to sustain\r\n               such loss, and\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          The  obligation  of the  insurer  to  indemnify the\r\n\ninsured for covered losses is explicitly made:\r\n\n          subject  to  the  Declarations,  Insuring\r\n          Agreements,      General      Agreements,\r\n          Conditions  and   Limitations  and  other\r\n          terms [of the Bond].\r\n\n          The  \"CONDITIONS  AND LIMITATIONS\"  section  of the\r\n\nBond contains,  among other clauses,  the \"DISCOVERY\" clause.\r\n\nUnder that  clause, the Bond  applies to \"loss  discovered by\r\n\nthe Insured during the Bond Period.\"  The clause then defines\r\n\n\"Discovery\" in two ways:\r\n\n          Discovery occurs when  the Insured  first\r\n          becomes aware of facts which  would cause\r\n          a reasonable person to assume that a loss\r\n          of the type covered by this bond has been\r\n          or  will be incurred,  regardless of when\r\n          the act or  acts causing or  contributing\r\n          to  such loss  occurred, even  though the\r\n          exact amount  or details of the  loss may\r\n          not then be known.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          (b)  to obtain financial benefit  for the\r\n               Employee   or   another  person   or\r\n               entity.\r\n\n          However, if some or all of the  Insured's\r\n          loss results directly or  indirectly from\r\n          Loans,  that portion  of the loss  is not\r\n          covered  unless  the   Employee  was   in\r\n          collusion with one or more parties to the\r\n          transactions   and   has   received,   in\r\n          connection therewith, a financial benefit\r\n          with a value of at least $2,500.\r\n\n          As   used    throughout   this   Insuring\r\n          Agreement,  financial  benefit  does  not\r\n          include any employee  benefits earned  in\r\n          the   normal    course   of   employment,\r\n          including:   salaries, commissions, fees,\r\n          bonuses,   promotions,   awards,   profit\r\n          sharing or pensions.  \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Discovery  also  occurs when  the Insured\r\n          receives notice of an actual or potential\r\n          claim in  which  it is  alleged that  the\r\n          Insured is liable to  a third party under\r\n          circumstances   which,  if   true,  would\r\n          constitute a loss under this bond.\r\n\n          The  \"CONDITIONS AND  LIMITATIONS\"  section of  the\r\n\nBond also contains pertinent notice provisions which state in\r\n\nrelevant part:\r\n\n               NOTICE/PROOF - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\r\n                     AGAINST UNDERWRITER\r\n\n          a)  At  the earliest  practicable moment,\r\n          not to exceed 30 days, after discovery of\r\n          loss,   the   Insured   shall  give   the\r\n          Underwriter notice thereof.\r\n\n          Construing   the   Bond's   first   definition   of\r\n\ndiscovery, the district court found that, at the latest,  the\r\n\nBank had discovered the loss by November 15, 1989.  The court\r\n\nthus  determined that the Bank was required to give notice to\r\n\nINA no later  than December 15, 1989 and that the January 16,\r\n\n1990  notice  was therefore  untimely.    The district  court\r\n\nconcluded that, \"[i]f notice to INA was untimely, the Bank is\r\n\nprecluded from recovery, regardless  of whether INA can prove\r\n\nany actual prejudice as a result of the delay.

Although the  district court relied  on the  Bond's\r\n\nfirst definition of discovery to reach this conclusion, it is\r\n\nmost clearly  reached under the second definition.   See Levy\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir. 1993).  Under the second\r                   \r\n\ndefinition,  discovery  occurs  \"when  the  Insured  receives\r\n\nnotice of an actual or potential claim in which it is alleged\r\n\nthat   the  Insured  is   liable  to  a   third  party  under\r\n\ncircumstances which,  if true, would constitute  a loss under\r\n\nthis bond.\"   The lawsuits and  counterclaims brought by  the\r\n\nBellos and the  Giamettes plainly constituted  actual claims.\r\n\nThe complaints alleged knowing acts of dishonesty or fraud by\r\n\nBank employees.5  Any harm caused by these alleged acts would\r\n\nqualify as loss under the Bond.6\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  We reject  the Bank's  argument that the  complaints only\r\nalleged  that  the  Bank  itself  defrauded  the  Bellos  and\r\nGiamettes and  thus could  not constitute discovery  of loss.\r\nThe complaints and counterclaims all specifically allege that\r\nDiCologero  and/or   Bonaiuto  acted   in  a   dishonest  and\r\nfraudulent manner  under circumstances which,  if true, would\r\nhave created a loss under the Bond.   Moreover, when the Bank\r\nfinally provided  INA with  notice, it cited  the allegations\r\ncontained in the  Giamette complaints  as the  source of  its\r\ndiscovery of loss.\r\n\n6.  Though it is largely irrelevant for our purposes, we will\r\nassume  that the  other  elements of  \"loss\"  are present  --\r\nnamely that, with regard to the portion of the loss resulting\r\nfrom loans, the employee(s), DiCologero and/or Bonaiuto, were\r\nin collusion with one or more parties to the transactions and\r\nreceived  a financial benefit with a value of at least $2,500\r\nfrom  principals  involved in  the  transactions.   The  Bank\r\nconceded in its notice letter to INA that, with regard to the\r\nloans alleged  in the  Giamette complaints, it  appeared that\r\nDiCologero's family members received financial benefits of at\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          The Bank weakly  argues that these complaints  \"did\r\n\nnot  rise  to   the  level  of  allegations  of   deceit  and\r\n\nmisrepresentation on  the part  of Bank employees  seeking to\r\n\nobtain  improper financial  benefits but rather  were nothing\r\n\nmore than the litigation  tactics of defaulting borrowers who\r\n\nwere  confronting foreclosure  proceedings.\"   That  argument\r\n\nmisses  the point.  The  Bond requires notice  to the insurer\r\n\nupon  a claim of employee  dishonesty and does  not allow the\r\n\ninsured  to wait until the claim is proved.  Further, General\r\n\nAgreement F of  the Bond independently  required the Bank  to\r\n\nprovide INA -- within  thirty days -- with all  pleadings and\r\n\npertinent papers in any legal proceeding brought to determine\r\n\nthe insured's liability for any loss. \r\n\n          The Bank  also asserts  that third-party  claims do\r\n\nnot  trigger  discovery   under  the  second  definition   of\r\n\ndiscovery unless those claims are reasonable.  Whether or not\r\n\nMassachusetts adopts  such  a reasonableness  standard,7  the\r\n\nclaims here met any such requirement and triggered the notice\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nleast $2,500. \r\n\n7.  But cf. Clore &amp; Keeley, \"Discovery of Loss,\" in Financial\r                                                                         \r\nInstitution Bonds  89, 113 (Duncan  L. Clore ed.,  1995) (\"As\r                             \r\nlong as a third party's claim would constitute a covered loss\r\nunder the bond if proven  to be true, it matters  not whether\r\nthe  allegations  are  perceived   as  true.    Instead,  the\r\nallegations  can be completely false.  The point is, once the\r\nallegations are made, the insurer has the right to know about\r\nthem  and  to  conduct  whatever investigation  it  may  deem\r\nappropriate.\").\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nrequirement by, at the  latest, mid-September 1989.   By that\r\n\ntime,  the Bank had been  informed that at  least ten persons\r\n\nclaimed to  have purchased more than  fifty condominiums from\r\n\nthe  Rostoff Group without any  down payment or  with a lower\r\n\ndown payment  than the  Bank's loan documentation  reflected.\r\n\nThe Bank was  charged with  knowing that the  figures in  the\r\n\nloan  documentation  were false.    The  Bank's attorney  was\r\n\nalleged to be complicit  in the falsehoods.   The son of  the\r\n\nBank's mortgage department manager purportedly had  been paid\r\n\nfor false appraisals.   A principal of the Rostoff  Group had\r\n\nconfirmed  that this had happened.  The similarity of all the\r\n\nallegations is telling.  If a \"smell test\" was  in order, the\r\n\nsmell  was rank indeed.  Accordingly, the notice given by the\r\n\nBank on January 16, 1990 was untimely.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n          More  difficult  is  the  question  of whether  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  courts  would  apply  the  common  law \"notice\r\n\nprejudice\" rule to Financial  Institution Bonds of this sort.\r\n\nThis is  a question of law.   See J.I. Corp.  v.

The  Massachusetts   law  of  notice\r\n\nprejudice  has been  previously visited  by the  decisions of\r\n\nthis  court  in  J.I.   Corp.,  supra;  National  Union  Fire\r                                                                         \r\n\nInsurance Co. v.

For various reasons, in all three of these cases\r\n\nthis court declined to apply the notice prejudice rule.\r\n\n          The  Bank urges us to analyze the issue in terms of\r\n\nwhether the  admittedly  different  policy  language  in  the\r\n\nFinancial  Institution Bond  is  closer  to  an  \"occurrence\"\r\n\nliability policy  or a  \"claims made and  reported\" liability\r\n\ninsurance  policy.   There  is,  however,  a logically  prior\r\n\nquestion  and  one  which it  is  prudent  to  ask under  our\r\n\nobligation  to apply  state substantive  law (in  the absence\r\n\nhere of any conflict  with or a threat to  federal policies).\r\n\nSee Atherton v. FDIC, No. 95-928, 1997 WL 9781 (U.S. Jan. 14,\r                                \r\n\n1997); Erie R.R.  Co. v.

We must apply the  law of Massachusetts as\r                       \r\n\ngiven  by its  state legislature  and state  court decisions.\r\n\nAnd in that lies the difficulty of the Bank's position.\r\n\n          The  Supreme Judicial Court  has never  applied the\r\n\nnotice prejudice rule to a Financial Institution Bond.   Such\r\n\nfidelity  bonds, as  discussed later,  are different  in kind\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nfrom liability insurance policies.  In  creating a common law\r\n\nnotice prejudice rule,  the Johnson Controls court did  so in\r                                                        \r\n\nthe context of liability  policies.  The statutory progenitor\r\n\nto Johnson Controls concerned automobile liability policies.8\r                               \r\n\nThe refinement and limitation of the notice prejudice rule in\r\n\nChas.  T. Main was also in the context of liability policies.\r                          \r\n\nAnd the usual posture in which the court has applied the rule\r\n\nhas been in liability policies.  See, e.g., Darcy v. Hartford\r                                                                         \r\n\nIns. Co.,  554  N.E.2d 28  (Mass. 1990).

The  requirement of timely notice is  a condition of this\r\nBond and so  is a  condition of coverage  under the  parties'\r\nagreement.  In  a bond of  this type,  the Insured agrees  to\r\ncomply with the bond's \"CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS\" governing\r\nthe procedure for presenting  and proving the Insured's claim\r\nin exchange  for the  indemnity promised by  the Underwriter.\r\nWoods, \"Conditions Precedent to Recovery: Presentation of the\r\nInsured's  Claim,\" in  Financial Institution  Bonds  285, 285\r                                                               \r\n(Duncan  L.

The transformation  from treatment  as a surety  bond to\r\ntreatment  as  an  insurance   contract  was  prompted  by  a\r\nbroadening  in  the  scope  of coverage  of  fidelity  bonds.\r\n\"[F]idelity coverage  came to encompass not  only traditional\r\nemployee dishonesty, but other related risks, and became more\r\nlike a  contract of insurance, using  the terms 'underwriter'\r\nand 'insured'  instead of 'surety'  and 'obligee.'\"   Knoll &amp;\r\nBolduan,  supra, at  5.   Here, the  only insuring  clause at\r                           \r\nissue is the one  covering \"traditional employee dishonesty.\"\r\nBut it is also  true that INA is described in  the Bond as an\r\n\"underwriter\" providing insurance.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ndegree  to which the contingency is within the control of one\r\n\nof  the parties.  In  the classic instance  of insurance, the\r\n\nrisk is controlled only by chance or nature.  In guaranty and\r\n\nsurety arrangements, the risk tends to be wholly or partially\r\n\nin  the  control  of  one of  the  three  parties  [promisor,\r\n\ncreditor, or debtor].\"   1  Couch on Insurance  3d, supra,   \r                                                                     \r\n\n1:18.   There  is also  a  difference in  the liability  of a\r\n\nclassic insurer  and that  of surety/guarantor.   An insurer,\r\n\nupon  the  occurrence  of  the  contingency,  must  bear  the\r\n\nultimate loss, while  a surety  is entitled  to indemnity  in\r\n\ncase the surety is compelled to perform.  \r\n\n          It  is also  significant,  as was  true in  Liberty\r                                                                         \r\n\nMutual, 773  F.2d at  18, that the  Massachusetts legislature\r                  \r\n\nhas  made  distinctions  in  this area.

That\r                             \r\n\nexpression  of   public   policy  undercuts   any   automatic\r\n\napplication of the insurance  notice prejudice rule to surety\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nbonds, and thus to Financial Institution  Bonds to the extent\r\n\nthat they partake of the characteristics of surety bonds. \r\n\n          These distinctions confirm our reluctance to extend\r\n\nthe state  notice prejudice  rule for liability  insurance to\r\n\nFinancial  Institution  Bonds.   The  material  technical and\r\n\nsubstantive differences between  a Financial Institution Bond\r\n\nand liability insurance make it difficult to apply easily the\r\n\ncommon  law notice prejudice rule, developed as it was in the\r\n\nliability  insurance  context,  to the  insuring  arrangement\r\n\nhere.\r\n\n          In   Cheschi,  as  in  Liberty  Mutual,  the  court\r                                                            \r\n\nconsidered  the fact  that  the  insuring  arrangements  (not\r\n\nliability  policies) did  not  involve  layperson  consumers.\r\n\nRather, they involved sophisticated businesses.  Accordingly,\r\n\nthere  was little  reason to  depart from  the usual  rule of\r\n\nholding  the parties to their  bargain.

This new statutory rule departed from the traditional common law rule which had strictly enforced notice provisions in insurance policies, allowing forfeiture of coverage where notice to an insurer of a claim was late.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts subsequently extended, by common law, and then limited the extension of, the notice prejudice rule for liability insurance policies.  At issue here is whether the notice due under a fidelity bond was late.  If so, does the state common law notice prejudice rule, under which an insurer must show prejudice in order to be excused from coverage by the insured's late notice, extend to the Financial Institution Bond at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The import here is whether a suit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as receiver for the failed Bank for Savings, may proceed against the Bank's insurer, the Insurance Company of North America (\"INA\"), for coverage of losses due to certain dishonest acts committed by a Bank officer and by a lawyer retained by the Bank.  The loss to the Bank from these activities is asserted to be $10 million.  The FDIC, as receiver for the Bank, seeks reimbursement for these losses to the full amount covered by the Financial Institution Bond issued by INA, $4 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank gave INA notice of potential loss under the Bond on January 16, 1990.  The insurer declined to pay, and the Bank brought suit.  The district court, interpreting the Bond provisions on a motion for summary judgment, held that the Bank's notice was late because it had not been filed within 30 days of discovery of loss as required by the policy.  FDIC v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 928 F.Supp. 54, 62-63 (D.Mass.1996).  The court granted summary judgment for the defendant.  Id.  The Bank appeals, disputing the district court's analysis of the date of discovery and claiming that its notice was timely.  The Bank further asserts that, even if its notice was late, the district court erred in failing to apply the notice prejudice rule to the Bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.  Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 927 (1st Cir.1996).  We hold that the district court was plainly correct in holding that the notice was late, but we do so on different grounds than the district court.  We also hold that the notice prejudice rule does not apply in this instance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the employee misconduct underlying the Bank's losses are taken from the Bank's Bond claim and accepted as true for present purposes.  From 1987 to 1989, Dolores DiCologero, an Assistant Vice President of the Bank and the manager of the mortgage department, and Paul Bonaiuto, an attorney retained to represent the Bank in mortgage closings, conspired with a condominium development group, the Rostoff Group, to make hundreds of mortgage loans using inflated appraisals and purchase prices in violation of Bank regulations and the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank made loans on condominium projects developed by the Rostoff Group until February 1989.  Although internal regulations forbade the Bank from participating in more than one-third of the units in a particular development, the Bank exceeded these limits as to Rostoff Group properties.  In addition, despite regulations prohibiting the financing of more than 80% of the purchase price of a property, the Bank made loans to purchasers for the full value of condominiums in Rostoff Group properties.  Bonaiuto prepared closing documents overstating the purchase price of the condominiums and falsely indicating that the purchasers had equity in the property.  The loan documentation reflected nonexistent down payments.  In fact, the \"down payments\" took the form of discounts on the purchase price.  DiCologero expedited approval of the mortgages without any investigation of the creditworthiness of the applicants, many of whom were not creditworthy for the loans given.  The aggregate face value of the loans was approximately $30 million, and many culminated in default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other DiCologero family members also participated in the scheme, to their profit.  The overstated values of the condominiums were supported by appraisals prepared by DiCologero's son.  He earned more than $33,000 for his work;  DiCologero's daughter received $4,550 from the Rostoff Group for secretarial work.  DiCologero's husband received $12,000 in referral fees for directing potential purchasers to the Rostoff Group and purchased a condominium himself without paying a deposit, although the Bank records falsely reflected that he had done so.  Other aspects of this tale of avarice and corruption need not be detailed.  The Bank was declared insolvent on March 20, 1992, and the FDIC was appointed receiver.  The FDIC asserts that these events helped bring down the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1989, the Bank received a letter from counsel for Erna Hooton, a former bookkeeper of the Rostoff Group and a mortgagee on six Rostoff Group units.  Ms. Hooton had defaulted on the loans, and the Bank had begun foreclosure proceedings.  The letter said that the Bank had misrepresented in the loan documents that Ms. Hooton had made down payments on the properties.  The letter also said that Ms. Hooton's financial position should have led the Bank to refuse financing.  The letter claimed that Bonaiuto, as closing counsel on the Hooton loans, was aware of the false documentation.  The Bank investigated these charges;  representatives of the Bank met with Steven Rostoff, a principal of the Rostoff Group, on March 21, 1989.  Rostoff said that the down payment for some loans, including Ms. Hooton's, had taken the form of a discounted purchase price.  He denied that anyone associated with the Bank was aware of this.  DiCologero also denied knowledge of any irregularities.  The Bank responded to the Hooton letter by denying the allegations.  Because Ms. Hooton did not pursue the matter, neither did the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in August 1989, Herbert and Deanna Bello, two defaulting borrowers on six Rostoff Group units, sued the Bank for damages and asserted counterclaims in a foreclosure action brought by the Bank.  The Bellos asserted, as had Ms. Hooton, that Bonaiuto was aware that they had not made the down payments reflected in the closing documents.  They also alleged that when they told Steven Rostoff that they had previously been unable to obtain financing, he replied that they would \"not have to worry about financing\" because he had made a \"deal\" with the Bank.  The Bank, the Bellos said, never asked for financial information from them.  The Bellos further alleged that, at one closing, they had pointed out to Bonaiuto that the closing documents stated an inflated purchase price and an inflated down payment.  Bonaiuto referred them to Rostoff, who said this was \"what the Bank wanted.\"   In the foreclosure action, the Bellos' counterclaim specifically alleged that the Bank knowingly permitted Rostoff's misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another couple who had purchased Rostoff Group properties, Edward and Dorothy Giamette, filed suit on September 22, 1989 against the Bank and the Rostoff principals.  Again the complaint alleged that down payments were falsely represented on the closing documents, that Steven Rostoff told the plaintiffs that the Bank knew the figures were false, that the appraisals, which were done by DiCologero's son, were for more than the fair market value of the properties, and that this scheme had been repeated with at least eight other purchasers who had bought a total of forty-five condominiums.  Earlier, on September 11, 1989, Mr. Giamette had made similar allegations in a counterclaim in the Bank's foreclosure action against him.  None of these claims, however, prompted the Bank to notify INA of possible losses due to alleged employee misconduct.  What eventually did lead the Bank to submit a notice of claim was a conversation in October 1989 between DiCologero and a Vice President of the Bank during which DiCologero remarked that her husband had purchased a condominium from the Rostoff Group without making a down payment.  The Vice President reported DiCologero's remark to the Bank's President, who met with the Bank's Audit Committee on November 6, 1989.  Outside legal counsel from Gaston &amp; Snow were present at the meeting.  The Committee discussed \"the possibility of 100% loans, the unknown extent of these loans, employee involvement and legal ramifications.\"   Gaston &amp; Snow was asked to prepare a preliminary analysis which was submitted on November 15, 1989.  Gaston &amp; Snow then investigated and reported back to the Bank on December 18, 1989.  The report recommended, among other measures, that the Bank refer the matter to federal authorities, notify INA, and dismiss DiCologero.  On December 27, 1989, the Bank filed a Report of Apparent Crime with the FDIC, advising that it had learned of suspected violations of federal law on December 18, 1989.  The Bank also notified the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office.  DiCologero, Bonaiuto, and the development group were later convicted on federal bank fraud and conspiracy charges.  United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 1990, the Bank gave INA notice of a potential loss arising from employee misconduct.  The Bank enclosed copies of the complaints in the Giamettes' state and federal lawsuits with its letter of notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is customary in the banking industry, the Bank had obtained a Financial Institution Bond, Standard Form No. 24, from INA.  The Bond period originally ran from January 1, 1988 to April 1, 1989, and was later extended by agreement to April 1, 1990.  Insured losses include those resulting from employee dishonesty and fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  For present purposes, we assume that the actions of DiCologero and Bonaiuto caused the Bank to sustain losses of the type covered by the \"INSURING AGREEMENTS FIDELITY\" section of the Bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The obligation of the insurer to indemnify the insured for covered losses is explicitly made:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>subject to the Declarations, Insuring Agreements, General Agreements, Conditions and Limitations and other terms [of the Bond].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS\" section of the Bond contains, among other clauses, the \"DISCOVERY\" clause.  Under that clause, the Bond applies to \"loss discovered by the Insured during the Bond Period.\"   The clause then defines \"Discovery\" in two ways:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Discovery occurs when the Insured first becomes aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss of the type covered by this bond has been or will be incurred, regardless of when the act or acts causing or contributing to such loss occurred, even though the exact amount or details of the loss may not then be known.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Discovery also occurs when the Insured receives notice of an actual or potential claim in which it is alleged that the Insured is liable to a third party under circumstances which, if true, would constitute a loss under this bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS\" section of the Bond also contains pertinent notice provisions which state in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>NOTICE/PROOF--LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST UNDERWRITER</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>a) At the earliest practicable moment, not to exceed 30 days, after discovery of loss, the Insured shall give the Underwriter notice thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construing the Bond's first definition of discovery, the district court found that, at the latest, the Bank had discovered the loss by November 15, 1989.  The court thus determined that the Bank was required to give notice to INA no later than December 15, 1989 and that the January 16, 1990 notice was therefore untimely.  The district court concluded that, \"[i]f notice to INA was untimely, the Bank is precluded from recovery, regardless of whether INA can prove any actual prejudice as a result of the delay.  J.I. Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., 920 F.2d 118, 120 (1st Cir.1990) (interpreting Johnson Controls v. Bowes, 381 Mass. 278, 409 N.E.2d 185 (1980)).\"  Insurance Co. of N. Am., 928 F.Supp. at 59.   The district court then granted INA's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that discovery was earlier than the Bank posits.  Although the district court relied on the Bond's first definition of discovery to reach this conclusion, it is most clearly reached under the second definition.  See Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).  Under the second definition, discovery occurs \"when the Insured receives notice of an actual or potential claim in which it is alleged that the Insured is liable to a third party under circumstances which, if true, would constitute a loss under this bond.\"   The lawsuits and counterclaims brought by the Bellos and the Giamettes plainly constituted actual claims.  The complaints alleged knowing acts of dishonesty or fraud by Bank employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Any harm caused by these alleged acts would qualify as loss under the Bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank weakly argues that these complaints \"did not rise to the level of allegations of deceit and misrepresentation on the part of Bank employees seeking to obtain improper financial benefits but rather were nothing more than the litigation tactics of defaulting borrowers who were confronting foreclosure proceedings.\"   That argument misses the point.  The Bond requires notice to the insurer upon a claim of employee dishonesty and does not allow the insured to wait until the claim is proved.  Further, General Agreement F of the Bond independently required the Bank to provide INA--within thirty days--with all pleadings and pertinent papers in any legal proceeding brought to determine the insured's liability for any loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank also asserts that third-party claims do not trigger discovery under the second definition of discovery unless those claims are reasonable.  Whether or not Massachusetts adopts such a reasonableness standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the claims here met any such requirement and triggered the notice requirement by, at the latest, mid-September 1989.  By that time, the Bank had been informed that at least ten persons claimed to have purchased more than fifty condominiums from the Rostoff Group without any down payment or with a lower down payment than the Bank's loan documentation reflected.  The Bank was charged with knowing that the figures in the loan documentation were false.  The Bank's attorney was alleged to be complicit in the falsehoods.  The son of the Bank's mortgage department manager purportedly had been paid for false appraisals.  A principal of the Rostoff Group had confirmed that this had happened.  The similarity of all the allegations is telling.  If a \"smell test\" was in order, the smell was rank indeed.  Accordingly, the notice given by the Bank on January 16, 1990 was untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More difficult is the question of whether the Massachusetts courts would apply the common law \"notice prejudice\" rule to Financial Institution Bonds of this sort.  This is a question of law.  See J.I. Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., 920 F.2d 118, 119 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two primary cases from the Supreme Judicial Court on the notice prejudice rule are Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Bowes, 381 Mass. 278, 409 N.E.2d 185 (1980), which creates a common law notice prejudice rule for liability policies, and Chas. T. Main, Inc. v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., 406 Mass. 862, 551 N.E.2d 28 (1990), which limits the rule in the context of liability policies.  The Massachusetts law of notice prejudice has been previously visited by the decisions of this court in J.I. Corp., supra; National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Talcott, 931 F.2d 166 (1st Cir.1991);  and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v. Gibbs, 773 F.2d 15 (1st Cir.1985).  For various reasons, in all three of these cases this court declined to apply the notice prejudice rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank urges us to analyze the issue in terms of whether the admittedly different policy language in the Financial Institution Bond is closer to an \"occurrence\" liability policy or a \"claims made and reported\" liability insurance policy.  There is, however, a logically prior question and one which it is prudent to ask under our obligation to apply state substantive law (in the absence here of any conflict with or a threat to federal policies).  See Atherton v. FDIC, 519 U.S. 213, 117 S.Ct. 666, 136 L.Ed.2d 656 (1997);  Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938);  see also infra n. 1.  We must apply the law of Massachusetts as given by its state legislature and state court decisions.  And in that lies the difficulty of the Bank's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court has never applied the notice prejudice rule to a Financial Institution Bond.  Such fidelity bonds, as discussed later, are different in kind from liability insurance policies.  In creating a common law notice prejudice rule, the Johnson Controls court did so in the context of liability policies.  The statutory progenitor to Johnson Controls concerned automobile liability policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The refinement and limitation of the notice prejudice rule in Chas. T. Main was also in the context of liability policies.  And the usual posture in which the court has applied the rule has been in liability policies.  See, e.g., Darcy v. Hartford Ins. Co., 407 Mass. 481, 554 N.E.2d 28 (1990).  No court has yet extended the Massachusetts notice prejudice rule to fidelity policies such as this Bond.  See, e.g., J.I. Corp., 920 F.2d at 118;  Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 613 F.Supp. 1090 (D.Mass.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When guidance is sought from Massachusetts caselaw concerning fidelity policies, that law, admittedly not of recent vintage, does not require our application of the notice prejudice rule here.  The background law of Massachusetts, which we believe is not overruled by Johnson Controls, was that conditions and limitations in such policies are construed as written.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In Gilmour v. Standard Surety and Casualty Co., 292 Mass. 205, 197 N.E. 673 (1935), the court was concerned with a bond for acts of dishonesty.  \"The contract of suretyship made by the defendant provided indemnity to the plaintiffs in the event they sustained loss through dishonest conduct on the part of the agency.\"  Id. 197 N.E. at 673.   The bond had the following condition and limitation:  \"That loss be discovered during the continuance of the suretyship or within six (6) months after its termination, and notice delivered to the Surety at its Home Office within ten (10) days after such discovery.\"  Id. at 673.   The court held that \"[t]he giving of such notice was made a condition precedent to recovery on the bond.\"  Id. at 675.   The court noted that it was concerned not with \"the question of the circumstances under which at common law an obligation is imposed on the obligee in a fidelity bond to give the surety notice,\" but rather with the question of the timing of the notice given.  Id. at 674.   The question was whether the plaintiffs had complied with the ten day notice period in order to be able to recover on the bond.  The notice was apparently given during the bond year, but the court still considered the dispositive question to be whether the notice was given within the ten day period.  Id. at 674.  (The court concluded that it had).  No case has said that Gilmour has been overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Gibbs, 773 F.2d 15 (1st Cir.1985), this court held that, Johnson Controls notwithstanding, the contract of insurance there must be enforced according to its terms and that the notice prejudice rule did not apply.  At issue was a contract of reinsurance.  The contract's notice clause required notice to be given \"as soon as possible.\"  Id. at 18.   Our court thought important three things.  First, the parties involved were not lay policyholders who required protection.  Id.  Second, the case involved two insurance companies, experienced businesses, that had bargained at arm's length.  Id.  Third, the Massachusetts insurance statute, as is true here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> distinguished between the contracts at issue (reinsurance) and liability policies.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cheschi v. Boston Edison Co., 39 Mass.App.Ct. 133, 654 N.E.2d 48, 53 (1995), Chief Judge Warner of the Appeals Court of Massachusetts rejected application of the notice prejudice rule to an indemnity contract, distinguishing Johnson Controls.   The court adopted and expanded upon this court's reasoning in Liberty Mutual, doubting that the notice prejudice rule would apply to types of insurance other than liability insurance when the insureds were not laypersons and when the parties to the contract were two sophisticated business concerns.  654 N.E.2d at 53.   The court held that it would apply traditional contract principles to the language of the indemnity clause, saying:  \"Rules addressing the special circumstances of certain insurance policies should not be applied in these circumstances.\"  Id. at 53-54.   Because it found language in the policy equivalent to making prompt notice a condition, the court held that the lack of prompt notice relieved the insurer of its obligation to reimburse the insured.  Id. at 54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guided by these principles, we analyze Massachusetts law.  Cheschi cautions against automatic application of notice prejudice rules designed for one type of insurance to other insuring arrangements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  654 N.E.2d at 53-54.   The Bond here is a Financial Institution Bond, Standard Form No. 24, as revised in 1986.  It is the most recent form in a long line of Financial Institution Bond forms utilized by members of the Surety Association of America.  See generally Knoll &amp; Bolduan, \"A Brief History of the Financial Institution Bond,\" in Financial Institution Bonds (1995), supra, at 1.   Such bonds are basically fidelity bonds, written specifically for financial institutions, including commercial and savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, stockbrokers, finance companies, and insurance companies.  I Fitzgerald et al., Principles of Suretyship 67 (1st ed. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fidelity bonds are a sort of \"honesty insurance,\" insuring against employee dishonesty.  See Weldy, \"History of the Bankers Blanket Bond and the Financial Institution Bond with Comments on the Drafting Process,\" in Financial Institution Bonds 1, 1 (1989);  Knoll &amp; Bolduan, supra, at 1.   The capacity of one who ensures the fidelity of another's employee has been described as part insurer and part surety, with liability in either capacity being primary and direct.  1 Russ &amp; Segalla, Couch on Insurance 3d &#167; 1:16 (1995).  Early Massachusetts cases about the Blanket Bankers Bond, the predecessor to the Financial Insurance Bond, use both the language of surety and the language of insurance.  See, e.g., Fitchburg Sav. Bank v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., 274 Mass. 135, 174 N.E. 324, 328 (1931).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is said that \"[i]n most cases and for most purposes, ... [fidelity bonds] are recognized to be a form of insurance that are subject to the rules applicable to insurance contracts generally.\"   1 Couch on Insurance 3d, supra, &#167; 1:16 (citing law from various states).  Nonetheless, scholars have noted that, while fidelity bonds have, over time, become more like insurance contracts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> a fidelity bond is still not liability insurance:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Although often referred to as insurance, it is not liability insurance, but rather a two-party indemnity agreement through which the insurer reimburses the insured for losses actually suffered in accordance with the contract provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weldy, supra, at 2;  see also Knoll &amp; Bolduan, supra, at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that the Bond possesses some characteristics of surety arrangements which distinguish them from liability policies.  \"The nature of the risk assumed by the party in the role of 'insurer' is a major distinction between insurance and the arrangements of guaranty and surety....  [T]he risk can be characterized in terms of the degree to which the contingency is within the control of one of the parties.  In the classic instance of insurance, the risk is controlled only by chance or nature.  In guaranty and surety arrangements, the risk tends to be wholly or partially in the control of one of the three parties [promisor, creditor, or debtor].\"  1 Couch on Insurance 3d, supra, &#167; 1:18.  There is also a difference in the liability of a classic insurer and that of surety/guarantor.  An insurer, upon the occurrence of the contingency, must bear the ultimate loss, while a surety is entitled to indemnity in case the surety is compelled to perform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also significant, as was true in Liberty Mutual, 773 F.2d at 18, that the Massachusetts legislature has made distinctions in this area.  The Massachusetts legislature has decided that, for most regulatory purposes, surety bonds are not insurance contracts.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 107.  In Williams v. Ashland Engineering Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 807, 116 S.Ct. 51, 133 L.Ed.2d 16 (1995), this court found that \"surety bonds are not insurance contracts, and are thus not subject to the Commonwealth's insurance laws.\"   See also General Elec. Co. v. Lexington Contracting Corp., 363 Mass. 122, 292 N.E.2d 874, 876 (1973).  That expression of public policy undercuts any automatic application of the insurance notice prejudice rule to surety bonds, and thus to Financial Institution Bonds to the extent that they partake of the characteristics of surety bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These distinctions confirm our reluctance to extend the state notice prejudice rule for liability insurance to Financial Institution Bonds.  The material technical and substantive differences between a Financial Institution Bond and liability insurance make it difficult to apply easily the common law notice prejudice rule, developed as it was in the liability insurance context, to the insuring arrangement here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cheschi, as in Liberty Mutual, the court considered the fact that the insuring arrangements (not liability policies) did not involve layperson consumers.  Rather, they involved sophisticated businesses.  Accordingly, there was little reason to depart from the usual rule of holding the parties to their bargain.  In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Judicial Court had stated that one reason for applying the notice prejudice rule in that case was that the insurance policy was:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>not a negotiated agreement;  rather its conditions are by and large dictated by the insurance company to the insured.  The only aspect of the contract over which the insured can 'bargain' is the monetary amount of the coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">409 N.E.2d at 187 (quoting Brakeman v. Potomac Ins. Co., 472 Pa. 66, 371 A.2d 193, 196 (1977)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contrast, the Bond is an agreement whose basic terms are negotiated between two industries.  Over the years, the banking industry and the fidelity bond companies have negotiated various standard forms of the Financial Institution Bonds.  See generally Knoll &amp; Bolduan, supra;  Weldy, supra.   As one commentator has noted, \"the fidelity bond is an arms-length, negotiated contract between sophisticated business entities, the standard form for which was drafted by the joint efforts of the Surety Association of America and the American Bankers Association.\"   Koch, supra, at vii.  For example, at the request of the American Bankers Association, the 1986 Bond added coverage for Uncertificated Securities, and adopted the UCC definitions of these financial instruments.  Knoll &amp; Bolduan, supra, at 25;  see also Calcasieu-Marine Nat'l Bank v. American Employers' Ins. Co., 533 F.2d 290, 295 n. 6 (5th Cir.)  (bankers bond being construed was drafted as a joint effort by the American Bankers Association and the American Surety Association), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 922, 97 S.Ct. 319, 50 L.Ed.2d 289 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank brings up the doctrine of contra proferentem arguing that \"[a]mbiguities are resolved against the insurer, who drafted the policy, and in favor of the insured.\"  GRE Ins. Group v. Metropolitan Boston Hous.  Partnership, Inc., 61 F.3d 79, 81 (1st Cir.1995).  This doctrine provides the Bank no refuge.  The presumption against the insurer is not applied where the policy language results from the bargaining between sophisticated commercial parties of similar bargaining power.  Falmouth Nat'l Bank v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 920 F.2d 1058, 1062 (1st Cir.1990)(applying Massachusetts law).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, to the extent the notice prejudice rule is supported by the policy of protecting consumers who effectively have little or no bargaining leverage, that policy provides no basis here to extend the notice prejudice rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Bank draws support for its position from a Tenth Circuit decision, FDIC v. Oldenburg, 34 F.3d 1529 (10th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 861, 116 S.Ct. 171, 133 L.Ed.2d 112 (1995) and district court decisions from other jurisdictions.  The court in Oldenburg predicted that Utah law would require a Financial Institution Bond company to show prejudice in order to avoid coverage where the bank gave late notice.  Id. at 1546.   The court held that the notice prejudice rule applied in light of:  (1) the failure of the policy to expressly make notice within a specific time a condition precedent to recovery;  (2) the Utah rule that provisions excluding coverage are strictly construed against the insurer;  and (3) a Utah statute, enacted after the Bond period, which expressed a public policy that the notice prejudice rule be applied to all insurance policies.  Id. at 1545-46.   Whatever the requirements of Utah or other law, Massachusetts law governs this issue, and Massachusetts has, until the Supreme Judicial Court or the state legislature decides otherwise, framed its public policy choices differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the notice prejudice rule does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties have agreed that Massachusetts law applies.

This new statutory rule departed from the traditional common law rule which had strictly enforced notice provisions in insurance policies, allowing forfeiture of coverage where notice to an insurer of a claim was late.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts subsequently extended, by common law, and then limited the extension of, the notice prejudice rule for liability insurance policies.  At issue here is whether the notice due under a fidelity bond was late.  If so, does the state common law notice prejudice rule, under which an insurer must show prejudice in order to be excused from coverage by the insured's late notice, extend to the Financial Institution Bond at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The import here is whether a suit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as receiver for the failed Bank for Savings, may proceed against the Bank's insurer, the Insurance Company of North America (\"INA\"), for coverage of losses due to certain dishonest acts committed by a Bank officer and by a lawyer retained by the Bank.  The loss to the Bank from these activities is asserted to be $10 million.  The FDIC, as receiver for the Bank, seeks reimbursement for these losses to the full amount covered by the Financial Institution Bond issued by INA, $4 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank gave INA notice of potential loss under the Bond on January 16, 1990.  The insurer declined to pay, and the Bank brought suit.  The district court, interpreting the Bond provisions on a motion for summary judgment, held that the Bank's notice was late because it had not been filed within 30 days of discovery of loss as required by the policy.  FDIC v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Bank appeals, disputing the district court's analysis of the date of discovery and claiming that its notice was timely.  The Bank further asserts that, even if its notice was late, the district court erred in failing to apply the notice prejudice rule to the Bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.

We hold that the district court was plainly correct in holding that the notice was late, but we do so on different grounds than the district court.  We also hold that the notice prejudice rule does not apply in this instance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the employee misconduct underlying the Bank's losses are taken from the Bank's Bond claim and accepted as true for present purposes.  From 1987 to 1989, Dolores DiCologero, an Assistant Vice President of the Bank and the manager of the mortgage department, and Paul Bonaiuto, an attorney retained to represent the Bank in mortgage closings, conspired with a condominium development group, the Rostoff Group, to make hundreds of mortgage loans using inflated appraisals and purchase prices in violation of Bank regulations and the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank made loans on condominium projects developed by the Rostoff Group until February 1989.  Although internal regulations forbade the Bank from participating in more than one-third of the units in a particular development, the Bank exceeded these limits as to Rostoff Group properties.  In addition, despite regulations prohibiting the financing of more than 80% of the purchase price of a property, the Bank made loans to purchasers for the full value of condominiums in Rostoff Group properties.  Bonaiuto prepared closing documents overstating the purchase price of the condominiums and falsely indicating that the purchasers had equity in the property.  The loan documentation reflected nonexistent down payments.  In fact, the \"down payments\" took the form of discounts on the purchase price.  DiCologero expedited approval of the mortgages without any investigation of the creditworthiness of the applicants, many of whom were not creditworthy for the loans given.  The aggregate face value of the loans was approximately $30 million, and many culminated in default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other DiCologero family members also participated in the scheme, to their profit.  The overstated values of the condominiums were supported by appraisals prepared by DiCologero's son.  He earned more than $33,000 for his work;  DiCologero's daughter received $4,550 from the Rostoff Group for secretarial work.  DiCologero's husband received $12,000 in referral fees for directing potential purchasers to the Rostoff Group and purchased a condominium himself without paying a deposit, although the Bank records falsely reflected that he had done so.  Other aspects of this tale of avarice and corruption need not be detailed.  The Bank was declared insolvent on March 20, 1992, and the FDIC was appointed receiver.  The FDIC asserts that these events helped bring down the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1989, the Bank received a letter from counsel for Erna Hooton, a former bookkeeper of the Rostoff Group and a mortgagee on six Rostoff Group units.  Ms. Hooton had defaulted on the loans, and the Bank had begun foreclosure proceedings.  The letter said that the Bank had misrepresented in the loan documents that Ms. Hooton had made down payments on the properties.  The letter also said that Ms. Hooton's financial position should have led the Bank to refuse financing.  The letter claimed that Bonaiuto, as closing counsel on the Hooton loans, was aware of the false documentation.  The Bank investigated these charges;  representatives of the Bank met with Steven Rostoff, a principal of the Rostoff Group, on March 21, 1989.  Rostoff said that the down payment for some loans, including Ms. Hooton's, had taken the form of a discounted purchase price.  He denied that anyone associated with the Bank was aware of this.  DiCologero also denied knowledge of any irregularities.  The Bank responded to the Hooton letter by denying the allegations.  Because Ms. Hooton did not pursue the matter, neither did the Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in August 1989, Herbert and Deanna Bello, two defaulting borrowers on six Rostoff Group units, sued the Bank for damages and asserted counterclaims in a foreclosure action brought by the Bank.  The Bellos asserted, as had Ms. Hooton, that Bonaiuto was aware that they had not made the down payments reflected in the closing documents.  They also alleged that when they told Steven Rostoff that they had previously been unable to obtain financing, he replied that they would \"not have to worry about financing\" because he had made a \"deal\" with the Bank.  The Bank, the Bellos said, never asked for financial information from them.  The Bellos further alleged that, at one closing, they had pointed out to Bonaiuto that the closing documents stated an inflated purchase price and an inflated down payment.  Bonaiuto referred them to Rostoff, who said this was \"what the Bank wanted.\"   In the foreclosure action, the Bellos' counterclaim specifically alleged that the Bank knowingly permitted Rostoff's misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another couple who had purchased Rostoff Group properties, Edward and Dorothy Giamette, filed suit on September 22, 1989 against the Bank and the Rostoff principals.  Again the complaint alleged that down payments were falsely represented on the closing documents, that Steven Rostoff told the plaintiffs that the Bank knew the figures were false, that the appraisals, which were done by DiCologero's son, were for more than the fair market value of the properties, and that this scheme had been repeated with at least eight other purchasers who had bought a total of forty-five condominiums.  Earlier, on September 11, 1989, Mr. Giamette had made similar allegations in a counterclaim in the Bank's foreclosure action against him.  None of these claims, however, prompted the Bank to notify INA of possible losses due to alleged employee misconduct.  What eventually did lead the Bank to submit a notice of claim was a conversation in October 1989 between DiCologero and a Vice President of the Bank during which DiCologero remarked that her husband had purchased a condominium from the Rostoff Group without making a down payment.  The Vice President reported DiCologero's remark to the Bank's President, who met with the Bank's Audit Committee on November 6, 1989.  Outside legal counsel from Gaston &amp; Snow were present at the meeting.  The Committee discussed \"the possibility of 100% loans, the unknown extent of these loans, employee involvement and legal ramifications.\"   Gaston &amp; Snow was asked to prepare a preliminary analysis which was submitted on November 15, 1989.  Gaston &amp; Snow then investigated and reported back to the Bank on December 18, 1989.  The report recommended, among other measures, that the Bank refer the matter to federal authorities, notify INA, and dismiss DiCologero.  On December 27, 1989, the Bank filed a Report of Apparent Crime with the FDIC, advising that it had learned of suspected violations of federal law on December 18, 1989.  The Bank also notified the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office.  DiCologero, Bonaiuto, and the development group were later convicted on federal bank fraud and conspiracy charges.  United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 1990, the Bank gave INA notice of a potential loss arising from employee misconduct.  The Bank enclosed copies of the complaints in the Giamettes' state and federal lawsuits with its letter of notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is customary in the banking industry, the Bank had obtained a Financial Institution Bond, Standard Form No. 24, from INA.  The Bond period originally ran from January 1, 1988 to April 1, 1989, and was later extended by agreement to April 1, 1990.  Insured losses include those resulting from employee dishonesty and fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  For present purposes, we assume that the actions of DiCologero and Bonaiuto caused the Bank to sustain losses of the type covered by the \"INSURING AGREEMENTS FIDELITY\" section of the Bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The obligation of the insurer to indemnify the insured for covered losses is explicitly made:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>subject to the Declarations, Insuring Agreements, General Agreements, Conditions and Limitations and other terms [of the Bond].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS\" section of the Bond contains, among other clauses, the \"DISCOVERY\" clause.  Under that clause, the Bond applies to \"loss discovered by the Insured during the Bond Period.\"   The clause then defines \"Discovery\" in two ways:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Discovery occurs when the Insured first becomes aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss of the type covered by this bond has been or will be incurred, regardless of when the act or acts causing or contributing to such loss occurred, even though the exact amount or details of the loss may not then be known.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Discovery also occurs when the Insured receives notice of an actual or potential claim in which it is alleged that the Insured is liable to a third party under circumstances which, if true, would constitute a loss under this bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS\" section of the Bond also contains pertinent notice provisions which state in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>NOTICE/PROOF--LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST UNDERWRITER</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>a) At the earliest practicable moment, not to exceed 30 days, after discovery of loss, the Insured shall give the Underwriter notice thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construing the Bond's first definition of discovery, the district court found that, at the latest, the Bank had discovered the loss by November 15, 1989.  The court thus determined that the Bank was required to give notice to INA no later than December 15, 1989 and that the January 16, 1990 notice was therefore untimely.  The district court concluded that, \"[i]f notice to INA was untimely, the Bank is precluded from recovery, regardless of whether INA can prove any actual prejudice as a result of the delay.  J.I.

Am., 928 F.Supp. at 59.   The district court then granted INA's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that discovery was earlier than the Bank posits.  Although the district court relied on the Bond's first definition of discovery to reach this conclusion, it is most clearly reached under the second definition.  See Levy v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194983\"><a href=\"/opinion/194983/levy-v-weinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).  Under the second definition, discovery occurs \"when the Insured receives notice of an actual or potential claim in which it is alleged that the Insured is liable to a third party under circumstances which, if true, would constitute a loss under this bond.\"   The lawsuits and counterclaims brought by the Bellos and the Giamettes plainly constituted actual claims.  The complaints alleged knowing acts of dishonesty or fraud by Bank employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Any harm caused by these alleged acts would qualify as loss under the Bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank weakly argues that these complaints \"did not rise to the level of allegations of deceit and misrepresentation on the part of Bank employees seeking to obtain improper financial benefits but rather were nothing more than the litigation tactics of defaulting borrowers who were confronting foreclosure proceedings.\"   That argument misses the point.  The Bond requires notice to the insurer upon a claim of employee dishonesty and does not allow the insured to wait until the claim is proved.  Further, General Agreement F of the Bond independently required the Bank to provide INA--within thirty days--with all pleadings and pertinent papers in any legal proceeding brought to determine the insured's liability for any loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bank also asserts that third-party claims do not trigger discovery under the second definition of discovery unless those claims are reasonable.  Whether or not Massachusetts adopts such a reasonableness standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the claims here met any such requirement and triggered the notice requirement by, at the latest, mid-September 1989.  By that time, the Bank had been informed that at least ten persons claimed to have purchased more than fifty condominiums from the Rostoff Group without any down payment or with a lower down payment than the Bank's loan documentation reflected.  The Bank was charged with knowing that the figures in the loan documentation were false.  The Bank's attorney was alleged to be complicit in the falsehoods.  The son of the Bank's mortgage department manager purportedly had been paid for false appraisals.  A principal of the Rostoff Group had confirmed that this had happened.  The similarity of all the allegations is telling.  If a \"smell test\" was in order, the smell was rank indeed.  Accordingly, the notice given by the Bank on January 16, 1990 was untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More difficult is the question of whether the Massachusetts courts would apply the common law \"notice prejudice\" rule to Financial Institution Bonds of this sort.  This is a question of law.  See J.I. Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552337\"><a href=\"/opinion/552337/ji-corp-fka-new-england-rare-coin-galleries-inc-v-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two primary cases from the Supreme Judicial Court on the notice prejudice rule are Johnson Controls, Inc. v.

The Massachusetts law of notice prejudice has been previously visited by the decisions of this court in J.I. Corp., supra; National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Talcott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559876\"><a href=\"/opinion/559876/national-union-fire-insurance-co-v-william-t-talcott-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991);  and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v.

There is, however, a logically prior question and one which it is prudent to ask under our obligation to apply state substantive law (in the absence here of any conflict with or a threat to federal policies).

Such fidelity bonds, as discussed later, are different in kind from liability insurance policies.  In creating a common law notice prejudice rule, the Johnson Controls court did so in the context of liability policies.  The statutory progenitor to Johnson Controls concerned automobile liability policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The refinement and limitation of the notice prejudice rule in Chas. T. Main was also in the context of liability policies.  And the usual posture in which the court has applied the rule has been in liability policies.  See, e.g., Darcy v. Hartford Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2196303\"><a href=\"/opinion/2196303/darcy-v-hartford-ins-co-royal-globe-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2196303\"><a href=\"/opinion/2196303/darcy-v-hartford-ins-co-royal-globe-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span> (1990).

The bond had the following condition and limitation:  \"That loss be discovered during the continuance of the suretyship or within six (6) months after its termination, and notice delivered to the Surety at its Home Office within ten (10) days after such discovery.\"  Id. at 673.   The court held that \"[t]he giving of such notice was made a condition precedent to recovery on the bond.\"  Id. at 675.   The court noted that it was concerned not with \"the question of the circumstances under which at common law an obligation is imposed on the obligee in a fidelity bond to give the surety notice,\" but rather with the question of the timing of the notice given.  Id. at 674.   The question was whether the plaintiffs had complied with the ten day notice period in order to be able to recover on the bond.  The notice was apparently given during the bond year, but the court still considered the dispositive question to be whether the notice was given within the ten day period.  Id. at 674.

The court adopted and expanded upon this court's reasoning in Liberty Mutual, doubting that the notice prejudice rule would apply to types of insurance other than liability insurance when the insureds were not laypersons and when the parties to the contract were two sophisticated business concerns.  654 N.E.2d at 53.   The court held that it would apply traditional contract principles to the language of the indemnity clause, saying:  \"Rules addressing the special circumstances of certain insurance policies should not be applied in these circumstances.\"  Id. at 53-54.   Because it found language in the policy equivalent to making prompt notice a condition, the court held that the lack of prompt notice relieved the insurer of its obligation to reimburse the insured.

The Bond here is a Financial Institution Bond, Standard Form No. 24, as revised in 1986.  It is the most recent form in a long line of Financial Institution Bond forms utilized by members of the Surety Association of America.  See generally Knoll &amp; Bolduan, \"A Brief History of the Financial Institution Bond,\" in Financial Institution Bonds (1995), supra, at 1.   Such bonds are basically fidelity bonds, written specifically for financial institutions, including commercial and savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, stockbrokers, finance companies, and insurance companies.  I Fitzgerald et al., Principles of Suretyship 67 (1st ed. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fidelity bonds are a sort of \"honesty insurance,\" insuring against employee dishonesty.  See Weldy, \"History of the Bankers Blanket Bond and the Financial Institution Bond with Comments on the Drafting Process,\" in Financial Institution Bonds 1, 1 (1989);  Knoll &amp; Bolduan, supra, at 1.   The capacity of one who ensures the fidelity of another's employee has been described as part insurer and part surety, with liability in either capacity being primary and direct.  1 Russ &amp; Segalla, Couch on Insurance 3d &#167; 1:16 (1995).  Early Massachusetts cases about the Blanket Bankers Bond, the predecessor to the Financial Insurance Bond, use both the language of surety and the language of insurance.  See, e.g., Fitchburg Sav. Bank v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span>, 328 (1931).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is said that \"[i]n most cases and for most purposes, ... [fidelity bonds] are recognized to be a form of insurance that are subject to the rules applicable to insurance contracts generally.\"   1 Couch on Insurance 3d, supra, &#167; 1:16 (citing law from various states).  Nonetheless, scholars have noted that, while fidelity bonds have, over time, become more like insurance contracts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> a fidelity bond is still not liability insurance:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Although often referred to as insurance, it is not liability insurance, but rather a two-party indemnity agreement through which the insurer reimburses the insured for losses actually suffered in accordance with the contract provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weldy, supra, at 2;  see also Knoll &amp; Bolduan, supra, at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that the Bond possesses some characteristics of surety arrangements which distinguish them from liability policies.  \"The nature of the risk assumed by the party in the role of 'insurer' is a major distinction between insurance and the arrangements of guaranty and surety....  [T]he risk can be characterized in terms of the degree to which the contingency is within the control of one of the parties.  In the classic instance of insurance, the risk is controlled only by chance or nature.  In guaranty and surety arrangements, the risk tends to be wholly or partially in the control of one of the three parties [promisor, creditor, or debtor].\"  1 Couch on Insurance 3d, supra, &#167; 1:18.  There is also a difference in the liability of a classic insurer and that of surety/guarantor.  An insurer, upon the occurrence of the contingency, must bear the ultimate loss, while a surety is entitled to indemnity in case the surety is compelled to perform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also significant, as was true in Liberty Mutual, 773 F.2d at 18, that the Massachusetts legislature has made distinctions in this area.  The Massachusetts legislature has decided that, for most regulatory purposes, surety bonds are not insurance contracts.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 107.  In Williams v.

Rather, they involved sophisticated businesses.  Accordingly, there was little reason to depart from the usual rule of holding the parties to their bargain.  In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Judicial Court had stated that one reason for applying the notice prejudice rule in that case was that the insurance policy was:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>not a negotiated agreement;  rather its conditions are by and large dictated by the insurance company to the insured.
