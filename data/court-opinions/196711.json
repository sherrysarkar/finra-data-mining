Charles  Martin  Edgar,\r                      LYNCH,   Circuit  Judge.\r                                             \r\n\nformerly   a  U.S.  Department   of  Commerce  employee,  was\r\n\nconvicted of three  counts of making false  statements on his\r\n\nfederal  workers' compensation  claims, and  of one  count of\r\n\nmail fraud arising from a  false automobile accident claim to\r\n\nan insurer.   He was  acquitted on  other charges,  including\r\n\nbankruptcy fraud.1  Edgar  was sentenced to one year  and one\r\n\nday plus two years of supervised release and was fined $5000.\r\n\n          His  appeal argues that  joinder of  the bankruptcy\r\n\nfraud, workers'  compensation fraud and  insurance fraud  was\r\n\nimproper, as was the  refusal to sever.  He  strongly asserts\r\n\nreversible error in the testimony of his civil-claim attorney\r\n\nbefore  the  grand  jury  which,  he  alleges,  violated  his\r\n\nattorney-client privilege.  He also  argues that the issue of\r\n\nmateriality of the alleged  false statements should have been\r\n\nsubmitted to  the jury  under the  rule established later  in\r\n\nUnited States v. Gaudin, 115 S. Ct. 2310 (1995), that denying\r                                   \r\n\nhim  discovery   was  error,   and  that  the   evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient to convict in any event.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Two arguments merit close discussion.  Edgar argues\r\n\nthat it was improper  and harmful for the government  to have\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The court granted Edgar's motions for acquittal on eleven\r\ncounts  of  mail fraud  based  on  the workers'  compensation\r\nclaims,  on one count of using a false social security number\r\nin connection with  his bankruptcy, and  on eleven counts  of\r\nbankruptcy  fraud.  The jury returned a verdict of not guilty\r\non  one count of making false statements to the Department of\r\nLabor and could not reach a verdict on nine other counts.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\njoined such disparate charges as workers' compensation fraud,\r\n\nauto  insurance  fraud and  bankruptcy  fraud  into a  single\r\n\nindictment, saying the common allegation of fraud is too weak\r\n\na thread to sew them all together, and that the counts should\r\n\nhave been severed.  While the argument has some force, he was\r\n\nacquitted on the bankruptcy charge and we find no harm to him\r\n\nfrom its joinder with the other charges.\r\n\n          Edgar also argues  that the government trampled  on\r\n\nhis attorney-client  privilege and  that this denied  him due\r\n\nprocess.  The  government subpoenaed  to the  grand jury  the\r\n\nlawyer who  had represented Edgar on  the automobile accident\r\n\nclaim.  The lawyer's initial declinations to answer questions\r\n\nabout  Edgar's communications  on grounds  of attorney-client\r\n\nprivilege gave  way in the  face of continued  questioning by\r\n\nthe  prosecutor.    Edgar  says  he  first  learned   of  his\r\n\nattorney's  grand jury  testimony after  he was  indicted and\r\n\nbefore  trial.  While troubled by what happened, we find that\r\n\nthere  was no prejudice to  Edgar at trial  and therefore his\r\n\nremedy, if any, is not the vacating of his conviction.\r\n\nBackground\r                      \r\n\n          Edgar's  checkered  reporting  on   his  employment\r\n\nstatus undergirds all counts  on which he was convicted.   In\r\n\n1984 Edgar  filed claims  for compensation  to the  Office of\r\n\nWorkers' Compensation Programs (\"OWCP\") of the Department  of\r\n\nLabor  based on back injuries suffered in a 1981 plane crash,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nallegedly work-related.   The  claim eventually ripened  to a\r\n\nclaim  of  total  disability  from  1987  on.    The  federal\r\n\ngovernment paid him benefits, after objecting, for injury for\r\n\nthe period  from 1981 through 1986.   It had balked at paying\r\n\nbeyond 1986, but Edgar again won on appeal and he was paid to\r\n\n1989.   In  May of  1991, in  an effort  to get  payments for\r\n\ncertain  periods between  1989 and  1991, he  submitted three\r\n\nforms CA-8 to the OWCP.  These documents formed the basis for\r\n\nthe counts of conviction.  On other dates, he submitted other\r\n\nforms  CA-8  as well  as forms  EN1032-0389 (\"1032\").   These\r\n\nforms are  important to  the OWCP in  considering claims  for\r\n\ncontinuing compensation.\r\n\n          The forms CA-8 required that certain information be\r\n\nprovided  if   the  claimant  was  working.   The  employment\r\n\ninformation is  used by OWCP  to determine a  claimant's wage\r\n\nearning  capacity, and thus the level of his benefits.  Edgar\r\n\nwas in fact working as a self-employed accountant during this\r\n\nperiod, but he did not provide the information required.  Nor\r\n\ndid  he mention that he operated and  managed a bar, which he\r\n\nalso  owned, from  1985 to  1990.2   Instead,  Edgar reported\r\n\nthat  he was  neither self-employed  nor employed  by others.\r\n\nThe  forms  include  a  warning that  any  \"false  statement,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  During the  time for  which he claimed  disability, Edgar\r\nalso attended law school.   He eventually became  licensed to\r\npractice law  in Massachusetts,  but was  suspended following\r\nhis conviction in this case.  In the Matter of Edgar, No. 95-\r                                                                \r\n004BD (Bd. of Bar Overseers Jan. 20, 1995).\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nmisrepresentation,  [or] concealment  of fact\"  could subject\r\n\nthe  submitter to a felony prosecution.  Edgar says the forms\r\n\nwere not material,  as the department had  already turned him\r\n\ndown on  this claim.  But,  based in part on  those forms, he\r\n\ndid receive continuing compensation for the post-1989 period.\r\n\nAll told, he received more than $250,000 in benefits from the\r\n\ngovernment.\r\n\n          In January 1987 Edgar was involved in an automobile\r\n\naccident and asserted he injured his back and could not work.\r\n\nAttorney  Robert Koditek  represented him  in his  claims for\r\n\ninjury and lost income against the other driver's insurer and\r\n\nto  his  own  insurance  carrier, Commercial  Union.    Edgar\r\n\nsubmitted a form to his own insurer, purportedly executed  by\r\n\na company bookkeeper but in fact forged by Edgar, stating, as\r\n\nto lost income, that his accounting company paid him a yearly\r\n\nsalary of  $45,600.   Attorney  Koditek, representing  Edgar,\r\n\nsubmitted a demand letter to Commercial Union  on October 12,\r\n\n1988,  asserting that  Edgar had  been totally disabled  as a\r\n\nresult of the auto  accident and demanding the  policy limits\r\n\nbe  paid him.   In support of  Edgar's claim  for damages for\r\n\nlost  income,  the letter  attached  \"copies  of Mr.  Edgar's\r\n\nfederal income  tax returns  for  the years  1985, 1986,  and\r\n\n1987.\"    Those signed  returns  showed  income for  1985  of\r\n\n$62,392 and for 1986 of  $61,876.  But Edgar had  never filed\r\n\nany tax return  in either  1985 or 1986;  so, the  government\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncharged, the representation was false.   On January 16, 1989,\r\n\nCommercial  Union settled Edgar's  claim, paying him $75,000.\r\n\nAttorney Koditek  testified at trial that  Edgar had supplied\r\n\nhim  with the copies of  the tax returns  given to Commercial\r\n\nUnion to support his claim.\r\n\nJoinder and Denial of Motion for Severance\r                                                      \r\n\n          The  37 count  indictment  returned  against  Edgar\r\n\ncharged  three  fraudulent  schemes.   The  first  24  counts\r\n\ncharged  Edgar  with  mail  fraud, alleging  that  Edgar  had\r\n\nwrongfully  obtained money  through the  mails (specifically,\r\n\nthe disability checks)  and had made false statements  to the\r\n\nDepartment of Labor.   These counts were  premised on Edgar's\r\n\nfalsely representing  his employment and earning  capacity in\r\n\nconnection  with  his disability  claim  from  1989 to  1992.\r\n\nAnother count  involved Edgar's submission,  through Attorney\r\n\nKoditek, of false  documents and a demand letter making false\r\n\nstatements to his automobile insurer in 1988.   The remaining\r\n\ntwelve  counts charged Edgar with filing documents containing\r\n\nfalse  statements   in  1991   in  connection  with   Edgar's\r\n\nbankruptcy.    The scheme  alleged  was  that  Edgar filed  a\r\n\nbankruptcy  petition  in  California,   falsely  representing\r\n\nCalifornia was his state of domicile, listing a false  social\r\n\nsecurity  number and  concealing assets  and income  from his\r\n\nformer wife and other creditors.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Edgar argues that  the counts charging these  three\r\n\nschemes  should  not  have  been  joined  because  they  were\r\n\ninsufficiently  similar.   He argues  that the  single common\r\n\ncharacteristic,  misrepresentation of material facts, was not\r\n\nenough  to satisfy the standards for joinder.  He also argues\r\n\nthat  evidence of  one scheme  would not  be admissible  in a\r\n\ntrial  on another scheme and  thus the jury  could infer from\r\n\nthe evidence  of  one fraud  that  Edgar was  predisposed  to\r\n\nengage in another fraud.\r\n\n          Edgar's argument that there was an improper joinder\r\n\nof claims against  him in the indictment, which  the district\r\n\ncourt refused  to undo,  raises two  concerns.   Edgar argues\r\n\nfirst  that there  was  not sufficient  similarity among  the\r\n\ncounts  of   conviction  to  permit  joinder.     Second,  he\r\n\npostulates a harmful spillover effect from all of the counts,\r\n\neven those on  which he was  acquitted, which prejudiced  him\r\n\nand led to his  conviction.  He also claims that,  apart from\r\n\nthe initial wrongful joinder,  the district court should have\r\n\nallowed his motion for severance.\r\n\n          The standard for joinder is set forth in Rule 8(a),\r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P., which provides:\r\n\n          Two or more  offenses may  be charged  in\r\n          the same indictment . . . if the offenses\r\n          charged . . . are  of the same or similar\r\n          character . . . .\r\n\n\"Similar\" does not mean \"identical,\" United States v. Werner,\r                                                                        \r\n\n620  F.2d 922,  928 (2d  Cir. 1980),  and similarity  must be\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nanalyzed  in terms of how the  government saw its case at the\r\n\ntime  of indictment.  United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302,\r                                                          \r\n\n306 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied,  502 U.S. 1079 (1992).  As\r                                             \r\n\nJudge Friendly commented in Werner, under the mandate of  the\r                                              \r\n\nSpeedy Trial Act,  joinder serves the purposes  of economy of\r\n\nresources.  620  F.2d at 928.  Denial of  a motion for relief\r\n\nfrom misjoinder  is  reviewed  de novo.    United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nChambers,  964  F.2d  1250  (1st  Cir.  1992).    Further,  a\r                    \r\n\nmisjoinder is  not reversible  if it  was  harmless.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Apr. 8, 1996).\r\n\n          Edgar also argues that  even if joinder was proper,\r\n\nhis motion  to sever the  different schemes should  have been\r\n\ngranted.   Under Rule 14, Fed. R.  Crim. P., \"[i]f it appears\r\n\nthat a defendant . . . is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses\r\n\n.  . ., the court may order . . . separate trials of counts.\"\r\n\nThe denial of a motion for severance is reviewed for abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion, and must  be affirmed unless  there is a  \"strong\r\n\nshowing of  evident prejudice.\"   United States  v. O'Bryant,\r                                                                        \r\n\n998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          In  determining whether counts are properly joined,\r\n\nthis court considers such factors as \"whether the charges are\r\n\nlaid  under the  same statute,  whether they  involve similar\r\n\nvictims, locations, or modes of operation, and the time frame\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nin which the  charged conduct  occurred.\"   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTaylor,  54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal citations\r                  \r\n\nomitted).3  The government argues  that the test is satisfied\r\n\nbecause  the workers'  compensation fraud and  the automobile\r\n\naccident fraud  involved the  same modus operandi  of claimed\r                                                             \r\n\ntotal disability following an asserted injury to the back, an\r\n\nasserted  loss of  income, the  submission of  false official\r\n\nforms, and the misrepresentation of other employment in order\r\n\nto   rake  in  large  sums.    As  to  timing,  the  workers'\r\n\ncompensation  fraud  overlapped  the  auto  insurance  fraud.\r\n\nWitnesses and testimony  would also overlap.  Evidence  as to\r\n\nthe  auto  accident  fraud  would  be  used  on  the  claimed\r\n\ndisability  from a back injury  from the plane  crash, and to\r\n\nestablish that Edgar misrepresented  his earnings and earning\r\n\ncapacity.    We believe  there  were  sufficient similarities\r\n\nbetween the workers' compensation and insurance fraud schemes\r\n\nto permit joinder of those counts.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  An earlier  case in this circuit applied an arguably more\r\nstringent standard  for the  government to  join two  or more\r\noffenses under Rule 8(a).   See United States v.  Yefsky, 994\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d  885, 895 (1st Cir. 1993)  (finding proper joinder where\r\nthere  was \"'substantial identity  of facts or participants'\"\r\nunderlying  two charged  schemes,  quoting  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\nLevine, 546 F.2d 658, 662 (5th Cir. 1977)).  Given that Edgar\r                  \r\nused  the  same  basic  mechanism,   misrepresenting  earning\r\ncapacity in  seeking compensation lost due to  a back injury,\r\nin both  the workers' compensation and  auto insurance fraud,\r\nwe  believe  that  joinder  of the  counts  underlying  these\r\nschemes would have been proper even under the test applied in\r\nYefsky.  Given  our disposition  of this issue,  we need  not\r                  \r\ndecide  whether Yefsky set a  more rigid test  for joinder of\r                                  \r\noffenses than the language of Rule 8(a) warrants.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          However, like the district court,  we are disturbed\r\n\nby  the  joinder of  the bankruptcy  fraud.4   We  discern no\r\n\n\"common scheme  or plan.\"  See  Randazzo,    F.3d at    , No.\r                                                    \r\n\n95-1489,  slip op.  at  5.    The bankruptcy  fraud  charges,\r\n\nrelating  to events  in  1991, were  brought under  different\r\n\nstatutes  and the  supposed victim  was Edgar's  ex-wife (and\r\n\npossibly  other unspecified  creditors).    The location  was\r\n\ndifferent.  The bankruptcy filings were all with the court in\r\n\nCalifornia, while  the other  frauds took place  primarily in\r\n\nMassachusetts.  The  modes of operation  were different.   In\r\n\nthe  workers' compensation  and automobile  insurance frauds,\r\n\nEdgar asserted an injury  to his back, which resulted  in the\r\n\nloss  of  earnings.   The  alleged bankruptcy  fraud  did not\r\n\ninvolve  an attempt to obtain payment for an injury.  Rather,\r\n\nit was allegedly an  attempt to avoid obligations to  his ex-\r\n\nwife, with whom  he had an  acrimonious relationship, and  to\r\n\nforce her to press her claim in an inconvenient forum.\r\n\n          Edgar claims he was prejudiced because the evidence\r\n\nfor  each scheme had a harmful spillover effect, and the jury\r\n\nconvicted him  not because  of specific evidence  showing his\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The district judge, in  granting the motion for acquittal\r\non the bankruptcy charges  after the government had presented\r\nits case,  noted the potential  problems with the  joinder of\r\nthe bankruptcy  fraud.  He  said, \"[T]his type  of indictment\r\nlooks  like you are  piling it on .  . . .\"   He also thought\r\nthat \"th[e] bankruptcy case was transferred here to  boost up\r\nthe  other  false statement  cases\"  and  that  there was  an\r\n\"unusual\" number of schemes alleged.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nguilt,  but because of its perception that he was a dishonest\r\n\nman.5    Specifically,  Edgar  posits  that  the  jury  heard\r\n\nevidence that (1) he collected  $75,000 in settlement for the\r\n\nauto  insurance claim;  (2) he  had an  extremely acrimonious\r\n\ndivorce; (3) he  filed for bankruptcy in  California and made\r\n\nfalse  statements that  he  resided there;  (4) he  has owned\r\n\nvarious properties  and has  established trusts  at different\r\n\ntimes; (5) he filed false information in the bankruptcy court\r\n\nregarding his assets and social security number.\r\n\n          Even assuming the  bankruptcy count was  improperly\r\n\njoined, any error was harmless.  It did not result in \"actual\r\n\nprejudice\"  because  it  did  not  have  a  \"substantial  and\r\n\ninjurious  effect  or  influence in  determining  the  jury's\r\n\nverdict.\"    Lane,  474  U.S.  at  449  (internal  quotations\r                             \r\n\nomitted);  see also O'Neal v.  McAninch, 115 S.  Ct. 992, 995\r                                                   \r\n\n(1995).  Edgar was  acquitted by the court of  the bankruptcy\r\n\nfraud and of  several counts  of mail fraud  in the  workers'\r\n\ncompensation scheme before the  matter went to the jury.   Of\r\n\nthe remaining thirteen workers' compensation counts, the jury\r\n\nproved itself  capable of making distinctions:   it acquitted\r\n\nEdgar of one, could not reach a verdict on nine and convicted\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Edgar also  claims that, had the schemes been severed, he\r\nmay have testified for one, but  not another.  Edgar does not\r\nexpand  upon this  claim of  prejudice, and  an \"unexplicated\r\nassertion\" that he would  have testified at one trial  is not\r\nenough to  establish prejudicial  joinder.  United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\nWerner, 620 F.2d 922, 930 (2d Cir. 1980).\r                  \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\non three.   The jury  thus showed itself  clearly capable  of\r\n\ndiscriminating  among the evidence  applicable to each count,\r\n\neven within  the workers' compensation  fraud, thus  reducing\r\n\nthe  risk of  any prejudice from  evidence on  the bankruptcy\r\n\ncount.  See  United States  v. Stackpole, 811  F.2d 689,  694\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1987) (jury's acquittal  on one of  several counts\r\n\nsuggests jury not  confused by joinder).  Moreover, the court\r\n\ngave appropriate limiting  instructions.6  See Chambers,  964\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d at 1251; United  States v.

Lane, 474 U.S.  at 450 (analyzing\r                                            \r\n\njoinder of defendants  under Fed.  R. Crim. P.  8(b)7).   The\r\n\nexhibits relating solely to the bankruptcy fraud were struck.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.    The court instructed  the jurors that  they should \"put\r\nout  of [their]  minds any  reference or  evidence concerning\r\nCounts 1 through 11 charging mail fraud and Counts 26 through\r\n36  charging bankruptcy fraud and  the use of  a false Social\r\nSecurity number,  because [the court has] ruled,  as a matter\r\nof  law, that the  government has failed to  prove all of the\r\nnecessary  elements of  each of  those charges.\"   The  court\r\nfurther instructed, \"You must decide the remaining charges as\r\nif those charges that I have removed from your consideration,\r\nmail fraud and bankruptcy fraud, were never made and as if no\r\nevidence was submitted in support of those charges.  You must\r\nlimit your  consideration. . .  .  And you  must determine if\r\nthe  government has sustained  its burden  of proof  beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt,  excluding all  references  to or  evidence\r\nconcerning Counts 1 through 11 and 26 through 37.\" \r\n\n7.  Fed.  R. Crim. P.  8(b) allows for the  joinder of two or\r\nmore defendants if \"they are alleged to have  participated in\r\nthe same  act or transaction or in the same series of acts or\r\ntransactions constituting an offense or offenses.\"\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          Some  of  the evidence  as  to  the bankruptcy  and\r\n\ninsurance   schemes  was  admissible   as  to   the  workers'\r\n\ncompensation  scheme, thus  resulting in  no prejudice.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nStackpole,  811  F.2d  at 694;  cf.  Lane,  474  U.S. at  450\r                                                     \r\n\n(analyzing  joinder  of defendants  under  Rule  8(b)).   Any\r\n\nstatements that Edgar filed with the bankruptcy court stating\r\n\nhis  income  for  the   years  encompassed  by  the  workers'\r\n\ncompensation fraud  would have been admissible  on the latter\r\n\nissue.   The  statements  made to  the  insurance company  in\r\n\nconnection with  the insurance  fraud were admissible  on the\r\n\nworkers'  compensation issue, particularly as they related to\r\n\nEdgar's back injury and his loss of earnings.  Finally, there\r\n\nwas  substantial  independent  evidence   on  the  counts  of\r\n\nconviction.  The fraud against  the insurance company and the\r\n\nthree  counts  of  submitting  falsified   documents  to  the\r\n\nDepartment of  Labor were supported by  evidence unrelated to\r\n\nthe bankruptcy.\r\n\n          Thus, Edgar  cannot  meet  his  burden  of  showing\r\n\nprejudice on the denial of the motion for severance as to any\r\n\nof the counts.  Garden-variety arguments of spillover -- such\r\n\nas  if the jury found defendant guilty of A, that alone would\r\n\nlead to  the conclusion that  he was  guilty of B  -- without\r\n\nmore, are insufficient to require severance.  Taylor, 54 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 973.  Appellants must demonstrate actual prejudice.   That\r\n\nis a particularly difficult burden for Edgar to meet, because\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nthe spillover from his acquittal on  the bankruptcy count and\r\n\ncertain  of the  workers' compensation  counts could  just as\r\n\neasily be posited to have worked  to his benefit.  The law of\r\n\nseverance  and  joinder is  a  stricter  master than  Edgar's\r\n\nclaimed error.  See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 307-08.\r                                       \r\n\nThe Grand Jury Testimony\r                                    \r\n\n          On June  1, 1993, Attorney Koditek  testified under\r\n\nsubpoena  before the grand jury.  Edgar says that neither the\r\n\ngovernment nor  Attorney  Koditek notified  him that  Koditek\r\n\nwould testify under subpoena.\r\n\n          Edgar  complains that he did not learn of the grand\r\n\njury testimony of  his civil-claim lawyer until  after he was\r\n\nindicted.  Even then, the prosecution denied Edgar's requests\r\n\nfor a copy of  Attorney Koditek's testimony.  Ten  days prior\r\n\nto   trial,  the   new  prosecutor   assigned  to   the  case\r\n\nappropriately provided the transcript to the defendant.  This\r\n\nis what the transcript8 showed:\r\n\n          AUSA:     Do  you recall  at some point  making, as\r\n                    part  of your  claim to  Commercial Union\r\n                    Insurance   Company  --   submitting  tax\r\n                    returns  to  commercial Union  evidencing\r\n                    Mr. Edgar's income for the years prior to\r\n                    the accident?\r\n          KODITEK:  I may have.\r\n          AUSA:     Well, what's your recollection, sir?\r\n          KODITEK:  I don't recall.\r\n          AUSA:     Mr. Koditek,  if you'd look at Exhibit 22\r\n                    [the October 12, 1988, demand letter] and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  The  district court  allowed the  government's motion  to\r\ndisclose certain  portions of Attorney  Koditek's grand  jury\r\ntestimony for purposes of responding to this appeal.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n                    if  you  could  read  that  carefully  to\r\n                    yourself.\r\n          KODITEK:  (Witness looking at document)\r\n          AUSA:     Have   you   looked   at  that   document\r\n                    carefully, sir?\r\n          KODITEK:  Yes, I have.\r\n          AUSA:     Does  that  refresh your  recollection at\r\n                    all  as  to  whether  you  submitted  tax\r\n                    returns  to  Commercial  Union  Insurance\r\n                    Company  as evidence of Mr. Edgar's wage-\r\n                    earning ability?\r\n          KODITEK:  It appears that I did.\r\n          AUSA:     Do  you recall  any discussions  with Mr.\r\n                    Edgar concerning those tax returns?\r\n          KODITEK:  Any  discussions would be  subject to the\r\n                    attorney/client privilege.\r\n          AUSA:     Well, what I'm asking you is not what, in\r\n                    fact,  was said,  but I'm  asking whether\r\n                    the subject of the tax returns ever  came\r\n                    up.\r\n          KODITEK:  I would presume the subject came up.\r\n          AUSA:     Did Mr. Edgar  say to you at any time, in\r\n                    connection with your submission  of those\r\n                    tax returns to Commercial Union Insurance\r\n                    Company, that those tax returns were not,\r\n                    in fact, identical to the ones filed with\r\n                    the Internal Revenue Service?\r\n          KODITEK:  Any  conversation would be subject to the\r\n                    attorney/client privilege.\r\n          AUSA:     Well, I  think  that in  this  particular\r\n                    instance, sir, they would not.   What I'm\r\n                    asking you is whether Mr. Edgar indicated\r\n                    to you, in substance  or in fact, that he\r\n                    was  submitting or  having you  submit to\r\n                    the  Commercial  Union Insurance  Company\r\n                    tax  returns  which  were  not  the same.\r\n                    That is  to say that they were fraudulent\r\n                    tax  returns that  were not  submitted to\r\n                    the Internal Revenue Service.\r\n          KODITEK:  No, he never said that to me.\r\n          AUSA:     Was it your  understanding, sir, that the\r\n                    tax  returns that  he submitted  were, in\r\n                    fact, genuine tax  returns as filed  with\r\n                    the Internal Revenue Service?\r\n          KODITEK:  That would be my understanding.\r\n\n          What  is   clear  is  that   Attorney  Koditek  was\r\n\nquestioned about the substance  of his conversations with his\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nclient,  that  he asserted  attorney-client  privilege twice,\r\n\nthat the prosecutor responded that the matter was not covered\r\n\nby  privilege  and that  Koditek  then  answered.   This  was\r\n\napparently done without the client, Edgar, being aware of the\r\n\ntestimony.   Nor was there any judicial review of whether the\r\n\ntestimony was indeed privileged.\r\n\n          At trial  Edgar did object on  grounds of attorney-\r\n\nclient privilege to any testimony from Attorney Koditek.  The\r\n\ncourt  rejected  the  privilege  claim.     Attorney  Koditek\r\n\ntestified that  he represented  Edgar in connection  with the\r\n\nCommercial  Union  claim,  that   he  wrote  two  letters  to\r\n\nCommercial Union in  connection with the claim,  and that the\r\n\ntax  returns were enclosed with one of the letters.  Attorney\r\n\nKoditek authenticated the letters,  but declined to answer on\r\n\ngrounds  of  privilege  the  question  of  who  gave him  the\r\n\nmaterial (including the  tax returns) to be enclosed with the\r\n\ndemand  letter to the insurer.  The district court ruled that\r\n\nbecause  the  tax returns  were  disclosed  to the  insurance\r\n\ncompany,  the fact that Edgar gave the returns to Koditek was\r\n\nnot privileged.   Attorney Koditek answered  that he received\r\n\nthe  tax returns from Mr.  Edgar.  Edgar  chose not to cross-\r\n\nexamine  on this point and never asserted a defense of advice\r\n\nof  counsel   or  that   the  attorney's  actions   were  not\r\n\nauthorized.   At trial, Attorney Koditek  did not testify, as\r\n\nhe did to  the grand jury, about whether Edgar  had ever told\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nhim that the  tax returns submitted  to Commercial Union  had\r\n\nnot  been submitted  to the IRS.   The government  did put on\r\n\nindependent evidence that these returns were never filed with\r\n\nthe IRS.\r\n\n          Edgar   filed   several   motions   regarding   his\r\n\nattorney's  testimony.   He argued  a fruit-of-the-poisonous-\r\n\ntree  theory that  Attorney  Koditek's  testimony before  the\r\n\ngrand  jury  was  illegal  and so  the  indictment  should be\r\n\ndismissed  or  evidence  should  be  suppressed.    There  is\r\n\nprecedent  for  an  argument  that  a   court  may  quash  an\r\n\nindictment  based  upon evidence  directly  obtained from  or\r\n\nderived from  breach of  the attorney-client privilege.

Some federal  courts  have  held  that if  the\r\n\nprosecutor   induces  the  breach,  suppression  of  evidence\r\n\nderived  from the  breach is  the appropriate  remedy, unless\r\n\nprejudice would remain,  in which case the  indictment may be\r\n\ndismissed.   See, e.g.,  United  States v.

The  net effect is that federal  prosecutors in\r\n\nMassachusetts must comply with PF 15, which provides:\r\n\n          It  is  unprofessional   conduct  for   a\r\n          prosecutor to  subpoena an attorney  to a\r\n          grand   jury   without   prior   judicial\r\n          approval   in  circumstances   where  the\r\n          prosecutor    seeks    to   compel    the\r\n          attorney/witness   to  provide   evidence\r\n          concerning a person who is represented by\r\n          the attorney/witness.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nS.J.C. Rule 3:08, PF 15.\r\n\n          The  prosecutor here  argues  that PF  15 does  not\r\n\nliterally  apply as  Edgar  was represented  in  the past  by\r                                           \r\n\nAttorney  Koditek, but was not represented by him at the time\r\n\nof  the  subpoena,  as  the   language  of  PF  15  requires.\r\n\nNonetheless,  the  prosecution  represented to  the  district\r\n\ncourt that it had complied with PF 15 and had obtained  prior\r\n\njudicial approval  to  serve the  subpoena.   But,  as  Edgar\r\n\npoints out, the record is devoid of proof on this point.\r\n\n          The  subpoena  here  did  not go  to  the  target's\r\n\ncriminal  defense counsel and so does not raise the issues of\r\n\npotential abuse specific to  that situation.  See Whitehouse,\r                                                                        \r\n\n53 F.3d  at 1354.   But  Edgar and Attorney  Koditek were  at\r\n\nleast  potentially  placed  in  the   hypothetical  situation\r\n\ndescribed in the panel opinion vacated by Klubock II9:\r                                                                \r\n\n          The  serving of  a  subpoena  under  such\r\n          circumstances  will  immediately drive  a\r\n          chilling      wedge      between      the\r\n          attorney/witness  and  his client.   This\r\n          wedge  is  the  natural   consequence  of\r\n          several  underlying  factors  created  by\r\n          this anomalous situation.   Most  obvious\r\n          is the fact that the client  is uncertain\r\n          at  best, and  suspicious at  worst, that\r\n          his  legitimate trust in his attorney may\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.

And because the\r\n          subpoenaed  attorney/witness may  himself\r\n          feel  intimidated, this may  in fact take\r\n          place   if  there  is  not  even  minimal\r\n          ethical     control    regulating     the\r\n          subpoenaing  of  an  attorney/witness  to\r\n          seek evidence against his client.\r\n\n               More   subtle,   but  perhaps   more\r\n          important in terms of the ethical setting\r\n          within  which PF  15  is  framed, is  the\r\n          immediate  conflict of  interests created\r\n          between  the   attorney/witness  and  his\r\n          client  by the  serving of a  subpoena in\r\n          the context of what is contemplated by PF\r\n          15.  As  a witness, the  attorney/witness\r\n          has   separate    legal   and   practical\r\n          interests apart from those of his client.\r\n          These interests may  or may not  coincide\r\n          with  those  of the  attorney/witness and\r\n          his client.  The mere possibility of such\r\n          a  conflict is  sufficient  to  create  a\r\n          problem.    A   minimal  overview  by  an\r\n          impartial observer, as is provided  by PF\r\n          15, can go far in preventing the creation\r\n          of  these  ethical conflicts  between the\r\n          attorney/witness and his client.\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Klubock,  832 F.2d  649, 652-53  (1st Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1987)  (footnote omitted)  (\"Klubock I\").   We  believe these\r                                                  \r\n\nconsiderations apply to the relationships with former counsel\r\n\nas well as with present counsel.\r\n\n          There  may be  an implicit  threat to  the attorney\r\n\ncalled to testify about a  client to the grand jury that  the\r\n\nattorney   will  become   a  target   himself10  should   the\r\n\nprosecutor  think  he knowingly  participated  in  the fraud.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Indeed, at trial Attorney Koditek indicated an intent to\r\nassert the right under the Fifth Amendment not to incriminate\r\nhimself  if called  to  testify.   By  the time  of  Attorney\r\nKoditek's trial  testimony, he  had been granted  immunity by\r\nthe prosecution.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nThis is  particularly so  where the prosecution  asserts that\r\n\nthe  privilege must  give way  to the  crime-fraud exception.\r\n\nThe lawyer may be  tempted to reveal privileged conversations\r\n\nin order  to avoid  becoming  a target  himself.11   Ideally,\r\n\ncounsel receiving a subpoena will give notice to a client and\r\n\nconsistently  assert the  privilege  on behalf  of a  client.\r\n\nIdeally, a prosecutor faced with an assertion of privilege by\r\n\nan  attorney witness  will seek  a judicial  determination of\r\n\nwhether the  privilege is valid.   But we  do not live  in an\r\n\nideal  world.  See Jerome  Frank, If Men  Were Angels (1942).\r                                                                 \r\n\nWe  are loath  to say  the prosecutor  here crossed  over the\r\n\nline.   But we are  equally loath to  say, as  the government\r\n\nurges, that there is no line and there is never a remedy.12\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  While an attorney  may, under the  self-defense doctrine\r\nset forth  in S.J.C. Rule  3:07, Code of  Prof. Resp.,  DR 4-\r\n101(C)(4),  reveal information  without prior  notice  to the\r\nclient,  the  doctrine does  not  apply  unless there  is  an\r\n\"accusation\"  of  wrongful  conduct.   We  do  not  think the\r\nprosecutor  here made  an  \"accusation\" against  counsel that\r\nwould have triggered this provision.\r\n\n12.  Indeed,  other  courts  have  concluded that  there  are\r\nlimits  to  how  far   government  investigators  may  go  in\r\nattempting   to  induce  a   breach  of  the  attorney-client\r\nprivilege.    In  Omni,  the  district  court  chastised  the\r                                  \r\ngovernment for interviewing an  attorney's secretary.  634 F.\r\nSupp. at 1431, 1439.  See also United States v.

But,  attorneys are  themselves  responsible for\r\nprotecting  the client  by  asserting the  privilege when  it\r\napplies.   See, e.g., United States v. Rasheed, 663 F.2d 843,\r                                                          \r\n854  (9th Cir.  1981), cert.  denied,  454 U.S.  1157 (1982);\r                                                \r\nOmni, 634 F.

A  lawyer has an\r\n\nobligation  not to  reveal client  confidences.   S.J.C. Rule\r\n\n3:07, Code  of Prof. Resp., DR  4-101.  A lawyer  also has an\r\n\nobligation to assert privilege  on behalf of a client.   Id.;\r                                                                        \r\n\nsee also In re Impounded Case (Law Firm), 879 F.2d 1211, 1213\r                                                    \r\n\n(3d  Cir. 1989).  Generally, an attorney has an obligation to\r\n\nassert  the  privilege on  behalf of  the  client and  not to\r\n\ndisclose  confidential information until  there is a judicial\r\n\ndetermination that  there is  no privilege.   ABA/BNA Lawyers\r                                                                         \r\n\nManual on  Professional Conduct  55:1307-08 (1989).   Even if\r                                           \r\n\nthere  is an assertion that there is no privilege because the\r\n\ncrime-fraud exception  applies, the  attorney is  required to\r\n\ngive notice to  the client.  S.J.C. Rule 3:07,  Code of Prof.\r\n\nResp.,  DR  7-102(B)(1).    If the  attorney  violates  these\r\n\nduties,  he is at risk at least  of a malpractice suit and of\r\n\nprofessional discipline.\r\n\n          Concomitantly, a prosecutor has certain obligations\r\n\nbeyond  zealous  representation  of the  government  when the\r\n\nprosecutor interrogates witnesses before the grand jury.  For\r\n\nexample,  if a  witness invokes  the privilege  against self-\r\n\nincrimination, the prosecutor should cease  questioning as to\r\n\nthe particular subject to  which the privilege was addressed.\r\n\nUnited  States v.

Thus, the  second\r                            \r\n\nline  of defense is that  the prosecutor will  not harangue a\r\n\nwitness, but will promptly bring the issue to a court.  \r\n\n          The  third  line  of  defense is  that  there  will\r\n\nultimately be a  disinterested judicial determination of  the\r\n\nissue.13  In  United   States   v.  Zolin,   491   U.S.   554\r                                                     \r\n\n(1989),  the  Supreme  Court  set  forth  the  procedure  for\r\n\nobtaining judicial review when the  attorney-client privilege\r\n\nis  consistently asserted  and  the  government  opposes  the\r\n\nprivilege.   Id. at 572.  The government may obtain in camera\r                            \r\n\nreview of  the information alleged  to be privileged,  at the\r\n\ndiscretion  of the court, upon a \"'showing of a factual basis\r\n\nadequate  to  support a  good  faith belief  by  a reasonable\r\n\nperson' . .  . that  in camera  review of  the materials  may\r\n\nreveal evidence  to establish the claim  that the crime-fraud\r\n\nexception applies.\"  Id. (quoting Caldwell v. District Court,\r                                                                        \r\n\n664 P.2d 26, 33  (Colo. 1982)).  Apparently, no  such showing\r\n\nwas made  in this  case because  Attorney Koditek  so quickly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The judicial protection of rights inherent in PF 15 does\r\nnot  resolve this  situation.

Under  Zolin, a\r                                                                      \r\n\nprosecutor  may  not  obtain  disclosure,  or  even  judicial\r\n\nreview, of the privileged information upon a simple assertion\r\n\nthat  the crime-fraud  exception applies, as  happened before\r\n\nthe grand jury here.  See id. at 571.\r                                         \r\n\n          Nevertheless, Edgar  ultimately had the  benefit of\r\n\nthat third line of defense.  On the facts of this case we see\r\n\nno  prejudice,   and  therefore   no  basis  to   vacate  the\r\n\nconviction.   See Fed.  R. Crim. P. 52;  Bank of Nova Scotia,\r                                                                        \r\n\n487 U.S. at 254-55 (requiring prejudice).  Edgar does not now\r\n\nassert  that  the  trial  testimony by  Koditek  invaded  his\r\n\nprivilege.   The district court instructed  the prosecutor to\r\n\nlimit his questions  to what was  disclosed to the  insurance\r\n\ncompany  and to  avoid the  communications between  Edgar and\r\n\nAttorney Koditek.   On the  significant point  as to  whether\r\n\nEdgar had or had not confided to Koditek that the tax returns\r\n\nto  be provided to Commercial  Union had not  been filed with\r\n\nthe IRS, Attorney Koditek did not so testify at trial, as  he\r\n\nhad to the  grand jury.   Indeed, the  evidence that the  tax\r\n\nreturns  had  not  been filed  was  introduced  independently\r\n\nthrough a Certification of Lack  of Record from the custodian\r\n\nof federal tax returns.  On the point that Edgar provided the\r\n\ntax  returns to  Attorney Koditek,  Edgar does  not claim  on\r\n\nappeal that the trial court erred in holding that information\r\n\nwas not privileged.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n          Edgar  argues there  was prejudice  in that  he was\r\n\ndeprived of the choice as  to whether to assert an  advice of\r\n\ncounsel  defense.  Edgar chose  not to assert  that the false\r\n\ntax returns were prepared and submitted on advice of counsel.\r\n\nHe was free to have made  such an argument, if supported,  at\r\n\ntrial, whatever Koditek's grand jury testimony.  Had  he made\r\n\nsuch an argument, of  course, he would have waived  any claim\r\n\nthat   the   attorney-client   privilege    protected   those\r\n\ndiscussions.   See  Glenmede Trust  Co. v. Thompson,  56 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n476,  486-87 (3d  Cir.  1995); Saint-Gobain/Norton  Indus. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGeneral  Elec.  Co., 884  F. Supp.  31,  33 (D.  Mass. 1995).\r                               \r\n\nMoreover, there  was no  argument or evidence  that Koditek's\r\n\nactions  in  connection  with  the  demand  letter  were  not\r\n\nauthorized.   The choice as to whether to make such arguments\r\n\nwas not foreclosed to him and was a strategy choice  by trial\r\n\ncounsel.\r\n\n          Nor is this a fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree situation\r\n\nthat would  require suppression  of evidence or  quashing the\r\n\nindictment.  Cf. Rogers,  751 F.2d at 1078-79.  Edgar has not\r                                   \r\n\nconvinced us that he would not have been indicted but for his\r\n\nattorney's testimony.  Edgar argues  that the only reason the\r\n\ngovernment  knew  that  Attorney  Koditek  obtained  the  tax\r\n\nreturns  from  Edgar  was  because of  Koditek's  grand  jury\r\n\ntestimony.     However,  that  inference   was  self-evident.\r\n\nFurther, the  Koditek letter  and attached returns  came from\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nCommercial  Union's  claim  file  and there  was  independent\r\n\nevidence identifying the signature on the unfiled tax returns\r\n\nas  Edgar's.    There  being   no  prejudice,  there  was  no\r\n\nreversible error.  Fed. R. Crim.

Gaudin, 115 S. Ct. 2310\r                                                        \r\n\n(1995).   Gaudin was decided  after his trial  but before his\r                            \r\n\nappeal.  The issue,  not having been raised in  his principal\r\n\nbrief  to  this  court, is  waived.    See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGabriele, 63 F.3d 61,  67 n.9 (1st Cir. 1995);  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Had  Edgar raised  the\r\n\nGaudin issue initially on appeal, this court would review the\r                  \r\n\nfailure to submit  materiality to  the jury  under the  plain\r\n\nerror  test because Edgar also  failed to raise  the issue in\r\n\nthe district  court.

Edgar  argues that  we should\r\n\nnonetheless review the district court's failure to submit the\r\n\nelement  of materiality to the jury for \"plain error\" just as\r\n\nthough  the  issue were  raised in  his  initial brief.

Edgar argues that  the evidence was insufficient  to\r\n\nestablish that his omissions from the forms CA-8 for which he\r\n\nwas convicted were material.   A statement is material  if it\r\n\nhas  a  natural  tendency  to  influence  or  is  capable  of\r\n\naffecting  or  influencing  a government  function.    United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1,  7-8 (1st Cir. 1994).

Even if we were to apply  the plain error test, we would\r\nfind  Edgar had  not met his  burden.   In light  of the very\r\nstrong  evidence  of  guilt, we  do  not  think  there was  a\r\n\"miscarriage of justice\" that would warrant correction of any\r\nerror.  United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 1779 (1993).\r                                          \r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nargues that because  the decision not  to grant him  benefits\r\n\nhad  already been made and because the forms were filed late,\r\n\nhis  failure  to  set   forth  his  self-employment  was  not\r\n\nmaterial.   However,  the standard is  not whether  there was\r\n\nactual influence,  but whether  it would  have a  tendency to\r\n\ninfluence.  The district director for the OWCP testified that\r\n\non a claim for disability, whether one may work or has worked\r\n\nhas  considerable  influence   on  the  amount  of   benefits\r\n\nwarranted.  Thus, the  district court did not err  in finding\r\n\nEdgar's false statements to be material.   See id. (affirming\r                                                              \r\n\na finding  of materiality for false  statements of employment\r\n\non a Form 1032).\r\n\nFair Credit Reporting Act\r                                     \r\n\n          Edgar's last  claim of error  is that there  was an\r\n\nabuse of discretion in the denial of his motion for discovery\r\n\nof the government's compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting\r\n\nAct, 15 U.S.C.     1681-1681t.  Edgar claimed to  have needed\r\n\nthis information  in order to  determine whether a  motion to\r\n\ndismiss the indictment or  a motion to suppress  evidence was\r\n\nwarranted.   Even assuming  that the government  violated the\r\n\nFCRA   by  improperly   acquiring  data   concerning  Edgar's\r\n\nfinances, Edgar has  not shown  how any use  of the  acquired\r\n\ninformation could  have prejudiced him  in the grand  jury to\r\n\nsupport dismissal of the indictment.  See, e.g., Bank of Nova\r                                                                         \r\n\nScotia  v. United  States, 487  U.S. 250  (1988).

Edgar argues that it was improper and harmful for the government to have joined such disparate charges as workers' compensation fraud, auto insurance fraud and bankruptcy fraud into a single indictment, saying the common allegation of fraud is too weak a thread to sew them all together, and that the counts should have been severed.   While the argument has some force, he was acquitted on the bankruptcy charge and we find no harm to him from its joinder with the other charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar also argues that the government trampled on his attorney-client privilege and that this denied him due process.   The government subpoenaed to the grand jury the lawyer who had represented Edgar on the automobile accident claim.   The lawyer's initial declinations to answer questions about Edgar's communications on grounds of attorney-client privilege gave way in the face of continued questioning by the prosecutor.   Edgar says he first learned of his attorney's grand jury testimony after he was indicted and before trial.   While troubled by what happened, we find that there was no prejudice to Edgar at trial and therefore his remedy, if any, is not the vacating of his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar's checkered reporting on his employment status undergirds all counts on which he was convicted.   In 1984 Edgar filed claims for compensation to the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (\"OWCP\") of the Department of Labor based on back injuries suffered in a 1981 plane crash, allegedly work-related.   The claim eventually ripened to a claim of total disability from 1987 on.   The federal government paid him benefits, after objecting, for injury for the period from 1981 through 1986.   It had balked at paying beyond 1986, but Edgar again won on appeal and he was paid to 1989.   In May of 1991, in an effort to get payments for certain periods between 1989 and 1991, he submitted three forms CA-8 to the OWCP.   These documents formed the basis for the counts of conviction.   On other dates, he submitted other forms CA-8 as well as forms EN1032-0389 (\"1032\").   These forms are important to the OWCP in considering claims for continuing compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The forms CA-8 required that certain information be provided if the claimant was working.   The employment information is used by OWCP to determine a claimant's wage earning capacity, and thus the level of his benefits.   Edgar was in fact working as a self-employed accountant during this period, but he did not provide the information required.   Nor did he mention that he operated and managed a bar, which he also owned, from 1985 to 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Instead, Edgar reported that he was neither self-employed nor employed by others.   The forms include a warning that any \"false statement, misrepresentation, [or] concealment of fact\" could subject the submitter to a felony prosecution.   Edgar says the forms were not material, as the department had already turned him down on this claim.   But, based in part on those forms, he did receive continuing compensation for the post-1989 period.   All told, he received more than $250,000 in benefits from the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1987 Edgar was involved in an automobile accident and asserted he injured his back and could not work.   Attorney Robert Koditek represented him in his claims for injury and lost income against the other driver's insurer and to his own insurance carrier, Commercial Union.   Edgar submitted a form to his own insurer, purportedly executed by a company bookkeeper but in fact forged by Edgar, stating, as to lost income, that his accounting company paid him a yearly salary of $45,600.   Attorney Koditek, representing Edgar, submitted a demand letter to Commercial Union on October 12, 1988, asserting that Edgar had been totally disabled as a result of the auto accident and demanding the policy limits be paid him.   In support of Edgar's claim for damages for lost income, the letter attached \"copies of Mr. Edgar's federal income tax returns for the years 1985, 1986, and 1987.\"   Those signed returns showed income for 1985 of $62,392 and for 1986 of $61,876.   But Edgar had never filed any tax return in either 1985 or 1986;  so, the government charged, the representation was false.   On January 16, 1989, Commercial Union settled Edgar's claim, paying him $75,000.   Attorney Koditek testified at trial that Edgar had supplied him with the copies of the tax returns given to Commercial Union to support his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Joinder and Denial of Motion for Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 37 count indictment returned against Edgar charged three fraudulent schemes.   The first 24 counts charged Edgar with mail fraud, alleging that Edgar had wrongfully obtained money through the mails (specifically, the disability checks) and had made false statements to the Department of Labor.   These counts were premised on Edgar's falsely representing his employment and earning capacity in connection with his disability claim from 1989 to 1992.   Another count involved Edgar's submission, through Attorney Koditek, of false documents and a demand letter making false statements to his automobile insurer in 1988.   The remaining twelve counts charged Edgar with filing documents containing false statements in 1991 in connection with Edgar's bankruptcy.   The scheme alleged was that Edgar filed a bankruptcy petition in California, falsely representing California was his state of domicile, listing a false social security number and concealing assets and income from his former wife and other creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar argues that the counts charging these three schemes should not have been joined because they were insufficiently similar.   He argues that the single common characteristic, misrepresentation of material facts, was not enough to satisfy the standards for joinder.   He also argues that evidence of one scheme would not be admissible in a trial on another scheme and thus the jury could infer from the evidence of one fraud that Edgar was predisposed to engage in another fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar's argument that there was an improper joinder of claims against him in the indictment, which the district court refused to undo, raises two concerns.   Edgar argues first that there was not sufficient similarity among the counts of conviction to permit joinder.   Second, he postulates a harmful spillover effect from all of the counts, even those on which he was acquitted, which prejudiced him and led to his conviction.   He also claims that, apart from the initial wrongful joinder, the district court should have allowed his motion for severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for joinder is set forth in Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment ... if the offenses charged ... are of the same or similar character....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Similar\" does not mean \"identical,\" United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir.1980), and similarity must be analyzed in terms of how the government saw its case at the time of indictment.  United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 306 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992).   As Judge Friendly commented in Werner, under the mandate of the Speedy Trial Act, joinder serves the purposes of economy of resources.  620 F.2d at 928.   Denial of a motion for relief from misjoinder is reviewed de novo.  United States v. Chambers, 964 F.2d 1250 (1st Cir.1992).   Further, a misjoinder is not reversible if it was harmless.  United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 444-50, 106 S.Ct. 725, 729-32, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986);  United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 628 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar also argues that even if joinder was proper, his motion to sever the different schemes should have been granted.   Under Rule 14, Fed.R.Crim.P., \"[i]f it appears that a defendant ... is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses ..., the court may order ... separate trials of counts.\"   The denial of a motion for severance is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and must be affirmed unless there is a \"strong showing of evident prejudice.\"  United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether counts are properly joined, this court considers such factors as \"whether the charges are laid under the same statute, whether they involve similar victims, locations, or modes of operation, and the time frame in which the charged conduct occurred.\"  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir.1995) (internal citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government argues that the test is satisfied because the workers' compensation fraud and the automobile accident fraud involved the same modus operandi of claimed total disability following an asserted injury to the back, an asserted loss of income, the submission of false official forms, and the misrepresentation of other employment in order to rake in large sums.   As to timing, the workers' compensation fraud overlapped the auto insurance fraud.   Witnesses and testimony would also overlap.   Evidence as to the auto accident fraud would be used on the claimed disability from a back injury from the plane crash, and to establish that Edgar misrepresented his earnings and earning capacity.   We believe there were sufficient similarities between the workers' compensation and insurance fraud schemes to permit joinder of those counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, like the district court, we are disturbed by the joinder of the bankruptcy fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We discern no \"common scheme or plan.\"   See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 627.   The bankruptcy fraud charges, relating to events in 1991, were brought under different statutes and the supposed victim was Edgar's ex-wife (and possibly other unspecified creditors). The location was different.   The bankruptcy filings were all with the court in California, while the other frauds took place primarily in Massachusetts.   The modes of operation were different.   In the workers' compensation and automobile insurance frauds, Edgar asserted an injury to his back, which resulted in the loss of earnings.   The alleged bankruptcy fraud did not involve an attempt to obtain payment for an injury.   Rather, it was allegedly an attempt to avoid obligations to his ex-wife, with whom he had an acrimonious relationship, and to force her to press her claim in an inconvenient forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar claims he was prejudiced because the evidence for each scheme had a harmful spillover effect, and the jury convicted him not because of specific evidence showing his guilt, but because of its perception that he was a dishonest man.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Specifically, Edgar posits that the jury heard evidence that (1) he collected $75,000 in settlement for the auto insurance claim;  (2) he had an extremely acrimonious divorce;  (3) he filed for bankruptcy in California and made false statements that he resided there;  (4) he has owned various properties and has established trusts at different times;  (5) he filed false information in the bankruptcy court regarding his assets and social security number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming the bankruptcy count was improperly joined, any error was harmless.   It did not result in \"actual prejudice\" because it did not have a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"  Lane, 474 U.S. at 449, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (internal quotations omitted);  see also O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 995, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995).   Edgar was acquitted by the court of the bankruptcy fraud and of several counts of mail fraud in the workers' compensation scheme before the matter went to the jury.   Of the remaining thirteen workers' compensation counts, the jury proved itself capable of making distinctions:  it acquitted Edgar of one, could not reach a verdict on nine and convicted on three.   The jury thus showed itself clearly capable of discriminating among the evidence applicable to each count, even within the workers' compensation fraud, thus reducing the risk of any prejudice from evidence on the bankruptcy count.   See United States v. Stackpole, 811 F.2d 689, 694 (1st Cir.1987) (jury's acquittal on one of several counts suggests jury not confused by joinder).   Moreover, the court gave appropriate limiting instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Chambers, 964 F.2d at 1251;  United States v. Attanasio, 870 F.2d 809, 815 (2d Cir.1989) (misjoinder can be rendered harmless by proper limiting instruction);  cf.  Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (analyzing joinder of defendants under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>).  The exhibits relating solely to the bankruptcy fraud were struck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the evidence as to the bankruptcy and insurance schemes was admissible as to the workers' compensation scheme, thus resulting in no prejudice.   See Stackpole, 811 F.2d at 694;  cf. Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (analyzing joinder of defendants under Rule 8(b)).   Any statements that Edgar filed with the bankruptcy court stating his income for the years encompassed by the workers' compensation fraud would have been admissible on the latter issue.   The statements made to the insurance company in connection with the insurance fraud were admissible on the workers' compensation issue, particularly as they related to Edgar's back injury and his loss of earnings.   Finally, there was substantial independent evidence on the counts of conviction.   The fraud against the insurance company and the three counts of submitting falsified documents to the Department of Labor were supported by evidence unrelated to the bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Edgar cannot meet his burden of showing prejudice on the denial of the motion for severance as to any of the counts.   Garden-variety arguments of spillover--such as if the jury found defendant guilty of A, that alone would lead to the conclusion that he was guilty of B--without more, are insufficient to require severance.  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 973.   Appellants must demonstrate actual prejudice.   That is a particularly difficult burden for Edgar to meet, because the spillover from his acquittal on the bankruptcy count and certain of the workers' compensation counts could just as easily be posited to have worked to his benefit.   The law of severance and joinder is a stricter master than Edgar's claimed error.   See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 307-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Grand Jury Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1993, Attorney Koditek testified under subpoena before the grand jury.

Even then, the prosecution denied Edgar's requests for a copy of Attorney Koditek's testimony.   Ten days prior to trial, the new prosecutor assigned to the case appropriately provided the transcript to the defendant.

What I'm asking you is whether Mr. Edgar indicated to you, in substance or in fact, that he was submitting or having you submit to the Commercial Union Insurance Company tax returns which were not the same.   That is to say that they were fraudulent tax returns that were not submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KODITEK:  No, he never said that to me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AUSA:  Was it your understanding, sir, that the tax returns that he submitted were, in fact, genuine tax returns as filed with the Internal Revenue Service?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KODITEK:  That would be my understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is clear is that Attorney Koditek was questioned about the substance of his conversations with his client, that he asserted attorney-client privilege twice, that the prosecutor responded that the matter was not covered by privilege and that Koditek then answered.   This was apparently done without the client, Edgar, being aware of the testimony.   Nor was there any judicial review of whether the testimony was indeed privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Edgar did object on grounds of attorney-client privilege to any testimony from Attorney Koditek.   The court rejected the privilege claim.   Attorney Koditek testified that he represented Edgar in connection with the Commercial Union claim, that he wrote two letters to Commercial Union in connection with the claim, and that the tax returns were enclosed with one of the letters.   Attorney Koditek authenticated the letters, but declined to answer on grounds of privilege the question of who gave him the material (including the tax returns) to be enclosed with the demand letter to the insurer.   The district court ruled that because the tax returns were disclosed to the insurance company, the fact that Edgar gave the returns to Koditek was not privileged.   Attorney Koditek answered that he received the tax returns from Mr. Edgar.   Edgar chose not to cross-examine on this point and never asserted a defense of advice of counsel or that the attorney's actions were not authorized.   At trial, Attorney Koditek did not testify, as he did to the grand jury, about whether Edgar had ever told him that the tax returns submitted to Commercial Union had not been submitted to the IRS.   The government did put on independent evidence that these returns were never filed with the IRS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar filed several motions regarding his attorney's testimony.   He argued a fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree theory that Attorney Koditek's testimony before the grand jury was illegal and so the indictment should be dismissed or evidence should be suppressed.   There is precedent for an argument that a court may quash an indictment based upon evidence directly obtained from or derived from breach of the attorney-client privilege.   See United States v. Omni International Corp., 634 F.Supp. 1414, 1421 (D.Md.1986) (but doubting that dismissal was an appropriate remedy under United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 101 S.Ct. 665, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981));  People v. Fentress, 103 Misc.2d 179, 425 N.Y.S.2d 485 (Dutchess Co. Ct.1980);  Baltes v. Doe I, 57 U.S.L.W. 2268 (Fla.Cir.Ct.1988).   Some federal courts have held that if the prosecutor induces the breach, suppression of evidence derived from the breach is the appropriate remedy, unless prejudice would remain, in which case the indictment may be dismissed.   See, e.g., United States v. Rogers, 751 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir.1985) (no dismissal when any prejudice to defendant could be neutralized by excluding at trial confidential communications wrongfully obtained from defendant's former attorney).   But \"[w]hen a federal court uses its supervisory power to dismiss an indictment it directly encroaches upon the fundamental role of the grand jury.   That power is appropriately reserved, therefore, for extremely limited circumstances.\"  Whitehouse v. United States Dist. Ct., 53 F.3d 1349, 1359 (1st Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted).   Indeed, the Supreme Court has said that prejudice is required to dismiss an indictment for prosecutorial misconduct.  Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 263, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 2378, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988).   Edgar also sought discovery as to whether the proper procedures were followed to subpoena Attorney Koditek.   And, he argued that the government had failed to follow the procedures in United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989).   Those motions were all denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>Attorney-Client Privilege and Due Process Arguments</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar argues on appeal that the questioning of Attorney Koditek before the grand jury violated his rights to due process and to the assistance of counsel.   We will assume, arguendo, that Edgar did not waive his rights under the attorney-client privilege and that those rights were violated by Attorney Koditek's testimony before the grand jury.

See, e.g., Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1077-78.   Nonetheless, we are troubled by what happened and seek guidance in case law discussing the district court's adoption of Rule 3:08 of the Rules of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, and in the teachings of United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A long simmering dispute in Massachusetts over prosecutors serving grand jury subpoenas on counsel resulted in the affirmance by this court, equally divided en banc, of a district court opinion that approved the Local Rule that adopted the disciplinary rules of the Supreme Judicial Court, particularly S.J.C.Rule 3:08, Prosecutorial Function 15 (\"PF 15\").   See United States v. Klubock, 832 F.2d 664 (1st Cir.1987) (en banc by an equally divided court) (\"Klubock II \") (plaintiff prosecutors sought a declaratory judgment against the Board of Bar Overseers that the rule was invalid as applied to federal prosecutors), aff'g 639 F.Supp. 117 (D.Mass.1986).   The net effect is that federal prosecutors in Massachusetts must comply with PF 15, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>It is unprofessional conduct for a prosecutor to subpoena an attorney to a grand jury without prior judicial approval in circumstances where the prosecutor seeks to compel the attorney/witness to provide evidence concerning a person who is represented by the attorney/witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.J.C.Rule 3:08, PF 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor here argues that PF 15 does not literally apply as Edgar was represented in the past by Attorney Koditek, but was not represented by him at the time of the subpoena, as the language of PF 15 requires.   Nonetheless, the prosecution represented to the district court that it had complied with PF 15 and had obtained prior judicial approval to serve the subpoena.   But, as Edgar points out, the record is devoid of proof on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subpoena here did not go to the target's criminal defense counsel and so does not raise the issues of potential abuse specific to that situation.   See Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at 1354.   But Edgar and Attorney Koditek were at least potentially placed in the hypothetical situation described in the panel opinion vacated by Klubock II<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>The serving of a subpoena under such circumstances will immediately drive a chilling wedge between the attorney/witness and his client.   This wedge is the natural consequence of several underlying factors created by this anomalous situation.   Most obvious is the fact that the client is uncertain at best, and suspicious at worst, that his legitimate trust in his attorney may be subject to betrayal.   And because the subpoenaed attorney/witness may himself feel intimidated, this may in fact take place if there is not even minimal ethical control regulating the subpoenaing of an attorney/witness to seek evidence against his client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More subtle, but perhaps more important in terms of the ethical setting within which PF 15 is framed, is the immediate conflict of interests created between the attorney/witness and his client by the serving of a subpoena in the context of what is contemplated by PF 15.   As a witness, the attorney/witness has separate legal and practical interests apart from those of his client.   These interests may or may not coincide with those of the attorney/witness and his client.   The mere possibility of such a conflict is sufficient to create a problem.   A minimal overview by an impartial observer, as is provided by PF 15, can go far in preventing the creation of these ethical conflicts between the attorney/witness and his client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Klubock, 832 F.2d 649, 652-53 (1st Cir.1987) (footnote omitted) (\"Klubock I \").   We believe these considerations apply to the relationships with former counsel as well as with present counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be an implicit threat to the attorney called to testify about a client to the grand jury that the attorney will become a target himself<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> should the prosecutor think he knowingly participated in the fraud.   This is particularly so where the prosecution asserts that the privilege must give way to the crime-fraud exception.   The lawyer may be tempted to reveal privileged conversations in order to avoid becoming a target himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Ideally, counsel receiving a subpoena will give notice to a client and consistently assert the privilege on behalf of a client.   Ideally, a prosecutor faced with an assertion of privilege by an attorney witness will seek a judicial determination of whether the privilege is valid.   But we do not live in an ideal world.   See Jerome Frank, If Men Were Angels (1942).   We are loath to say the prosecutor here crossed over the line.   But we are equally loath to say, as the government urges, that there is no line and there is never a remedy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first line of defense to protect Edgar's privilege lay in the hands of his lawyer.   A lawyer has an obligation not to reveal client confidences.   S.J.C.Rule 3:07, Code of Prof.Resp., DR 4-101.   A lawyer also has an obligation to assert privilege on behalf of a client.   Id.;  see also In re Impounded Case (Law Firm), 879 F.2d 1211, 1213 (3d Cir.1989).   Generally, an attorney has an obligation to assert the privilege on behalf of the client and not to disclose confidential information until there is a judicial determination that there is no privilege.   ABA/BNA Lawyers Manual on Professional Conduct 55:1307-08 (1989).   Even if there is an assertion that there is no privilege because the crime-fraud exception applies, the attorney is required to give notice to the client.   S.J.C.Rule 3:07, Code of Prof.Resp., DR 7-102(B)(1).   If the attorney violates these duties, he is at risk at least of a malpractice suit and of professional discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concomitantly, a prosecutor has certain obligations beyond zealous representation of the government when the prosecutor interrogates witnesses before the grand jury.   For example, if a witness invokes the privilege against self-incrimination, the prosecutor should cease questioning as to the particular subject to which the privilege was addressed.  United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 581, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1778, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976).   But see United States v. Benjamin, 852 F.2d 413, 420 (9th Cir.1988) (testing validity of reliance on privilege not prosecutorial misconduct unless prosecutor harangued witness or improperly commented on assertion of privilege), vacated on other grounds, 490 U.S. 1043, 109 S.Ct. 1948, 104 L.Ed.2d 418 (1989).   Thus, the second line of defense is that the prosecutor will not harangue a witness, but will promptly bring the issue to a court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third line of defense is that there will ultimately be a disinterested judicial determination of the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989), the Supreme Court set forth the procedure for obtaining judicial review when the attorney-client privilege is consistently asserted and the government opposes the privilege.  Id. at 572, 109 S.Ct. at 2631.   The government may obtain in camera review of the information alleged to be privileged, at the discretion of the court, upon a \" 'showing of a factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person' ... that in camera review of the materials may reveal evidence to establish the claim that the crime-fraud exception applies.\"  Id. (quoting Caldwell v. District Court, 644 P.2d 26, 33 (Colo.1982)).   Apparently, no such showing was made in this case because Attorney Koditek so quickly succumbed to the prosecutor's questioning.   Under Zolin, a prosecutor may not obtain disclosure, or even judicial review, of the privileged information upon a simple assertion that the crime-fraud exception applies, as happened before the grand jury here.   See id. at 571, 109 S.Ct. at 2630.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Edgar ultimately had the benefit of that third line of defense.   On the facts of this case we see no prejudice, and therefore no basis to vacate the conviction.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52;  Bank of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 254-55, 108 S.Ct. at 2373 (requiring prejudice).   Edgar does not now assert that the trial testimony by Koditek invaded his privilege.   The district court instructed the prosecutor to limit his questions to what was disclosed to the insurance company and to avoid the communications between Edgar and Attorney Koditek.   On the significant point as to whether Edgar had or had not confided to Koditek that the tax returns to be provided to Commercial Union had not been filed with the IRS, Attorney Koditek did not so testify at trial, as he had to the grand jury.   Indeed, the evidence that the tax returns had not been filed was introduced independently through a Certification of Lack of Record from the custodian of federal tax returns.   On the point that Edgar provided the tax returns to Attorney Koditek, Edgar does not claim on appeal that the trial court erred in holding that information was not privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar argues there was prejudice in that he was deprived of the choice as to whether to assert an advice of counsel defense.   Edgar chose not to assert that the false tax returns were prepared and submitted on advice of counsel.   He was free to have made such an argument, if supported, at trial, whatever Koditek's grand jury testimony.   Had he made such an argument, of course, he would have waived any claim that the attorney-client privilege protected those discussions.   See Glenmede Trust Co. v. Thompson, 56 F.3d 476, 486-87 (3d Cir.1995);  Saint-Gobain/Norton Indus. v. General Elec. Co., 884 F.Supp. 31, 33 (D.Mass.1995).   Moreover, there was no argument or evidence that Koditek's actions in connection with the demand letter were not authorized.   The choice as to whether to make such arguments was not foreclosed to him and was a strategy choice by trial counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this a fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree situation that would require suppression of evidence or quashing the indictment.   Cf. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078-79.   Edgar has not convinced us that he would not have been indicted but for his attorney's testimony.   Edgar argues that the only reason the government knew that Attorney Koditek obtained the tax returns from Edgar was because of Koditek's grand jury testimony.   However, that inference was self-evident.   Further, the Koditek letter and attached returns came from Commercial Union's claim file and there was independent evidence identifying the signature on the unfiled tax returns as Edgar's.   There being no prejudice, there was no reversible error.   Fed.R.Crim.P. 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>Sufficiency of Evidence of MaterialityIn his reply brief<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> in this court Edgar makes the argument for the first time that the jury was not permitted to decide the issue of materiality of his allegedly false statements, in violation of the principles announced by the Supreme Court in United States v. Gaudin, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995).  Gaudin was decided after his trial but before his appeal.   The issue, not having been raised in his principal brief to this court, is waived.   See United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 67 n. 9 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1318 n. 12 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995);  United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918, 922 n. 7 (1st Cir.1993).   Had Edgar raised the Gaudin issue initially on appeal, this court would review the failure to submit materiality to the jury under the plain error test because Edgar also failed to raise the issue in the district court.   See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 631;  see also United States v. Collins, 60 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1995).   Edgar argues that we should nonetheless review the district court's failure to submit the element of materiality to the jury for \"plain error\" just as though the issue were raised in his initial brief.   See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 631.   However, we think a higher standard must be met, and as review for \"plain error\" lies \"within the sound discretion of the Court of Appeals,\" we decline to apply that standard in the circumstances of this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 972 (\"appellate courts will notice unpreserved errors only in the most egregious circumstances\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar did properly preserve an objection to the sufficiency of the evidence on materiality, but that we also reject.   Edgar argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that his omissions from the forms CA-8 for which he was convicted were material.   A statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence or is capable of affecting or influencing a government function.  United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.1994).   Edgar argues that because the decision not to grant him benefits had already been made and because the forms were filed late, his failure to set forth his self-employment was not material.   However, the standard is not whether there was actual influence, but whether it would have a tendency to influence.   The district director for the OWCP testified that on a claim for disability, whether one may work or has worked has considerable influence on the amount of benefits warranted.   Thus, the district court did not err in finding Edgar's false statements to be material.   See id.  (affirming a finding of materiality for false statements of employment on a Form 1032).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Fair Credit Reporting Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar's last claim of error is that there was an abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion for discovery of the government's compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1681-1681t.   Edgar claimed to have needed this information in order to determine whether a motion to dismiss the indictment or a motion to suppress evidence was warranted.   Even assuming that the government violated the FCRA by improperly acquiring data concerning Edgar's finances, Edgar has not shown how any use of the acquired information could have prejudiced him in the grand jury to support dismissal of the indictment.   See, e.g., Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988).   Nor would suppression be required for a violation of the FCRA.   Suppression of the evidence is not a mentioned remedy under the FCRA, nor is discovery of whether the government complied with the Act.   See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1681n;  cf. United States v. Kington, 801 F.2d 733, 737 (5th Cir.1986) (refusing to suppress records obtained in violation of the Right to Financial Privacy Act when Congress did not provide for that remedy in statute), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1014, 107 S.Ct. 1888, 95 L.Ed.2d 495 (1987);  cf. also United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 735, 100 S.Ct. 2439, 2446, 65 L.Ed.2d 468 (1980) (evidence otherwise admissible may not be suppressed on the ground that it was seized unlawfully from a third party);  United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741, 99 S.Ct. 1465, 59 L.Ed.2d 733 (1979) (evidence obtained in violation of IRS regulation need not be suppressed).

Levine, 546 F.2d 658, 662 (5th Cir.1977)).   Given that Edgar used the same basic mechanism, misrepresenting earning capacity in seeking compensation lost due to a back injury, in both the workers' compensation and auto insurance fraud, we believe that joinder of the counts underlying these schemes would have been proper even under the test applied in Yefsky.   Given our disposition of this issue, we need not decide whether Yefsky set a more rigid test for joinder of offenses than the language of Rule 8(a) warrants</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district judge, in granting the motion for acquittal on the bankruptcy charges after the government had presented its case, noted the potential problems with the joinder of the bankruptcy fraud.

He was acquitted on other charges, including bankruptcy fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Edgar was sentenced to one year and one day in prison plus two years of supervised release and was fined $5000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His appeal argues that joinder of the bankruptcy fraud, workers' compensation fraud and insurance fraud was improper, as was the refusal to sever.   He strongly asserts reversible error in the testimony of his civil-claim attorney before the grand jury which, he alleges, violated his attorney-client privilege.   He also argues that the issue of materiality of the alleged false statements should have been submitted to the jury under the rule established later in United States v. Gaudin, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117958\"><a href=\"/opinion/117958/united-states-v-gaudin/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two arguments merit close discussion.   Edgar argues that it was improper and harmful for the government to have joined such disparate charges as workers' compensation fraud, auto insurance fraud and bankruptcy fraud into a single indictment, saying the common allegation of fraud is too weak a thread to sew them all together, and that the counts should have been severed.   While the argument has some force, he was acquitted on the bankruptcy charge and we find no harm to him from its joinder with the other charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar also argues that the government trampled on his attorney-client privilege and that this denied him due process.   The government subpoenaed to the grand jury the lawyer who had represented Edgar on the automobile accident claim.   The lawyer's initial declinations to answer questions about Edgar's communications on grounds of attorney-client privilege gave way in the face of continued questioning by the prosecutor.   Edgar says he first learned of his attorney's grand jury testimony after he was indicted and before trial.   While troubled by what happened, we find that there was no prejudice to Edgar at trial and therefore his remedy, if any, is not the vacating of his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar's checkered reporting on his employment status undergirds all counts on which he was convicted.   In 1984 Edgar filed claims for compensation to the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (\"OWCP\") of the Department of Labor based on back injuries suffered in a 1981 plane crash, allegedly work-related.   The claim eventually ripened to a claim of total disability from 1987 on.   The federal government paid him benefits, after objecting, for injury for the period from 1981 through 1986.   It had balked at paying beyond 1986, but Edgar again won on appeal and he was paid to 1989.   In May of 1991, in an effort to get payments for certain periods between 1989 and 1991, he submitted three forms CA-8 to the OWCP.   These documents formed the basis for the counts of conviction.   On other dates, he submitted other forms CA-8 as well as forms EN1032-0389 (\"1032\").   These forms are important to the OWCP in considering claims for continuing compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The forms CA-8 required that certain information be provided if the claimant was working.   The employment information is used by OWCP to determine a claimant's wage earning capacity, and thus the level of his benefits.   Edgar was in fact working as a self-employed accountant during this period, but he did not provide the information required.   Nor did he mention that he operated and managed a bar, which he also owned, from 1985 to 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Instead, Edgar reported that he was neither self-employed nor employed by others.   The forms include a warning that any \"false statement, misrepresentation, [or] concealment of fact\" could subject the submitter to a felony prosecution.   Edgar says the forms were not material, as the department had already turned him down on this claim.   But, based in part on those forms, he did receive continuing compensation for the post-1989 period.   All told, he received more than $250,000 in benefits from the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1987 Edgar was involved in an automobile accident and asserted he injured his back and could not work.   Attorney Robert Koditek represented him in his claims for injury and lost income against the other driver's insurer and to his own insurance carrier, Commercial Union.   Edgar submitted a form to his own insurer, purportedly executed by a company bookkeeper but in fact forged by Edgar, stating, as to lost income, that his accounting company paid him a yearly salary of $45,600.   Attorney Koditek, representing Edgar, submitted a demand letter to Commercial Union on October 12, 1988, asserting that Edgar had been totally disabled as a result of the auto accident and demanding the policy limits be paid him.   In support of Edgar's claim for damages for lost income, the letter attached \"copies of Mr. Edgar's federal income tax returns for the years 1985, 1986, and 1987.\"   Those signed returns showed income for 1985 of $62,392 and for 1986 of $61,876.   But Edgar had never filed any tax return in either 1985 or 1986;  so, the government charged, the representation was false.   On January 16, 1989, Commercial Union settled Edgar's claim, paying him $75,000.   Attorney Koditek testified at trial that Edgar had supplied him with the copies of the tax returns given to Commercial Union to support his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Joinder and Denial of Motion for Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 37 count indictment returned against Edgar charged three fraudulent schemes.   The first 24 counts charged Edgar with mail fraud, alleging that Edgar had wrongfully obtained money through the mails (specifically, the disability checks) and had made false statements to the Department of Labor.   These counts were premised on Edgar's falsely representing his employment and earning capacity in connection with his disability claim from 1989 to 1992.   Another count involved Edgar's submission, through Attorney Koditek, of false documents and a demand letter making false statements to his automobile insurer in 1988.   The remaining twelve counts charged Edgar with filing documents containing false statements in 1991 in connection with Edgar's bankruptcy.   The scheme alleged was that Edgar filed a bankruptcy petition in California, falsely representing California was his state of domicile, listing a false social security number and concealing assets and income from his former wife and other creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar argues that the counts charging these three schemes should not have been joined because they were insufficiently similar.   He argues that the single common characteristic, misrepresentation of material facts, was not enough to satisfy the standards for joinder.   He also argues that evidence of one scheme would not be admissible in a trial on another scheme and thus the jury could infer from the evidence of one fraud that Edgar was predisposed to engage in another fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar's argument that there was an improper joinder of claims against him in the indictment, which the district court refused to undo, raises two concerns.   Edgar argues first that there was not sufficient similarity among the counts of conviction to permit joinder.   Second, he postulates a harmful spillover effect from all of the counts, even those on which he was acquitted, which prejudiced him and led to his conviction.   He also claims that, apart from the initial wrongful joinder, the district court should have allowed his motion for severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for joinder is set forth in Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment ... if the offenses charged ... are of the same or similar character....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Similar\" does not mean \"identical,\" United States v.

As to timing, the workers' compensation fraud overlapped the auto insurance fraud.   Witnesses and testimony would also overlap.   Evidence as to the auto accident fraud would be used on the claimed disability from a back injury from the plane crash, and to establish that Edgar misrepresented his earnings and earning capacity.   We believe there were sufficient similarities between the workers' compensation and insurance fraud schemes to permit joinder of those counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, like the district court, we are disturbed by the joinder of the bankruptcy fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We discern no \"common scheme or plan.\"   See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 627.   The bankruptcy fraud charges, relating to events in 1991, were brought under different statutes and the supposed victim was Edgar's ex-wife (and possibly other unspecified creditors). The location was different.   The bankruptcy filings were all with the court in California, while the other frauds took place primarily in Massachusetts.   The modes of operation were different.   In the workers' compensation and automobile insurance frauds, Edgar asserted an injury to his back, which resulted in the loss of earnings.   The alleged bankruptcy fraud did not involve an attempt to obtain payment for an injury.   Rather, it was allegedly an attempt to avoid obligations to his ex-wife, with whom he had an acrimonious relationship, and to force her to press her claim in an inconvenient forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar claims he was prejudiced because the evidence for each scheme had a harmful spillover effect, and the jury convicted him not because of specific evidence showing his guilt, but because of its perception that he was a dishonest man.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Specifically, Edgar posits that the jury heard evidence that (1) he collected $75,000 in settlement for the auto insurance claim;  (2) he had an extremely acrimonious divorce;  (3) he filed for bankruptcy in California and made false statements that he resided there;  (4) he has owned various properties and has established trusts at different times;  (5) he filed false information in the bankruptcy court regarding his assets and social security number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming the bankruptcy count was improperly joined, any error was harmless.   It did not result in \"actual prejudice\" because it did not have a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"  Lane, 474 U.S. at 449, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (internal quotations omitted);  see also O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span> (1995).   Edgar was acquitted by the court of the bankruptcy fraud and of several counts of mail fraud in the workers' compensation scheme before the matter went to the jury.   Of the remaining thirteen workers' compensation counts, the jury proved itself capable of making distinctions:  it acquitted Edgar of one, could not reach a verdict on nine and convicted on three.   The jury thus showed itself clearly capable of discriminating among the evidence applicable to each count, even within the workers' compensation fraud, thus reducing the risk of any prejudice from evidence on the bankruptcy count.   See United States v. Stackpole, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483246\"><a href=\"/opinion/483246/united-states-v-donald-francis-stackpole-united-states-of-america-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 694 (1st Cir.1987) (jury's acquittal on one of several counts suggests jury not confused by joinder).   Moreover, the court gave appropriate limiting instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Chambers, 964 F.2d at 1251;  United States v. Attanasio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520299\"><a href=\"/opinion/520299/united-states-v-louis-j-attanasio-marie-l-attanasio-joseph-valentino/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span>, 815 (2d Cir.1989) (misjoinder can be rendered harmless by proper limiting instruction);  cf.  Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (analyzing joinder of defendants under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>).  The exhibits relating solely to the bankruptcy fraud were struck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the evidence as to the bankruptcy and insurance schemes was admissible as to the workers' compensation scheme, thus resulting in no prejudice.   See Stackpole, 811 F.2d at 694;  cf. Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (analyzing joinder of defendants under Rule 8(b)).   Any statements that Edgar filed with the bankruptcy court stating his income for the years encompassed by the workers' compensation fraud would have been admissible on the latter issue.   The statements made to the insurance company in connection with the insurance fraud were admissible on the workers' compensation issue, particularly as they related to Edgar's back injury and his loss of earnings.   Finally, there was substantial independent evidence on the counts of conviction.   The fraud against the insurance company and the three counts of submitting falsified documents to the Department of Labor were supported by evidence unrelated to the bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Edgar cannot meet his burden of showing prejudice on the denial of the motion for severance as to any of the counts.   Garden-variety arguments of spillover--such as if the jury found defendant guilty of A, that alone would lead to the conclusion that he was guilty of B--without more, are insufficient to require severance.  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 973.   Appellants must demonstrate actual prejudice.   That is a particularly difficult burden for Edgar to meet, because the spillover from his acquittal on the bankruptcy count and certain of the workers' compensation counts could just as easily be posited to have worked to his benefit.   The law of severance and joinder is a stricter master than Edgar's claimed error.   See Natanel, 938 F.2d at 307-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Grand Jury Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1993, Attorney Koditek testified under subpoena before the grand jury.

Even then, the prosecution denied Edgar's requests for a copy of Attorney Koditek's testimony.

That is to say that they were fraudulent tax returns that were not submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KODITEK:  No, he never said that to me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AUSA:  Was it your understanding, sir, that the tax returns that he submitted were, in fact, genuine tax returns as filed with the Internal Revenue Service?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KODITEK:  That would be my understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is clear is that Attorney Koditek was questioned about the substance of his conversations with his client, that he asserted attorney-client privilege twice, that the prosecutor responded that the matter was not covered by privilege and that Koditek then answered.   This was apparently done without the client, Edgar, being aware of the testimony.   Nor was there any judicial review of whether the testimony was indeed privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Edgar did object on grounds of attorney-client privilege to any testimony from Attorney Koditek.   The court rejected the privilege claim.   Attorney Koditek testified that he represented Edgar in connection with the Commercial Union claim, that he wrote two letters to Commercial Union in connection with the claim, and that the tax returns were enclosed with one of the letters.   Attorney Koditek authenticated the letters, but declined to answer on grounds of privilege the question of who gave him the material (including the tax returns) to be enclosed with the demand letter to the insurer.   The district court ruled that because the tax returns were disclosed to the insurance company, the fact that Edgar gave the returns to Koditek was not privileged.   Attorney Koditek answered that he received the tax returns from Mr. Edgar.   Edgar chose not to cross-examine on this point and never asserted a defense of advice of counsel or that the attorney's actions were not authorized.   At trial, Attorney Koditek did not testify, as he did to the grand jury, about whether Edgar had ever told him that the tax returns submitted to Commercial Union had not been submitted to the IRS.   The government did put on independent evidence that these returns were never filed with the IRS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar filed several motions regarding his attorney's testimony.   He argued a fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree theory that Attorney Koditek's testimony before the grand jury was illegal and so the indictment should be dismissed or evidence should be suppressed.   There is precedent for an argument that a court may quash an indictment based upon evidence directly obtained from or derived from breach of the attorney-client privilege.   See United States v.

Some federal courts have held that if the prosecutor induces the breach, suppression of evidence derived from the breach is the appropriate remedy, unless prejudice would remain, in which case the indictment may be dismissed.

The net effect is that federal prosecutors in Massachusetts must comply with PF 15, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>It is unprofessional conduct for a prosecutor to subpoena an attorney to a grand jury without prior judicial approval in circumstances where the prosecutor seeks to compel the attorney/witness to provide evidence concerning a person who is represented by the attorney/witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.J.C.Rule 3:08, PF 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor here argues that PF 15 does not literally apply as Edgar was represented in the past by Attorney Koditek, but was not represented by him at the time of the subpoena, as the language of PF 15 requires.   Nonetheless, the prosecution represented to the district court that it had complied with PF 15 and had obtained prior judicial approval to serve the subpoena.   But, as Edgar points out, the record is devoid of proof on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subpoena here did not go to the target's criminal defense counsel and so does not raise the issues of potential abuse specific to that situation.   See Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at 1354.   But Edgar and Attorney Koditek were at least potentially placed in the hypothetical situation described in the panel opinion vacated by Klubock II<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>The serving of a subpoena under such circumstances will immediately drive a chilling wedge between the attorney/witness and his client.   This wedge is the natural consequence of several underlying factors created by this anomalous situation.   Most obvious is the fact that the client is uncertain at best, and suspicious at worst, that his legitimate trust in his attorney may be subject to betrayal.   And because the subpoenaed attorney/witness may himself feel intimidated, this may in fact take place if there is not even minimal ethical control regulating the subpoenaing of an attorney/witness to seek evidence against his client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More subtle, but perhaps more important in terms of the ethical setting within which PF 15 is framed, is the immediate conflict of interests created between the attorney/witness and his client by the serving of a subpoena in the context of what is contemplated by PF 15.   As a witness, the attorney/witness has separate legal and practical interests apart from those of his client.   These interests may or may not coincide with those of the attorney/witness and his client.   The mere possibility of such a conflict is sufficient to create a problem.   A minimal overview by an impartial observer, as is provided by PF 15, can go far in preventing the creation of these ethical conflicts between the attorney/witness and his client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

This is particularly so where the prosecution asserts that the privilege must give way to the crime-fraud exception.   The lawyer may be tempted to reveal privileged conversations in order to avoid becoming a target himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Ideally, counsel receiving a subpoena will give notice to a client and consistently assert the privilege on behalf of a client.   Ideally, a prosecutor faced with an assertion of privilege by an attorney witness will seek a judicial determination of whether the privilege is valid.   But we do not live in an ideal world.   See Jerome Frank, If Men Were Angels (1942).   We are loath to say the prosecutor here crossed over the line.   But we are equally loath to say, as the government urges, that there is no line and there is never a remedy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first line of defense to protect Edgar's privilege lay in the hands of his lawyer.   A lawyer has an obligation not to reveal client confidences.   S.J.C.Rule 3:07, Code of Prof.Resp., DR 4-101.   A lawyer also has an obligation to assert privilege on behalf of a client.   Id.;  see also In re Impounded Case (Law Firm), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526460\"><a href=\"/opinion/526460/in-re-impounded-case-law-firm/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span>, 1213 (3d Cir.1989).   Generally, an attorney has an obligation to assert the privilege on behalf of the client and not to disclose confidential information until there is a judicial determination that there is no privilege.   ABA/BNA Lawyers Manual on Professional Conduct 55:1307-08 (1989).   Even if there is an assertion that there is no privilege because the crime-fraud exception applies, the attorney is required to give notice to the client.   S.J.C.Rule 3:07, Code of Prof.Resp., DR 7-102(B)(1).   If the attorney violates these duties, he is at risk at least of a malpractice suit and of professional discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concomitantly, a prosecutor has certain obligations beyond zealous representation of the government when the prosecutor interrogates witnesses before the grand jury.

The government may obtain in camera review of the information alleged to be privileged, at the discretion of the court, upon a \" 'showing of a factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person' ... that in camera review of the materials may reveal evidence to establish the claim that the crime-fraud exception applies.\"  Id.

Apparently, no such showing was made in this case because Attorney Koditek so quickly succumbed to the prosecutor's questioning.   Under Zolin, a prosecutor may not obtain disclosure, or even judicial review, of the privileged information upon a simple assertion that the crime-fraud exception applies, as happened before the grand jury here.   See id. at 571, 109 S.Ct. at 2630.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Edgar ultimately had the benefit of that third line of defense.   On the facts of this case we see no prejudice, and therefore no basis to vacate the conviction.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52;  Bank of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 254-55, 108 S.Ct. at 2373 (requiring prejudice).   Edgar does not now assert that the trial testimony by Koditek invaded his privilege.   The district court instructed the prosecutor to limit his questions to what was disclosed to the insurance company and to avoid the communications between Edgar and Attorney Koditek.   On the significant point as to whether Edgar had or had not confided to Koditek that the tax returns to be provided to Commercial Union had not been filed with the IRS, Attorney Koditek did not so testify at trial, as he had to the grand jury.   Indeed, the evidence that the tax returns had not been filed was introduced independently through a Certification of Lack of Record from the custodian of federal tax returns.   On the point that Edgar provided the tax returns to Attorney Koditek, Edgar does not claim on appeal that the trial court erred in holding that information was not privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar argues there was prejudice in that he was deprived of the choice as to whether to assert an advice of counsel defense.   Edgar chose not to assert that the false tax returns were prepared and submitted on advice of counsel.   He was free to have made such an argument, if supported, at trial, whatever Koditek's grand jury testimony.   Had he made such an argument, of course, he would have waived any claim that the attorney-client privilege protected those discussions.   See Glenmede Trust Co. v. Thompson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697273\"><a href=\"/opinion/697273/glenmede-trust-company-pepper-hamilton-scheetz-v-b-ray-thompson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 486-87 (3d Cir.1995);  Saint-Gobain/Norton Indus. v.

Moreover, there was no argument or evidence that Koditek's actions in connection with the demand letter were not authorized.   The choice as to whether to make such arguments was not foreclosed to him and was a strategy choice by trial counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this a fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree situation that would require suppression of evidence or quashing the indictment.   Cf. Rogers, 751 F.2d at 1078-79.   Edgar has not convinced us that he would not have been indicted but for his attorney's testimony.   Edgar argues that the only reason the government knew that Attorney Koditek obtained the tax returns from Edgar was because of Koditek's grand jury testimony.   However, that inference was self-evident.   Further, the Koditek letter and attached returns came from Commercial Union's claim file and there was independent evidence identifying the signature on the unfiled tax returns as Edgar's.   There being no prejudice, there was no reversible error.

Had Edgar raised the Gaudin issue initially on appeal, this court would review the failure to submit materiality to the jury under the plain error test because Edgar also failed to raise the issue in the district court.   See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 631;  see also United States v.

Edgar argues that we should nonetheless review the district court's failure to submit the element of materiality to the jury for \"plain error\" just as though the issue were raised in his initial brief.   See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 631.   However, we think a higher standard must be met, and as review for \"plain error\" lies \"within the sound discretion of the Court of Appeals,\" we decline to apply that standard in the circumstances of this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  See United States v.

Edgar argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that his omissions from the forms CA-8 for which he was convicted were material.   A statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence or is capable of affecting or influencing a government function.  United States v. Arcadipane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195748\"><a href=\"/opinion/195748/united-states-v-arcadipane/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7-8 (1st Cir.1994).   Edgar argues that because the decision not to grant him benefits had already been made and because the forms were filed late, his failure to set forth his self-employment was not material.   However, the standard is not whether there was actual influence, but whether it would have a tendency to influence.   The district director for the OWCP testified that on a claim for disability, whether one may work or has worked has considerable influence on the amount of benefits warranted.   Thus, the district court did not err in finding Edgar's false statements to be material.   See id.  (affirming a finding of materiality for false statements of employment on a Form 1032).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Fair Credit Reporting Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edgar's last claim of error is that there was an abuse of discretion in the denial of his motion for discovery of the government's compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1681-1681t.   Edgar claimed to have needed this information in order to determine whether a motion to dismiss the indictment or a motion to suppress evidence was warranted.   Even assuming that the government violated the FCRA by improperly acquiring data concerning Edgar's finances, Edgar has not shown how any use of the acquired information could have prejudiced him in the grand jury to support dismissal of the indictment.   See, e.g., Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112125\"><a href=\"/opinion/112125/bank-of-nova-scotia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112125\"><a href=\"/opinion/112125/bank-of-nova-scotia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
