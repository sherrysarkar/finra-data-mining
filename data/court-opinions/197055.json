(\"Sullivan\"), appeals the decision of the\r\n\nNational  Labor  Relations  Board  (the \"NLRB\"  or  the  \"Board\")\r\n\nfinding that Sullivan  committed an unfair labor practice.  Local\r\n\n600M of the Graphic Communications International Union  (\"GCIU\"),\r\n\nAFL-CIO,  appeals the  Board's  refusal to  order  the remedy  it\r\n\nrequested.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  have  previously  addressed this  dispute  in  some\r\n\ndetail.  See Pye v. Sullivan Bros. Printers, Inc. (\"Sullivan I\"),\r                                                                        \r\n\n38  F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 1994) (affirming district court's denial of\r\n\nthe Board's  request for a preliminary  injunction requiring that\r\n\nSullivan recognize  and bargain  with Local 600M).   Accordingly,\r\n\nrather than delve into the  facts of this case, we begin  with an\r\n\noutline of the dispute, and address more specific details as they\r\n\narise.\r\n\n          For  over  three decades,  GCIU Local  109C represented\r\n\nSullivan's pressmen, and Local 139B represented  its bookbinders.\r\n\nAs  of 1990,  Sullivan's pressmen  and bookbinders  represented a\r\n\nsmall minority in each local:  \"The vast majority of  the members\r\n\nof each  local .  . . worked  at another printing  company, North\r\n\nAmerican  Directory Corporation ('NADCO').\"  Id. at 60.  By 1993,\r                                                          \r\n\nhowever, NADCO  had closed  its plant, dramatically  reducing the\r\n\nlocals' membership.  Local  109C was left with about  40 members,\r\n\nroughly  15 of whom were from Sullivan,  and Local 139B with 8 to\r\n\n10   members,    all   from   Sullivan.       Henry   Boermeester\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n(\"Boermeester\"),  president  of  Local   109C,  and  Oscar  Becht\r\n\n(\"Becht\"), president  of Local 139B, both  NADCO employees, began\r\n\nto  explore  the possibilities  of  merging  or transferring  the\r\n\nlocals.   Accordingly, in January of 1993, the Local 109C members\r\n\nvoted to  surrender  their charter  and transfer  to Local  600M,\r\n\nwhich had some 700 members.   The Local 139B members did the same\r\n\nin March.  Id. at 60-61.  \r                        \r\n\n          In July of 1993,  Local 600M formally notified Sullivan\r\n\nof the changes and  asked Sullivan to recognize and  bargain with\r\n\nit.   Local 139B's  contract with Sullivan  was due to  expire in\r\n\nAugust of 1993,  but Local  109C's was effective  through May  of\r\n\n1995.  Beginning in July, 1993, Sullivan began to take unilateral\r\n\nactions,  which Local 600M points  to as unlawfully altering some\r\n\nof the terms and conditions of employment in the bookbinders' and\r\n\npressmen's units.   Sullivan informed Local 600M in early August,\r\n\n1993, that it would not recognize Local 600M, and that it did not\r\n\nconsider itself bound by the transfer.  Id. at 62.  \r                                                     \r\n\n          Local 600M responded by filing an unfair labor practice\r\n\ncharge  with the Board. The Board issued an unfair labor practice\r\n\ncomplaint charging Sullivan with violations of the National Labor\r\n\nRelations  Act  (the  \"Act\")  for  refusing  to  bargain and  for\r\n\nunilaterally changing the terms  and conditions of employment, in\r\n\nviolation  of sections 8(a)(1)  and 8(a)(5) of  the Act.   See 29\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    158(a)(1) &amp; (a)(5).1  The Board petitioned the district\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Under   8(a) of the Act, \r\n\n          [i]t shall be an unfair labor practice for an\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncourt  for   a  temporary  injunction  requiring   that  Sullivan\r\n\nrecognize and bargain  with Local 600M and  rescinding certain of\r\n\nthe  unilateral   changes.     The  district  court   denied  the\r\n\ninjunction,  stating  that  \"'a  question  exist[ed]  as  to  the\r\n\ncontinuity of representation provided by Local 600M,'\" id. at 62,\r                                                                    \r\n\nand a panel of this court affirmed in October, 1994.2  Id.\r                                                                    \r\n\n          In the  meantime, an  administrative law judge  (\"ALJ\")\r\n\nconducted a hearing  and issued his decision in July,  1994.  The\r\n\nALJ found  that Sullivan had not violated  the Act by refusing to\r\n\nrecognize Local 600M as  the successor to 139B, but  had violated\r\n\nit by refusing to recognize Local 109C.  The NLRB, in turn, found\r\n\nthat Sullivan had violated the Act by refusing to recognize Local\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          employer --\r\n\n            (1)  to  interfere  with,   restrain,  or\r\n            coerce employees  in the exercise  of the\r\n            rights guaranteed in section 157  of this\r\n            title;\r\n            ***\r\n            (5)  to  refuse  to bargain  collectively\r\n            with    the   representatives    of   his\r\n            employees, subject to  the provisions  of\r\n            section 159(a) of this title.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.    158(a)(1) &amp; (a)(5).\r\n\n2   In Sullivan  I, we concluded  that \"the transfer  of [L]ocals\r                            \r\n139B and 109C to 600M exhibited no combination of characteristics\r\non which the Board has typically based a finding of continuity in\r\nthe past.\"   Sullivan I, 38  F.3d at 67.   We recognize that  our\r                                 \r\nholding today affirming the  Board's decision reaches a different\r\nconclusion than  in our earlier decision.   In that  case we were\r\nreviewing  an  interlocutory appeal  for  a  temporary injunction\r\npursuant to  section 10(j) of the  Act.  See 29  U.S.C.   160(j).\r                                                      \r\nSuch a proceeding is independent of the proceeding on the merits,\r\nand therefore our  decision in Sullivan  I is not binding  in the\r                                                    \r\ncontext of  this appeal.

At  heart,  its  argument  is  that the  administrative\r\n\ntransfer  of  Locals 139B  and  109C  interrupted the  collective\r\n\nbargaining   relationship,   giving   rise  to   a   question  of\r\n\nrepresentation, such that Local 600M must establish its status as\r\n\na bargaining representative through the same means that any labor\r\n\norganization  must  use  in the  first  instance.    See NLRB  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nInsulfab Plastics, Inc., 789 F.2d 961, 964-65 (1st Cir. 1986). \r                                 \r\n\n          \"The  Act  recognizes  that  employee  support  for   a\r\n\ncertified  bargaining  representative may  be  eroded by  changed\r\n\ncircumstances,\"  NLRB v.

Generally,  the Board  will look  for such  due process\r\n\nsafeguards as \"notice of the election to all members, an adequate\r\n\nopportunity for  members to discuss the  election, and reasonable\r\n\nprecautions to maintain ballot secrecy.\"  Id. at 199.

NLRB,  890 F.2d 430, 433  n.4.  For\r                                            \r\n\nthe reasons set forth below, we find it has not met that burden.4\r\n\n          Here, on the day  of the vote, Becht, the  president of\r\n\nLocal  139B, passed out  ballots to the five  or six employees on\r\n\nthe day  shift, leaving  three or  four  additional ballots  with\r\n\nanother employee for distribution  to the employees on  the night\r\n\nshift.   He informed them that  he would return the following day\r\n\nto  pick up  the ballots,  which were  collected in  an envelope.\r\n\nWhen he collected  the sealed envelope,  he found eight  ballots,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Sullivan  does not challenge the Board's adoption of the ALJ's\r\nfinding  that  the election  carried out  by  Local 109C  did not\r\nviolate the minimal due process requirement.\r\n\n4  Local 600M and the GCIU, as joint intervenors, raise the issue\r\nof whether the  imposition of voting  requirements is beyond  the\r\nBoard's  statutory power.  See Seattle-First, 475 U.S. at 199 n.6\r                                                      \r\n(declining  to reach  the  issue).   Like  the Board  before  us,\r\nhowever, we need not  address whether the NLRB has  the authority\r\nto impose due process requirements, as such requirements  have at\r\nany  rate been met  here.  See  Sullivan II, 317  N.L.R.B. at   ,\r                                                     \r\n1995 WL 318651 at *9 n.2.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nall cast in favor  of the merger.  No objection was raised by the\r\n\nmembers as to the merger vote process. \r\n\n          The Board concluded  that the  due process  requirement\r\n\nwas met in this  case.  First, it  found that Becht held  four or\r\n\nfive  informal meetings  with  the remaining  Local 139B  members\r\n\nafter  the  NADCO  closure,  informing  them  of  the  status  of\r\n\nnegotiations,  and notified them a  week before the  vote that he\r\n\nwould bring around  the ballots, a procedure consistent  with his\r\n\nestablished  practice.  Second, as for the vote itself, the Board\r\n\nrelied  on the lack of any evidence  that the election was not in\r\n\nfact accomplished  with  adequate procedural  safeguards,  noting\r\n\nthat  Becht knew  that all  of the  employees were  current union\r\n\nmembers,  that he personally distributed  the ballots to the day-\r\n\nshift employees, and that there was no evidence that the ballots'\r\n\nsecrecy was  compromised.  Third,  the Board noted  that, \"[m]ost\r\n\nimportant[ly],  there [was]  no  indication  that any  individual\r\n\nobjected  to the voting procedures or any aspect of merger either\r\n\nat the  time of the  vote or any  time subsequently, or  that the\r\n\nvote  did not  reflect  the majority  view.\"   Sullivan  II,  317\r                                                                     \r\n\nN.L.R.B. at   ,  1995 WL 318651  at *4.   Accordingly, the  Board\r\n\nconcluded that its standard of minimal due process was satisfied,\r\n\nemphasizing  again \"that this case  involves the merger of sister\r\n\nlocals and that no one objected.\"  Id. \r                                                \r\n\n          The Board accepted  Becht's testimony  about the  union\r\n\nmembership  status  of Sullivan's  employees.   In so  doing, the\r\n\nBoard  stated that, unlike the Board, the ALJ had \"questioned the\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nbasis  for  Becht's  knowledge concerning  the  union  membership\r\n\nstatus  of  the Respondent's  unit  employees  as being  'without\r\n\nfoundation.'\"   Id.  at 3  n.4.    According to  the  Board,  its\r                             \r\n\nacceptance of Becht's testimony about union  membership therefore\r\n\nran contrary to the  ALJ's conclusion.  Sullivan argues  that the\r\n\nBoard  erred  in  drawing  this conclusion.    Instead,  Sullivan\r\n\ncontends,  when  the ALJ  discussed  the  foundations of  Becht's\r\n\ntestimony he was in  fact concerned with another issue:   Becht's\r\n\ntestimony about  his \"'belief' that  someone referred to  only as\r\n\n'he'  just handed the ballots  out without checking  names off at\r\n\nnight and that the 'individual' who passed  them out at night was\r\n\nresponsible to collect them.\"   Sullivan II, 317 N.L.R.B.  at   ,\r                                                     \r\n\n1995  WL  318651  at *15.    This  purported error  proves  a red\r\n\nherring.  Contrary to Sullivan's position, the ALJ did comment on\r\n\nthe lack of foundation  for Becht's statement that the  employees\r\n\nwho voted were  all union  members, stating that  \"[h]ow he  knew\r\n\nthis is  unexplained.\"  Id.   Thus the Board's  statement was not\r                                     \r\n\ninaccurate.   What  is  more, even  if  it were  a  misstatement,\r\n\nSullivan has pointed to no grounds for us to question the Board's\r\n\nacceptance  of \"the  veteran Local 139B  officer's uncontroverted\r\n\ntestimony.\"  Id. at *9 n.4.\r                          \r\n\n          Second, Sullivan questions the  Board's reliance on the\r\n\nfact  that  when Becht  retrieved the  ballots  they were  in the\r\n\nsealed  envelope, with  no evidence  that they had  been tampered\r\n\nwith  or  their secrecy  compromised.   Sullivan argues  that the\r\n\nALJ's reasoning was more persuasive when he stated: \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          [a]lso left devoid of any informative answers\r\n          are significant questions  of who had custody\r\n          of  the   envelope  from  the  time   it  was\r\n          delivered to employees  and then returned  to\r\n          Becht at noon  the following day, if  anyone;\r\n          where it was kept, and whether any safeguards\r\n          whatsoever  reasonably protected  the secrecy\r\n          and  reliability of  the  ballots during  the\r\n          course of the day  and a half consumed before\r\n          Becht arrived and the ballots were tallied.\r\n\nId. at *15.  Sullivan maintains that the ALJ's concerns were more\r             \r\n\nprobative as to the  secrecy and integrity of the  balloting than\r\n\nwhether or  not  the ballots  were  in  a sealed  envelope.    We\r\n\ndisagree.    Simply  put, the  burden  is  on  Sullivan to  prove\r\n\nimpropriety,  and mere  assertions that  tampering  was possible,\r\n\nwithout evidentiary support  in the  record, does  not meet  that\r\n\nrequirement.   See  News/Sun Sentinel  Co.,  890 F.2d  at  433-34\r                                                    \r\n\n(\"[A]n  employer challenging  the validity  of a  merger election\r\n\nmust provide  an evidentiary  showing of irregularity  before the\r\n\nburden  can  shift  to  the   NLRB  General  Counsel  to  provide\r\n\naffirmative  proof of  procedural propriety.\").   We  cannot find\r\n\nthat the Board  applied the law  incorrectly where Sullivan  does\r\n\nnot meet its burden.  Cf. Insulfab, 789 F.2d at 965-66 (upholding\r                                            \r\n\nnear  unanimous  election  in 32-person  union  despite  informal\r\n\nprocedures).\r\n\n          Third,  Sullivan questions the  Board's reliance on the\r\n\nfact that none of the employees objected to the voting procedure,\r\n\narguing that  even minimal due process standards  require the use\r\n\nof a \"more finely calibrated analysis than whether or not someone\r\n\nbothered to  complain.\"    Appellant's  Brief, at  47.    Indeed,\r\n\nSullivan continues, that  is especially so here, because prior to\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  merger no Local 139B  member showed an  interest in becoming\r\n\nactive in the  union, indicating  that the lack  of objection  is\r\n\njust as likely to indicate apathy as approval.  We are once again\r\n\nunconvinced.   The Board did not rely  solely on the fact that no\r\n\nemployee objected:  it also found that the employees were given a\r\n\nweek's  notice of  the  election, that  they  held four  or  five\r\n\nmeetings  to discuss the change,  and that there  was no evidence\r\n\nthat  the  ballots  were   tampered  with.    While  it   is  not\r\n\ndispositive,  the fact that none of the eight employees who voted\r\n\ncomplained supports  the Board's  finding.  See,  e.g., Insulfab,\r                                                                          \r\n\n789 F.2d  961, 966 (1st  Cir. 1986)  (noting that no  one in  the\r\n\nbargaining unit opposed the results of an affiliation election in\r\n\nupholding the Board's finding of due process); Aurelia Osborn Fox\r                                                                           \r\n\nMemorial Hosp., 247 N.L.R.B. 356, 1980 WL 11045, at *5 (same).\r                        \r\n\n                    B.

The focus in  this second step is\r\n\non whether the administrative transfer \"substantially changed the\r\n\nunion.\"   Seattle-First, 475 U.S. at 199.   In making its factual\r                                 \r\n\ndetermination,  the  Board  traditionally considers  a  number of\r\n\nfactors,  including  the   union's  \"structure,   administration,\r\n\nofficers, assets,  membership,  autonomy, by-laws,  [and]  size,\"\r\n\nNLRB  v.

The burden is  again on\r              \r\n\nSullivan to prove lack of continuity.  News/Sun Sentinel Co., 890\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 315.\r\n\n          Sullivan argues that the Board incorrectly  applied the\r\n\nlaw and relied upon findings of fact not supported by substantial\r\n\nevidence  in holding  that substantial continuity  exists between\r\n\nLocals  139B and 109C and Local 600M.   We turn now to the merits\r\n\nof this claim. \r\n\n                  1.  Leadership Responsibility\r                            1.  Leadership Responsibility\r\n\n          Local 139B:   No  former Local 139B  official holds  an\r                              \r\n\nelected or appointed  position in  Local 600M.   The Board  found\r\n\nthat the only remaining Local 139B officers, President Becht  and\r\n\nJeannette Pickels, were both  offered and declined positions with\r\n\nLocal 600M  after the  merger.  The  Board also found  that Becht\r\n\nagreed  to serve on Local 600M's negotiating committee, a role he\r\n\nplayed  prior to the merger.   The Board  noted that negotiations\r\n\nwould be accomplished  by the  union's president, who  was not  a\r\n\nSullivan employee, as was true  in the past.  Thus, according  to\r\n\nthe Board, the lack of continuity in leadership was caused by the\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfree  choice  of  the  leaders  themselves,  and  there  was some\r\n\ncontinuity  in   the  form   of  Becht's  participation   on  the\r\n\nnegotiating committee.  \r\n\n          We  find that the  Board's conclusion regarding Becht's\r\n\nrole  is not supported by  substantial evidence.   Both Becht and\r\n\nthe  president of Local 600M testified that Becht had agreed that\r\n\n\"if  he was  available, he'd  be delighted  to  be there,  but he\r\n\ncouldn't  commit.\"  (Transcript  of hearing before  NLRB, Feb. 3,\r\n\n1994, p. 265).  Thus, the commitment to serve on  the negotiating\r\n\ncommittee  was tentative at best, and not the agreement the Board\r\n\ndescribes.  See  Sullivan I,  38 F.3d  at 65.   Accordingly,  the\r                                     \r\n\nBoard's conclusion that Becht \"will continue to perform  the same\r\n\nleadership role  with respect to the  [Local 600M's] negotiations\r\n\nwith Respondent,\" Sullivan II, 317 N.L.R.B. at   , 1995 WL 318651\r                                       \r\n\nat *5,  is also  without a  foundation  in substantial  evidence.\r\n\nBecht's tentative  role in  the negotiation process,  paired with\r\n\nthe  fact that no Local 139B  officer has an official position in\r\n\nLocal   600M,  precludes   finding   substantial  continuity   in\r\n\nleadership.

The ALJ noted that the former president of\r\n\nLocal 109C, Boermeester, \r\n\n          became an elected executive board  member [of\r\n          Local   600M]  on   August   5,   1993,   and\r\n          represented  the  former  Local 109C  members\r\n          employed  by Respondent  in the  dispute over\r\n          Respondent's unilateral changes  in a  401(k)\r\n          plan in  a letter sent in  his official Local\r\n          600M capacity on September  28, 1993, as well\r\n          as  demanding  bargaining over  new equipment\r\n          purchased  by  Respondent.     His  long-time\r\n          practice  of  regular  contact   with  chapel\r\n          chairmen  continued,  with  regular  contacts\r\n          between [Chapel Chairman Stephen] Wysocki and\r\n          him   over  representation   of  Respondent's\r\n          employees  and  Local 600M  President Carlsen\r\n          testified credibly that the Local denoted him\r\n          for membership on  the negotiating  committee\r\n          from  Local  600M  when  it  negotiates  with\r\n          Respondent.

The ALJ  also  noted  that  Chapel Chairman  Wysocki\r\n\nretained  the same  leadership  role that  he  had prior  to  the\r\n\nmerger,  and  that the  president  of Local  600M  testified that\r\n\nWysocki  will  be  used  as a  negotiating  committee  member  in\r\n\ncontract negotiations with Sullivan.  Finally, it found  that two\r\n\nchapel  chairmen  at  another  former Local  109C  employer  will\r\n\ncontinue in their positions under Local 600M.  \r\n\n          Sullivan  contests  the ALJ's  conclusion.    First, it\r\n\npoints  out  that  Boermeester was  the  only  former Local  109C\r\n\nofficial to hold any of the elected or appointed positions within\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nLocal  600M -- indeed, Sullivan maintains, he was the only former\r\n\nofficial who even became  a member of Local 600M.5  Sullivan also\r\n\nrelies on the testimony that Boermeester's appointment was  not a\r\n\ncondition  of the merger, that  it was not  made until the merger\r\n\nwas complete, that Boermeester  would have to win an  election to\r\n\nretain  his position,  as  it was  a  temporary  one to  fill  an\r\n\nunexpired term, and that  Boermeester represented a division that\r\n\ndid  not contain former Local  109C members.   Sullivan adds that\r\n\nBoermeester  testified that  he agreed  to participate  in future\r\n\nnegotiations only if he had time  to, and that, like Becht,  even\r\n\nin  those negotiations  in which  he participated,  he would  not\r\n\nenjoy  the  same  degree of  autonomy  and  authority  as he  had\r\n\npreviously.  See Sullivan  I, 38 F.3d at 66.  Therefore, Sullivan\r                                      \r\n\nconcludes,  Boermeester's role  cannot  be found  to satisfy  the\r\n\ncontinued leadership responsibility requirement.\r\n\n          We  found  in  Sullivan  I  that  \"Wysocki's  continued\r                                              \r\n\nstewardship and Boermeester's position on  Local 600M's executive\r\n\nboard represent  some continuity  of leadership for  their former\r\n\nlocal;   whether   they  represent   substantial   continuity  is\r\n\ndoubtful.\"  38 F.3d at 66.  Our standard of review here is fairly\r\n\ndeferential to the Board's  decision, while in Sullivan I  it was\r                                                                   \r\n\nthe district court  that received our deference.   See id. at  63\r                                                                    \r\n\n(noting that we reviewed  the court's determination of reasonable\r\n\ncause  for clear error, and the decision to deny equitable relief\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Both Boermeester and  Wysocki testified that  no one in Local\r\n109C wanted to take over running the local.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nfor  abuse of discretion).  The standard makes all the difference\r\n\nhere:    applying the  pertinent  standard,  we must  affirm  the\r\n\nBoard's finding  that there was continuity  of leadership between\r\n\nLocal  109C and Local  600M, notwithstanding Sullivan's argument.\r\n\nCf. City Wide Insulation, Inc., 307 N.L.R.B. 1,   , 1992 WL 75108\r                                        \r\n\nat  *3  (1992)  (finding  substantial  continuity  of  leadership\r\n\ndespite fact that business manager who formerly did not report to\r\n\nanyone  was  required to  report  to  secretary-treasurer of  new\r\n\ndistrict  council  and union  counsel  was  added to  negotiating\r\n\nteam).   The evidence Sullivan points to would allow a factfinder\r\n\nto  reach  conclusions  differing  from  the  Board's  --  as  we\r\n\nintimated in Sullivan  I -- but our review  of the record reveals\r                                  \r\n\nsubstantial evidence underpinning the ALJ findings adopted by the\r\n\nBoard  regarding Local 109C.  We will not substitute our judgment\r\n\nfor  the Board's,  even  if we  might  have reached  a  different\r\n\nconclusion, see  Union Builders, 68 F.3d  at 522, and so  we must\r                                         \r\n\naffirm   the   Board's   finding   in   these   circumstances.   \r\n\n         2.

Negotiation and Administration of Contracts\r\n\n                            Proposals\r                                      Proposals\r                                               \r\n\n          In terms  of contract  proposals, the practice  of both\r\n\nLocal 109C and  Local 139B was to hold informal  meetings -- at a\r\n\ndonut  shop  or on  the shop  floor --  where members  could make\r\n\nproposals.    The  by-laws  of Local  600M,  however,  state that\r\n\nsuggested contract proposals must  be submitted to the president,\r\n\nin  writing, at least  90 days prior to  contract expiration.  We\r\n\nagree  with Sullivan  that, on  its face,  this is  a substantial\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nchange.   Nonetheless, the  case law is  firm that  what we  must\r\n\nweigh is not the  rule, but the actual  practice followed.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Central Wash. Hosp., 303 N.L.R.B. at   ,  1991 WL 113265 at\r                                   \r\n\n*1.   Carlsen testified that the by-laws procedure was not always\r\n\nstrictly followed:  sometimes Local 600M would  hold meetings for\r\n\nproposals,  and sometimes  employees would  send lists  that were\r\n\ndeveloped and sent back to them for approval or modification.  On\r\n\nthis record,  the  Board concluded  that  the procedure  did  not\r\n\ndiffer dramatically, despite the by-laws provision.\r\n\n          Sullivan protests  that there was no  evidence that the\r\n\n90 day requirement  was not adhered to.   But Sullivan bears  the\r\n\nburden  here  of  demonstrating  that there  was  no  substantial\r\n\ncontinuity, and it  points to nothing in the record demonstrating\r\n\nthat the 90-day practice was adhered to, or how far ahead of time\r                                      \r\n\nthe Local 109C and  139B meetings were held.  In the  end, we are\r\n\nleft with evidence  that the  old locals  held meetings  sometime\r\n\nprior to  the contract's  expiration to collect  suggestions, and\r\n\nthat Local 600M's  practice is  to sometimes hold  meetings at  a\r\n\npoint prior to expiration, and sometimes to consider lists mailed\r\n\nin.  On this record, we find that Sullivan has not met its burden\r\n\nand that we must affirm the Board's finding on this point.\r\n\n                      Contract Negotiations\r                                Contract Negotiations\r                                                     \r\n\n          In negotiating contracts with Sullivan, the practice of\r\n\nLocal  139B was for the president and  a Sullivan employee to act\r\n\nas  the negotiators; most recently,  that had been  Becht with an\r\n\nemployee.    According  to  Carlsen's  testimony,  Local   600M's\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\npractice  would be  to  use a  committee  formed of  the  local's\r\n\npresident, plus  Becht as the former  president, Wysocki (because\r\n\nthere  was  no  chapel chair  from  former  Local  139B), and  an\r\n\nemployee,  if possible.  For Local 109C, the past practice was to\r\n\nuse  the local's president,  vice president, and  a chapel chair:\r\n\nonly  the latter  was a  Sullivan employee.   Again  according to\r\n\nCarlsen,  the  new  practice would  be  to  have  himself as  the\r\n\npresident, Boermeester as the former president, Wysocki as chapel\r\n\nchair, and perhaps an employee, serve on the committee.  \r\n\n          Sullivan argues that there is no substantial continuity\r\n\nhere, as the primary responsibility for negotiations have shifted\r\n\nfrom Becht (who will not necessarily even serve)  and Boermeester\r\n\nto Carlsen.  Nonetheless,  we agree with the Board that there has\r\n\nbeen  no  substantial  break   in  continuity.    First,  neither\r\n\nBoermeester nor  Becht were Sullivan employees to begin with, and\r\n\nso both  before and after the  administrative transfer Sullivan's\r\n\nemployees will be  represented by  a team led  by a  non-employee\r\n\npresident.     Second,  on   both  the  pre-   and  post-transfer\r\n\ncommittees,  the Sullivan  employees do not  make up  a majority.\r\n\nPrior  to  the  transfer, employees  made  up  half  of the  139B\r\n\ncommittee, and one third of the 109C committee:  assuming Carlsen\r\n\ncan find employees to  fill his designated spots, they  will make\r\n\nup one  half of both committees.   Based on this  record, we find\r\n\nthat substantial evidence supports the Board's factual finding of\r\n\nsubstantial continuity in contract negotiations.\r\n\n          Local 600M attempted to  extend the bindery contract so\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nthat the contracts  of both Locals 139B and  109C would expire on\r\n\nthe  same date,  allowing  Local 600M  to  break the  established\r\n\npractice of negotiating  the contracts  individually and  bargain\r\n\nfor both at one  time.  Sullivan contends that  this would result\r\n\nin a loss of autonomy for the locals, and so contests the Board's\r\n\nconclusion  that the attempt did not mark a significant change in\r\n\nnegotiation  of  contracts.    The  Board based  its  finding  on\r\n\nCarlsen's  testimony that he would be willing to conduct separate\r\n\nnegotiations if the employees so wished.  Without citing support,\r\n\nSullivan  maintains that  the very  fact that  joint negotiations\r\n\nwere proposed reveals the lack of substantial continuity present.\r\n\nTo the contrary, we find that Carlsen's flexibility on conducting\r\n\nseparate negotiations  indicates that  Local 600M was  willing to\r\n\ncompromise in order to maintain the continuity of representation:\r\n\nto find otherwise would  be to penalize the new  local merely for\r\n\nsuggesting changes that may,  in fact, benefit workers.   We have\r\n\nno  reason  to second-guess  the  Board's  reliance on  Carlsen's\r\n\ntestimony, and accordingly affirm its findings on this point.\r\n\n                      Contract Ratification\r                                Contract Ratification\r                                                     \r\n\n          The   Board  found   that  the   contract  ratification\r\n\nprocedures remains substantially the same.  Prior to  the merger,\r\n\nin  both  locals a  proposed  contract  was  ratified  only  when\r\n\naccepted by a majority of the bargaining unit employees voting in\r\n\na secret ballot election.  The Board found, and Sullivan does not\r\n\nseem  to  contest,  that Local  600M's  practice  of having  only\r\n\ncovered employees  vote,  by secret  ballot  if requested,  is  a\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nsubstantially similar practice.\r\n\n          Sullivan focuses instead on  the fact that, under Local\r\n\n600M,  the executive  board  has the  right  to accept  contracts\r\n\ncontrary to the  membership's vote, thereby opening up the danger\r\n\nof  the executive board accepting  a contract and  imposing it on\r\n\nthe  bargaining unit  employees even  though a majority  of those\r\n\nemployees voted to reject the  contract.  The Board did  not find\r\n\nthe change substantial, on the basis that\r\n\n            this  procedure takes  effect  only in  a\r\n            very  limited  situation,  i.e., where  a\r\n            unit  rejects a contract offer, votes not\r\n            to  strike,  and   does  not  accept  the\r\n            executive   committee's   recommendation.\r\n            Under these limited circumstances, such a\r\n            difference does not rise to the level  of\r\n            a significant change.\r\n\nSullivan  II, 317  N.L.R.B. at    ,  1995 WL  318651 at  *6.   On\r                      \r\n\nappeal, the  Board reiterates its logic that  the executive board\r\n\ncan only disregard  the employees' wishes when  they have brought\r\n\nthe  bargaining to a gridlock, an  unlikely occurrence.  Sullivan\r\n\nretorts that  employees will  frequently reject a  contract offer\r\n\nbut decide not to strike, and that  even if the use of the  power\r\n\nis  rare,  the  dramatic change  from  the  old  locals' complete\r\n\nautonomy and the lasting consequences on the employees of the use\r\n\nof   the  executive  board's   power,  represents   a  meaningful\r\n\ndiminution of local autonomy and  indicates a lack of continuity.\r\n\nSee National Posters, Inc., 289 N.L.R.B. 468,   , 1988 WL 213801,\r                                    \r\n\nat *20  (1988) (\"If . . . the  members of the Local possessed the\r\n\nauthority  before the merger, but did  not thereafter, to finally\r\n\nconsummate  their  own  bargaining   agreements,  a  question  of\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\ncontinuity of identity would be raised.\"), enforced 885 F.2d  175\r                                                             \r\n\n(4th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1026 (1990).\r                                       \r\n\n          We  disagree.

The Board  found\r\n\nthat,  as  the  executive  council's  authority  was  limited  to\r\n\noccasions  where the  membership had  rejected a strike  or other\r\n\neconomic  action, as here, the  membership did in  fact \"have the\r\n\nopportunity to voice its approval or disapproval of a final offer\r\n\nand the executive council cannot bypass the membership.\"  Id.

The Board adopted  that finding, and  concluded that, for\r\n\nLocal  139B,  the  limited  evidence before  it  demonstrated  no\r\n\nsignificant  difference in grievance  handling procedures.

As the administration was never under the control of a\r\n\nSullivan  employee, we fail to  see how this  change in personnel\r\n\namounts to a significant change, where the actual practice is the\r\n\nsame.   Second, Sullivan argues that neither of the former locals\r\n\ntransferred  its past contracts,  arbitration decisions, contract\r\n\nproposals, or grievance  resolutions, effectively undermining the\r\n\npreservation of continuity in  contract administration.  We agree\r\n\nwith  the Board that, as  any informal settlement  of a grievance\r\n\nhas   no  precedental  value,  this  is  not  a  point  of  great\r\n\nsignificance.   Indeed,  Sullivan offers  no evidence  that Local\r\n\n600M could  not, in fact,  access such records if  a need arises.\r\n\nFinally, Sullivan focuses on  the fact that, under Local  139B, a\r\n\ngrievance received  the direct attention of  President Becht, but\r\n\nunder Local 600M, an unresolved grievance was to be handled  by a\r\n\npressroom  steward, and  concludes  that Local  600M intended  to\r\n\nsystematically blur  the line  between the bindery  and pressroom\r\n\nunits.   We disagree.   Local 139B  never had a  chapel chairman,\r\n\naccording to  Becht's testimony, because he could not find anyone\r\n\nwilling  to do  the job.   In this  situation, we  agree with the\r\n\nBoard that the use  of another Sullivan employee who  is from the\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nformer Local  109C instead  of from Local  139B does  not mark  a\r\n\nsubstantial difference.\r\n\n                           Strike Votes\r                                     Strike Votes\r                                                 \r\n\n          With  respect to strike votes,  the Board found, and we\r\n\nagree, that the basic procedures of the  locals are substantially\r\n\nsimilar.  Sullivan's argument to the contrary is based on a Local\r\n\n600M by-laws provision, which allows the  executive board to call\r\n\na strike  in shops with 25  or fewer members without  holding any\r\n\nkind of  a vote.   Before doing so,  the executive board  must be\r\n\nsatisfied that  the membership and the  International support the\r\n\nstrike and that  the strike would have  no adverse effect on  the\r\n\nLocal.   The  Board  discounted  the danger  of  this  provision,\r\n\nrelying on Carlsen's  testimony that the  actual practice was  to\r\n\nhave  the  individual  shop  affected conduct  a  vote  by secret\r\n\nballot,  with  a two-thirds  majority  necessary  to authorize  a\r\n\nstrike.     Sullivan's  position  is  that   Carlsen's  testimony\r\n\nregarding Local 600M's normal policy regarding strike votes would\r\n\nnot apply here,  because Sullivan's employees fall  within the 25\r\n\nor fewer exception to the rule.  Sullivan points out that Carlsen\r\n\nnever stated  that the executive board did  not have the right to\r\n\norder a strike in such a  small shop, or that the executive board\r\n\nnever did.  \r\n\n          We  find  support for  the  Board's  conclusion in  the\r\n\nfollowing testimony by Local 600M President Carlsen:\r\n\n               JUDGE  BERNARD:  .  .  .  .   Are  you\r\n            testifying  that  in  the respects  we've\r\n            just  discussed,  the  strike  fund,  the\r\n            binding nature  of a  strike vote  by the\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\n            Local   600M,   these  remaining   shops,\r\n            including  Sullivan  . . . , the  members\r\n            there,   .  .   .  have   retained  their\r\n            autonomy?\r\n               THE WITNESS:  They have retained their\r\n            autonomy  as to  the right  to vote  on a\r\n            contract  or  take an  individual strike,\r\n            but the Local would  support them if they\r\n            voted to go on strike.\r\n               If   we   vote   to  strike   Sullivan\r\n            Brothers,  Sullivan  Brothers would  also\r\n            have the facilities of the merged fund.\r\n               JUDGE  BERNARD:   Getting down  to the\r\n            bottom  line  just  numbers  wise,  these\r\n            shops would not necessarily be able to be\r\n            outvoted or outflooded  by all the  other\r\n            shops in Local --\r\n               THE WITNESS:  No, sir, the other shops\r\n            would have nothing to do with it . . . .\r\n\n(Hearing Testimony, at 223-24).  As Sullivan noted, Carlsen never\r\n\nstated  that  the  by-law  in  question  would  not  be  applied.\r\n\nHowever,  Carlsen's statement  that the Sullivan  shops \"retained\r\n\ntheir  autonomy  as to  the right  to .  .  . take  an individual\r\n\nstrike\"  offers evidentiary  support for  the Board's  conclusion\r\n\nthat \"there is,  at most,  a minimal difference  between the  two\r\n\nlocals'  premerger  procedures   and  those  of  [Local   600M].\"\r\n\nSullivan  II, 317  N.L.R.B. at    , 1995  WL 318651  at *6.   The\r                      \r\n\nburden is on Sullivan to show that there is a lack of substantial\r\n\ncontinuity between the locals:   here, where the Board  can point\r\n\nto  evidence that the by-law at issue is not enforced, Sullivan's\r\n\nfailure  to  raise  record  evidence  disproving  that  assertion\r\n\nrequires  that we affirm  the Board's  conclusion.   Cf. Seattle-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFirst, 290  N.L.R.B. at   , 1988  WL 213911 at *5  n. 11 (holding\r               \r\n\nthat international's potential authority to impose trusteeship on\r\n\na local for failure  to obtain authorization to strike  \"does not\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\ndefeat the conclusion that in most situations decisions to strike\r\n\nremain at the local  level\").

Assets and Records\r\n\n          The  Board   found  that   Local  139B's  assets   were\r\n\ntransferred  to Local 600M  and commingled with  other funds, but\r\n\nthat  the evidence  indicated  that \"the  full  resources of  the\r\n\n[Local] are available to  the former Local 139B unit.\"   Sullivan\r                                                                           \r\n\nII, 317 N.L.R.B. at   , 1995 WL 318651 at *7.  As for Local 109C,\r            \r\n\nits  assets  were  transferred  into  the  Local  600M strike  or\r\n\nemergency  fund, with similar results.   We agree  with the Board\r\n\nthat such  commingling  is not  dispositive, and  that \"it  would\r\n\nfrustrate  a purpose of the Act to find that employee expressions\r\n\nof  desire  to  achieve  [increased  financial  support]  through\r\n\naffiliations   and   mergers   automatically   raised   questions\r\n\nconcerning representation.\"  Id.   Therefore, although there is a\r                                          \r\n\nsubstantial difference  in the locals' assets prior  to and after\r\n\nthe administrative transfer,  like the Board we  are not disposed\r\n\nto give that fact great weight.\r\n\n                  4.

The  ALJ  found a  similar  increase for  local  109C\r\n\nmembers, from $8.00 to $9.22.  No initiation fees were charged to\r\n\nmembers of either local.  Sullivan argues now  that the change to\r\n\na  sliding scale system based  on salary, plus  the difference in\r\n\nthe  dues  charged, amounts  to a  substantial  change.   We find\r\n\nnothing in its argument or the case law it relies on, however, to\r\n\nconvince  us  that  the Board's  findings  were  incorrect.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCentral Wash. Hospital, 303 N.L.R.B. at    , 1991 WL 113265 at *2\r                                \r\n\nn.8 (finding no marked change in dues despite rise from $10.42 to\r\n\n$12.50 per month).\r\n\n                     Obligations and By-laws\r                               Obligations and By-laws\r                                                      \r\n\n          The Board recognized that there is a difference between\r\n\nthe  former locals' by-laws and those of  Local 600M, in that the\r\n\nlatter set of by-laws restrict members' rights  to accept outside\r\n\nemployment.  The Board, however, citing the lack of evidence that\r\n\nLocal 600M  ever enforced the restrictions,  found no significant\r\n\nchange.    The Board  relied on  the  premise, cited  above, that\r\n\nactual practice, not policy,  controls.  See Sullivan I,  38 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  66-67.  But there was no  evidence here that the by-laws were\r\n\nnot followed on this issue:   thus, the only evidence we  find on\r\n\nthis record is  the restriction itself.  See id.  Accordingly, we\r                                                          \r\n\nfind  that Sullivan  has met  its burden  of  showing significant\r\n\nchange, and the Board's  conclusion lacks substantial evidentiary\r\n\nsupport.\r\n\n                              Voting\r                                        Voting\r                                              \r\n\n          Finally, Sullivan argues that a  fundamental difference\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nhas been made in the locals' character:  Local 109C was comprised\r\n\nexclusively of pressmen, and Local 139B of bookbinders, but Local\r\n\n600M  includes  a mix  of  different  printing industry  workers.\r\n\nSimilarly,  while the original locals were limited to the city of\r\n\nLowell and  its environs,  the territorial jurisdiction  of Local\r\n\n600M  extends throughout  eastern Massachusetts  and part  of New\r\n\nHampshire.   More importantly,  Sullivan emphasizes that  through\r\n\nthe transfer, its  employees in  Locals 139B and  109C went  from\r\n\nbeing part of locals  with 8-10 and 40 members,  respectively, to\r\n\nmembership in a  local of  over 700 people.   Sullivan  concludes\r\n\nthat such a  dramatic increase in size  would result in a  severe\r\n\ndiminution of voting strength, a factor the Board  has considered\r\n\nin finding a question  concerning representation has been raised.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Pacific Southwest  Container, Inc., 283  N.L.R.B. 79,\r                                                        \r\n\n  , 1987 WL 109286, at *2 (1987).  Sullivan notes that even where\r\n\na merger is between two locals  of the same international, as the\r\n\nadministrative  transfer is here, the  Board has found  a lack of\r\n\ncontinuity  where there  was a  similar disparity  of size.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nQuality Inn Waikiki, 297 N.L.R.B. 497,   , 1989 WL 224495, at *10\r                             \r\n\n(1989).\r\n\n          In  making  its  comparison in  substantial  continuity\r\n\ncases,  the  Board generally  looks  at  the  local  in  question\r\n\nimmediately  before the  affiliation, merger,  or transfer.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\ne.g.,  Seattle-First, 290 N.L.R.B. at    , 1988 WL  213911 at *2.\r                              \r\n\nHere, however, the Board,  without citing any authority, expanded\r\n\nthe  period in this case to include the locals' position prior to\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nNADCO's  closing.   Accordingly,  the  Board  concluded that  the\r\n\nmerger  left  the  members  of the  locals  in  their  historical\r\n\nposition:   \"a  small  segment  of a  larger  local  representing\r\n\nsimilar craft employees within the same geographic area under the\r\n\nsame  International.\"  Sullivan II,  317 N.L.R.B. at    , 1995 WL\r                                            \r\n\n318651 at *7.6  It argues again now that the proper comparison in\r\n\nterms of size is between the historic size of the locals -- about\r\n\n240  for Local 139B and  125 for Local  109C in 1990   -- and not\r\n\ntheir  size  right before  the  merger,  as membership  had  been\r\n\ndiminished  by NADCO's  closing.   Viewed from  that perspective,\r\n\nappellee  calculates,  prior  to  NADCO's  closing  employees  of\r\n\nSullivan  constituted about  seven percent  of the  membership of\r\n\neach local; now,  Sullivan's employees  are 28 of  700, or  about\r\n\nfour percent, of Local 600M.  However, we need not determine here\r\n\nwhether  the Board  erred  in considering  the pre-NADCO  closing\r\n\nfigures, for we find  that, even assuming Sullivan  can establish\r\n\nthat  there are significant differences in voting power, there is\r\n\nstill  substantial continuity  between Locals  109C and  139B and\r\n\nLocal 600M.  \r\n\n          Whether    a    merger,   transfer,    or   affiliation\r\n\nsubstantially  changes  a local  is a  question  of degree.   Our\r\n\nmeasure  of the changes here  reveals that it  falls somewhere in\r\n\nthe gray area between a  complete transformation in identity  and\r\n\nno   change  at  all.    On  balance,  while  we  recognize  that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  The  International Union's constitution permits it  to rescind\r\nor suspend the charter of any local with fewer than 50 members.\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nsignificant changes have been wrought in the locals' by-laws  and\r\n\nassets -- and, for Local 139B, in its leadership -- the weight of\r\n\nthe  factors we  have  examined leads  us  to conclude  that  the\r\n\nchanges are not  sufficiently dramatic to  alter the identity  of\r\n\nthe  bargaining representative  and  raise a  question concerning\r\n\nrepresentation.  \r\n\n          We  do not  reach  this conclusion  merely because  the\r\n\nmajority of the factors  we examined weigh in favor  of affirming\r\n\nthe  NLRB's  decision:   this  is  not a  mathematical  analysis.\r\n\nSimply put, we cannot find that  the changes here -- an  increase\r\n\nin assets, a  new local by-law restricting  outside employment, a\r\n\nchange in  leadership due to  the previous  officers' refusal  to\r\n\nstay  on,  and   a  decrease  in  immediate  voting  strength  --\r\n\nsubstantially changed the local  when it is governed by  the same\r\n\nInternational  constitution  and  by-laws, when  the  system  for\r\n\ncontract proposal,  negotiation, and ratification as  well as for\r\n\ngrievances  and strike votes is substantially the same as before,\r\n\nand  when  even  the  dues  have  stayed  essentially  the  same.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  affirm  the  Board's  finding  of   substantial\r\n\ncontinuity.\r\n\n                         II.

That  case addressed  what  remedy\r\n\napplies when  a union breaches  its duty  of fair  representation\r\n\nwith regard  to processing  an employee's  grievance.  The  Board\r\n\nheld  that once the General  Counsel meets its  initial burden of\r\n\nproving  that   the  underlying   grievance   was  \"not   clearly\r\n\nfrivolous,\"  the burden shifts to the union to establish that the\r\n\ngrievance was not meritorious.   If it cannot, the  employee will\r\n\nbe awarded back pay.  See 290  N.L.R.B. at    , 1988 WL 214001 at\r                                   \r\n\n*5.  \r\n\n          Specifically, the  Union  agrees that  if Sullivan  had\r\n\nbargained  in good faith with the Union, under Litton and Indiana\r                                                                           \r\n\n&amp;  Michigan Electric Sullivan would  not have committed an unfair\r                              \r\n\nlabor  practice  by  refusing  to  continue  in effect  the  dues\r\n\ncheckoff provision of the  expired contract.  However, the  Union\r\n\npoints  out, Sullivan did not bargain in good faith here; indeed,\r\n\nit  committed an unfair  labor practice.   Accordingly, the Union\r\n\ncontinues, under Mack-Wayne Closures, any uncertainty  created by\r                                              \r\n\nSullivan's refusal to bargain should be assessed against it.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at  *3 (noting that  forcing the  union to bear  the risk  of\r             \r\n\nuncertainty was \"in keeping with traditional equitable principles\r\n\nthat the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of any uncertainty arising\r\n\nfrom its  actions\").   Here,  the Union  posits, the  uncertainty\r\n\nconcerning  whether Sullivan  would  have agreed  to continue  in\r\n\neffect the  dues checkoff provision pending  agreement or impasse\r\n\non  a   new  contract   should  be  assessed   against  Sullivan.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nTherefore,  the Union  concludes, Sullivan  should be  ordered to\r\n\nmake  the Union whole by  remitting dues for  the bookbinder unit\r\n\nemployees for  the entire period  from the  date Sullivan  ceased\r\n\ndoing  so, with interest.  Refusal to do so, the Union maintains,\r\n\nwould reward Sullivan for its  unlawful refusal to recognize  and\r\n\nbargain with the Union.\r\n\n          The   Board  responds   that  Mack-Wayne   Closures  is\r                                                                       \r\n\ndistinguishable.   Contrary to the Union's  contention, the Board\r\n\nargues, Mack-Wayne Closures did not  rest solely on the principle\r                                     \r\n\nthat uncertainty  should be resolved against  the wrongdoer whose\r\n\nconduct created the  uncertainty.   It also rested  on two  other\r\n\nconsiderations.  First, the Board noted that \"the union obviously\r\n\n[had]  more  particular knowledge  regarding  the  merits of  the\r\n\nunderlying  grievance than  the General  Counsel,\" such  that the\r\n\ncase fell within the principle that \"the burden of establishing a\r\n\nparticular  matter will often be placed on the party with special\r\n\nknowledge regarding that matter.\"   290 N.L.R.B. at    ,  1988 WL\r\n\n214001, at  *4.  This consideration does not apply here.  Second,\r\n\nthe Board argues, Mack-Wayne  Closures also stressed \"the special\r                                                \r\n\ncharacter   of  the  grievance-arbitration   process,  where  the\r\n\nemployee is in effect 'presumed' to  be 'innocent.'\"  Id. at  *5.\r                                                                   \r\n\nIf  the  burden  were not  shifted,  the  employee  would lose  a\r\n\nprocedural and  tactical advantage, i.e., of  having the employer\r\n\nbear the burden of proof.  Id.  at *4.  The Board points out that\r                                        \r\n\nno similar loss  of rights  is demonstrable in  this case,  which\r\n\ninvolves  the denial, not  of rights under  an existing contract,\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nbut of the opportunity to negotiate a new contract.\r\n\n          The  Board notes that it  based its refusal  to issue a\r\n\nprospective order on the \"settled principle\" that such provisions\r\n\ndo  not survive the expiration of the contract, because the Labor\r\n\nManagement  Relations Act,  29 U.S.C.    186(c)(4),  permits dues\r\n\ncheckoff  arrangements  only  as   part  of  a  valid  collective\r\n\nbargaining  agreement.   See  Litton, 501  U.S. 190,  199 (1991).\r                                              \r\n\nAlso, it  points out, it cannot  order an employer to  agree to a\r\n\ncheckoff provision, even where the employer's refusal to agree to\r\n\nsuch a provision  is based on a desire to frustrate agreement and\r\n\nnot on any legitimate reason.   See H.K. Porter Co. v.  NLRB, 397\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 99,  108 (1970) (\"[A]llowing  the Board to  compel agreement\r\n\nwhen the parties themselves are unable to agree would violate the\r\n\nfundamental  premise  on  which  the  Act  is  based  --  private\r\n\nbargaining under governmental supervision of the procedure alone,\r\n\nwithout  any  official compulsion  over the  actual terms  of the\r\n\ncontract.\"). \r\n\n          Similarly, the Board maintains, the remedy for unlawful\r\n\nrepudiation  of a  contractual  checkoff provision  cannot extend\r\n\nbeyond the  expiration date of  the contract, where  the employer\r\n\nhas  not  agreed  to  a  subsequent  contract  containing such  a\r\n\nprovision.  See Ortiz  Funeral Home Corp., 250 N.L.R.B. at  731 &amp;\r                                                   \r\n\nn.6  (noting that  \"a union's  right to  dues checkoff  . .  . is\r\n\nextinguished on expiration of the collective-bargaining agreement\r\n\ncreating that right\").   The Board concludes  that nothing in the\r\n\nrecord could enable it to determine whether, or when, the parties\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\nwould  have reached agreement on  a new contract  if Sullivan had\r\n\nnot refused  to bargain.  Since the Board would be left having to\r\n\ndecide,  in essence, what the  parties should have  agreed to, it\r\n\ncontends that it properly declined to speculate.  \r\n\n          We find the Board's  reasoning persuasive.  Simply put,\r\n\nit is  too far a  reach to extrapolate the  Board's fairly narrow\r\n\nreasoning in Mack-Wayne  Closures into this  context.  See  Mack-\r                                                                           \r\n\nWayne  Closures,  290  N.L.R.B. at    ,  1988  WL  214001, at  *5\r                         \r\n\n(describing  the specific  circumstances in  which the  burden of\r\n\nproof  shifts to  the union).   The  Union has not  presented any\r\n\nauthority that would help us close that gap.  Accordingly, as the\r\n\nUnion has not shown that the Board's remedy is \"'a patent attempt\r\n\nto achieve  ends other  than those  which can  fairly be said  to\r\n\neffectuate the  policies of  the Act,'\" Pegasus  Broadcasting, 82\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 513 (quoting Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. 319 U.S. at 540),\r                                                         \r\n\nwe affirm  the Board's denial  of the  request to honor  the dues\r\n\ncheckoff provision.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          The  mere fact that a  majority of the  members of both\r\n\nLocals 109C  and 139B voted  for the administrative  transfers at\r\n\nissue  here does not, and cannot, resolve the question of whether\r\n\na question of representation has arisen.  \"In determining whether\r\n\na 'question concerning representation'  exists because of lack of\r\n\ncontinuity,  the Board  is  not directly  inquiring into  whether\r\n\nthere is majority  support for the  labor organization after  the\r\n\nchanges  at issue, but rather is seeking to determine whether the\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\nchanges are so great that a new organization has come into  being\r\n\n--  one that  should be  required to  establish its  status  as a\r\n\nbargaining representative  through the same means  that any labor\r\n\norganization  is required to use in the first instance.\"  Western\r                                                                           \r\n\nComm'l  Transp., Inc., 288 N.L.R.B.  214,   , 1988  WL 213704, *5\r                               \r\n\n(1988).

Accordingly,\r\n\nrather than delve into the  facts of this case, we begin  with an\r\n\noutline of the dispute, and address more specific details as they\r\n\narise.\r\n\n          For  over  three decades,  GCIU Local  109C represented\r\n\nSullivan's pressmen, and Local 139B represented  its bookbinders.\r\n\nAs  of 1990,  Sullivan's pressmen  and bookbinders  represented a\r\n\nsmall minority in each local:  \"The vast majority of  the members\r\n\nof each  local .  . . worked  at another printing  company, North\r\n\nAmerican  Directory Corporation ('NADCO').\"  Id. at 60.  By 1993,\r                                                          \r\n\nhowever, NADCO  had closed  its plant, dramatically  reducing the\r\n\nlocals' membership.  Local  109C was left with about  40 members,\r\n\nroughly  15 of whom were from Sullivan,  and Local 139B with 8 to\r\n\n10   members,    all   from   Sullivan.       Henry   Boermeester\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n(\"Boermeester\"),  president  of  Local   109C,  and  Oscar  Becht\r\n\n(\"Becht\"), president  of Local 139B, both  NADCO employees, began\r\n\nto  explore  the possibilities  of  merging  or transferring  the\r\n\nlocals.   Accordingly, in January of 1993, the Local 109C members\r\n\nvoted to  surrender  their charter  and transfer  to Local  600M,\r\n\nwhich had some 700 members.   The Local 139B members did the same\r\n\nin March.  Id. at 60-61.  \r                        \r\n\n          In July of 1993,  Local 600M formally notified Sullivan\r\n\nof the changes and  asked Sullivan to recognize and  bargain with\r\n\nit.   Local 139B's  contract with Sullivan  was due to  expire in\r\n\nAugust of 1993,  but Local  109C's was effective  through May  of\r\n\n1995.  Beginning in July, 1993, Sullivan began to take unilateral\r\n\nactions,  which Local 600M points  to as unlawfully altering some\r\n\nof the terms and conditions of employment in the bookbinders' and\r\n\npressmen's units.   Sullivan informed Local 600M in early August,\r\n\n1993, that it would not recognize Local 600M, and that it did not\r\n\nconsider itself bound by the transfer.  Id. at 62.  \r                                                     \r\n\n          Local 600M responded by filing an unfair labor practice\r\n\ncharge  with the Board. The Board issued an unfair labor practice\r\n\ncomplaint charging Sullivan with violations of the National Labor\r\n\nRelations  Act  (the  \"Act\")  for  refusing  to  bargain and  for\r\n\nunilaterally changing the terms  and conditions of employment, in\r\n\nviolation  of sections 8(a)(1)  and 8(a)(5) of  the Act.   See 29\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    158(a)(1) &amp; (a)(5).1  The Board petitioned the district\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Under   8(a) of the Act, \r\n\n          [i]t shall be an unfair labor practice for an\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncourt  for   a  temporary  injunction  requiring   that  Sullivan\r\n\nrecognize and bargain  with Local 600M and  rescinding certain of\r\n\nthe  unilateral   changes.     The  district  court   denied  the\r\n\ninjunction,  stating  that  \"'a  question  exist[ed]  as  to  the\r\n\ncontinuity of representation provided by Local 600M,'\" id. at 62,\r                                                                    \r\n\nand a panel of this court affirmed in October, 1994.2  Id.\r                                                                    \r\n\n          In the  meantime, an  administrative law judge  (\"ALJ\")\r\n\nconducted a hearing  and issued his decision in July,  1994.  The\r\n\nALJ found  that Sullivan had not violated  the Act by refusing to\r\n\nrecognize Local 600M as  the successor to 139B, but  had violated\r\n\nit by refusing to recognize Local 109C.  The NLRB, in turn, found\r\n\nthat Sullivan had violated the Act by refusing to recognize Local\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          employer --\r\n\n            (1)  to  interfere  with,   restrain,  or\r\n            coerce employees  in the exercise  of the\r\n            rights guaranteed in section 157  of this\r\n            title;\r\n            ***\r\n            (5)  to  refuse  to bargain  collectively\r\n            with    the   representatives    of   his\r\n            employees, subject to  the provisions  of\r\n            section 159(a) of this title.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.    158(a)(1) &amp; (a)(5).\r\n\n2   In Sullivan  I, we concluded  that \"the transfer  of [L]ocals\r                            \r\n139B and 109C to 600M exhibited no combination of characteristics\r\non which the Board has typically based a finding of continuity in\r\nthe past.\"   Sullivan I, 38  F.3d at 67.   We recognize that  our\r                                 \r\nholding today affirming the  Board's decision reaches a different\r\nconclusion than  in our earlier decision.   In that  case we were\r\nreviewing  an  interlocutory appeal  for  a  temporary injunction\r\npursuant to  section 10(j) of the  Act.

For\r                                            \r\n\nthe reasons set forth below, we find it has not met that burden.4\r\n\n          Here, on the day  of the vote, Becht, the  president of\r\n\nLocal  139B, passed out  ballots to the five  or six employees on\r\n\nthe day  shift, leaving  three or  four  additional ballots  with\r\n\nanother employee for distribution  to the employees on  the night\r\n\nshift.   He informed them that  he would return the following day\r\n\nto  pick up  the ballots,  which were  collected in  an envelope.\r\n\nWhen he collected  the sealed envelope,  he found eight  ballots,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Sullivan  does not challenge the Board's adoption of the ALJ's\r\nfinding  that  the election  carried out  by  Local 109C  did not\r\nviolate the minimal due process requirement.\r\n\n4  Local 600M and the GCIU, as joint intervenors, raise the issue\r\nof whether the  imposition of voting  requirements is beyond  the\r\nBoard's  statutory power.  See Seattle-First, 475 U.S. at 199 n.6\r                                                      \r\n(declining  to reach  the  issue).   Like  the Board  before  us,\r\nhowever, we need not  address whether the NLRB has  the authority\r\nto impose due process requirements, as such requirements  have at\r\nany  rate been met  here.  See  Sullivan II, 317  N.L.R.B. at   ,\r                                                     \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">318651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *9 n.2.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nall cast in favor  of the merger.  No objection was raised by the\r\n\nmembers as to the merger vote process. \r\n\n          The Board concluded  that the  due process  requirement\r\n\nwas met in this  case.  First, it  found that Becht held  four or\r\n\nfive  informal meetings  with  the remaining  Local 139B  members\r\n\nafter  the  NADCO  closure,  informing  them  of  the  status  of\r\n\nnegotiations,  and notified them a  week before the  vote that he\r\n\nwould bring around  the ballots, a procedure consistent  with his\r\n\nestablished  practice.  Second, as for the vote itself, the Board\r\n\nrelied  on the lack of any evidence  that the election was not in\r\n\nfact accomplished  with  adequate procedural  safeguards,  noting\r\n\nthat  Becht knew  that all  of the  employees were  current union\r\n\nmembers,  that he personally distributed  the ballots to the day-\r\n\nshift employees, and that there was no evidence that the ballots'\r\n\nsecrecy was  compromised.  Third,  the Board noted  that, \"[m]ost\r\n\nimportant[ly],  there [was]  no  indication  that any  individual\r\n\nobjected  to the voting procedures or any aspect of merger either\r\n\nat the  time of the  vote or any  time subsequently, or  that the\r\n\nvote  did not  reflect  the majority  view.\"   Sullivan  II,  317\r                                                                     \r\n\nN.L.R.B. at   ,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">318651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  at *4.   Accordingly, the  Board\r\n\nconcluded that its standard of minimal due process was satisfied,\r\n\nemphasizing  again \"that this case  involves the merger of sister\r\n\nlocals and that no one objected.\"  Id. \r                                                \r\n\n          The Board accepted  Becht's testimony  about the  union\r\n\nmembership  status  of Sullivan's  employees.   In so  doing, the\r\n\nBoard  stated that, unlike the Board, the ALJ had \"questioned the\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nbasis  for  Becht's  knowledge concerning  the  union  membership\r\n\nstatus  of  the Respondent's  unit  employees  as being  'without\r\n\nfoundation.'\"   Id.  at 3  n.4.    According to  the  Board,  its\r                             \r\n\nacceptance of Becht's testimony about union  membership therefore\r\n\nran contrary to the  ALJ's conclusion.  Sullivan argues  that the\r\n\nBoard  erred  in  drawing  this conclusion.    Instead,  Sullivan\r\n\ncontends,  when  the ALJ  discussed  the  foundations of  Becht's\r\n\ntestimony he was in  fact concerned with another issue:   Becht's\r\n\ntestimony about  his \"'belief' that  someone referred to  only as\r\n\n'he'  just handed the ballots  out without checking  names off at\r\n\nnight and that the 'individual' who passed  them out at night was\r\n\nresponsible to collect them.\"   Sullivan II, 317 N.L.R.B.  at   ,\r                                                     \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>  <span class=\"page\">318651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  at *15.    This  purported error  proves  a red\r\n\nherring.  Contrary to Sullivan's position, the ALJ did comment on\r\n\nthe lack of foundation  for Becht's statement that the  employees\r\n\nwho voted were  all union  members, stating that  \"[h]ow he  knew\r\n\nthis is  unexplained.\"  Id.   Thus the Board's  statement was not\r                                     \r\n\ninaccurate.   What  is  more, even  if  it were  a  misstatement,\r\n\nSullivan has pointed to no grounds for us to question the Board's\r\n\nacceptance  of \"the  veteran Local 139B  officer's uncontroverted\r\n\ntestimony.\"  Id. at *9 n.4.\r                          \r\n\n          Second, Sullivan questions the  Board's reliance on the\r\n\nfact  that  when Becht  retrieved the  ballots  they were  in the\r\n\nsealed  envelope, with  no evidence  that they had  been tampered\r\n\nwith  or  their secrecy  compromised.   Sullivan argues  that the\r\n\nALJ's reasoning was more persuasive when he stated: \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          [a]lso left devoid of any informative answers\r\n          are significant questions  of who had custody\r\n          of  the   envelope  from  the  time   it  was\r\n          delivered to employees  and then returned  to\r\n          Becht at noon  the following day, if  anyone;\r\n          where it was kept, and whether any safeguards\r\n          whatsoever  reasonably protected  the secrecy\r\n          and  reliability of  the  ballots during  the\r\n          course of the day  and a half consumed before\r\n          Becht arrived and the ballots were tallied.\r\n\nId. at *15.  Sullivan maintains that the ALJ's concerns were more\r             \r\n\nprobative as to the  secrecy and integrity of the  balloting than\r\n\nwhether or  not  the ballots  were  in  a sealed  envelope.    We\r\n\ndisagree.    Simply  put, the  burden  is  on  Sullivan to  prove\r\n\nimpropriety,  and mere  assertions that  tampering  was possible,\r\n\nwithout evidentiary support  in the  record, does  not meet  that\r\n\nrequirement.   See  News/Sun Sentinel  Co.,  890 F.2d  at  433-34\r                                                    \r\n\n(\"[A]n  employer challenging  the validity  of a  merger election\r\n\nmust provide  an evidentiary  showing of irregularity  before the\r\n\nburden  can  shift  to  the   NLRB  General  Counsel  to  provide\r\n\naffirmative  proof of  procedural propriety.\").   We  cannot find\r\n\nthat the Board  applied the law  incorrectly where Sullivan  does\r\n\nnot meet its burden.  Cf. Insulfab, 789 F.2d at 965-66 (upholding\r                                            \r\n\nnear  unanimous  election  in 32-person  union  despite  informal\r\n\nprocedures).\r\n\n          Third,  Sullivan questions the  Board's reliance on the\r\n\nfact that none of the employees objected to the voting procedure,\r\n\narguing that  even minimal due process standards  require the use\r\n\nof a \"more finely calibrated analysis than whether or not someone\r\n\nbothered to  complain.\"    Appellant's  Brief, at  47.    Indeed,\r\n\nSullivan continues, that  is especially so here, because prior to\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  merger no Local 139B  member showed an  interest in becoming\r\n\nactive in the  union, indicating  that the lack  of objection  is\r\n\njust as likely to indicate apathy as approval.  We are once again\r\n\nunconvinced.   The Board did not rely  solely on the fact that no\r\n\nemployee objected:  it also found that the employees were given a\r\n\nweek's  notice of  the  election, that  they  held four  or  five\r\n\nmeetings  to discuss the change,  and that there  was no evidence\r\n\nthat  the  ballots  were   tampered  with.    While  it   is  not\r\n\ndispositive,  the fact that none of the eight employees who voted\r\n\ncomplained supports  the Board's  finding.  See,  e.g., Insulfab,\r                                                                          \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469365\"><a href=\"/opinion/469365/national-labor-relations-board-v-insulfab-plastics-inc-new-england/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 966 (1st  Cir. 1986)  (noting that no  one in  the\r\n\nbargaining unit opposed the results of an affiliation election in\r\n\nupholding the Board's finding of due process); Aurelia Osborn Fox\r                                                                           \r\n\nMemorial Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">11045</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (same).\r                        \r\n\n                    B.

The burden is  again on\r              \r\n\nSullivan to prove lack of continuity.

We turn now to the merits\r\n\nof this claim. \r\n\n                  1.  Leadership Responsibility\r                            1.  Leadership Responsibility\r\n\n          Local 139B:   No  former Local 139B  official holds  an\r                              \r\n\nelected or appointed  position in  Local 600M.   The Board  found\r\n\nthat the only remaining Local 139B officers, President Becht  and\r\n\nJeannette Pickels, were both  offered and declined positions with\r\n\nLocal 600M  after the  merger.  The  Board also found  that Becht\r\n\nagreed  to serve on Local 600M's negotiating committee, a role he\r\n\nplayed  prior to the merger.   The Board  noted that negotiations\r\n\nwould be accomplished  by the  union's president, who  was not  a\r\n\nSullivan employee, as was true  in the past.  Thus, according  to\r\n\nthe Board, the lack of continuity in leadership was caused by the\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfree  choice  of  the  leaders  themselves,  and  there  was some\r\n\ncontinuity  in   the  form   of  Becht's  participation   on  the\r\n\nnegotiating committee.  \r\n\n          We  find that the  Board's conclusion regarding Becht's\r\n\nrole  is not supported by  substantial evidence.   Both Becht and\r\n\nthe  president of Local 600M testified that Becht had agreed that\r\n\n\"if  he was  available, he'd  be delighted  to  be there,  but he\r\n\ncouldn't  commit.\"  (Transcript  of hearing before  NLRB, Feb. 3,\r\n\n1994, p. 265).  Thus, the commitment to serve on  the negotiating\r\n\ncommittee  was tentative at best, and not the agreement the Board\r\n\ndescribes.  See  Sullivan I,  38 F.3d  at 65.   Accordingly,  the\r                                     \r\n\nBoard's conclusion that Becht \"will continue to perform  the same\r\n\nleadership role  with respect to the  [Local 600M's] negotiations\r\n\nwith Respondent,\" Sullivan II, 317 N.L.R.B. at   , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">318651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r                                       \r\n\nat *5,  is also  without a  foundation  in substantial  evidence.\r\n\nBecht's tentative  role in  the negotiation process,  paired with\r\n\nthe  fact that no Local 139B  officer has an official position in\r\n\nLocal   600M,  precludes   finding   substantial  continuity   in\r\n\nleadership.

The ALJ noted that the former president of\r\n\nLocal 109C, Boermeester, \r\n\n          became an elected executive board  member [of\r\n          Local   600M]  on   August   5,   1993,   and\r\n          represented  the  former  Local 109C  members\r\n          employed  by Respondent  in the  dispute over\r\n          Respondent's unilateral changes  in a  401(k)\r\n          plan in  a letter sent in  his official Local\r\n          600M capacity on September  28, 1993, as well\r\n          as  demanding  bargaining over  new equipment\r\n          purchased  by  Respondent.     His  long-time\r\n          practice  of  regular  contact   with  chapel\r\n          chairmen  continued,  with  regular  contacts\r\n          between [Chapel Chairman Stephen] Wysocki and\r\n          him   over  representation   of  Respondent's\r\n          employees  and  Local 600M  President Carlsen\r\n          testified credibly that the Local denoted him\r\n          for membership on  the negotiating  committee\r\n          from  Local  600M  when  it  negotiates  with\r\n          Respondent.

The ALJ  also  noted  that  Chapel Chairman  Wysocki\r\n\nretained  the same  leadership  role that  he  had prior  to  the\r\n\nmerger,  and  that the  president  of Local  600M  testified that\r\n\nWysocki  will  be  used  as a  negotiating  committee  member  in\r\n\ncontract negotiations with Sullivan.  Finally, it found  that two\r\n\nchapel  chairmen  at  another  former Local  109C  employer  will\r\n\ncontinue in their positions under Local 600M.  \r\n\n          Sullivan  contests  the ALJ's  conclusion.    First, it\r\n\npoints  out  that  Boermeester was  the  only  former Local  109C\r\n\nofficial to hold any of the elected or appointed positions within\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nLocal  600M -- indeed, Sullivan maintains, he was the only former\r\n\nofficial who even became  a member of Local 600M.5  Sullivan also\r\n\nrelies on the testimony that Boermeester's appointment was  not a\r\n\ncondition  of the merger, that  it was not  made until the merger\r\n\nwas complete, that Boermeester  would have to win an  election to\r\n\nretain  his position,  as  it was  a  temporary  one to  fill  an\r\n\nunexpired term, and that  Boermeester represented a division that\r\n\ndid  not contain former Local  109C members.   Sullivan adds that\r\n\nBoermeester  testified that  he agreed  to participate  in future\r\n\nnegotiations only if he had time  to, and that, like Becht,  even\r\n\nin  those negotiations  in which  he participated,  he would  not\r\n\nenjoy  the  same  degree of  autonomy  and  authority  as he  had\r\n\npreviously.  See Sullivan  I, 38 F.3d at 66.  Therefore, Sullivan\r                                      \r\n\nconcludes,  Boermeester's role  cannot  be found  to satisfy  the\r\n\ncontinued leadership responsibility requirement.\r\n\n          We  found  in  Sullivan  I  that  \"Wysocki's  continued\r                                              \r\n\nstewardship and Boermeester's position on  Local 600M's executive\r\n\nboard represent  some continuity  of leadership for  their former\r\n\nlocal;   whether   they  represent   substantial   continuity  is\r\n\ndoubtful.\"  38 F.3d at 66.  Our standard of review here is fairly\r\n\ndeferential to the Board's  decision, while in Sullivan I  it was\r                                                                   \r\n\nthe district court  that received our deference.   See id. at  63\r                                                                    \r\n\n(noting that we reviewed  the court's determination of reasonable\r\n\ncause  for clear error, and the decision to deny equitable relief\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Both Boermeester and  Wysocki testified that  no one in Local\r\n109C wanted to take over running the local.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nfor  abuse of discretion).  The standard makes all the difference\r\n\nhere:    applying the  pertinent  standard,  we must  affirm  the\r\n\nBoard's finding  that there was continuity  of leadership between\r\n\nLocal  109C and Local  600M, notwithstanding Sullivan's argument.\r\n\nCf.

The evidence Sullivan points to would allow a factfinder\r\n\nto  reach  conclusions  differing  from  the  Board's  --  as  we\r\n\nintimated in Sullivan  I -- but our review  of the record reveals\r                                  \r\n\nsubstantial evidence underpinning the ALJ findings adopted by the\r\n\nBoard  regarding Local 109C.  We will not substitute our judgment\r\n\nfor  the Board's,  even  if we  might  have reached  a  different\r\n\nconclusion, see  Union Builders, 68 F.3d  at 522, and so  we must\r                                         \r\n\naffirm   the   Board's   finding   in   these   circumstances.   \r\n\n         2.

The  by-laws  of Local  600M,  however,  state that\r\n\nsuggested contract proposals must  be submitted to the president,\r\n\nin  writing, at least  90 days prior to  contract expiration.  We\r\n\nagree  with Sullivan  that, on  its face,  this is  a substantial\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nchange.   Nonetheless, the  case law is  firm that  what we  must\r\n\nweigh is not the  rule, but the actual  practice followed.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Central Wash.

Carlsen testified that the by-laws procedure was not always\r\n\nstrictly followed:  sometimes Local 600M would  hold meetings for\r\n\nproposals,  and sometimes  employees would  send lists  that were\r\n\ndeveloped and sent back to them for approval or modification.  On\r\n\nthis record,  the  Board concluded  that  the procedure  did  not\r\n\ndiffer dramatically, despite the by-laws provision.\r\n\n          Sullivan protests  that there was no  evidence that the\r\n\n90 day requirement  was not adhered to.   But Sullivan bears  the\r\n\nburden  here  of  demonstrating  that there  was  no  substantial\r\n\ncontinuity, and it  points to nothing in the record demonstrating\r\n\nthat the 90-day practice was adhered to, or how far ahead of time\r                                      \r\n\nthe Local 109C and  139B meetings were held.  In the  end, we are\r\n\nleft with evidence  that the  old locals  held meetings  sometime\r\n\nprior to  the contract's  expiration to collect  suggestions, and\r\n\nthat Local 600M's  practice is  to sometimes hold  meetings at  a\r\n\npoint prior to expiration, and sometimes to consider lists mailed\r\n\nin.  On this record, we find that Sullivan has not met its burden\r\n\nand that we must affirm the Board's finding on this point.\r\n\n                      Contract Negotiations\r                                Contract Negotiations\r                                                     \r\n\n          In negotiating contracts with Sullivan, the practice of\r\n\nLocal  139B was for the president and  a Sullivan employee to act\r\n\nas  the negotiators; most recently,  that had been  Becht with an\r\n\nemployee.    According  to  Carlsen's  testimony,  Local   600M's\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\npractice  would be  to  use a  committee  formed of  the  local's\r\n\npresident, plus  Becht as the former  president, Wysocki (because\r\n\nthere  was  no  chapel chair  from  former  Local  139B), and  an\r\n\nemployee,  if possible.  For Local 109C, the past practice was to\r\n\nuse  the local's president,  vice president, and  a chapel chair:\r\n\nonly  the latter  was a  Sullivan employee.   Again  according to\r\n\nCarlsen,  the  new  practice would  be  to  have  himself as  the\r\n\npresident, Boermeester as the former president, Wysocki as chapel\r\n\nchair, and perhaps an employee, serve on the committee.  \r\n\n          Sullivan argues that there is no substantial continuity\r\n\nhere, as the primary responsibility for negotiations have shifted\r\n\nfrom Becht (who will not necessarily even serve)  and Boermeester\r\n\nto Carlsen.  Nonetheless,  we agree with the Board that there has\r\n\nbeen  no  substantial  break   in  continuity.    First,  neither\r\n\nBoermeester nor  Becht were Sullivan employees to begin with, and\r\n\nso both  before and after the  administrative transfer Sullivan's\r\n\nemployees will be  represented by  a team led  by a  non-employee\r\n\npresident.     Second,  on   both  the  pre-   and  post-transfer\r\n\ncommittees,  the Sullivan  employees do not  make up  a majority.\r\n\nPrior  to  the  transfer, employees  made  up  half  of the  139B\r\n\ncommittee, and one third of the 109C committee:  assuming Carlsen\r\n\ncan find employees to  fill his designated spots, they  will make\r\n\nup one  half of both committees.   Based on this  record, we find\r\n\nthat substantial evidence supports the Board's factual finding of\r\n\nsubstantial continuity in contract negotiations.\r\n\n          Local 600M attempted to  extend the bindery contract so\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nthat the contracts  of both Locals 139B and  109C would expire on\r\n\nthe  same date,  allowing  Local 600M  to  break the  established\r\n\npractice of negotiating  the contracts  individually and  bargain\r\n\nfor both at one  time.  Sullivan contends that  this would result\r\n\nin a loss of autonomy for the locals, and so contests the Board's\r\n\nconclusion  that the attempt did not mark a significant change in\r\n\nnegotiation  of  contracts.    The  Board based  its  finding  on\r\n\nCarlsen's  testimony that he would be willing to conduct separate\r\n\nnegotiations if the employees so wished.  Without citing support,\r\n\nSullivan  maintains that  the very  fact that  joint negotiations\r\n\nwere proposed reveals the lack of substantial continuity present.\r\n\nTo the contrary, we find that Carlsen's flexibility on conducting\r\n\nseparate negotiations  indicates that  Local 600M was  willing to\r\n\ncompromise in order to maintain the continuity of representation:\r\n\nto find otherwise would  be to penalize the new  local merely for\r\n\nsuggesting changes that may,  in fact, benefit workers.   We have\r\n\nno  reason  to second-guess  the  Board's  reliance on  Carlsen's\r\n\ntestimony, and accordingly affirm its findings on this point.\r\n\n                      Contract Ratification\r                                Contract Ratification\r                                                     \r\n\n          The   Board  found   that  the   contract  ratification\r\n\nprocedures remains substantially the same.  Prior to  the merger,\r\n\nin  both  locals a  proposed  contract  was  ratified  only  when\r\n\naccepted by a majority of the bargaining unit employees voting in\r\n\na secret ballot election.  The Board found, and Sullivan does not\r\n\nseem  to  contest,  that Local  600M's  practice  of having  only\r\n\ncovered employees  vote,  by secret  ballot  if requested,  is  a\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nsubstantially similar practice.\r\n\n          Sullivan focuses instead on  the fact that, under Local\r\n\n600M,  the executive  board  has the  right  to accept  contracts\r\n\ncontrary to the  membership's vote, thereby opening up the danger\r\n\nof  the executive board accepting  a contract and  imposing it on\r\n\nthe  bargaining unit  employees even  though a majority  of those\r\n\nemployees voted to reject the  contract.  The Board did  not find\r\n\nthe change substantial, on the basis that\r\n\n            this  procedure takes  effect  only in  a\r\n            very  limited  situation,  i.e., where  a\r\n            unit  rejects a contract offer, votes not\r\n            to  strike,  and   does  not  accept  the\r\n            executive   committee's   recommendation.\r\n            Under these limited circumstances, such a\r\n            difference does not rise to the level  of\r\n            a significant change.\r\n\nSullivan  II, 317  N.L.R.B. at    ,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>  <span class=\"page\">318651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at  *6.   On\r                      \r\n\nappeal, the  Board reiterates its logic that  the executive board\r\n\ncan only disregard  the employees' wishes when  they have brought\r\n\nthe  bargaining to a gridlock, an  unlikely occurrence.

There, as  here, the former  practice required\r\n\nratification  of a  new  contract by  the  membership, but  after\r\n\nmerger the new executive  council could accept or reject  a final\r\n\ncontract  offer without  membership  approval.   The Board  found\r\n\nthat,  as  the  executive  council's  authority  was  limited  to\r\n\noccasions  where the  membership had  rejected a strike  or other\r\n\neconomic  action, as here, the  membership did in  fact \"have the\r\n\nopportunity to voice its approval or disapproval of a final offer\r\n\nand the executive council cannot bypass the membership.\"  Id.  We\r                                                                       \r\n\naccordingly affirm the Board's finding on this issue.\r\n\n                            Grievances\r                                      Grievances\r                                                \r\n\n          The  ALJ  found,  without comment,  that  the grievance\r\n\nhandling procedures for  Local 600M  were the same  as for  Local\r\n\n109C.   The Board adopted  that finding, and  concluded that, for\r\n\nLocal  139B,  the  limited  evidence before  it  demonstrated  no\r\n\nsignificant  difference in grievance  handling procedures.   Both\r\n\nbefore and after the  transfer, the president of the  Local would\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nhave the  authority to resolve grievances once  attempts to solve\r\n\nthe problem informally at the shop level were unsuccessful.\r\n\n          Sullivan  challenges  these   findings  on  two  bases.\r\n\nFirst, Sullivan notes day-to-day administration had formerly been\r\n\nthe responsibility of a Lowell-area  union official, and now  the\r\n\nadministration  would  be  undertaken  by  Boston-area  President\r\n\nCarlsen.   As the administration was never under the control of a\r\n\nSullivan  employee, we fail to  see how this  change in personnel\r\n\namounts to a significant change, where the actual practice is the\r\n\nsame.   Second, Sullivan argues that neither of the former locals\r\n\ntransferred  its past contracts,  arbitration decisions, contract\r\n\nproposals, or grievance  resolutions, effectively undermining the\r\n\npreservation of continuity in  contract administration.  We agree\r\n\nwith  the Board that, as  any informal settlement  of a grievance\r\n\nhas   no  precedental  value,  this  is  not  a  point  of  great\r\n\nsignificance.   Indeed,  Sullivan offers  no evidence  that Local\r\n\n600M could  not, in fact,  access such records if  a need arises.\r\n\nFinally, Sullivan focuses on  the fact that, under Local  139B, a\r\n\ngrievance received  the direct attention of  President Becht, but\r\n\nunder Local 600M, an unresolved grievance was to be handled  by a\r\n\npressroom  steward, and  concludes  that Local  600M intended  to\r\n\nsystematically blur  the line  between the bindery  and pressroom\r\n\nunits.   We disagree.   Local 139B  never had a  chapel chairman,\r\n\naccording to  Becht's testimony, because he could not find anyone\r\n\nwilling  to do  the job.   In this  situation, we  agree with the\r\n\nBoard that the use  of another Sullivan employee who  is from the\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nformer Local  109C instead  of from Local  139B does  not mark  a\r\n\nsubstantial difference.\r\n\n                           Strike Votes\r                                     Strike Votes\r                                                 \r\n\n          With  respect to strike votes,  the Board found, and we\r\n\nagree, that the basic procedures of the  locals are substantially\r\n\nsimilar.  Sullivan's argument to the contrary is based on a Local\r\n\n600M by-laws provision, which allows the  executive board to call\r\n\na strike  in shops with 25  or fewer members without  holding any\r\n\nkind of  a vote.   Before doing so,  the executive board  must be\r\n\nsatisfied that  the membership and the  International support the\r\n\nstrike and that  the strike would have  no adverse effect on  the\r\n\nLocal.   The  Board  discounted  the danger  of  this  provision,\r\n\nrelying on Carlsen's  testimony that the  actual practice was  to\r\n\nhave  the  individual  shop  affected conduct  a  vote  by secret\r\n\nballot,  with  a two-thirds  majority  necessary  to authorize  a\r\n\nstrike.     Sullivan's  position  is  that   Carlsen's  testimony\r\n\nregarding Local 600M's normal policy regarding strike votes would\r\n\nnot apply here,  because Sullivan's employees fall  within the 25\r\n\nor fewer exception to the rule.  Sullivan points out that Carlsen\r\n\nnever stated  that the executive board did  not have the right to\r\n\norder a strike in such a  small shop, or that the executive board\r\n\nnever did.  \r\n\n          We  find  support for  the  Board's  conclusion in  the\r\n\nfollowing testimony by Local 600M President Carlsen:\r\n\n               JUDGE  BERNARD:  .  .  .  .

As Sullivan noted, Carlsen never\r\n\nstated  that  the  by-law  in  question  would  not  be  applied.\r\n\nHowever,  Carlsen's statement  that the Sullivan  shops \"retained\r\n\ntheir  autonomy  as to  the right  to .  .  . take  an individual\r\n\nstrike\"  offers evidentiary  support for  the Board's  conclusion\r\n\nthat \"there is,  at most,  a minimal difference  between the  two\r\n\nlocals'  premerger  procedures   and  those  of  [Local   600M].\"\r\n\nSullivan  II, 317  N.L.R.B. at    , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">318651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  at *6.

The  ALJ  found a  similar  increase for  local  109C\r\n\nmembers, from $8.00 to $9.22.  No initiation fees were charged to\r\n\nmembers of either local.  Sullivan argues now  that the change to\r\n\na  sliding scale system based  on salary, plus  the difference in\r\n\nthe  dues  charged, amounts  to a  substantial  change.   We find\r\n\nnothing in its argument or the case law it relies on, however, to\r\n\nconvince  us  that  the Board's  findings  were  incorrect.

The Board, however, citing the lack of evidence that\r\n\nLocal 600M  ever enforced the restrictions,  found no significant\r\n\nchange.    The Board  relied on  the  premise, cited  above, that\r\n\nactual practice, not policy,  controls.  See Sullivan I,  38 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  66-67.  But there was no  evidence here that the by-laws were\r\n\nnot followed on this issue:   thus, the only evidence we  find on\r\n\nthis record is  the restriction itself.  See id.

More importantly,  Sullivan emphasizes that  through\r\n\nthe transfer, its  employees in  Locals 139B and  109C went  from\r\n\nbeing part of locals  with 8-10 and 40 members,  respectively, to\r\n\nmembership in a  local of  over 700 people.   Sullivan  concludes\r\n\nthat such a  dramatic increase in size  would result in a  severe\r\n\ndiminution of voting strength, a factor the Board  has considered\r\n\nin finding a question  concerning representation has been raised.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Pacific Southwest  Container, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                        \r\n\n  , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">109286</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (1987).

Viewed from  that perspective,\r\n\nappellee  calculates,  prior  to  NADCO's  closing  employees  of\r\n\nSullivan  constituted about  seven percent  of the  membership of\r\n\neach local; now,  Sullivan's employees  are 28 of  700, or  about\r\n\nfour percent, of Local 600M.  However, we need not determine here\r\n\nwhether  the Board  erred  in considering  the pre-NADCO  closing\r\n\nfigures, for we find  that, even assuming Sullivan  can establish\r\n\nthat  there are significant differences in voting power, there is\r\n\nstill  substantial continuity  between Locals  109C and  139B and\r\n\nLocal 600M.  \r\n\n          Whether    a    merger,   transfer,    or   affiliation\r\n\nsubstantially  changes  a local  is a  question  of degree.   Our\r\n\nmeasure  of the changes here  reveals that it  falls somewhere in\r\n\nthe gray area between a  complete transformation in identity  and\r\n\nno   change  at  all.

However, the  Union\r\n\npoints  out, Sullivan did not bargain in good faith here; indeed,\r\n\nit  committed an unfair  labor practice.   Accordingly, the Union\r\n\ncontinues, under Mack-Wayne Closures, any uncertainty  created by\r                                              \r\n\nSullivan's refusal to bargain should be assessed against it.

See Ortiz  Funeral Home Corp., 250 N.L.R.B. at  731 &amp;\r                                                   \r\n\nn.6  (noting that  \"a union's  right to  dues checkoff  . .  . is\r\n\nextinguished on expiration of the collective-bargaining agreement\r\n\ncreating that right\").   The Board concludes  that nothing in the\r\n\nrecord could enable it to determine whether, or when, the parties\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\nwould  have reached agreement on  a new contract  if Sullivan had\r\n\nnot refused  to bargain.  Since the Board would be left having to\r\n\ndecide,  in essence, what the  parties should have  agreed to, it\r\n\ncontends that it properly declined to speculate.  \r\n\n          We find the Board's  reasoning persuasive.  Simply put,\r\n\nit is  too far a  reach to extrapolate the  Board's fairly narrow\r\n\nreasoning in Mack-Wayne  Closures into this  context.
