MALAVE, ET AL.,\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n      [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Mario Perez Santos on brief pro se.\n     Robert J. Sanchez Ramos, Solicitor General, Vanessa Lugo\nFlores, Deputy Solicitor General, and Sigfredo Rodriguez-Isaac,\nAssistant Solicitor General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                      November 28, 2001\n\f           Per Curiam. Mario Pérez-Santos appeals pro se from\n\nthe   district   court’s    denial   of    his    motion   for   default\n\njudgment   against   Jose    A.   Malavé    and     dismissal    of   the\n\ncomplaint. Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(c) provides, in relevant part,\n\nthat “[f]or good cause shown the court may set aside an\n\nentry of default.”    “After an entry of default, a court may\n\nexamine a plaintiff’s complaint to determine whether it\n\nalleges a cause of action.        In making that determination it\n\nmust assume that all well pleaded factual allegations are\n\ntrue.” Quirindongo Pacheco v. Rolon Morales, 953 F.2d 15, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).   Review of the district court’s dismissal of\n\nthe complaint is de novo. See Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez,\n\n212 F.3d 617, 621 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           The district court did not err in dismissing Pérez’\n\nclaims against Malavé and co-defendant Víctor Fajardo under\n\nthe Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a.                The private right of\n\naction created by § 552a(g) of the Privacy Act is limited to\n\nactions against agencies of the federal government and does\n\nnot apply to state agencies or individuals. See Dittman v.\n\nCalifornia, 191 F.3d 1020, 1026 (9th Cir. 1999); Polchowski\n\nv. Gorris, 714 F.2d 749, 752 (7th Cir. 1983); Wren v. Harris,\n\n675 F.2d 1144, 1148 n.8 (10th Cir. 1982).              Therefore, the\n\fPrivacy Act did not create a private right of action against\n\nMalavé and Fajardo in their personal or official capacities.\n\n            Pérez referred in his complaint to the violation\n\nof   his   rights   under   the   Fourth   Amendment,    without   any\n\nexplanation of how those rights were violated.             On appeal,\n\nhe stated that the district court erred in dismissing his\n\nFourth Amendment claim, but again did not make any developed\n\nargument in support of that statement.                 Therefore, the\n\nargument is waived. See Aponte Melendez v. Ortiz Otero, 964\n\nF.2d 1225, 1226 n.1 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that “[a]lthough\n\nappellant’s    brief   on    appeal     once   again   makes   cursory\n\nreference to a first amendment claim, the claim is supported\n\nby no ‘developed argumentation.’           Accordingly, we deem it\n\nwaived”).\n\n            The district court judgment denying Pérez’ motion\n\nfor default judgment and dismissing the complaint (without\n\nprejudice to the Puerto Rico law claims being brought in the\n\nPuerto Rico courts) is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f-4-\n\f",
