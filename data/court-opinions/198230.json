Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Nilda M. Navarro-Cabrer and Navarro-Cabrer &amp; Cruz-Martino on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n\nDecember 4, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Third-party defendant, the Council on\r\nHigher Education of Puerto Rico (\"CHE\"), appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's denial of summary judgment on the ground of\r\nEleventh Amendment immunity.  \"[P]retrial orders granting or\r\ndenying Eleventh Amendment immunity [are] immediately\r\nappealable.\" Metcalf &amp; Eddy v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer\r\nAuthority, 991 F.2d 935, 937 (1st Cir. 1993).  Where, as in\r\nthis case, the Eleventh Amendment issue is essentially one of\r\nlaw, this court affords plenary review to the district court's\r\ndenial of immunity. Id. at 938.\r\n          To aid in determining whether a state-created entity,\r\nsuch as CHE, is an \"arm of the state\" entitled to Eleventh\r\nAmendment immunity, this court has identified a list of factors\r\nto be considered. See Metcalf &amp; Eddy, 991 F.2d at 939-40. \r\nApplied to CHE, those factors weigh heavily in favor of\r\nimmunity.  CHE lacks authority to generate revenue and relies\r\non the Commonwealth treasury for its funding (it may also\r\naccept federal educational funds).  It is, therefore, unable to\r\nsatisfy judgments against it from its own resources except as\r\nfunds for that purpose are legislatively provided.  Compare id.at 942. CHE's powers - licensing and accrediting public and\r\nprivate universities as a condition to their legal right to\r\noperate within the commonwealth, coupled with its enforcement\r\npowers, such as the power to issue cease and desist orders and\r\nimpose fines - are more governmental than proprietary. SeePuerto Rico Ports Authority v. M/V Manhattan Prince, 897 F.2d\r\n1, 12 (1st Cir. 1990)(ruling that PRASA's functions of setting\r\nand enforcing standards is governmental, not proprietary).  The\r\nstatute creating CHE gives it \"only such powers that are\r\nindispensable to exercise official functions in an area vested\r\nwith great public interest such as higher education.\" 18\r\nL.P.R.A. 852.\r\n          CHE is not separately incorporated. Compare Metcalf\r\n&amp; Eddy, 991 F.2d at 942 (noting that PRASA is separately\r\nincorporated in ruling that it is not an arm of the\r\nCommonwealth); Royal Caribbean Corp. v. Puerto Rico Ports\r\nAuthority, 973 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1992) (weighing factor that\r\nPorts Authority is a \"public corporation\" in ruling that it is\r\nnot an arm of the Commonwealth).  Nor has the Commonwealth\r\n\"explicitly insulated itself from any financial responsibility\"\r\nwith respect to CHE. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, 991 F.2d at 940.  The\r\nCommonwealth exercises substantial control over CHE in that CHE\r\nmembers are appointed by the Governor with the advice and\r\nconsent of the senate.  The Commonwealth's Secretary of\r\nEducation serves as an ex-officio member of the Board.  This\r\ncourt has weighed such factors heavily in finding that an\r\nentity is an arm of the Commonwealth. See In re San Juan Dupont\r\nPlaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 888 F.2d 940, 943 (1st Cir. 1989);\r\nCulebras Enterprises Corp. v. Rivera Rios, 813 F.2d 506, 517\r\n(1st Cir. 1987); Perez v. Rodriguez Bou, 575 F.2d 21, 25 (1st\r\nCir. 1978).\r\n          The only factors that weigh against immunity are\r\nCHE's powers to sue and be sued and to contract.  Those factors\r\nalone, however, are not sufficient to support the district\r\ncourt's denial of immunity.  See University of Rhode Island v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 2 F.3d 1200, 1207 n.11; Culebras\r\nEnterprises Corp., 813 F.2d at 517.  We conclude that the\r\ndistrict court erred when it ruled that CHE was not an arm of\r\nthe Commonwealth for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\r\n          The district court's denial of CHE's motion for\r\nsummary judgment and request for dismissal of all claims\r\nagainst it on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds is reversed.\r\nThe case is remanded to the district court with instructions to\r\ndismiss the third-party complaint against CHE.   \r\n\n        cc: Mr. Baella-Silva, Ms. Rodriguez-Mora, \r\n         Ms. Maldonado-Colon, Ms. Navarro-Cabrer\n",
