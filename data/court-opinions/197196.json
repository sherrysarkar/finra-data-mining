We have carefully  reviewed the record  on\r                           \r\n\nappeal and the briefs of the parties.  Assuming, in appellant\r\n\nGeorge  Moran's favor, that he has filed a timely appeal, we,\r\n\nnonetheless, conclude that the appeal has no merit.\r\n\n     The  district  court  neither   erred  nor  abused   its\r\n\ndiscretion in construing Moran's self-styled \"motion to amend\r\n\nan  amended judgment in a  criminal case\" as  a motion, filed\r\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255, to vacate, set aside or correct\r\n\nhis  sentence.  Neither did  the district court  err or abuse\r\n\nits  discretion  in  denying  Moran's  motion  for   default.\r\n\nMoran's contention  that the  government's response to  his  \r\n\n2255 motion was late is unsupported in the record and, in any\r\n\nevent,  contrary  to Moran's  supposition,  even  if it  were\r\n\ntardy,  Moran  is not  thereby  automatically  entitled to  a\r\n\nruling on his   2255 motion in his favor.\r\n\n     As  for the substance of the   2255 motion, the district\r\n\ncourt correctly  concluded that, in  this collateral  attack,\r\n\nMoran may  not relitigate issues already  raised and rejected\r\n\nin  his direct appeal and, to the  extent that Moran seeks to\r\n\nraise  new issues, they could have been, but were not, raised\r\n\nin that direct appeal.\r\n\n     In any event, Moran's complaint about the time frame  of\r\n\nthe conspiracy, to  the extent  it is not  foreclosed by  our\r\n\nopinion in his direct appeal, see United States v. Moran, 984\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  1299 (1st  Cir. 1993),  is simply  factually erroneous.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nContrary to Moran's  apparent present  understanding, he  was\r\n\nnot  charged  with conspiring  with  Paul  Callahan, who  was\r\n\njailed  in   October  1988;  rather,  he   was  charged  with\r\n\nconspiring  with Hobart  Willis (the alleged  ringleader) and\r\n\nothers and that  conspiracy was alleged to  have lasted until\r\n\nJune 12, 1990.\r\n\n     Moran's remaining appellate arguments are foreclosed not\r\n\nonly  by circuit precedent,  see United States  v. Lindia, 82\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 1154,  1161 (1st Cir. 1996), but also circuit precedent,\r\n\nthe  holding  of which  was recently  favorably cited  by the\r\n\nSupreme Court, see  United States  v. Watts, 117  S. Ct.  633\r                                                       \r\n\n(1997) (per  curiam), citing  United States v.  Mocciola, 891\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 13,  16-17 (1st  Cir.  1989).   Finally, the  government\r\n\ncorrectly points  out that  the amount of  cocaine underlying\r\n\nthe counts on which Moran was acquitted played no dispositive\r\n\nrole in the  ultimate sentence imposed.   His offense  level,\r\n\nand  his sentence, was determined  by his status  as a career\r\n\noffender.\r\n\n     The  \"motion  for  reassignment of  appellate  panel\" is\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied.\r                   \r\n\n     The orders of the district  court denying the motion for\r                                                                         \r\n\ndefault and the   2255 motion are Affirmed.\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
