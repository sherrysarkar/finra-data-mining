In 1936, Rhode Island created a\r\nretirement system for state employees, school teachers, and other\r\nemployees of cities and towns that chose to participate. R.I. Gen.\r\nLaws  36-8-1 to 36-10-39.  The retirement system is administered\r\nby the Retirement Board (\"the Board\"), which is chaired by the\r\nstate treasurer.  R.I. Gen. Laws  36-8-4, 36-8-9.  The retirement\r\nsystem is a \"defined benefit plan\" in which benefits are determined\r\nnot by the amount contributed during service but by a schedule of\r\nbenefits that specifies the amount to be paid.\r\nAt present, benefits under the Rhode Island statute are\r\nset as a percentage of the average of the employee's salary earned\r\nduring the three highest consecutive years of earnings, multiplied\r\nby the number of years of credited service.  R.I. Gen. Laws  36-\r\n10-10.  An employee may retire and begin receiving payments at any\r\nage after 28 years of service or after reaching age 60 and\r\ncompleting 10 years of service.  Id.  36-10-9.  Employees\r\ncontribute a fixed percentage of annual earnings to the retirement\r\nsystem, but the state pays the balance needed to provide the\r\nscheduled benefit.  Id.  36-10-2.\r\nIn the 1980s, teachers' unions in Rhode Island sought\r\nlegislation to allow employees of unions representing state\r\nemployees including teachers to participate in the state retirement\r\nsystem; these union employees are not, at least in that capacity,\r\npublic employees.  Thus, the statute needed to be amended to permit\r\nthem to receive benefits.  In early 1987, a bill embodying such a\r\nproposal was introduced and placed on the legislature's consent\r\ncalendar; and it was passed on the final day of the session without\r\ndebate and apparently without much public notice.\r\nThe new provision, codified at R.I. Gen. Laws  36-9-33, \r\nnot only allowed union employees to join the retirement system, but\r\nalso permitted them to purchase credit, on payment of a modest\r\namount to the system, for all years previously served with the\r\nunion.  This allowed the union employee to treat all prior years\r\nof employment by the union as years of public service needed to\r\nqualify for state pension benefits and to treat earnings from the\r\nunion as if they were public compensation for purposes of computing\r\nthe \"highest three (3) consecutive years\" average.  Id.  36-10-10.\r\nFurthermore, the provision allowed union employees to\r\nreceive pension benefits based on salaries over which the state had\r\nno control.  Because the retirement system calculates benefits\r\nbased on the average of the three highest consecutive years' salary\r\n(multiplied by a factor based on years of service), the union could\r\nraise salaries for pension-qualifying union employees and thereby\r\nboost their pension benefits from the state retirement system.  The\r\nrecord reflects significant increases in union employee salaries\r\nfollowing the passage of section 36-9-33.\r\nThe effect, as more fully described below, was to allow \r\na number of highly paid union officials to qualify for state\r\npensions almost immediately in amounts greatly in excess of their\r\ncontributions to the system.  The pensions were in addition to, not\r\nin place of, whatever pensions were provided by the union.  The\r\ndistrict court later calculated the plaintiffs' total contribution\r\nto the Retirement System at $1,995,784, the present value of their\r\nprojected pension benefits at about $11,430,579, and an average\r\nprojected rate of return for the individual plaintiffs of\r\napproximately 1250 percent.\r\nWhen the situation became widely known, the legislature\r\nrepealed section 36-9-33 in toto on June 9, 1988.  See 1988 R.I.\r\nPub. Laws ch. 486 (\"the Repeal Act\").  At that time, applications\r\nby union employees were pending before the Board, which had\r\ndeclined to process them.  Despite the repeal, two teachers' unions\r\nfiled suit in October 1988 and later succeeded in persuading a\r\nstate court judge that the repeal was prospective only and did not\r\npermit the Board to exclude union employees who had sought to\r\nbecome members and purchase credits prior to the repeal.  See RIFTv. Retirement Sys., No. PC 88-4974 (R.I. Sup. Ct. Dec. 21, 1989).\r\nAs a result, qualified union employees then entered the\r\nretirement system, some retiring fairly soon after.  Bernard\r\nSingleton, for example, became a member of the Retirement System\r\neffective January 1, 1990 (as did other individual plaintiffs) and\r\npromptly purchased roughly 25 years of service credit for his prior\r\nunion employment at a cost of $25,411.09.  On July 28, 1990,\r\nseveral months later, at age 52, he took \"early retirement\" and\r\nimmediately began to collect a pension of approximately $53,000 per\r\nyear, with an expected lifetime benefit of about $750,000.\r\nIn July 1994, the legislature responded by \"evicting\" the\r\nunion employees.  See 1994 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 413,  1, codified at\r\nR.I. Gen. Laws  36-9.1-l et seq. (\"the Eviction Act\").  The new\r\nstatute, which sparked the present litigation, terminated pensions\r\nfor union employees who had entered under the now repealed statute. \r\nIt provided for return of their contributions, with interest,\r\nreduced by any benefits they had received.  Id.  The Eviction Act\r\nstated that inclusion of union employees had \"no rational\r\nrelationship to any legitimate governmental purpose\" and would\r\ninvade the corpus in violation of the requirements of the Internal\r\nRevenue Code.  Id.  36-9.1-1.\r\nTwo teachers' unions and 22 present or former union\r\nemployees then brought the present suit in the district court in\r\nJuly 1994 against the Board, its chairperson, and its executive\r\ndirector.  The plaintiffs alleged that the Eviction Act violated\r\nthe Contract, Takings and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution,\r\nsee U.S. Const. art. I,  10, cl. 1; id. amend. V; id. amend. XIV,\r\nand that under 42 U.S.C.  1983, they were entitled to declaratory\r\nrelief, an injunction, restoration of any benefits wrongly\r\nwithheld, and attorney's fees.  \r\nThe district court denied the defendants' motion to\r\ndismiss.  See National Educ. Ass'n-R.I. v. Retirement Bd., 890 F.\r\nSupp. 1143, 1165 (D.R.I. 1995) (\"NEA I\").  Following discovery and\r\ncross motions for summary judgment, the district court decided the\r\nheart of the case in a detailed and lucid opinion on August 7,\r\n1997.  See National Educ. Ass'n-R.I. v. Retirement Bd. of R.I.\r\nEmployees' Retirement Sys., 972 F. Supp. 100 (D.R.I. 1997) (\"NEA\r\nII\").  The decision resolved all legal issues but reserved for\r\nlater disposition a few factual questions as to the status of three\r\nindividual plaintiffs.\r\nIn a nutshell, the district court ruled that the Takings\r\nClause protected the benefits of two groups of plaintiffs: those\r\nwho were eligible to retire and had retired by the date of the\r\nEviction Act (July 15, 1994), and those who were eligible to retire\r\nbut were still working as of that date.  Three other plaintiffs\r\nwho were still working and were not eligible for retirement at the\r\ndate of the Eviction Act were held not protected by the Takings\r\nClause or by the Contract Clause or by substantive due process\r\nconcepts.  See id. at 114-15.\r\nGiven these legal rulings, the parties then stipulated as\r\nto the status of two of the other remaining plaintiffs--one was\r\neligible to retire and therefore protected and the other was not--\r\nleaving only one plaintiff (DeOrsey) whose status was contested. \r\nIn April 1998, the district court conducted a bench trial and ruled\r\nthat DeOrsey had never been eligible to join the retirement system. \r\nThereafter, the district court entered a final judgment in favor of\r\nthe eligible plaintiffs and against the ineligible ones.  The\r\ndefendants now appeal from the first part of the judgment, and the\r\nineligible plaintiffs, together with DeOrsey, from the second.\r\nOn appeal, our review is de novo as to the legal issues\r\nresolved on summary judgment, see Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d\r\n28, 34 (1st Cir. 1998), and for clear error as to the factual\r\nissues resolved at DeOrsey's bench trial.  See Williams v. Poulas,\r\n11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir. 1993).  We begin with the plaintiffs'\r\nContract Clause claims, if only because most of the precedent\r\naddresses such cases under this rubric.  The claims raise  a\r\ndifficult set of issues that were expressly reserved in this\r\ncourt's leading decision in McGrath v. Rhode Island Retirement\r\nBoard, 88 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 1996), further complicated by the\r\nsomewhat eccentric facts of this case.\r\nPension plans come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but\r\nthe typical plan contemplates  a stream of payments to be received\r\nby the employee starting upon retirement; both the terms and the\r\npayment formula are normally stated in the plan.  In defined\r\nbenefit plans, such as that of Rhode Island, the employee may be\r\nrequired to contribute during employment; but much of the payout is\r\ncontributed by the employer, often funded in advance at least in\r\npart.  See generally 1 J. Mamorsky, Employee Benefits Law:  ERISA\r\nand Beyond  1.01-1.05, at 1-2 to 1-25 (1998).\r\nAlthough such plans may be negotiated as explicit\r\ncontracts (e.g., as part of a collective bargaining agreement),\r\nquite often they are simply \"plans.\"  The plans may or may not have\r\nlanguage binding the employer not to change them (at least in\r\ncertain circumstances) or reserving its right to do so (at least in\r\ncertain circumstances).  Often, such plans have \"vesting\"\r\nprovisions, but strictly speaking such provisions usually \r\ndescribe how the existing plan operates and not whether the plan\r\nitself can be altered unilaterally by the employer.  \"Vesting\" and\r\n\"contractual\" are not synonymous.\r\nIn McGrath, this court surveyed the case law and\r\nconcluded that with respect to private pension plans, the courts\r\nwere divided, but that a substantial body of case law treats such\r\nplans as implied contracts, protecting at least those whose rights\r\nhave \"vested.\"  McGrath, 88 F.3d at 16-17.  The theory is that the\r\nplan is an offer and the employee, by working for many years\r\npursuant to the plan, has relied on and accepted the offer, which\r\ncannot now be changed unilaterally as to a vested employee, whether\r\nstill working or retired.  Id. at 17.  Of course, the plan may\r\nstill explicitly reserve rights to alter vested benefits.\r\nThe case law concerning public-employee pensions is  less\r\nsettled.  Some courts, including this one, have been quite hesitant\r\nto infer a contract where the state pension statute neither speaks\r\nin the language of contract nor explicitly precludes amendment of\r\nthe plan.  See, e.g., Parker, 123 F.3d at 5-6.  After all,\r\nlegislatures regularly modify compensation schedules and benefit\r\nprograms.  Supreme Court precedent has tended to treat government\r\npension statutes as similarly subject to modification for payments\r\nnot yet made, unless the government's intent to create a contract\r\nis clear and definite.  See, e.g., Dodge v. Board of Educ., 302\r\nU.S. 74, 78-79 (1937).\r\nThus, \r\nabsent some clear indication that the\r\nlegislature intends to bind itself\r\ncontractually, the presumption is that 'a law\r\nis not intended to create private contractual\r\nor vested rights but merely declares a policy\r\nto be pursued until the legislature shall\r\nordain otherwise.'  Dodge v. Board of Educ.,\r\n302 U.S. 74, 79 (1937). . . . [T]he principal\r\nfunction of a legislature is not to make\r\ncontracts, but to make laws that establish the\r\npolicy of the state. . . .  Policies, unlike\r\ncontracts, are inherently subject to revision\r\nand repeal, and to construe laws as contracts\r\nwhen the obligation is not clearly and\r\nunequivocally expressed would be to limit\r\ndrastically the essential powers of a\r\nlegislative body.\r\n\nNational R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchinson, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry.\r\nCo., 470 U.S. 451, 465-66 (1985) (emphasis added).\r\nAlthough National Railroad involved a claim that federal\r\nstatute created contractual rights, the Dodge case cited by the\r\nCourt with approval in National Railroad involved a state pension\r\nstatute for teachers; and in Dodge the Court explicitly held that\r\na reduction in pensions for already retired teachers did not\r\nviolate the Contract Clause.  See Dodge, 302 U.S. at 81.  More\r\nrecently, the Supreme Court allowed a statutory reduction in\r\nrailroad worker pensions for some \"vested\" workers, noting that\r\n\"railroad benefits, like social security benefits, are not\r\ncontractual and may be altered . . . .\"  United States R.R.\r\nRetirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 173 (1980) (citations\r\nomitted).\r\nThe clear statement requirement for \"legislative\"\r\ncontracts has been regularly imposed by the Supreme Court and\r\nfollowed by this court.  The policy reasons for protecting\r\nlegislative power against implied surrender are too obvious to\r\nwarrant much elaboration, see National Railroad, 470 U.S. at 466;\r\nMcGrath, 88 F.3d at 19, and it is easy enough for a statute\r\nexplicitly to authorize a contract or to say explicitly that the\r\nbenefits are contractual promises, or that any changes will not\r\napply to a specific class of beneficiaries (e.g., those who have\r\nretired), cf. Parker, 123 F.3d at 8-9.\r\nWe do not think that the Rhode Island general pension\r\nstatute \"clearly and unequivocally\" contracts for future benefits\r\neither by language or--in the circumstances of this case--through\r\nthe nature of the relationship.  Nowhere does the statute call the\r\npension plan a \"contract\" or contain an anti-retroactivity clause\r\nas to future changes.  Compare Brand, 303 U.S. at 105.  The closest\r\nthat the statute comes is a provision headed \"Guaranty by state--\r\nAnnual appropriations\" which provides, inter alia, that \r\nit is the intention of the state to make\r\npayment of the annuities, benefits, and\r\nretirement allowances provided for under the\r\nprovisions of this chapter and . . . to make\r\nthe appropriations required by the state to\r\nmeet its obligations to the extent provided in\r\nthis chapter.  The general assembly shall make\r\nannual appropriations which shall be\r\nsufficient to provide for the payment of\r\nannuities, benefits, and retirement allowances\r\nrequired of the state under this chapter.\r\nR.I. Gen. Laws  36-10-7.  This certainly directs state officials\r\nto fund the plan as it exists.  But it falls at least a step short\r\nof clearly expressing a contractual commitment not to change\r\nbenefit levels or other plan variables by legislation.  CompareParker, 123 F.3d at 8-9.\r\nNor we do think that references in the statute to\r\n\"vesting\" create a contract.  Often, and clearly so in Rhode\r\nIsland's statute, \"vesting\" refers to the period provided by a plan\r\nfor which an employee must work to become eligible for a pension if\r\nand when he attains retirement age.  See note 1, above.  Whether a\r\nplan affords contractual protections against a change in its terms\r\nis a different question.  A plan may not protect \"vested\" employees\r\nagainst change, see Fritz, 449 U.S. at 169 n.3, 173-74, or\r\nalternatively may provide some contractual protection even for\r\nunvested employees (e.g., against a change in the vesting period),\r\ncf. State of Nevada Employees Ass'n, Inc. v. Keating, 903 F.2d\r\n1223, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 1990).  \r\nIf one turns from language to circumstances, see United\r\nStates Trust, 431 U.S. at 17 n.14, it is true that today private\r\npensions are often conceived and crafted more as deferred\r\ncompensation than as gifts.  See Parker, 123 F.3d at 6-8; McGrath,\r\n88 F.3d at 16-19.  But pensions can still be created (and\r\nwithdrawn) without contract; this was just what the Supreme Court\r\nfound as to railroad retirement benefits in Fritz itself.  SeeFritz, 449 U.S. at 174; see also Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.S.\r\n572, 575 (1979).  Further, Rhode Island's general pension plan was\r\ncreated in 1936 when the view of pensions taken in Dodge was quite\r\nwidespread.\r\nRhode Island case law points in both directions.  The\r\nstate supreme court has implied that under state law pensions\r\ncannot be freely terminated; but it has also allowed cut-offs (of,\r\nfor example, a faithless judge) not easily reconciled with a strict\r\ncontract theory.  See In re Almeida, 611 A.2d 1375 (R.I. 1992).  In\r\nall events, whether a contract exists for Contract Clause purposes\r\nis a federal question.  See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503\r\nU.S. 181, 187 (1992).\r\nThe existence of an employer-employee relationship does\r\nweigh in favor of finding an implied contract, as the non-\r\ngovernmental pension cases make clear.  See McGrath, 88 F.3d at 17\r\n(summarizing case law).  However, the force of this consideration\r\nis very much muted in this case:  these particular plaintiffs do\r\nnot have the benefit of a clear and longstanding employer-employee\r\nrelationship with the government--they are far from the\r\nquintessential 10 or 28-years-of-service government employees.\r\nWe decline to decide now whether this last consideration\r\nwould tip the balance if, for example, Rhode Island took a meat axe\r\nto the pensions of long-time state employees.  In many states,\r\nthere are express limitations on such changes; and in general,\r\npolitical constraints make them unlikely (but not impossible). \r\nIn all events, the clear statement rule is binding unless and until\r\naltered by the Supreme Court, see State Oil Co. v. Khan, 118 S. Ct.\r\n275, 284 (1997); and the conundrum of a \"statutory\" contract that\r\nmay meet this requirement by clear implication rather than clear\r\nlanguage is an issue happily deferred.\r\nWe turn now to the basis given by the district court for\r\ngranting relief, namely, that the future payments constituted a\r\nproperty right that could not be infringed without payment of\r\ncompensation to retirees or employees eligible to retire.  In\r\nMcGrath, we explicitly reserved decision on this issue, seeMcGrath, 88 F.3d at 20 n.9, finding that the pension expectancies\r\nat issue had not even vested at the time that they were modified by\r\nthe legislature.  Here, the issue can no longer be fully postponed.\r\nThe Fifth Amendment forbids the federal government from \r\ntaking \"property\" for public use without just compensation, and\r\nthis limitation has been extended to the states through the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  See Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.\r\nBeckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 160 (1980).  What constitutes \"property\"\r\nfor this purpose is  a recurring issue to which no mechanical\r\nanswer has been found.  The concept includes more than tangible\r\nproperty owned outright, see United States v. Willow River Power\r\nCo., 324 U.S. 499, 502-03 (1945), and has been extended to\r\nmaterialmen's liens, see Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40,\r\n44 (1960), and trade secrets protected under state law, seeRuckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1003-04 (1984).\r\nBut the Supreme Court has also made clear that protection\r\nunder the Takings Clause does not extend to mere \"unilateral\r\nexpectation[s],\" even if they are entirely plausible expectations\r\nof economic benefit.  Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, 449 U.S. at 161;\r\ncf. Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 118 S. Ct. 2131, 2161-63 (1998)\r\n(Breyer, J., dissenting).  Thus, the Supreme Court has excluded\r\nfrom the \"property\" rubric riparian rights recognized under state\r\nlaw, railroad pensions, and future social service benefits.  Willow\r\nRiver, 324 U.S. at 502-03 (riparian rights); Hisquierdo, 439 U.S.\r\nat 575 (railroad pensions); Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 608-\r\n611 (1960) (social security).  This is so even though expectations\r\nare sometimes afforded procedural protection, see, e.g., Goldbergv. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), and protection from wholly arbitrary\r\naction, see Fritz, 449 U.S. at 172.  See R. Rotunda &amp; J. Nowak, 2\r\nConstitutional Law:  Substance and Procedure  15.12, at 485 n.4,\r\n17.5, at 626 (2d ed. 1992).\r\nIn the present case, the Takings Clause does, or arguably\r\ndoes, to some extent protect some interests of plaintiffs under the\r\npension plan.  Pension payments actually made to retirees become\r\ntheir property and are protected against takings, even if and where\r\nthe payments are unquestionably a gift.  Similarly, anything that\r\nthe employee contributed, directly or by purchase of benefits, may\r\nwell be regarded as the employee's property.  Under the Rhode\r\nIsland plan, contributions are returned with interest even to a\r\nnon-vested employee who leaves the state's employment.  See R.I.\r\nGen. Laws  36-10-8.  However, the Eviction Act did not purport to\r\nreclaim any benefits actually paid, and it provided for the return\r\nof any member contributions, with interest, to the extent that they\r\nexceeded already paid-out benefits.  See R.I. Gen. Laws  36-9.1-\r\n2(a), (b).\r\nThus, the question for us is whether, apart from what has\r\nbeen paid in by the member or already paid out by the state, the\r\nprospective payments of the state's share of the defined benefits\r\nare currently \"property\" of the plaintiffs under the Takings\r\nClause.  If there were a contractual right to such payment, that\r\nright itself would be property for the purposes of the Takings\r\nClause.  See United States Trust, 431 U.S. at 11 n.16.  But in this\r\ncase we have already said that the state's prospective payments,\r\nover and above the members' contributions, are not contractually\r\nobligated under the Contract Clause--at least as to \"last minute\"\r\nentrants such as the plaintiffs.\r\nIn Hoffman, we concluded that \"[n]oncontractual employee\r\nbenefits that a recipient has not yet received, but has a mere\r\nexpectation of receiving, are not property as to which the\r\ngovernment, before repealing, must provide just compensation.\" \r\nHoffman, 909 F.2d at 616.  There we denied a contract clause claim\r\nbecause a pension statute did not clearly indicate an intent to\r\nbind the legislature contractually, see id. at 614, and then denied\r\na takings claim because there was no enforceable contract right,\r\nsee id. at 616; cf. Fritz, 449 U.S. at 174.  That decision is\r\ncontrolling here.\r\nThis position is virtually compelled by Supreme Court\r\ncases that, after finding that an expected statutory benefit did\r\nnot constitute a contract right, rejected the claim to payment. \r\nSee, e.g., National Railroad, 470 U.S. at 466-67, 478-79; Flemming,\r\n363 U.S. at 610-11; Dodge, 302 U.S. at 78-81.  It would make\r\nnonsense of such rulings--and the clear intent requirement--to\r\nconclude that an expectancy insufficient to constitute an\r\nenforceable contract against the state could simply be renamed\r\n\"property\" and enforced as a promise through the back door under\r\nthe Takings Clause.  \r\nThis brings us to the final constitutional attack on the \r\nEviction Act:  the claim that it violates \"substantive\" due\r\nprocess.  An expectation that is not \"property\" for purposes of the\r\nTakings Clause may yet sometimes entitle the citizen to procedural\r\nprotection, and substantive protection against arbitrariness,\r\nbefore the expectation is cut off by government action.  SeeFlemming, 363 U.S. at 610-11; Hoffman, 909 F.2d at 618.  The\r\nplaintiffs' claim here is to substantive protection (no procedural\r\nrights have been denied), but the due process standard in economic\r\nmatters is one of minimum rationality.  See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn\r\nMining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 17 (1976); Hoffman, 909 F.2d at 618.\r\nWhen Congress curtailed pension rights of certain vested\r\nrailroad employees to prevent windfall benefits, it made fairly\r\nmechanical judgments about who should be grandfathered into double\r\npensions and who should not, and the Supreme Court upheld those\r\njudgments.  See Fritz, 449 U.S. at 174, 179-80.  Similarly, we only\r\nrecently upheld against such an attack certain distinctions made by\r\nCongress in social security payments to limit duplicative recovery,\r\neven while recognizing that the restrictions involved some fairly\r\ngross distinctions that could hardly be described as perfect\r\njustice.  See Splude v. Apfel, 165 F.3d 85, 92 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nHere, the class of persons who have been \"evicted\" are\r\nindividuals who were never public employees--at least in the\r\ncapacity for which the state pensions are sought--and were\r\npermitted to enter the system at bargain-basement prices while\r\nretaining their pensions as union employees.  The discrepancies\r\nbetween what they contributed as a class and what they might expect\r\nin pensions was striking.  And almost at once, they were warned of\r\nlegislative efforts to undo their unusual benefits.  The first such\r\nattempt (the Repeal Act) was frustrated in state court, but the\r\nEviction Act followed hard on its heels.\r\nAt argument, plaintiffs' counsel pointed out that the\r\nlegislature has in the past given special pension benefits to\r\nfavored groups, allowing (for example) veterans to \"purchase\" years\r\nof credit.  Cf. McGrath, 88 F.3d at 13 (describing R.I. Gen. Laws \r\n45-21-9, 45-21-53).  But especially in economic regulation, the\r\nquestion is not whether the legislature has dealt perfectly with\r\nall possible problems but whether its choice in this instance was\r\nrational.  See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. Gray &amp; Co.,\r\n467 U.S. 717, 730 (1984); Fritz, 449 U.S. at 176-77; Hoffman, 909\r\nF.2d at 618.  Here, the choice to evict this group of members,\r\nreturning to them their contributions with interest, is not so\r\npatently arbitrary, irrational, or unrelated to a legitimate\r\nlegislative purpose as to constitute a violation of substantive due\r\nprocess.\r\nOur resolution makes it unnecessary to discuss whether\r\nthe additional plaintiffs, to whom the district court denied\r\nrelief, were \"eligible\" or bona fide members of the plan.  It\r\nreserves, once again, the very difficult case of the long-time\r\nvested or eligible employee whose benefits might be curtailed.  And\r\nit leaves it open to Rhode Island and its employees to address such\r\nmatters by explicit legislation or ordinary contract, the course\r\nbest suited to achieve certainty on both sides.\r\nThe decision of the district court is vacated and the\r\nmatter is remanded for entry of a judgment dismissing the\r\ncomplaint.\r\nIt is so ordered.\r\n",

In 1936, Rhode Island created a\r\nretirement system for state employees, school teachers, and other\r\nemployees of cities and towns that chose to participate. R.I. Gen.\r\nLaws  36-8-1 to 36-10-39.  The retirement system is administered\r\nby the Retirement Board (\"the Board\"), which is chaired by the\r\nstate treasurer.  R.I. Gen. Laws  36-8-4, 36-8-9.  The retirement\r\nsystem is a \"defined benefit plan\" in which benefits are determined\r\nnot by the amount contributed during service but by a schedule of\r\nbenefits that specifies the amount to be paid.\r\nAt present, benefits under the Rhode Island statute are\r\nset as a percentage of the average of the employee's salary earned\r\nduring the three highest consecutive years of earnings, multiplied\r\nby the number of years of credited service.  R.I. Gen. Laws  36-\r\n10-10.  An employee may retire and begin receiving payments at any\r\nage after 28 years of service or after reaching age 60 and\r\ncompleting 10 years of service.  Id.  36-10-9.  Employees\r\ncontribute a fixed percentage of annual earnings to the retirement\r\nsystem, but the state pays the balance needed to provide the\r\nscheduled benefit.  Id.  36-10-2.\r\nIn the 1980s, teachers' unions in Rhode Island sought\r\nlegislation to allow employees of unions representing state\r\nemployees including teachers to participate in the state retirement\r\nsystem; these union employees are not, at least in that capacity,\r\npublic employees.  Thus, the statute needed to be amended to permit\r\nthem to receive benefits.  In early 1987, a bill embodying such a\r\nproposal was introduced and placed on the legislature's consent\r\ncalendar; and it was passed on the final day of the session without\r\ndebate and apparently without much public notice.\r\nThe new provision, codified at R.I. Gen. Laws  36-9-33, \r\nnot only allowed union employees to join the retirement system, but\r\nalso permitted them to purchase credit, on payment of a modest\r\namount to the system, for all years previously served with the\r\nunion.  This allowed the union employee to treat all prior years\r\nof employment by the union as years of public service needed to\r\nqualify for state pension benefits and to treat earnings from the\r\nunion as if they were public compensation for purposes of computing\r\nthe \"highest three (3) consecutive years\" average.  Id.  36-10-10.\r\nFurthermore, the provision allowed union employees to\r\nreceive pension benefits based on salaries over which the state had\r\nno control.  Because the retirement system calculates benefits\r\nbased on the average of the three highest consecutive years' salary\r\n(multiplied by a factor based on years of service), the union could\r\nraise salaries for pension-qualifying union employees and thereby\r\nboost their pension benefits from the state retirement system.  The\r\nrecord reflects significant increases in union employee salaries\r\nfollowing the passage of section 36-9-33.\r\nThe effect, as more fully described below, was to allow \r\na number of highly paid union officials to qualify for state\r\npensions almost immediately in amounts greatly in excess of their\r\ncontributions to the system.  The pensions were in addition to, not\r\nin place of, whatever pensions were provided by the union.  The\r\ndistrict court later calculated the plaintiffs' total contribution\r\nto the Retirement System at $1,995,784, the present value of their\r\nprojected pension benefits at about $11,430,579, and an average\r\nprojected rate of return for the individual plaintiffs of\r\napproximately 1250 percent.\r\nWhen the situation became widely known, the legislature\r\nrepealed section 36-9-33 in toto on June 9, 1988.  See 1988 R.I.\r\nPub. Laws ch. 486 (\"the Repeal Act\").  At that time, applications\r\nby union employees were pending before the Board, which had\r\ndeclined to process them.  Despite the repeal, two teachers' unions\r\nfiled suit in October 1988 and later succeeded in persuading a\r\nstate court judge that the repeal was prospective only and did not\r\npermit the Board to exclude union employees who had sought to\r\nbecome members and purchase credits prior to the repeal.  See RIFTv. Retirement Sys., No. PC 88-4974 (R.I. Sup. Ct. Dec. 21, 1989).\r\nAs a result, qualified union employees then entered the\r\nretirement system, some retiring fairly soon after.  Bernard\r\nSingleton, for example, became a member of the Retirement System\r\neffective January 1, 1990 (as did other individual plaintiffs) and\r\npromptly purchased roughly 25 years of service credit for his prior\r\nunion employment at a cost of $25,411.09.  On July 28, 1990,\r\nseveral months later, at age 52, he took \"early retirement\" and\r\nimmediately began to collect a pension of approximately $53,000 per\r\nyear, with an expected lifetime benefit of about $750,000.\r\nIn July 1994, the legislature responded by \"evicting\" the\r\nunion employees.  See 1994 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 413,  1, codified at\r\nR.I. Gen. Laws  36-9.1-l et seq. (\"the Eviction Act\").  The new\r\nstatute, which sparked the present litigation, terminated pensions\r\nfor union employees who had entered under the now repealed statute. \r\nIt provided for return of their contributions, with interest,\r\nreduced by any benefits they had received.  Id.  The Eviction Act\r\nstated that inclusion of union employees had \"no rational\r\nrelationship to any legitimate governmental purpose\" and would\r\ninvade the corpus in violation of the requirements of the Internal\r\nRevenue Code.  Id.  36-9.1-1.\r\nTwo teachers' unions and 22 present or former union\r\nemployees then brought the present suit in the district court in\r\nJuly 1994 against the Board, its chairperson, and its executive\r\ndirector.  The plaintiffs alleged that the Eviction Act violated\r\nthe Contract, Takings and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution,\r\nsee U.S. Const. art. I,  10, cl. 1; id. amend. V; id. amend. XIV,\r\nand that under 42 U.S.C.  1983, they were entitled to declaratory\r\nrelief, an injunction, restoration of any benefits wrongly\r\nwithheld, and attorney's fees.  \r\nThe district court denied the defendants' motion to\r\ndismiss.  See National Educ. Ass'n-R.I. v. Retirement Bd., 890 F.\r\nSupp. 1143, 1165 (D.R.I. 1995) (\"NEA I\").  Following discovery and\r\ncross motions for summary judgment, the district court decided the\r\nheart of the case in a detailed and lucid opinion on August 7,\r\n1997.  See National Educ. Ass'n-R.I. v. Retirement Bd. of R.I.\r\nEmployees' Retirement Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1486635\"><a href=\"/opinion/1486635/nat-educ-assn-rhode-island-v-retirement-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.R.I. 1997) (\"NEA\r\nII\").  The decision resolved all legal issues but reserved for\r\nlater disposition a few factual questions as to the status of three\r\nindividual plaintiffs.\r\nIn a nutshell, the district court ruled that the Takings\r\nClause protected the benefits of two groups of plaintiffs: those\r\nwho were eligible to retire and had retired by the date of the\r\nEviction Act (July 15, 1994), and those who were eligible to retire\r\nbut were still working as of that date.  Three other plaintiffs\r\nwho were still working and were not eligible for retirement at the\r\ndate of the Eviction Act were held not protected by the Takings\r\nClause or by the Contract Clause or by substantive due process\r\nconcepts.  See id. at 114-15.\r\nGiven these legal rulings, the parties then stipulated as\r\nto the status of two of the other remaining plaintiffs--one was\r\neligible to retire and therefore protected and the other was not--\r\nleaving only one plaintiff (DeOrsey) whose status was contested. \r\nIn April 1998, the district court conducted a bench trial and ruled\r\nthat DeOrsey had never been eligible to join the retirement system. \r\nThereafter, the district court entered a final judgment in favor of\r\nthe eligible plaintiffs and against the ineligible ones.  The\r\ndefendants now appeal from the first part of the judgment, and the\r\nineligible plaintiffs, together with DeOrsey, from the second.\r\nOn appeal, our review is de novo as to the legal issues\r\nresolved on summary judgment, see Terry v.

We begin with the plaintiffs'\r\nContract Clause claims, if only because most of the precedent\r\naddresses such cases under this rubric.  The claims raise  a\r\ndifficult set of issues that were expressly reserved in this\r\ncourt's leading decision in McGrath v. Rhode Island Retirement\r\nBoard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196857\"><a href=\"/opinion/196857/mcgrath-v-ri-retirement-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1996), further complicated by the\r\nsomewhat eccentric facts of this case.\r\nPension plans come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but\r\nthe typical plan contemplates  a stream of payments to be received\r\nby the employee starting upon retirement; both the terms and the\r\npayment formula are normally stated in the plan.  In defined\r\nbenefit plans, such as that of Rhode Island, the employee may be\r\nrequired to contribute during employment; but much of the payout is\r\ncontributed by the employer, often funded in advance at least in\r\npart.  See generally 1 J. Mamorsky, Employee Benefits Law:  ERISA\r\nand Beyond  1.01-1.05, at 1-2 to 1-25 (1998).\r\nAlthough such plans may be negotiated as explicit\r\ncontracts (e.g., as part of a collective bargaining agreement),\r\nquite often they are simply \"plans.\"  The plans may or may not have\r\nlanguage binding the employer not to change them (at least in\r\ncertain circumstances) or reserving its right to do so (at least in\r\ncertain circumstances).  Often, such plans have \"vesting\"\r\nprovisions, but strictly speaking such provisions usually \r\ndescribe how the existing plan operates and not whether the plan\r\nitself can be altered unilaterally by the employer.  \"Vesting\" and\r\n\"contractual\" are not synonymous.\r\nIn McGrath, this court surveyed the case law and\r\nconcluded that with respect to private pension plans, the courts\r\nwere divided, but that a substantial body of case law treats such\r\nplans as implied contracts, protecting at least those whose rights\r\nhave \"vested.\"  McGrath, 88 F.3d at 16-17.  The theory is that the\r\nplan is an offer and the employee, by working for many years\r\npursuant to the plan, has relied on and accepted the offer, which\r\ncannot now be changed unilaterally as to a vested employee, whether\r\nstill working or retired.  Id. at 17.  Of course, the plan may\r\nstill explicitly reserve rights to alter vested benefits.\r\nThe case law concerning public-employee pensions is  less\r\nsettled.  Some courts, including this one, have been quite hesitant\r\nto infer a contract where the state pension statute neither speaks\r\nin the language of contract nor explicitly precludes amendment of\r\nthe plan.  See, e.g., Parker, 123 F.3d at 5-6.  After all,\r\nlegislatures regularly modify compensation schedules and benefit\r\nprograms.  Supreme Court precedent has tended to treat government\r\npension statutes as similarly subject to modification for payments\r\nnot yet made, unless the government's intent to create a contract\r\nis clear and definite.  See, e.g., Dodge v. Board of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102855\"><a href=\"/opinion/102855/dodge-v-board-of-ed-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78-79 (1937).\r\nThus, \r\nabsent some clear indication that the\r\nlegislature intends to bind itself\r\ncontractually, the presumption is that 'a law\r\nis not intended to create private contractual\r\nor vested rights but merely declares a policy\r\nto be pursued until the legislature shall\r\nordain otherwise.'

See Dodge, 302 U.S. at 81.  More\r\nrecently, the Supreme Court allowed a statutory reduction in\r\nrailroad worker pensions for some \"vested\" workers, noting that\r\n\"railroad benefits, like social security benefits, are not\r\ncontractual and may be altered . . . .\"  United States R.R.\r\nRetirement Bd. v.

The policy reasons for protecting\r\nlegislative power against implied surrender are too obvious to\r\nwarrant much elaboration, see National Railroad, 470 U.S. at 466;\r\nMcGrath, 88 F.3d at 19, and it is easy enough for a statute\r\nexplicitly to authorize a contract or to say explicitly that the\r\nbenefits are contractual promises, or that any changes will not\r\napply to a specific class of beneficiaries (e.g., those who have\r\nretired), cf. Parker, 123 F.3d at 8-9.\r\nWe do not think that the Rhode Island general pension\r\nstatute \"clearly and unequivocally\" contracts for future benefits\r\neither by language or--in the circumstances of this case--through\r\nthe nature of the relationship.  Nowhere does the statute call the\r\npension plan a \"contract\" or contain an anti-retroactivity clause\r\nas to future changes.  Compare Brand, 303 U.S. at 105.  The closest\r\nthat the statute comes is a provision headed \"Guaranty by state--\r\nAnnual appropriations\" which provides, inter alia, that \r\nit is the intention of the state to make\r\npayment of the annuities, benefits, and\r\nretirement allowances provided for under the\r\nprovisions of this chapter and . . . to make\r\nthe appropriations required by the state to\r\nmeet its obligations to the extent provided in\r\nthis chapter.  The general assembly shall make\r\nannual appropriations which shall be\r\nsufficient to provide for the payment of\r\nannuities, benefits, and retirement allowances\r\nrequired of the state under this chapter.\r\nR.I. Gen. Laws  36-10-7.  This certainly directs state officials\r\nto fund the plan as it exists.  But it falls at least a step short\r\nof clearly expressing a contractual commitment not to change\r\nbenefit levels or other plan variables by legislation.  CompareParker, 123 F.3d at 8-9.\r\nNor we do think that references in the statute to\r\n\"vesting\" create a contract.  Often, and clearly so in Rhode\r\nIsland's statute, \"vesting\" refers to the period provided by a plan\r\nfor which an employee must work to become eligible for a pension if\r\nand when he attains retirement age.  See note 1, above.  Whether a\r\nplan affords contractual protections against a change in its terms\r\nis a different question.  A plan may not protect \"vested\" employees\r\nagainst change, see Fritz, 449 U.S. at 169 n.3, 173-74, or\r\nalternatively may provide some contractual protection even for\r\nunvested employees (e.g., against a change in the vesting period),\r\ncf.

See Parker, 123 F.3d at 6-8; McGrath,\r\n88 F.3d at 16-19.  But pensions can still be created (and\r\nwithdrawn) without contract; this was just what the Supreme Court\r\nfound as to railroad retirement benefits in Fritz itself.  SeeFritz, 449 U.S. at 174; see also Hisquierdo v.

Further, Rhode Island's general pension plan was\r\ncreated in 1936 when the view of pensions taken in Dodge was quite\r\nwidespread.\r\nRhode Island case law points in both directions.  The\r\nstate supreme court has implied that under state law pensions\r\ncannot be freely terminated; but it has also allowed cut-offs (of,\r\nfor example, a faithless judge) not easily reconciled with a strict\r\ncontract theory.

In\r\nall events, whether a contract exists for Contract Clause purposes\r\nis a federal question.  See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112703\"><a href=\"/opinion/112703/general-motors-corp-v-romein/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187 (1992).\r\nThe existence of an employer-employee relationship does\r\nweigh in favor of finding an implied contract, as the non-\r\ngovernmental pension cases make clear.  See McGrath, 88 F.3d at 17\r\n(summarizing case law).  However, the force of this consideration\r\nis very much muted in this case:  these particular plaintiffs do\r\nnot have the benefit of a clear and longstanding employer-employee\r\nrelationship with the government--they are far from the\r\nquintessential 10 or 28-years-of-service government employees.\r\nWe decline to decide now whether this last consideration\r\nwould tip the balance if, for example, Rhode Island took a meat axe\r\nto the pensions of long-time state employees.  In many states,\r\nthere are express limitations on such changes; and in general,\r\npolitical constraints make them unlikely (but not impossible). \r\nIn all events, the clear statement rule is binding unless and until\r\naltered by the Supreme Court, see State Oil Co. v. Khan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118149\"><a href=\"/opinion/118149/state-oil-co-v-khan/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In\r\nMcGrath, we explicitly reserved decision on this issue, seeMcGrath, 88 F.3d at 20 n.9, finding that the pension expectancies\r\nat issue had not even vested at the time that they were modified by\r\nthe legislature.  Here, the issue can no longer be fully postponed.\r\nThe Fifth Amendment forbids the federal government from \r\ntaking \"property\" for public use without just compensation, and\r\nthis limitation has been extended to the states through the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  See Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.\r\nBeckwith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110362\"><a href=\"/opinion/110362/webbs-fabulous-pharmacies-inc-v-beckwith/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160 (1980).  What constitutes \"property\"\r\nfor this purpose is  a recurring issue to which no mechanical\r\nanswer has been found.  The concept includes more than tangible\r\nproperty owned outright, see United States v. Willow River Power\r\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104111\"><a href=\"/opinion/104111/united-states-v-willow-river-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502-03 (1945), and has been extended to\r\nmaterialmen's liens, see Armstrong v.

Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, 449 U.S. at 161;\r\ncf. Eastern Enterprises v.

Thus, the Supreme Court has excluded\r\nfrom the \"property\" rubric riparian rights recognized under state\r\nlaw, railroad pensions, and future social service benefits.  Willow\r\nRiver, 324 U.S. at 502-03 (riparian rights); Hisquierdo, 439 U.S.\r\nat 575 (railroad pensions); Flemming v. Nestor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106087\"><a href=\"/opinion/106087/flemming-v-nestor/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608-\r\n611 (1960) (social security).  This is so even though expectations\r\nare sometimes afforded procedural protection, see, e.g., Goldbergv. Kelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108100\"><a href=\"/opinion/108100/goldberg-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970), and protection from wholly arbitrary\r\naction, see Fritz, 449 U.S. at 172.  See R. Rotunda &amp; J. Nowak, 2\r\nConstitutional Law:  Substance and Procedure  15.12, at 485 n.4,\r\n17.5, at 626 (2d ed. 1992).\r\nIn the present case, the Takings Clause does, or arguably\r\ndoes, to some extent protect some interests of plaintiffs under the\r\npension plan.  Pension payments actually made to retirees become\r\ntheir property and are protected against takings, even if and where\r\nthe payments are unquestionably a gift.  Similarly, anything that\r\nthe employee contributed, directly or by purchase of benefits, may\r\nwell be regarded as the employee's property.  Under the Rhode\r\nIsland plan, contributions are returned with interest even to a\r\nnon-vested employee who leaves the state's employment.  See R.I.\r\nGen. Laws  36-10-8.  However, the Eviction Act did not purport to\r\nreclaim any benefits actually paid, and it provided for the return\r\nof any member contributions, with interest, to the extent that they\r\nexceeded already paid-out benefits.  See R.I. Gen. Laws  36-9.1-\r\n2(a), (b).\r\nThus, the question for us is whether, apart from what has\r\nbeen paid in by the member or already paid out by the state, the\r\nprospective payments of the state's share of the defined benefits\r\nare currently \"property\" of the plaintiffs under the Takings\r\nClause.  If there were a contractual right to such payment, that\r\nright itself would be property for the purposes of the Takings\r\nClause.  See United States Trust, 431 U.S. at 11 n.16.  But in this\r\ncase we have already said that the state's prospective payments,\r\nover and above the members' contributions, are not contractually\r\nobligated under the Contract Clause--at least as to \"last minute\"\r\nentrants such as the plaintiffs.\r\nIn Hoffman, we concluded that \"[n]oncontractual employee\r\nbenefits that a recipient has not yet received, but has a mere\r\nexpectation of receiving, are not property as to which the\r\ngovernment, before repealing, must provide just compensation.\" \r\nHoffman, 909 F.2d at 616.  There we denied a contract clause claim\r\nbecause a pension statute did not clearly indicate an intent to\r\nbind the legislature contractually, see id. at 614, and then denied\r\na takings claim because there was no enforceable contract right,\r\nsee id. at 616; cf. Fritz, 449 U.S. at 174.  That decision is\r\ncontrolling here.\r\nThis position is virtually compelled by Supreme Court\r\ncases that, after finding that an expected statutory benefit did\r\nnot constitute a contract right, rejected the claim to payment. \r\nSee, e.g., National Railroad, 470 U.S. at 466-67, 478-79; Flemming,\r\n363 U.S. at 610-11; Dodge, 302 U.S. at 78-81.  It would make\r\nnonsense of such rulings--and the clear intent requirement--to\r\nconclude that an expectancy insufficient to constitute an\r\nenforceable contract against the state could simply be renamed\r\n\"property\" and enforced as a promise through the back door under\r\nthe Takings Clause.  \r\nThis brings us to the final constitutional attack on the \r\nEviction Act:  the claim that it violates \"substantive\" due\r\nprocess.  An expectation that is not \"property\" for purposes of the\r\nTakings Clause may yet sometimes entitle the citizen to procedural\r\nprotection, and substantive protection against arbitrariness,\r\nbefore the expectation is cut off by government action.  SeeFlemming, 363 U.S. at 610-11; Hoffman, 909 F.2d at 618.  The\r\nplaintiffs' claim here is to substantive protection (no procedural\r\nrights have been denied), but the due process standard in economic\r\nmatters is one of minimum rationality.  See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn\r\nMining Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109528\"><a href=\"/opinion/109528/usery-v-turner-elkhorn-mining-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1976); Hoffman, 909 F.2d at 618.\r\nWhen Congress curtailed pension rights of certain vested\r\nrailroad employees to prevent windfall benefits, it made fairly\r\nmechanical judgments about who should be grandfathered into double\r\npensions and who should not, and the Supreme Court upheld those\r\njudgments.  See Fritz, 449 U.S. at 174, 179-80.  Similarly, we only\r\nrecently upheld against such an attack certain distinctions made by\r\nCongress in social security payments to limit duplicative recovery,\r\neven while recognizing that the restrictions involved some fairly\r\ngross distinctions that could hardly be described as perfect\r\njustice.  See Splude v. Apfel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198292\"><a href=\"/opinion/198292/splude-v-social-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nHere, the class of persons who have been \"evicted\" are\r\nindividuals who were never public employees--at least in the\r\ncapacity for which the state pensions are sought--and were\r\npermitted to enter the system at bargain-basement prices while\r\nretaining their pensions as union employees.  The discrepancies\r\nbetween what they contributed as a class and what they might expect\r\nin pensions was striking.  And almost at once, they were warned of\r\nlegislative efforts to undo their unusual benefits.  The first such\r\nattempt (the Repeal Act) was frustrated in state court, but the\r\nEviction Act followed hard on its heels.\r\nAt argument, plaintiffs' counsel pointed out that the\r\nlegislature has in the past given special pension benefits to\r\nfavored groups, allowing (for example) veterans to \"purchase\" years\r\nof credit.  Cf. McGrath, 88 F.3d at 13 (describing R.I. Gen. Laws \r\n45-21-9, 45-21-53).  But especially in economic regulation, the\r\nquestion is not whether the legislature has dealt perfectly with\r\nall possible problems but whether its choice in this instance was\r\nrational.  See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. Gray &amp; Co.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111216\"><a href=\"/opinion/111216/pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation-v-ra-gray-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730 (1984); Fritz, 449 U.S. at 176-77; Hoffman, 909\r\nF.2d at 618.  Here, the choice to evict this group of members,\r\nreturning to them their contributions with interest, is not so\r\npatently arbitrary, irrational, or unrelated to a legitimate\r\nlegislative purpose as to constitute a violation of substantive due\r\nprocess.\r\nOur resolution makes it unnecessary to discuss whether\r\nthe additional plaintiffs, to whom the district court denied\r\nrelief, were \"eligible\" or bona fide members of the plan.  It\r\nreserves, once again, the very difficult case of the long-time\r\nvested or eligible employee whose benefits might be curtailed.  And\r\nit leaves it open to Rhode Island and its employees to address such\r\nmatters by explicit legislation or ordinary contract, the course\r\nbest suited to achieve certainty on both sides.\r\nThe decision of the district court is vacated and the\r\nmatter is remanded for entry of a judgment dismissing the\r\ncomplaint.\r\nIt is so ordered.\r\n</pre>",
