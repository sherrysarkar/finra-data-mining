Garca-Gregory, with whom Luis A. Oliver-Fraticelli and\r\nFiddler, Gonzlez &amp; Rodrguez were on brief for petitioner.\r\nTerri Parker DeLeon, Attorney, U.S. Department of Labor,\r\nOffice of the Solicitor-Occupational Safety and Health, with whom\r\nJ. Davitt McAteer, Acting Solicitor of Labor, Joseph M. Woodward,\r\nAssociate Solicitor for Occupational Safety and Health, and\r\nBruce F. Justh, Assistant Counsel for Appellate Litigation were on\r\nbrief for respondents.\r\n\n                                \r\n\n              March 16, 1998\r\n                                        WOODLOCK, District Judge.  In this appeal, petitioner\r\nEmpire Co. (\"Empire\") challenges a decision of the Occupational\r\nSafety and Health Review Commission (the \"Commission\") affirming \r\ncitations issued by the Secretary of Labor (the \"Secretary\") for\r\nviolations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 19\r\nU.S.C.  651-678 (the \"Act\").  Empire maintains that its worksite\r\nin Ponce, Puerto Rico is outside the enforcement jurisdiction of\r\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United\r\nStates Department of Labor (\"OSHA\") because the area does not fall\r\nwithin the scope of OSHA's marine terminal standard, 29 C.F.R. Part\r\n1917.  We find that the Commission could properly find the worksite\r\nwithin that standard and accordingly affirm.\r\n           I.  Standard of Review\r\nAt the outset, it is important to delineate the standards\r\nwhich govern our evaluation.  We review the Commission's legal\r\nconclusions to determine whether they are arbitrary, capricious, an\r\nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.  See\r\nP. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review\r\nComm'n, 115 F.3d 100, 107-08 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing 5 U.S.C.  706\r\n(2)(A)); Reich v. Simpson, Gumpertz &amp; Heger, Inc., 3 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  \"In making these determinations we must be mindful\r\nthat an agency's construction of its own regulations is entitled to\r\nsubstantial deference.\"  Reich, 3 F.3d at 2; see P. Gioioso, 115\r\nF.3d at 107.  Thus, the agency's interpretation must be given\r\neffect if it is reasonable--that is to say, if it sensibly conforms\r\nto the purpose and wording of the regulation.  See P. Gioioso, 115\r\nF.3d at 107; Reich, 3 F.3d at 2.  Where the Secretary and the\r\nCommission advance reasonable but differing interpretations of an\r\nambiguous regulation, the Secretary's interpretation is to be given\r\neffect.  See Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n,\r\n499 U.S. 144 (1991).\r\nWe review the Commission's factual findings to determine\r\nwhether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record\r\nconsidered as a whole.  See P. Gioioso, 115 F.3d at 108 (citing 29\r\nU.S.C.  660(a)); Reich, 3 F.3d at 2.  \"[T]he standard applies with\r\nundiminished force where, as here, an administrative body, like the\r\ncommission, does not itself hear witnesses but instead adopts an\r\nALJ's findings of fact.\"  P. Gioioso, 115 F.3d at 108 (citing Truck\r\nDrivers &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 170 v. NLRB, 993 F.2d 990, 998-\r\n99 (1st Cir. 1993)).\r\n          II.  Factual Background\r\nThe findings of fact made by the administrative law\r\njudge, upheld by the Commission on review and supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record as a whole established as\r\nfollows.  Empire operates a worksite in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where\r\nit engages in the maintenance, repair, and rental of equipment such\r\nas marine shipping containers, lifts to move heavy loads and\r\nchassis upon which containers are placed for ground transportation. \r\nClients in the maritime industry provide approximately eighty\r\npercent of Empire's rental business and approximately eighty-five\r\npercent of its maintenance and repair business.  Empire also\r\nsupplies diesel fuel to Luis Ayala Coln Successors Inc. (\"LAC\"),\r\na stevedoring company, and to the Ponce Port Authority, which\r\noperates a wharf and berth facility for the handling of maritime\r\ncargo.\r\nEmpire's worksite, as illustrated in two hand-drawn maps\r\nmade a part of the administrative record and attached as Appendices\r\nA and B to this opinion, lies approximately one-half mile north of\r\nthe Port Authority's wharves.  A public road, P.R. 10, runs roughly\r\neast and west along the wharf.  The road is fenced on both sides,\r\nand access to the wharf is provided through a gate.  Railroad\r\ntracks run roughly north from the shore, intersecting P.R. 10 then\r\nveering westward before reaching Empire's worksite.  A railroad\r\nloading facility, operated by CHEMEX Corp., lies between Empire's\r\nworksite and the shore.  To the east of the CHEMEX facility are\r\nunrelated structures, including a boat yard, a warehouse, a gas\r\nstorage facility, and a tuna factory.  To the west are offices of\r\nthe Port Authority, and an area in which shipping containers were\r\nbeing stored at the time of the OSHA inspection.\r\n          III.  Procedural History\r\nOn June 12, 1993, the Secretary issued two citations to\r\nEmpire for violations of the Act.  Empire contested the citations,\r\nclaiming that its worksite does not fall within the scope of OSHA's\r\nmarine terminal standard, 29 C.F.R. Part 1917.  The Act permits\r\nstates to enforce occupational safety and health standards under\r\nplans approved by the Secretary.  See 29 U.S.C.  667.  Puerto Rico\r\noperates generally under such an approved plan.  See 29 C.F.R.\r\n1952.383(s); 47 Fed. Reg. 39,164-66 (1982).  As a result, OSHA\r\nhas enforcement jurisdiction in Puerto Rico only over marine\r\nterminals, 29 C.F.R. Part 1917, and in other narrow areas not\r\nrelevant here.\r\nSee 29 C.F.R.  1952.382.\r\nThe marine terminal standard applies to\r\nemployment within a marine terminal as\r\ndefined in  1917.2(u), including the\r\nloading, unloading, movement or other\r\nhandling of cargo, ship's stores or gear\r\nwithin the terminal or into or out of any\r\nland carrier, holding or consolidation\r\narea, or any other activity within and\r\nassociated with the overall operation and\r\nfunctions of the terminal, such as the use\r\nand routine maintenance of facilities and\r\nequipment.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.  1917.1(a).\r\n\n\"Marine terminal\" means\r\n\nwharves, bulkheads, quays, piers, docks\r\nand other berthing locations and adjacent\r\nstorage or contiguous areas and structures\r\nassociated with the primary movements of\r\ncargo or materials from vessel to shore or\r\nshore to vessel including structures which\r\nare devoted to receiving, handling,\r\nholding, consolidation and loading or\r\ndelivery of waterborne shipments or\r\npassengers, including areas devoted to the\r\nmaintenance of the terminal or equipment. \r\nThe term does not include production or\r\nmanufacturing areas having their own\r\ndocking facilities and located at a marine\r\nterminal nor does the term include storage\r\nfacilities directly associated with those\r\nproduction or manufacturing areas.\r\n\nId.  1917.2(u).\r\n\nAfter a hearing, an administrative law judge (the \"ALJ\")\r\nheld that Empire's worksite was within the scope of Part 1917 and\r\ntherefore was within OSHA's enforcement jurisdiction.  The ALJ\r\nviewed part 1917 as imposing both a functional test and a\r\ngeographic test for determining whether the marine terminal\r\nstandard applies to a given worksite.\r\nThe ALJ found the functional test satisfied because\r\nEmpire engaged in \"the . . . maintenance of . . . equipment\" used\r\nin maritime cargo handling, and because Empire's sales of diesel\r\nfuel to the Ponce Port authority and LAC were activities\r\n\"associated with the overall operation and functions of the\r\nterminal.\"\r\nThe ALJ found the geographic test satisfied because\r\nEmpire's operations took place in \"contiguous areas . . . devoted\r\nto the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"  He saw no need\r\nto look beyond what he characterized by reference to Webster's\r\nThird New International Dictionary as the plain meaning of\r\n\"contiguous,\" which he interpreted as \"nearby\" or \"close\" and not\r\nlimited to immediately or directly adjoining locations.  He\r\ndetermined \"that the presence of a road, fences, and gate along the\r\nwharf is not sufficient to separate out the premises to the north\r\nand prevent them from being considered part of a marine terminal.\" \r\nThe ALJ also found that neither the Port Authority offices to the\r\nwest nor the unrelated structures to the east \"intrude into or\r\noccupy any part of the area to the south between Empire's facility\r\nand the wharf itself.\"  Consequently, the Empire worksite was\r\ndetermined to  be contiguous with the wharf: \"Since there are no\r\nintervening work operations or structures unrelated to marine\r\nterminal activities, the evidence supports a finding that Empire's\r\nproperty is part of a single, overall facility which comes within\r\nthe definition of a marine terminal.\"\r\nEmpire filed a petition for review of this decision, and\r\nthe Commission affirmed but used a different interpretation. \r\nSpecifically, with respect to the functional test, the Commission\r\nfound reasonable an administrative interpretation under which \"a\r\ncontiguous area is considered a marine terminal without regard to\r\nwhether it is associated with the primary movement of cargo or\r\nmaterials from vessel to shore or shore to vessel.\"  With respect\r\nto the geographic test, the Commission agreed with the ALJ that\r\n\"contiguous,\" as used in  1917.2(u), can mean \"nearby.\"  The\r\nCommission found that, under this definition, Empire's facility\r\nqualifies as a contiguous area because it is located approximately\r\none-half mile from the wharf and because \"[a]ll of the property\r\nbetween Empire and the wharf is devoted to maritime activities.\"\r\nPursuant to 29 U.S.C.  660, Empire petitioned this Court\r\nfor review.\r\n      IV.  Defining \"Marine Terminal\"\r\nEmpire challenges (A) the Commission's interpretation of\r\nthe functional test, (B) the Commission's interpretation of the\r\ngeographic test, and (C) the Commission's application of the\r\ngeographic test to Empire's worksite.\r\nA.  The Functional Dimension of \"Marine Terminal\":\r\n  Maintenance Associated with Cargo Movement \r\n\nBy holding that a contiguous area is considered a marine\r\nterminal without regard to whether it is associated with the\r\nprimary movement of cargo or materials from vessel to shore or\r\nshore to vessel, the Commission all but did away with a function\r\ndimension to the term \"marine terminal.\"  Adopting that\r\ninterpretation, the Commission considered only whether Empire's\r\nworksite is contiguous to the Ponce wharf.\r\nWe find this aspect of the interpretation articulated by\r\nthe Commission contrary to the plain language of the regulation. \r\nSection 1917.2(u) deals with two basic categories of sites.  First\r\nare those sites that are per se elements of a marine terminal:\r\n\"wharves, bulkheads, quays, piers, docks and other berthing\r\nlocations and adjacent storage . . . .\"  The second category,\r\nintroduced in  1917.2(u) by the disjunctive \"or,\" are those\r\n\"contiguous areas and structures\" serving functions \"associated\r\nwith the primary movement of cargo or materials from vessel to\r\nshore or shore to vessel . . . including areas devoted to the\r\nmaintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"  The Commission could\r\nhave reached its interpretation only by finding that the\r\n\"associated with\" language modifies \"structures\" but not\r\n\"contiguous areas.\"  Under the open-textured interpretation adopted\r\nby the Commission, any contiguous area would qualify as part of a\r\nmarine terminal without apparent regard for its function.  If this\r\ninterpretation were correct, however, it would be supererogatory\r\nfor the regulation to provide that a marine terminal \"includ[es]\r\nareas [not limited to structures] devoted to the maintenance of the\r\nterminal or equipment.\"  This offends a basic canon of statutory\r\nconstruction requiring every portion of the regulatory language to\r\nhave meaning.  See Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249,\r\n253 (1992).  Furthermore, by making Part 1917 applicable to\r\ncontiguous areas without regard to the activities performed\r\ntherein, the Commission's interpretation cuts the marine terminal\r\nstandard loose from certain articulated purposes identified by the\r\nagency in promulgating its standard.  \"This proposed rule is a\r\nvertical standard, i.e., one which applies to this industry\r\nexclusively and is designed specifically to address the hazards\r\nassociated with marine cargo-handling shore.\"  46 Fed. Reg. 4182,\r\n4182 (1981).\r\nWe interpret  1917.2(u) with emphasis on its functional\r\npurpose.  We see that purpose to be furthered by finding that\r\nEmpire's worksite is part of a marine terminal precisely because,\r\nas a marine equipment maintenance area, it is associated with the\r\nprimary movement of cargo or materials.  In this connection, Empire\r\ncontends that the marine terminal standard was not intended to\r\napply to worksites where employees are \"merely\" engaged in the\r\nmaintenance and repair of equipment.  This argument strains to\r\navoid a practical recognition of just what happens at a marine\r\nterminal.  The Supreme Court has observed--albeit in the context of\r\nthe Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.\r\n901-950--that \"maintaining or repairing equipment essential to\r\nthe loading or unloading process\" is not only associated with\r\nprimary marine activity, but \"is an integral part of and essential\r\nto those overall processes.\"  Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. Schwalb, 493 U.S. 40, 47 (1989).  Furthermore, Empire's suggested\r\ndefinition of a marine terminal permits disregard of one of the\r\nimportant specific goals of the regulation: to prevent injuries\r\nsuffered during \"hot  work\" (e.g., welding, cutting, heating),\r\nwhich \"is used in the marine terminal principally to perform\r\nroutine maintenance and repair tasks, such as rebuilding a damaged\r\nintermodal container or repairing a chassis that is no longer\r\nproperly aligned.\" 46 Fed. Reg. 4182, 4221 (1981).  This is\r\nactivity the ALJ found to be present at Empire's worksite.  Most\r\nimportantly, the regulation itself plainly states that areas\r\ncovered by virtue of function include those \"devoted to the\r\nmaintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"\r\nThe ALJ found, and Empire does not dispute, that\r\n\"Empire's business at the location in question is maintenance and\r\nrepair of equipment used in marine terminal operations.\"  Although\r\nthe Commission's expansive interpretation avoided any need to\r\nreview that determination, it is clear to us that this finding of\r\nfact is the only one supported by the administrative record.  As a\r\nresult, remand to the Commission would serve no purpose and is\r\ntherefore inappropriate.  See, e.g., Brock v. L. R. Willson &amp; Sons,\r\nInc., 773 F.2d 1377, 1389 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Marshall v. Western Elec., Inc., 565 F.2d 240, 246 (2d Cir. 1977), overruled on\r\nother grounds, Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review\r\nComm'n, 499 U.S. 144 (1991).\r\nIn sum, while we find the Commission's interpretation of\r\nthe functional test to be erroneous, we nevertheless conclude that\r\nEmpire's worksite indisputably satisfies the appropriately tailored\r\nfunctional test applied by the ALJ.\r\nB.  The Geographic Dimension: \"Contiguous\" Areas\r\nEmpire challenges the interpretation of \"contiguous\" as\r\nincluding areas \"nearby\" but not necessarily \"touching.\"  The\r\ndictionary definition relied upon by the ALJ and the Commission\r\nlists \"touching along boundaries\" as the primary definition and\r\n\"nearby\" as the tertiary--and therefore less commonly used--\r\nmeaning.  As the Supreme Court has emphasized in an analogous\r\ncontext, an agency's interpretation need not comport with the most\r\ncommon usage:\r\n  To be sure, \"terminate\" may also bear\r\nthe meaning proposed by respondent. \r\nIndeed, it may bear that meaning more\r\nnaturally or more frequently in common\r\nusage.  But it is axiomatic that the\r\nEEOC's interpretation of Title VII, for\r\nwhich it has primary enforcement\r\nresponsibility, need not be the best one\r\nby grammatical or any other standards. \r\nRather, the EEOC's interpretation of\r\nambiguous language need only be reasonable\r\nto be entitled to deference.\r\n\nEEOC v. Commercial Office Prods. Co., 486 U.S. 107, 115 (1988). \r\nThe language of  1917.2(u) does not clearly preclude \"nearby,\" and\r\nwe therefore consider whether the definition adopted by the\r\nCommission and the ALJ, regardless of its rank in the dictionaries,\r\nis a reasonable interpretation of the term \"contiguous\" as used in\r\nPart 1917.\r\nIn promulgating Part 1917, OSHA explained why regulations\r\nwere needed in certain geographic areas: \"The work environment at\r\na marine terminal exposes maritime employees to a greater risk of\r\ninjury than is true for workers in most other industries.\"  46 Fed.\r\nReg. 4182, 4183 (1981).  Of course, many of the hazards covered by\r\nPart 1917 are plainly greatest at the wharves and piers themselves. \r\nIt is undisputed, however, that Part 1917 applies to some areas\r\ndistinct from the docks, so long as related activities are carried\r\nout therein.  The Secretary has simply determined that, under the\r\nregulations, the degree of danger--and thus the need for coverage--\r\nin such a distinct area with such defined activities depends upon\r\nits proximity to the wharf rather than upon whether the two areas\r\nshare a common border.\r\nIf we were not according substantial deference to the\r\nagency interpretation, we might be tempted to read Part 1917 to\r\napply only to those areas immediately adjacent to the wharf itself,\r\nbecause the hazards of direct cargo handling are most likely to be\r\nexperienced in such areas and because that is a more rigorous\r\ndefinition of \"contiguous.\"  Cf. Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of\r\nModern Legal Usage 213 (2d ed. 1995) (\"contiguous means, not merely\r\n'close to' or 'near,' but 'adjacent'\").  The farther activities are\r\nfrom adjacent areas of direct cargo handling, the more remote are\r\nthe unique dangers of marine terminals.  Presumably at some point\r\nbeyond adjacent areas employees may appropriately be protected by\r\nthe ordinary safety standards of a given locality.  But these\r\ngeneralizations are speculative, and by contrast we note the ALJ's\r\nfinding that the actual working activities at Empire's worksite\r\ninvolve the types of hazards addressed by the marine terminal\r\nstandard--e.g., welding, electrical safety, hazard communications,\r\nfall protection, and machine guarding.  In any event, the parties\r\nhave failed to describe the practical significance of the choice\r\nbetween the OSHA and the Puerto Rico safety regimes.  In light of\r\nthe regulation's general protective purposes--and in the absence of\r\nsome demonstration that an expansive reading presents a practical\r\nanomaly--we do not find it unreasonable to interpret Part 1917 as\r\napplying to areas \"nearby\"-- and not just to those \"touching\"--the\r\nwharf. Cf. Texports Stevedore Co. v. Winchester, 632 F.2d 504, 514\r\n(5th Cir. 1980) (holding that areas \"adjoining\" navigable waters,\r\nwhich are covered by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'\r\nCompensation Act, include areas \"close to or in the vicinity of\r\nnavigable waters\").\r\nC.  Application of the Geographic Test \r\nThe Commission's determination of contiguity was based in\r\npart upon findings that Empire's worksite and the wharf are\r\nseparated by an area, about one-half mile long, entirely devoted to\r\nmaritime activity.  This factual predicate was supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record as a whole.  Although Empire\r\ncontends that an \"empty lot\" lay to the south, directly adjacent to\r\nthe CHEMEX facility, two OSHA officers testified at the hearing\r\nbefore the ALJ that they had personally observed chassis and\r\ncontainers in this area.  Similarly, the maps introduced by both\r\nparties in the administrative proceeding, see supra note 1 and\r\naccompanying text, together with the related testimony,\r\ndemonstrated, as the ALJ found, that neither the unrelated\r\nstructures to the east nor the Port Authority offices to the west\r\n\"intrude into or occupy any part of the area to the south between\r\nEmpire's facility and the wharf itself.\"\r\nWe also agree with the ALJ that \"the presence of a road,\r\nfences, and gate along the wharf is not sufficient to separate out\r\nthe premises to the north and prevent them from being considered\r\npart of a marine terminal.\"  Empire makes much of an OSHA guideline\r\nemphasizing that federal enforcement jurisdiction ends at \"the gate\r\nof the terminal.\"  OSHA Instruction STP 2-1.112 (Sept. 9, 1983). \r\nHowever, this phrase appears merely to be a figurative reference to\r\nthe geographic limits on the scope of Part 1917, and in any event\r\nit does not answer the question of where the terminal begins or\r\nends.  The marine terminal standard undoubtedly applies to areas\r\ndistinct from the wharf itself.  The existence of intervening\r\nroads, fences, and gates between such areas is entirely\r\nunremarkable, and such appurtenances do not necessarily reduce the\r\ndangers to which the marine terminal standard is addressed.\r\n               V.  Conclusion\r\nWe conclude Part 1917 can properly be interpreted to\r\ncover maintenance areas \"nearby\" a wharf, associated with the\r\nprimary movement of cargo.  We further conclude the Commission's\r\nfinding that Empire's worksite is covered by Part 1917 is in\r\naccordance with that interpretation and is supported by substantial\r\nevidence in the record as a whole.  Accordingly we will not disturb\r\nthe Commission's ultimate conclusion that Empire's worksite is a\r\n\"marine terminal\" subject to 29 C.F.R. Part 1917.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of fact made by the administrative law judge, upheld by the Commission on review and supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole established as follows.  Empire operates a worksite in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where it engages in the maintenance, repair, and rental of equipment such as marine shipping containers, lifts to move heavy loads and chassis upon which containers are placed for ground transportation.  Clients in the maritime industry provide approximately eighty percent of Empire's rental business and approximately eighty-five percent of its maintenance and repair business.  Empire also supplies diesel fuel to Luis Ayala Coln Successors Inc.  (\"LAC\"), a stevedoring company, and to the Ponce Port Authority, which operates a wharf and berth facility for the handling of maritime cargo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Empire's worksite, as illustrated in two hand-drawn maps made a part of the administrative record and attached to this opinion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> lies approximately one-half mile north of the Port Authority's wharves.  A public road, P.R. 10, runs roughly east and west along the wharf.  The road is fenced on both sides, and access to the wharf is provided through a gate.  Railroad tracks run roughly north from the shore, intersecting P.R. 10 then veering westward before reaching Empire's worksite.  A railroad loading facility, operated by CHEMEX Corp., lies between Empire's worksite and the shore.  To the east of the CHEMEX facility are unrelated structures, including a boat yard, a warehouse, a gas storage facility, and a tuna factory.  To the west are offices of the Port Authority, and an area in which shipping containers were being stored at the time of the OSHA inspection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 1993, the Secretary issued two citations to Empire for violations of the Act. Empire contested the citations, claiming that its worksite does not fall within the scope of OSHA's marine terminal standard, 29 C.F.R. Part 1917.  The Act permits states to enforce occupational safety and health standards under plans approved by the Secretary.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 667.  Puerto Rico operates generally under such an approved plan.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1952.383(s);  47 Fed.Reg. 39,164-66 (1982).  As a result, OSHA has enforcement jurisdiction in Puerto Rico only over marine terminals, 29 C.F.R. Part 1917, and in other narrow areas not relevant here.

The term does not include production or manufacturing areas having their own docking facilities and located at a marine terminal nor does the term include storage facilities directly associated with those production or manufacturing areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 1917.2(u).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing, an administrative law judge (the \"ALJ\") held that Empire's worksite was within the scope of Part 1917 and therefore was within OSHA's enforcement jurisdiction.  The ALJ viewed Part 1917 as imposing both a functional test and a geographic test for determining whether the marine terminal standard applies to a given worksite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found the functional test satisfied because Empire engaged in \"the ... maintenance of ... equipment\" used in maritime cargo handling, and because Empire's sales of diesel fuel to the Ponce Port Authority and LAC were activities \"associated with the overall operation and functions of the terminal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found the geographic test satisfied because Empire's operations took place in \"contiguous areas ... devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"   He saw no need to look beyond what he characterized by reference to Webster's Third New International Dictionary as the plain meaning of \"contiguous,\" which he interpreted as \"nearby\" or \"close\" and not limited to immediately or directly adjoining locations.  He determined \"that the presence of a road, fences, and gate along the wharf is not sufficient to separate out the premises to the north and prevent them from being considered part of a marine terminal.\"   The ALJ also found that neither the Port Authority offices to the west nor the unrelated structures to the east \"intrude into or occupy any part of the area to the south between Empire's facility and the wharf itself.\"   Consequently, the Empire worksite was determined to be contiguous with the wharf:  \"Since there are no intervening work operations or structures unrelated to marine terminal activities, the evidence supports a finding that Empire's property is part of a single, overall facility which comes within the definition of a marine terminal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Empire filed a petition for review of this decision, and the Commission affirmed but used a different interpretation.  Specifically, with respect to the functional test, the Commission found reasonable an administrative interpretation under which \"a contiguous area is considered a marine terminal without regard to whether it is associated with the primary movement of cargo or materials from vessel to shore or shore to vessel.\"   With respect to the geographic test, the Commission agreed with the ALJ that \"contiguous,\" as used in &#167; 1917.2(u), can mean \"nearby.\"   The Commission found that, under this definition, Empire's facility qualifies as a contiguous area because it is located approximately one-half mile from the wharf and because \"[a]ll of the property between Empire and the wharf is devoted to maritime activities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660, Empire petitioned this Court for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>IV.

The Functional Dimension of \"Marine Terminal\":  Maintenance Associated with Cargo Movement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By holding that a contiguous area is considered a marine terminal without regard to whether it is associated with the primary movement of cargo or materials from vessel to shore or shore to vessel, the Commission all but did away with a functional dimension to the term \"marine terminal.\"   Adopting that interpretation, the Commission considered only whether Empire's worksite is contiguous to the Ponce wharf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this aspect of the interpretation articulated by the Commission contrary to the plain language of the regulation.  Section 1917.2(u) deals with two basic categories of sites.  First are those sites that are per se elements of a marine terminal:  \"wharves, bulkheads, quays, piers, docks and other berthing locations and adjacent storage....\"  The second category, introduced in &#167; 1917.2(u) by the disjunctive \"or,\" are those \"contiguous areas and structures\" serving functions \"associated with the primary movement of cargo or materials from vessel to shore or shore to vessel ... including areas devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"   The Commission could have reached its interpretation only by finding that the \"associated with\" language modifies \"structures\" but not \"contiguous areas.\"   Under the open-textured interpretation adopted by the Commission, any contiguous area would qualify as part of a marine terminal without apparent regard for its function.  If this interpretation were correct, however, it would be supererogatory for the regulation to provide that a marine terminal \"includ[es] areas [not limited to structures] devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"   This offends a basic canon of statutory construction requiring every portion of the regulatory language to have meaning.  See Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 1149, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).  Furthermore, by making Part 1917 applicable to contiguous areas without regard to the activities performed therein, the Commission's interpretation cuts the marine terminal standard loose from certain articulated purposes identified by the agency in promulgating its standard.  \"This proposed rule is a vertical standard, i.e., one which applies to this industry exclusively and is designed specifically to address the hazards associated with marine cargo-handling shore.\"  46 Fed.Reg. 4182, 4182 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret &#167; 1917.2(u) with emphasis on its functional purpose.  We see that purpose to be furthered by finding that Empire's worksite is part of a marine terminal precisely because, as a marine equipment maintenance area, it is associated with the primary movement of cargo or materials.  In this connection, Empire contends that the marine terminal standard was not intended to apply to worksites where employees are \"merely\" engaged in the maintenance and repair of equipment.  This argument strains to avoid a practical recognition of just what happens at a marine terminal.  The Supreme Court has observed--albeit in the context of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 901-950--that \"maintaining or repairing equipment essential to the loading or unloading process\" is not only associated with primary marine activity, but \"is an integral part of and essential to those overall processes.\"  Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. Schwalb, 493 U.S. 40, 47, 110 S.Ct. 381, 385, 107 L.Ed.2d 278 (1989).  Furthermore, Empire's suggested definition of a marine terminal permits disregard of one of the important specific goals of the regulation:  to prevent injuries suffered during \"hot work\" (e.g., welding, cutting, heating), which \"is used in the marine terminal principally to perform routine maintenance and repair tasks, such as rebuilding a damaged intermodal container or repairing a chassis that is no longer properly aligned.\"  46 Fed.Reg. 4182, 4221 (1981).  This is activity the ALJ found to be present at Empire's worksite.  Most importantly, the regulation itself plainly states that areas covered by virtue of function include those \"devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found, and Empire does not dispute, that \"Empire's business at the location in question is maintenance and repair of equipment used in marine terminal operations.\"   Although the Commission's expansive interpretation avoided any need to review that determination, it is clear to us that this finding of fact is the only one supported by the administrative record.  As a result, remand to the Commission would serve no purpose and is therefore inappropriate.  See, e.g., Brock v. L.R. Willson &amp; Sons, Inc., 773 F.2d 1377, 1389 n. 12 (D.C.Cir.1985);  Marshall v. Western Elec., Inc., 565 F.2d 240, 246 (2d Cir.1977), overruled on other grounds, Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while we find the Commission's interpretation of the functional test to be erroneous, we nevertheless conclude that Empire's worksite indisputably satisfies the appropriately tailored functional test applied by the ALJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Indeed, it may bear that meaning more naturally or more frequently in common usage.  But it is axiomatic that the EEOC's interpretation of Title VII, for which it has primary enforcement responsibility, need not be the best one by grammatical or any other standards.  Rather, the EEOC's interpretation of ambiguous language need only be reasonable to be entitled to deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EEOC v. Commercial Office Prods.  Co., 486 U.S. 107, 115, 108 S.Ct. 1666, 1671, 100 L.Ed.2d 96 (1988).  The language of &#167; 1917.2(u) does not clearly preclude \"nearby,\" and we therefore consider whether the definition adopted by the Commission and the ALJ, regardless of its rank in the dictionaries, is a reasonable interpretation of the term \"contiguous\" as used in Part 1917.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In promulgating Part 1917, OSHA explained why regulations were needed in certain geographic areas:  \"The work environment at a marine terminal exposes maritime employees to a greater risk of injury than is true for workers in most other industries.\"  46 Fed.Reg. 4182, 4183 (1981).  Of course, many of the hazards covered by Part 1917 are plainly greatest at the wharves and piers themselves.  It is undisputed, however, that Part 1917 applies to some areas distinct from the docks, so long as related activities are carried out therein.  The Secretary has simply determined that, under the regulations, the degree of danger--and thus the need for coverage--in such a distinct area with such defined activities depends upon its proximity to the wharf rather than upon whether the two areas share a common border.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were not according substantial deference to the agency interpretation, we might be tempted to read Part 1917 to apply only to those areas immediately adjacent to the wharf itself, because the hazards of direct cargo handling are most likely to be experienced in such areas and because that is a more rigorous definition of \"contiguous.\"   Cf. Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 213 (2d ed. 1995) (\"contiguous means, not merely 'close to' or 'near,' but 'adjacent' \").  The farther activities are from adjacent areas of direct cargo handling, the more remote are the unique dangers of marine terminals.  Presumably at some point beyond adjacent areas employees may appropriately be protected by the ordinary safety standards of a given locality.  But these generalizations are speculative, and by contrast we note the ALJ's finding that the actual working activities at Empire's worksite involve the types of hazards addressed by the marine terminal standard--e.g., welding, electrical safety, hazard communications, fall protection, and machine guarding.  In any event, the parties have failed to describe the practical significance of the choice between the OSHA and the Puerto Rico safety regimes.  In light of the regulation's general protective purposes--and in the absence of some demonstration that an expansive reading presents a practical anomaly--we do not find it unreasonable to interpret Part 1917 as applying to areas \"nearby\"--and not just to those \"touching\"--the wharf.  Cf. Texports Stevedore Co. v. Winchester, 632 F.2d 504, 514 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that areas \"adjoining\" navigable waters, which are covered by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, include areas \"close to or in the vicinity of navigable waters\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Application of the Geographic Test</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's determination of contiguity was based in part upon findings that Empire's worksite and the wharf are separated by an area, about one-half mile long, entirely devoted to maritime activity.  This factual predicate was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  Although Empire contends that an \"empty lot\" lay to the south, directly adjacent to the CHEMEX facility, two OSHA officers testified at the hearing before the ALJ that they had personally observed chassis and containers in this area.  Similarly, the maps introduced by both parties in the administrative proceeding, see supra note 1 and accompanying text, together with the related testimony, demonstrated, as the ALJ found, that neither the unrelated structures to the east nor the Port Authority offices to the west \"intrude into or occupy any part of the area to the south between Empire's facility and the wharf itself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with the ALJ that \"the presence of a road, fences, and gate along the wharf is not sufficient to separate out the premises to the north and prevent them from being considered part of a marine terminal.\"   Empire makes much of an OSHA guideline emphasizing that federal enforcement jurisdiction ends at \"the gate of the terminal.\"   OSHA Instruction STP 2-1.112 (Sept. 9, 1983).  However, this phrase appears merely to be a figurative reference to the geographic limits on the scope of Part 1917, and in any event it does not answer the question of where the terminal begins or ends.  The marine terminal standard undoubtedly applies to areas distinct from the wharf itself.  The existence of intervening roads, fences, and gates between such areas is entirely unremarkable, and such appurtenances do not necessarily reduce the dangers to which the marine terminal standard is addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude Part 1917 can properly be interpreted to cover maintenance areas \"nearby\" a wharf, associated with the primary movement of cargo.  We further conclude the Commission's finding that Empire's worksite is covered by Part 1917 is in accordance with that interpretation and is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  Accordingly we will not disturb the Commission's ultimate conclusion that Empire's worksite is a \"marine terminal\" subject to 29 C.F.R.

In actual contact;  touching;  also, near, though not in contact ...\") (emphasis supplied).  This meaning is reflected as well as the secondary definition of the current edition of the Random House Dictionary.

The current edition of the principal legal dictionary also treats the definition employed by the Commission and the ALJ as the most common.  Black's Law Dictionary 320 (6th ed. 1990) (\"In close proximity;  neighboring ...\").

Empire maintains that its worksite in Ponce, Puerto Rico is outside the enforcement jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor (\"OSHA\") because the area does not fall within the scope of OSHA's marine terminal standard, 29 C.F.R.

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of fact made by the administrative law judge, upheld by the Commission on review and supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole established as follows.  Empire operates a worksite in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where it engages in the maintenance, repair, and rental of equipment such as marine shipping containers, lifts to move heavy loads and chassis upon which containers are placed for ground transportation.  Clients in the maritime industry provide approximately eighty percent of Empire's rental business and approximately eighty-five percent of its maintenance and repair business.  Empire also supplies diesel fuel to Luis Ayala Coln Successors Inc.  (\"LAC\"), a stevedoring company, and to the Ponce Port Authority, which operates a wharf and berth facility for the handling of maritime cargo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Empire's worksite, as illustrated in two hand-drawn maps made a part of the administrative record and attached to this opinion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> lies approximately one-half mile north of the Port Authority's wharves.  A public road, P.R. 10, runs roughly east and west along the wharf.  The road is fenced on both sides, and access to the wharf is provided through a gate.  Railroad tracks run roughly north from the shore, intersecting P.R. 10 then veering westward before reaching Empire's worksite.  A railroad loading facility, operated by CHEMEX Corp., lies between Empire's worksite and the shore.  To the east of the CHEMEX facility are unrelated structures, including a boat yard, a warehouse, a gas storage facility, and a tuna factory.  To the west are offices of the Port Authority, and an area in which shipping containers were being stored at the time of the OSHA inspection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 1993, the Secretary issued two citations to Empire for violations of the Act. Empire contested the citations, claiming that its worksite does not fall within the scope of OSHA's marine terminal standard, 29 C.F.R. Part 1917.  The Act permits states to enforce occupational safety and health standards under plans approved by the Secretary.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 667.  Puerto Rico operates generally under such an approved plan.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1952.383(s);  47 Fed.Reg. 39,164-66 (1982).  As a result, OSHA has enforcement jurisdiction in Puerto Rico only over marine terminals, 29 C.F.R. Part 1917, and in other narrow areas not relevant here.

The ALJ viewed Part 1917 as imposing both a functional test and a geographic test for determining whether the marine terminal standard applies to a given worksite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found the functional test satisfied because Empire engaged in \"the ... maintenance of ... equipment\" used in maritime cargo handling, and because Empire's sales of diesel fuel to the Ponce Port Authority and LAC were activities \"associated with the overall operation and functions of the terminal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found the geographic test satisfied because Empire's operations took place in \"contiguous areas ... devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"   He saw no need to look beyond what he characterized by reference to Webster's Third New International Dictionary as the plain meaning of \"contiguous,\" which he interpreted as \"nearby\" or \"close\" and not limited to immediately or directly adjoining locations.  He determined \"that the presence of a road, fences, and gate along the wharf is not sufficient to separate out the premises to the north and prevent them from being considered part of a marine terminal.\"   The ALJ also found that neither the Port Authority offices to the west nor the unrelated structures to the east \"intrude into or occupy any part of the area to the south between Empire's facility and the wharf itself.\"   Consequently, the Empire worksite was determined to be contiguous with the wharf:  \"Since there are no intervening work operations or structures unrelated to marine terminal activities, the evidence supports a finding that Empire's property is part of a single, overall facility which comes within the definition of a marine terminal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Empire filed a petition for review of this decision, and the Commission affirmed but used a different interpretation.  Specifically, with respect to the functional test, the Commission found reasonable an administrative interpretation under which \"a contiguous area is considered a marine terminal without regard to whether it is associated with the primary movement of cargo or materials from vessel to shore or shore to vessel.\"   With respect to the geographic test, the Commission agreed with the ALJ that \"contiguous,\" as used in &#167; 1917.2(u), can mean \"nearby.\"   The Commission found that, under this definition, Empire's facility qualifies as a contiguous area because it is located approximately one-half mile from the wharf and because \"[a]ll of the property between Empire and the wharf is devoted to maritime activities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660, Empire petitioned this Court for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>IV.

Section 1917.2(u) deals with two basic categories of sites.  First are those sites that are per se elements of a marine terminal:  \"wharves, bulkheads, quays, piers, docks and other berthing locations and adjacent storage....\"  The second category, introduced in &#167; 1917.2(u) by the disjunctive \"or,\" are those \"contiguous areas and structures\" serving functions \"associated with the primary movement of cargo or materials from vessel to shore or shore to vessel ... including areas devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"   The Commission could have reached its interpretation only by finding that the \"associated with\" language modifies \"structures\" but not \"contiguous areas.\"   Under the open-textured interpretation adopted by the Commission, any contiguous area would qualify as part of a marine terminal without apparent regard for its function.  If this interpretation were correct, however, it would be supererogatory for the regulation to provide that a marine terminal \"includ[es] areas [not limited to structures] devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"   This offends a basic canon of statutory construction requiring every portion of the regulatory language to have meaning.  See Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 253, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span> (1992).  Furthermore, by making Part 1917 applicable to contiguous areas without regard to the activities performed therein, the Commission's interpretation cuts the marine terminal standard loose from certain articulated purposes identified by the agency in promulgating its standard.  \"This proposed rule is a vertical standard, i.e., one which applies to this industry exclusively and is designed specifically to address the hazards associated with marine cargo-handling shore.\"  46 Fed.Reg. 4182, 4182 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret &#167; 1917.2(u) with emphasis on its functional purpose.  We see that purpose to be furthered by finding that Empire's worksite is part of a marine terminal precisely because, as a marine equipment maintenance area, it is associated with the primary movement of cargo or materials.  In this connection, Empire contends that the marine terminal standard was not intended to apply to worksites where employees are \"merely\" engaged in the maintenance and repair of equipment.  This argument strains to avoid a practical recognition of just what happens at a marine terminal.  The Supreme Court has observed--albeit in the context of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 901-950--that \"maintaining or repairing equipment essential to the loading or unloading process\" is not only associated with primary marine activity, but \"is an integral part of and essential to those overall processes.\"  Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span> (1989).  Furthermore, Empire's suggested definition of a marine terminal permits disregard of one of the important specific goals of the regulation:  to prevent injuries suffered during \"hot work\" (e.g., welding, cutting, heating), which \"is used in the marine terminal principally to perform routine maintenance and repair tasks, such as rebuilding a damaged intermodal container or repairing a chassis that is no longer properly aligned.\"  46 Fed.Reg. 4182, 4221 (1981).  This is activity the ALJ found to be present at Empire's worksite.  Most importantly, the regulation itself plainly states that areas covered by virtue of function include those \"devoted to the maintenance of the terminal or equipment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found, and Empire does not dispute, that \"Empire's business at the location in question is maintenance and repair of equipment used in marine terminal operations.\"   Although the Commission's expansive interpretation avoided any need to review that determination, it is clear to us that this finding of fact is the only one supported by the administrative record.  As a result, remand to the Commission would serve no purpose and is therefore inappropriate.  See, e.g., Brock v. L.R.

The language of &#167; 1917.2(u) does not clearly preclude \"nearby,\" and we therefore consider whether the definition adopted by the Commission and the ALJ, regardless of its rank in the dictionaries, is a reasonable interpretation of the term \"contiguous\" as used in Part 1917.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In promulgating Part 1917, OSHA explained why regulations were needed in certain geographic areas:  \"The work environment at a marine terminal exposes maritime employees to a greater risk of injury than is true for workers in most other industries.\"  46 Fed.Reg. 4182, 4183 (1981).  Of course, many of the hazards covered by Part 1917 are plainly greatest at the wharves and piers themselves.  It is undisputed, however, that Part 1917 applies to some areas distinct from the docks, so long as related activities are carried out therein.  The Secretary has simply determined that, under the regulations, the degree of danger--and thus the need for coverage--in such a distinct area with such defined activities depends upon its proximity to the wharf rather than upon whether the two areas share a common border.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were not according substantial deference to the agency interpretation, we might be tempted to read Part 1917 to apply only to those areas immediately adjacent to the wharf itself, because the hazards of direct cargo handling are most likely to be experienced in such areas and because that is a more rigorous definition of \"contiguous.\"   Cf. Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 213 (2d ed. 1995) (\"contiguous means, not merely 'close to' or 'near,' but 'adjacent' \").  The farther activities are from adjacent areas of direct cargo handling, the more remote are the unique dangers of marine terminals.  Presumably at some point beyond adjacent areas employees may appropriately be protected by the ordinary safety standards of a given locality.  But these generalizations are speculative, and by contrast we note the ALJ's finding that the actual working activities at Empire's worksite involve the types of hazards addressed by the marine terminal standard--e.g., welding, electrical safety, hazard communications, fall protection, and machine guarding.  In any event, the parties have failed to describe the practical significance of the choice between the OSHA and the Puerto Rico safety regimes.  In light of the regulation's general protective purposes--and in the absence of some demonstration that an expansive reading presents a practical anomaly--we do not find it unreasonable to interpret Part 1917 as applying to areas \"nearby\"--and not just to those \"touching\"--the wharf.

Application of the Geographic Test</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's determination of contiguity was based in part upon findings that Empire's worksite and the wharf are separated by an area, about one-half mile long, entirely devoted to maritime activity.  This factual predicate was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  Although Empire contends that an \"empty lot\" lay to the south, directly adjacent to the CHEMEX facility, two OSHA officers testified at the hearing before the ALJ that they had personally observed chassis and containers in this area.  Similarly, the maps introduced by both parties in the administrative proceeding, see supra note 1 and accompanying text, together with the related testimony, demonstrated, as the ALJ found, that neither the unrelated structures to the east nor the Port Authority offices to the west \"intrude into or occupy any part of the area to the south between Empire's facility and the wharf itself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with the ALJ that \"the presence of a road, fences, and gate along the wharf is not sufficient to separate out the premises to the north and prevent them from being considered part of a marine terminal.\"   Empire makes much of an OSHA guideline emphasizing that federal enforcement jurisdiction ends at \"the gate of the terminal.\"   OSHA Instruction STP 2-1.112 (Sept. 9, 1983).  However, this phrase appears merely to be a figurative reference to the geographic limits on the scope of Part 1917, and in any event it does not answer the question of where the terminal begins or ends.  The marine terminal standard undoubtedly applies to areas distinct from the wharf itself.  The existence of intervening roads, fences, and gates between such areas is entirely unremarkable, and such appurtenances do not necessarily reduce the dangers to which the marine terminal standard is addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude Part 1917 can properly be interpreted to cover maintenance areas \"nearby\" a wharf, associated with the primary movement of cargo.  We further conclude the Commission's finding that Empire's worksite is covered by Part 1917 is in accordance with that interpretation and is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  Accordingly we will not disturb the Commission's ultimate conclusion that Empire's worksite is a \"marine terminal\" subject to 29 C.F.R. Part 1917.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLENOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We recognize the hazards of reliance in judicial opinions upon potentially misleading graphic images.  See generally Hampton Dellinger, Words are Enough:  The Troublesome Use of Photographs, Maps, and Other Images in Supreme Court Opinions, 110 Harv.L.Rev. 1704 (1997).  The crudely prepared maps here, for example, neither of which is drawn to scale, were offered respectively by Empire (Bates No. 00013) and by the Secretary (Bates No. 00098) apparently to emphasize their partisan contentions about the site.  Nevertheless, viewed with caution, they may be helpful as supplements to the narrative above in imagining the locale</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Webster's Third New International Dictionary 492 (1986) (\"1 ... c:  NEARBY, CLOSE:  not distant ...\").  While purists have been skeptical about the latitudinarian tendencies of Webster's Third, see generally Herbert C. Morton, The Story of Webster's Third:  Philip Goves' Controversial Dictionary and its Critics (1994);  see also Rex Stout, Gambit 2 (1964) (Nero Wolfe reported to view Webster's Third as \"subversive because it threatens the integrity of the English language\"), this meaning of \"contiguous\" is found in the primary definition of its more prescriptive predecessor, I Webster's New International Dictionary 576 (2d ed. 1950) (\"1. In actual contact;  touching;  also, near, though not in contact ...\") (emphasis supplied).  This meaning is reflected as well as the secondary definition of the current edition of the Random House Dictionary.  Random House Unabridged Dictionary 439 (2d ed. 1993) (\"2. in close proximity without actually touching;  near.\").  The current edition of the principal legal dictionary also treats the definition employed by the Commission and the ALJ as the most common.  Black's Law Dictionary 320 (6th ed. 1990) (\"In close proximity;  neighboring ...\").  In short, there is nothing unreasonable about defining \"contiguous\" to mean \"nearby.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
