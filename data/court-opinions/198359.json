Freedman, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Lori H. Levinson and Cain, Hibbard, Myers &amp; Cook, P.C. on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, Ariane D. Vuono,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                     March 4, 1999\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  Thomas E. Wilson appeals from an\r\nenhanced sentence that was imposed in 1994, pursuant to the\r\nArmed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.  924(e), following his\r\nguilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in\r\nviolation of  922(g)(1).  The district court, having failed to\r\nadvise Wilson of his right to appeal at sentencing, later\r\ngranted (in part) Wilson's  2255 motion and reinstated his\r\nright to appeal his sentence.  This appeal represents Wilson's\r\nexercise of that reinstated right.\r\n          Wilson challenges his conviction and enhanced\r\nsentence on the ground that his prior Massachusetts convictions\r\ndid not qualify as predicate offenses because his civil rights\r\nhad been restored with respect to those convictions.  He relies\r\nupon 18 U.S.C.  921(a)(20), which provides, in relevant part,\r\nthat a conviction \"shall not be considered\" as a predicate\r\noffense where\r\n          a person . . . has had civil rights\r\n          restored . . . , unless such . . .\r\n          restoration of civil rights expressly\r\n          provides that the person may not ship,\r\n          transport, possess or receive firearms.\r\n\nThe parties agree that Massachusetts law has restored Wilson's\r\ncivil rights.  The focus of this appeal is the interpretation\r\nto be given to the \"unless clause\" of  921(a)(20).\r\n          \"Massachusetts materially restricts an ex-felon's\r\nright to carry and traffic in firearms regardless of the\r\npassage of time.\" United States v. Alston, 112 F.3d 32, 37 (1st\r\nCir. 1997); see United States v. Estrella, 104 F.3d 3, 7 (1st\r\n                             -2-\r\nCir. 1997)(listing Massachusetts statutory restrictions). \r\nDespite the absence of a total prohibition of the right to\r\npossess firearms, Massachusetts' \"patchwork of restrictions\"\r\ntriggers the \"unless clause\" such that  921(a)(20) does not\r\nprotect the ex-felon. Estrella, 104 F.3d at 8 (holding that\r\nEstrella was not excepted from the felon-in-possession\r\nstatute).  The holding in Estrella has also been applied to\r\naffirm sentencing enhancements under  924(e). See United\r\nStates v. Blodgett, 130 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1997); Alston,\r\n112 F.3d at 37-38.\r\n          The Supreme Court recently resolved a division among\r\nvarious circuits over the interpretation to be given to the\r\n\"unless clause\" and endorsed the approach taken by this circuit\r\nin Estrella, supra. See Caron v. United States, 118 S.Ct. 2007\r\n(1998).  The court interpreted the \"unless clause\" to apply\r\nwhen the state forbids one or more types of firearms, adopting\r\nthe following reasoning:\r\n\n          a state weapons limitation on an offender\r\n          activates the uniform federal ban on\r\n          possessing any firearms at all.  This is\r\n          so even if the guns the offender possessed\r\n          were ones the State permitted him to have. \r\n          The State has singled out the offender as\r\n          more dangerous than law-abiding citizens,\r\n          and federal law uses this determination to\r\n          impose its own broader stricture.\r\n\nId. at 2011-12.  The Court affirmed this court's judgment\r\nordering that Caron be sentenced as an armed career criminal\r\nunder  924(e). Id. at 2012.\r\n          Wilson's argument that the Supreme Court's Carondecision does not apply to him because it had not yet been\r\ndecided when he became aware of his right to appeal in August\r\n1997, is unavailing.  The Supreme Court's Caron decision\r\naffirmed a judgment of this court applying the approach taken\r\nin Estrella, supra.  Therefore, it makes no difference to the\r\noutcome of this appeal whether we apply the Supreme Court's\r\nCaron decision or (as Wilson urges us to do) the law of this\r\ncircuit as it existed in August 1997.  The district court did\r\nnot err in treating the prior Massachusetts convictions as\r\npredicate offenses for purposes of  922(g)(1) and 924(e). \r\nNor did Wilson receive ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nbecause his attorney did not challenge the use of the predicate\r\noffenses.\r\n          The government's motion for summary affirmance is\r\ngranted.
