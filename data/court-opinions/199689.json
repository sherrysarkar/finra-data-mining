Marcelo         Ceballos      challenges       the\n\nindictment to which he pled guilty.             Specifically, he argues\n\non appeal that the there was no evidence presented to the\n\ngrand jury of an essential element of the charge to which he\n\npled guilty.      Before pleading guilty to Count Three of the\n\nSecond    Superseding    Indictment,          which     charged       him   with\n\nconspiring to commit money laundering, Ceballos moved to\n\ndismiss    the    indictment     on    the     ground      that    there     was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support it.                  At the time that he\n\npled    guilty,   however,     Ceballos       agreed      that    all   pending\n\nmotions     (which    included        the    motion       to     dismiss    the\n\nindictment) would be “deemed waived.”                 On appeal, Ceballos\n\nagain    challenges   the    factual        basis   for    the    indictment,\n\narguing that there was no evidence presented to the grand\n\njury to support a finding that he knew that the money he\n\nhelped    transfer    represented       proceeds        from     an     unlawful\n\nactivity.\n\n            “This circuit has ruled that a defendant who pleads\n\nguilty may not later contest the factual and theoretical\n\nfoundations of the indictment to which he has pled.” United\n\nStates v. Rivera Ramos, 856 F.2d 420, 423 (1 st Cir. 1988).\n\nThis appeal by Ceballos represents an effort to contest the\n\nfactual foundation of Count Three of the indictment, to\n\f which   he   pled   guilty.    At   his   change-of-plea    hearing,\n\n Ceballos specifically admitted that he knew that the money\n\n he helped transfer “came from drug transactions.”           Ceballos’\n\n appeal does not fall within any exception for challenges to\n\n “jurisdictional     facts”    alleged     in   the   indictment.   See\n\n Valencia v. United States, 923 F.2d 917, 921 (1st Cir. 1991).1\n\n              Ceballos’ conviction and sentence are affirmed. See\n\n Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n    1 Ceballos’ reliance upon United States v. Frigerio-Migiano,\n254 F.3d 30 (1st Cir. 2001) is misplaced as appellant in that\ncase did not plead guilty but appealed from a conviction\nfollowing a trial.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
