O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n George E. Kersey on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney and Michael J.\r\nPineault, Assistant U.S. Attorney on brief for appellees.\r\n\nDecember 10, 1998\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  We have carefully reviewed the record in\r\nthis case, including the briefs of the parties and the\r\nmemorandum and order of the district court.  We affirm the\r\ngrant of summary judgment to defendants/appellees essentially\r\nfor the reasons given by the district court in its memorandum\r\nand order, dated March 12, 1998. We add only the following\r\nbrief comments.\r\n          Even if we assume arguendo that defendants/appellees\r\nserved their motion to dismiss one day late, Kersey has not\r\nalleged any prejudice from the delay.  Thus, the district court\r\nwas well within its discretion in considering the motion.  SeeCoughlin v. Tailhook Ass'n Inc., 818 F. Supp. 1366, 1368 (D.\r\nNev. 1993) (court will consider motion to dismiss since filing\r\none day late did not prejudice plaintiff).\r\n          We find no error in the decision by the EEOC to\r\ndismiss Kersey's complaint without having informed him\r\nbeforehand of its reliance on the doctrine of constructive\r\nreceipt.  Moreover, since the Notice of Final Interview was\r\ndelivered to the address Kersey provided and was received by an\r\nindividual of suitable age and discretion, Kersey has not\r\nraised any issue which might rebut the presumption of\r\nconstructive receipt.  Consequently, he suffered no prejudice\r\nfrom any failure by the agency to inform him of its reliance on\r\nthe doctrine prior to his final appeal.\r\n          Finally, Kersey has not alleged any facts which show\r\nthat the actions which form the basis of his complaint were\r\nperformed by his supervisors outside of the scope of their\r\nemployment.  Hence, no cause of action exists against them in\r\ntheir individual capacities.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
