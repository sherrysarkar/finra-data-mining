The\r\n\nentire purchase  price was  financed through  a mortgage  loan in\r\n\npounds  sterling.   On  October  12, 1988,  it  was increased  to\r\n\n330,000 pounds (exchange rate:   $1.73 to 1 pound); on  March 27,\r\n\n1990,  to  333,180  pounds  (exchange  rate  $1.62 to  1  pound).\r\n\nUltimately,  their  capital improvements  to  the residence  cost\r\n\n45,647 pounds.   No  U.S. funds were  used either to  purchase or\r\n\nimprove the residence.  On July 27, 1990, it was sold for 453,374\r\n\npounds,  net  of selling  expenses,  and  the mortgage  loan  was\r\n\nretired. \r\n\n          Appellants'  1990  joint   federal  income  tax  return\r\n\noriginally  reported  a  $308,811  capital  gain,  utilizing  the\r\n\nexchange rate at date of purchase ($1.49 to 1 pound) to calculate\r\n\nthe  adjusted cost basis, but using  the exchange rate at date of\r\n\nsale ($1.82  to 1 pound) to calculate the sale price.  Appellants\r\n\nlater amended their 1990 return to claim a $30,610 refund arrived\r\n\nat  by utilizing the  exchange rate at  date of sale  ($1.82 to 1\r\n\npound) to determine the adjusted cost  basis as well as the  sale\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nprice, thus resulting in a reduced $199,491 capital gain. \r\n\n          After  the Internal  Revenue  Service disallowed  their\r\n\namended refund  claim, appellants  initiated the  present action.\r\n\nThe complaint alleged that Revenue Ruling 90-79 misinterprets our\r\n\ndecision in Willard Helburn,  Ltd. v. Commissioner, 214 F.2d  815\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1954), and that  the tax imposed violates the Sixteenth\r\n\nAmendment,  see Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S.  189 (1920).  In due\r                                            \r\n\ncourse,  appellants moved for  summary judgment.   The government\r\n\nresponded  that the  total cost  basis of  the residence  must be\r\n\narrived  at by  utilizing  the  respective dollar-pound  exchange\r\n\nrates  in  effect  when  the  residence  was  purchased and  each\r\n\ncapital-improvement payment  was  made.   The parties  stipulated\r\n\nthat,  thus  calculated,  appellants  had  overpaid  $2,668, plus\r\n\nrelated  interest   and   penalties   not   presently   relevant.\r\n\nUltimately, the district court entered judgment for appellants in\r\n\nthe amount of  $2,668 plus interest and penalties  as provided by\r\n\nlaw.   On appeal, appellants  challenge the district  court order\r\n\nrejecting their motion for summary judgment in the larger  amount\r\n\nof $30,610.  \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION1\r                                     DISCUSSION\r                                               \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In a  civil action  for refund under  26 U.S.C.    7422(a),\r\n\"the taxpayer must bear the burden of proving that the challenged\r\nIRS  tax assessment  was erroneous.\"   Webb  v.

Section 1011 of  the Internal Revenue\r\n\nCode provides that the \"adjusted basis for determining the gain .\r\n\n.  . from  the sale  or other  disposition of  property, whenever\r\n\nacquired, shall be  the basis (determined under section  1012 . .\r\n\n.),  adjusted as provided  in section 1016.\"   26  U.S.C.   1011.\r\n\nUnder section 1012, generally the  basis of property is its cost.\r\n\nId.    1012.   For relevant  purposes, section  1016(a)(1) states\r            \r\n\nthat  a proper adjustment shall be  made for \"expenditures . . .,\r\n\nor  other items, properly chargeable to  capital . . .  .\"  Id.  \r                                                                        \r\n\n1016(a)(1).\r\n\n          Section 985(a) generally  requires that all  income tax\r\n\nliability  determinations are  to  be  made  in  the  \"taxpayer's\r\n\nfunctional currency,\" id.   985(a),  which is the U.S. dollar for\r                                  \r\n\nindividual United  States taxpayers,  id.    985(b)(1)(A).

Moreover, since  the\r\n\nmortgage-loan-transaction loss  was not \"incurred  in an activity\r\n\nor as the result of an  event described in section 165(c) of  the\r\n\nCode[,] . . .

They argue,\r\n\nhowever, that  the  343,147  pound adjusted  cost  basis  of  the\r\n\nresidence, consisting of the 297,500 pound purchase price and the\r\n\n45,647 pounds paid  for capital improvements, likewise  should be\r\n\nexpressed in  U.S.  dollar terms  as  of the  date  of the  sale.\r                                                                          \r\n\nAppellants  correctly state that, viewed \"in the foreign currency\r\n\nin which  it was  transacted,\" the  purchase generated  a 110,227\r\n\npound  gain as  of  the date  of  the sale,  which  translates to\r\n\napproximately  $200,000 at  the $1.82  per  pound exchange  rate.\r\n\nTherefore,  they  say,  the  difference between  the  approximate\r\n\n$300,000  gain  under  the  government's  computation,   and  the\r\n\n$200,000  gain   appellants  suggest,  approximates   a  $100,000\r\n\nunrealized foreign exchange  gain on the residence  that resulted\r                    \r\n\nfrom the increase in  the dollar-pound exchange rate  between the\r\n\ndates  the residence  was  bought  and sold.    However fair  and\r\n\nreasonable  their argument  may be,  it amounts  to an  untenable\r\n\nattempt  to convert  their \"functional  currency\"  from the  U.S.\r\n\ndollar to the pound sterling.  \r\n\n          Under  I.R.C.   985(b)(1), use of a functional currency\r\n\nother than the  U.S. dollar is  restricted to qualified  business\r\n\nunits (\"QBU\"s).   The functional  currency of a  QBU that  is not\r\n\nrequired  to use  the dollar  is  \"the currency  of the  economic\r\n\nenvironment in which a significant part of such unit's activities\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nexchange rate prevailing at the  date of their purchase, 214 F.2d\r\nat 818, and their stipulation was  accepted by the court, id.  at\r                                                                      \r\n819.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nare conducted and which is used by such unit in keeping its books\r\n\nand records.\"   26 U.S.C.    985(b)(1)(B).   Although  appellants\r\n\ncorrectly assert that their residence was purchased \"for a pound-\r\n\ndenominated value\"  while  they were  \"living  and working  in  a\r\n\npound-denominated economy,\" under I.R.C.   989(a) a QBU must be a\r\n\n\"separate and clearly  identified unit of trade or  business of a\r\n\ntaxpayer  which maintains separate books and records.\"  26 U.S.C.\r\n\n  989(a).   And  since appellants concede  that the  purchase and\r\n\nsale of  their  residence  was not  carried  out by  a  QBU,  the\r\n\ndistrict court properly rejected their plea to treat the pound as\r\n\ntheir functional currency.  \r\n\nB.

The entire purchase price was financed through a mortgage loan in pounds sterling.  On October 12, 1988, it was increased to 330,000 pounds (exchange rate:  $1.73 to 1 pound);  on March 27, 1990, to 333,180 pounds (exchange rate $1.62 to 1 pound).  Ultimately, their capital improvements to the residence cost 45,647 pounds.  No U.S. funds were used either to purchase or improve the residence.  On July 27, 1990, it was sold for 453,374 pounds, net of selling expenses, and the mortgage loan was retired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' 1990 joint federal income tax return originally reported a $308,811 capital gain, utilizing the exchange rate at date of purchase ($1.49 to 1 pound) to calculate the adjusted cost basis, but using the exchange rate at date of sale ($1.82 to 1 pound) to calculate the sale price.  Appellants later amended their 1990 return to claim a $30,610 refund arrived at by utilizing the exchange rate at date of sale ($1.82 to 1 pound) to determine the adjusted cost basis as well as the sale price, thus resulting in a reduced $199,491 capital gain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Internal Revenue Service disallowed their amended refund claim, appellants initiated the present action.  The complaint alleged that Revenue Ruling 90-79 misinterprets our decision in Willard Helburn, Inc. v. Commissioner, 214 F.2d 815 (1st Cir.1954), and that the tax imposed violates the Sixteenth Amendment, see Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521 (1920).  In due course, appellants moved for summary judgment.  The government responded that the total cost basis of the residence must be arrived at by utilizing the respective dollar-pound exchange rates in effect when the residence was purchased and each capital-improvement payment was made.  The parties stipulated that, thus calculated, appellants had overpaid $2,668, plus related interest and penalties not presently relevant.  Ultimately, the district court entered judgment for appellants in the amount of $2,668 plus interest and penalties as provided by law.  On appeal, appellants challenge the district court order rejecting their motion for summary judgment in the larger amount of $30,610.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <p>A.

Section 1011 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the \"adjusted basis for determining the gain ... from the sale or other disposition of property, whenever acquired, shall be the basis (determined under section 1012 ... ), adjusted as provided in section 1016.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 1011.  Under section 1012, generally the basis of property is its cost.  Id. &#167; 1012.  For relevant purposes, section 1016(a)(1) states that a proper adjustment shall be made for \"expenditures ..., or other items, properly chargeable to capital....\"  Id. &#167; 1016(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 985(a) generally requires that all income tax liability determinations are to be made in the \"taxpayer's functional currency,\" id. &#167; 985(a), which is the U.S. dollar for individual United States taxpayers, id. &#167; 985(b)(1)(A).  With exceptions not relevant here, section 165(a) permits \"a deduction [for] any loss sustained during the taxable year....\"  Id. &#167; 165(a).  Finally and importantly, in relevant part section 165(c) limits the deductions available to individual United States taxpayers to \"(1) losses incurred in a trade or business [and] (2) losses incurred in any transaction entered into for profit, though not connected with a trade or business....\"  Id. &#167; 165(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Loss on Mortgage Loan Transaction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government essentially agrees that appellants sustained a loss in their mortgage loan transaction, since the value of the dollar declined, as against the pound sterling, from the time of the mortgage loan to the date of its repayment.  Nonetheless, says the government, appellants may not offset their mortgage-loan-transaction loss against their real-estate-transaction gain, because \"the borrowing and repayment of the mortgage loan is a separate transaction from the purchase and sale of the personal residence.\"   Rev. Rul. 90-79, 1990-38 I.R.B. 26 (citing Willard Helburn, 214 F.2d at 818-19;  Church's English Shoes, Ltd. v.

Moreover, since the mortgage-loan-transaction loss was not \"incurred in an activity or as the result of an event described in section 165(c) of the Code[,] ...

Appellants point out that though we employed a separate transactions approach in Willard Helburn, 214 F.2d at 818, we recognized that an integrated approach to the transaction might have been elected by the taxpayer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Unfortunately for appellants, Congress has since foreclosed an integrated transaction approach to the exclusively foreign-currency financed acquisition involved in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants urge, in effect, that their mortgage loan transaction be considered part of a \"hedging transaction\" under I.R.C. &#167; 988(d)(1), which might result in its integrated treatment as part and parcel of their real estate transaction.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 988(d)(1).  \"To the extent provided in regulations,\" id., borrowing under a debt instrument in which the taxpayer is obligated to repay the loan in \"a nonfunctional currency,\" id. &#167; 988(c)(1), will qualify for treatment as part of a \"section 988 hedging transaction\" provided the taxpayer (i) entered into the transaction primarily \"to reduce risk of currency fluctuations with respect to property which is held or to be held by the taxpayer,\" id. &#167; 988(d)(2)(A)(i), and (ii) identified the transaction as a section 988 hedging transaction.

Capital Gain on Real Estate Sale</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government follows up with the contention that \"the cost and selling price of the [residence] should be expressed in American currency at the rate of exchange prevailing as of the date of the purchase and the date of the sale, respectively.\"   Rev.

They argue, however, that the 343,147 pound adjusted cost basis of the residence, consisting of the 297,500 pound purchase price and the 45,647 pounds paid for capital improvements, likewise should be expressed in U.S. dollar terms as of the date of the sale.   Appellants correctly state that, viewed \"in the foreign currency in which it was transacted,\" the purchase generated a 110,227 pound gain as of the date of the sale, which translates to approximately $200,000 at the $1.82 per pound exchange rate.  Therefore, they say, the difference between the approximate $300,000 gain under the government's computation, and the $200,000 gain appellants suggest, approximates a $100,000 unrealized foreign exchange gain on the residence that resulted from the increase in the dollar-pound exchange rate between the dates the residence was bought and sold.  However fair and reasonable their argument may be, it amounts to an untenable attempt to convert their \"functional currency\" from the U.S. dollar to the pound sterling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under I.R.C. &#167; 985(b)(1), use of a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is restricted to qualified business units (\"QBU\"s).

Although appellants correctly assert that their residence was purchased \"for a pound-denominated value\" while they were \"living and working in a pound-denominated economy,\" under I.R.C. &#167; 989(a) a QBU must be a \"separate and clearly identified unit of trade or business of a taxpayer which maintains separate books and records.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 989(a).  And since appellants concede that the purchase and sale of their residence was not carried out by a QBU, the district court properly rejected their plea to treat the pound as their functional currency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Sixteenth Amendment Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants launch a double-barreled claim that the income taxation at issue in this case was imposed in violation of the Sixteenth Amendment.  The Sixteenth Amendment eliminated any requirement that \"income taxes\" imposed by Congress be apportioned among the states.  See Eisner, 252 U.S. at 205, 40 S.Ct. at 192.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Since Eisner, the Supreme Court has described \" 'income' ... in its constitutional sense,\" as \"instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.\"  Commissioner v.

Federal income tax deductions are matters of legislative grace.  Welch v. United States, 750 F.2d 1101, 1106 (1st Cir.1985) (citing New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 435, 440, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790, 78 L.Ed. 1348 (1934)).  The nonintegrated tax treatment Congress accords the acquisition, sale, and financing of appellants' residence simply renders nondeductible the foreign exchange loss on their foreign-currency denominated mortgage loan.  As we have made clear in the past, Congress possesses plenary power to determine allowable deductions from the gross income it has elected to tax.  See State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Worcester v. Commissioner, 246 F.2d 319, 324 (1st Cir.1957) (citing Helvering v. Independent Life Ins. Co., 292 U.S. 371, 381, 54 S.Ct. 758, 760, 78 L.Ed. 1311 (1934)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Their argument attempts to revive the \"functional currency\" debate already discussed.  See supra pps. 29-30.  As the government points out, to purchase property with a foreign currency necessarily places the individual United States taxpayer \"in a position to gain or lose from a change in the exchange rate....\"  Should the foreign currency increase in value (as against the dollar) by the time the property is sold, the resulting gain in U.S. dollars, the functional currency of the individual United States taxpayer, plainly qualifies as realized income, fully taxable under the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed.

The entire purchase price was financed through a mortgage loan in pounds sterling.  On October 12, 1988, it was increased to 330,000 pounds (exchange rate:  $1.73 to 1 pound);  on March 27, 1990, to 333,180 pounds (exchange rate $1.62 to 1 pound).  Ultimately, their capital improvements to the residence cost 45,647 pounds.  No U.S. funds were used either to purchase or improve the residence.  On July 27, 1990, it was sold for 453,374 pounds, net of selling expenses, and the mortgage loan was retired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' 1990 joint federal income tax return originally reported a $308,811 capital gain, utilizing the exchange rate at date of purchase ($1.49 to 1 pound) to calculate the adjusted cost basis, but using the exchange rate at date of sale ($1.82 to 1 pound) to calculate the sale price.  Appellants later amended their 1990 return to claim a $30,610 refund arrived at by utilizing the exchange rate at date of sale ($1.82 to 1 pound) to determine the adjusted cost basis as well as the sale price, thus resulting in a reduced $199,491 capital gain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Internal Revenue Service disallowed their amended refund claim, appellants initiated the present action.

Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"234573\"><a href=\"/opinion/234573/willard-helburn-inc-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1954), and that the tax imposed violates the Sixteenth Amendment, see Eisner v.

The government responded that the total cost basis of the residence must be arrived at by utilizing the respective dollar-pound exchange rates in effect when the residence was purchased and each capital-improvement payment was made.  The parties stipulated that, thus calculated, appellants had overpaid $2,668, plus related interest and penalties not presently relevant.  Ultimately, the district court entered judgment for appellants in the amount of $2,668 plus interest and penalties as provided by law.  On appeal, appellants challenge the district court order rejecting their motion for summary judgment in the larger amount of $30,610.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <p>A.

Under section 1012, generally the basis of property is its cost.  Id. &#167; 1012.

With exceptions not relevant here, section 165(a) permits \"a deduction [for] any loss sustained during the taxable year....\"  Id. &#167; 165(a).  Finally and importantly, in relevant part section 165(c) limits the deductions available to individual United States taxpayers to \"(1) losses incurred in a trade or business [and] (2) losses incurred in any transaction entered into for profit, though not connected with a trade or business....\"  Id. &#167; 165(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Nonetheless, says the government, appellants may not offset their mortgage-loan-transaction loss against their real-estate-transaction gain, because \"the borrowing and repayment of the mortgage loan is a separate transaction from the purchase and sale of the personal residence.\"   Rev.

The nonintegrated tax treatment Congress accords the acquisition, sale, and financing of appellants' residence simply renders nondeductible the foreign exchange loss on their foreign-currency denominated mortgage loan.  As we have made clear in the past, Congress possesses plenary power to determine allowable deductions from the gross income it has elected to tax.  See State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Worcester v.

Their argument attempts to revive the \"functional currency\" debate already discussed.  See supra pps. 29-30.  As the government points out, to purchase property with a foreign currency necessarily places the individual United States taxpayer \"in a position to gain or lose from a change in the exchange rate....\"  Should the foreign currency increase in value (as against the dollar) by the time the property is sold, the resulting gain in U.S. dollars, the functional currency of the individual United States taxpayer, plainly qualifies as realized income, fully taxable under the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed.
