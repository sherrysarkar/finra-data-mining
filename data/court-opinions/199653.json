George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Carolyn E. O'Connor on brief pro se.\n     Mary P. Harrington, Kathleen M. O'Hagan and Ronan, Segal &\nHarrington on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            April 11, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam. This court previously affirmed the lower\n\ncourt's     judgment       dismissing       the      instant     employment\n\ndiscrimination suit pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\nAfter   this   court     affirmed,    appellant     Carolyn     E.   O'Connor\n\n(\"O'Connor\") filed a timely petition for a writ of certiorari\n\nwith the United States Supreme Court.               On June 17, 2002, the\n\nSupreme   Court   issued     a   summary    order    granting    O'Connor's\n\npetition and remanding the matter to this court for further\n\nreview in light of that Court's recent decision in Swierkiewicz\n\nv. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002).          Accordingly, we directed\n\nthe parties to submit supplemental briefing on the issue of\n\nwhether Swierkiewicz required a different result here.                   The\n\nparties have briefed the issue, and the matter is now ready for\n\ndecision.\n\n            After a thorough review of the submissions, the\n\nrecord and the Supreme Court's decision in Swierkiewicz, we\n\nagain affirm the district court's dismissal of the Complaint.\n\nSwierkiewicz      held    that    a    Complaint      in   an    employment\n\ndiscrimination lawsuit need not set out the elements of a prima\n\nfacie case as spelled out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n\n411 U.S. 792 (1973), in order to survive a motion to dismiss\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).             This court did not hold\n\nO'Connor's Complaint to that heightened pleading standard when\n\nit affirmed the dismissal of her lawsuit.              Rather, this court\n\nconcluded that the Complaint failed to state a valid claim for\n\n                                      -2-\n\freligious discrimination because it did not allege that she was\n\nfired for a reason prohibited by Title VII, i.e., that she was\n\nfired because of her religion.      Indeed, the Complaint seems to\n\nadmit that no one with decision-making authority had any\n\nknowledge of O'Connor's religious affiliation.          The fact that\n\none who lacked authority to fire her may have -- unbeknownst to\n\nmanagement -- harbored animosity toward her because of her\n\nreligion is insufficient to state a claim that she was fired in\n\nviolation of Title VII.      See Shorette v. Rite Aid of Maine,\n\nInc., 155 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1998) (motivations or remarks of\n\nthose who lack hiring and firing authority over the plaintiff\n\ncannot form the basis for an employment discrimination claim\n\nabsent a hostile work environment claim); see also Weston-Smith\n\nv. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., 282 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (post-Swierkiewicz; approving rule from Shorette). Thus,\n\nO'Connor's Complaint failed to satisfy the requirement of Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 8 and of Swierkiewicz that it include \"a short and\n\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\nentitled   to   relief.\"    For   this   reason,   it   was   properly\n\ndismissed.\n\n             Likewise, nothing in Swierkiewicz alters this court's\n\nconclusion that to the extent O'Connor attempted to state a\n\nclaim that she was subjected to a hostile work environment, her\n\nclaim was legally insufficient.          See O'Rourke v. City of\n\nProvidence, 235 F.3d 713, 728 (1st Cir. 2001).           Finally, it\n\n                                  -3-\n\fremains true that her age and sex discrimination claims were\n\nproperly   dismissed   for    failure    to   include   them   in   her\n\nadministrative charge.       See 29 U.S.C. ยง 636(d); 42 U.S.C. ยง\n\n2000e-5(f); Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456, 464 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n           The   judgment    of   the   lower   court   is   affirmed.\n\nAppellant's motion to go forward with discovery is denied.\n\nAppellant's motion for reimbursement of filing fee is denied,\n\nas not properly directed to this court.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
