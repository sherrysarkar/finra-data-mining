On July 6,  1995, Defendant-\r                    TORRUELLA,  Chief Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nAppellant Michael P. Fosher (\"Fosher\") pled guilty to four counts\r\n\nof an indictment, which charged him with racketeering conspiracy,\r\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.    1962(d), racketeering, in  violation\r\n\nof  18  U.S.C.    1962(c),  interstate  transportation  of stolen\r\n\nproperty, in  violation of 18  U.S.C.   2314, and  conspiracy, in\r\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.   371.  On  March 5, 1996, the sentencing\r\n\ncourt  imposed  upward  adjustments for  an  unusually vulnerable\r\n\nvictim and for Fosher's  role in the offense.   The court further\r\n\ndetermined  that Fosher's armed bank robbery conviction under the\r\n\nFederal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C.   5005 et seq. (\"FYCA\"),\r                                                                 \r\n\npreviously set aside  pursuant to that Act, was properly included\r\n\nin the Criminal History Category calculation.  The district court\r\n\ncalculated Fosher's  Total Offense Level  at 33 and  his Criminal\r\n\nHistory  Category at  III, resulting  in  a guideline  sentencing\r\n\nrange of 168  to 210 months.   The government requested that,  in\r\n\nlight  of  Fosher's  substantial assistance,  the  court  grant a\r\n\ndownward departure under   5K1.1  and impose a 60 month sentence.\r\n\nThe court granted the government's downward departure motion, and\r\n\nsentenced Fosher to 78 months' imprisonment.  Fosher  appeals his\r\n\nsentence, arguing that  the district court  erred in its  rulings\r\n\nregarding  the unusually vulnerable  victim and  the role  in the\r\n\noffense  adjustments,  as  well  as  its  inclusion  in  Fosher's\r\n\nCriminal History Category  of his set-aside conviction  under the\r\n\nFYCA.  For the reasons set forth herein, we reverse and remand in\r\n\npart and affirm in part.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In  presenting the  facts, we  consult the  uncontested\r\n\nportions  of  the  Presentence  Report (\"PSR\"),  as  well  as the\r\n\nsentencing hearing transcript.  United States v. Lagasse, 87 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n18, 20 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n          In December 1991, Fosher called Michael Chinn (\"Chinn\")\r\n\nfrom Florida and told Chinn that he would  pay Chinn's airfare to\r\n\nFlorida so  that they could  do \"something big.\"   Chinn flew  to\r\n\nFort  Lauderdale with  Anthony  Corso  (\"Corso\").    The  airline\r\n\ntickets for  both were  purchased by Fosher.   Chinn  stayed with\r\n\nFosher, while Corso  stayed with his father, Philip  Corso.  Upon\r\n\narrival  in Fort  Lauderdale, Chinn  and  Corso were  taken by  a\r\n\nfriend of Philip  Corso to a  restaurant to meet  Fosher and  Joe\r\n\nBomengo  (\"Bomengo\").   During  lunch, Fosher  told them  about a\r\n\nhouse he had targeted  for a home invasion.  Donald  Marks Schoff\r\n\n(\"Schoff\") had told  Fosher that the house  contained $500,000 in\r\n\ngold coins and a five carat diamond ring and was occupied by a 62\r\n\nyear old  woman, her daughter  and granddaughter.   Fosher stated\r\n\nthat he  wanted Chinn  and Corso  to  enter the  house, while  he\r\n\nwaited outside  in a  van and  Schoff waited  at the  end of  the\r\n\nstreet listening to a police  scanner.  They also discussed using\r\n\nweapons  and   Fosher  unsuccessfully  sought  weapons   from  an\r\n\nacquaintance he ran into in the restaurant.\r\n\n          Thereafter, Fosher,  Chinn, Corso, Bomengo,  and Schoff\r\n\nmet Philip  Corso at Corso's  house.  Schoff described  where the\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmoney was kept.  The  participants looked at some guns  at Philip\r\n\nCorso's  house and  wanted  to  borrow the  guns.   Philip  Corso\r\n\ndeclined to let  the group use  the guns because  the guns  \"were\r\n\nhardly needed  since the  victim was  an older  woman.\"   At  the\r\n\nmeeting,  Bomengo suggested that the participants pose as florist\r\n\ndelivery  men.   Fosher determined  that  he would  rent a  white\r\n\nminivan to  resemble  a  florist  delivery  truck.    During  the\r\n\ndiscussion,  Fosher  made  decisions and  assigned  roles  to the\r\n\nparticipants.\r\n\n          On  the  morning  of January  8,  1992,  Fosher, Chinn,\r\n\nCorso, and Schoff executed the home invasion.  Fosher, Chinn, and\r\n\nCorso  drove to  the  victim's  house in  the  van, while  Schoff\r\n\nfollowed in a second car.  On the way to the victim's house, they\r\n\npurchased a floral arrangement and  gloves and \"ties\" to bind the\r\n\nvictims.    Corso and  Chinn  went  to the  front  door with  the\r\n\nflowers.  When the victim came to the door, they entered.   Corso\r\n\nasked her  for  the keys  to the  floor safe  in  the garage  and\r\n\nattempted to open it.   Fosher and Schoff  entered the garage  to\r\n\nhelp him.   Upon opening the safe, they  discovered only $500,000\r\n\nworth  of gold coins.   They approached the  victim and asked her\r\n\nwhere the other safe  and the five carat diamond ring  were.  The\r\n\nmen  took the  victim to  her  jewelry lockbox  and took  jewelry\r\n\nvalued at $23,000.   When they were  unable to find a  five carat\r\n\ndiamond, Fosher told Chinn, within the hearing of the victim, \"if\r\n\nshe doesn't tell you where the other safe is, shoot her.\"   Chinn\r\n\ntold the victim that he would not let them hurt her.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          When they  left the  victim's house,  the four  went to\r\n\nFosher's condominium, where they divided the coins.   Fosher made\r\n\nCorso throw away the jewelry for fear that it might allow someone\r\n\nto  identify them.   Corso left  Florida soon  thereafter, taking\r\n\n$80,000 in coins with him  to Massachusetts.  Chinn also returned\r\n\nto  Massachusetts, carrying cash  received from Fosher  after the\r\n\ncoins had been melted down.\r\n\n          On May 11,  1995, a federal grand jury  returned a five\r\n\ncount indictment against Fosher and Corso.  On  June  27,   1995,\r\n\nFosher executed a plea and  cooperation agreement with the United\r\n\nStates Attorney's Office, agreeing to plead guilty to four counts\r\n\nof the indictment.1   The agreement provided that, at sentencing,\r\n\nthe  government would take  the position under  the United States\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines  (\"U.S.S.G.\") that  Fosher's offense  level\r\n\nwas 33, for which the guideline  sentencing range was 135 to  168\r\n\nmonths.   The  agreement  noted  that  Fosher  objected  to  this\r\n\ncalculation and reserved  the right to argue for  a lower offense\r\n\nlevel.    Fosher agreed  to  cooperate with  the  government and,\r\n\nassuming  he provided substantial  assistance, the  U.S. Attorney\r\n\nagreed to file a motion for a two level downward adjustment under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K1.1.\r\n\n          On July  6,  1995, Fosher  pled  guilty to  Counts  One\r\n\nthrough  Four.   At his  March 5,  1996, sentencing  hearing, the\r\n\nprobation department presented  its PSR, in which  the department\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   The United States  Attorney's Office agreed to  dismissed the\r\nfifth count.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nconcluded  that the  four  counts  constituted  seven  groups  of\r\n\noffenses.    The  probation department  calculated  the  Adjusted\r\n\nOffense Level  for  each  group and  determined  that  the  group\r\n\nrelating to  an  invasion and  robbery,  executed by  Fosher  and\r\n\nothers, of the  home of a 62  year old Fort Lauderdale  woman had\r\n\nthe highest Adjusted  Offense Level at 33.   This included a two-\r\n\nlevel  upward adjustment for an unusually vulnerable victim under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3A1.12 and a four-level  upward adjustment for being a\r\n\nleader or organizer of five or more participants under U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n3B1.1.3  After applying the grouping rules under U.S.S.G.   3D1.4\r\n\nand  providing  for  a  downward  adjustment  for  acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility, the probation department  concluded that Fosher's\r\n\nTotal Offense Level was 33.\r\n\n          The  probation   department  concluded   that  Fosher's\r\n\nCriminal History Category was III, including in the calculation a\r\n\nconviction for armed bank robbery under the FYCA.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Section 3A1.1(b) provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          If the  defendant knew  or should  have known\r\n          that a  victim of the  offense was  unusually\r\n          vulnerable  due to  age,  physical or  mental\r\n          condition, . . . increase by 2 levels.\r\n\n3  Section 3B1.1(a) provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          Based on the defendant's role in the offense,\r\n          increase the offense level as follows:\r\n\n          (a)  If the  defendant was  an organizer\r\n               or  leader of  a criminal  activity\r\n               that   involved   five    or   more\r\n               participants   or   was   otherwise\r\n               extensive, increase by 4 levels.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          On  February 26, 1996,  Fosher filed objections  to the\r\n\nupward adjustments  in calculation of  the offense level  for the\r\n\nFort Lauderdale  home invasion and  to the inclusion of  his FYCA\r\n\nconviction  in the  Criminal History  Category  calculation.   He\r\n\nargued that  the FYCA conviction should not be considered because\r\n\nit  had been \"set  aside\" pursuant to  the FYCA on  September 24,\r\n\n1982.\r\n\n          At the  sentencing hearing,  the district court  agreed\r\n\nwith the findings  in the PSR and imposed  upward adjustments for\r\n\nan  unusually vulnerable  victim  and for  Fosher's  role in  the\r\n\noffense.    The  court  further  determined  that  Fosher's  FYCA\r\n\nconviction was properly included in the Criminal History Category\r\n\ncalculation.  The  district court, therefore, set  Fosher's Total\r\n\nOffense Level  at 33  and his Criminal  History Category  at III,\r\n\nresulting in a  guideline sentencing range of 168  to 210 months.\r\n\nThe  government submitted a  motion requesting that,  in light of\r\n\nFosher's  substantial  assistance,  the court  grant  a  downward\r\n\ndeparture and impose a 60-month  sentence.  The court allowed the\r\n\ngovernment's    5K1.1 downward  departure  motion, but  sentenced\r\n\nFosher to 78 months' imprisonment.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\nI.  Unusually vulnerable victim\r          I.  Unusually vulnerable victim\r\n\n          The  government insists that  the issue of  whether the\r\n\nvictim  of the  Fort  Lauderdale  home  invasion  was  \"unusually\r\n\nvulnerable\" is a factual issue and therefore that the clear error\r\n\nstandard applies.  Fosher argues  vigorously that the facts being\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nundisputed, the  only question  presented is a  legal one  of the\r\n\nsentencing  court's application of  the guidelines to  the facts,\r\n\nrequiring de  novo review.    \"[Q]uestions .  . .  of the  proper\r                            \r\n\napplication of  a legal  standard to undisputed  facts . .  . are\r\n\nusually called 'mixed questions' of fact and law.\"  United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

As  our cases in\r                   \r\n\nthis   context  amply  demonstrate,  such  issues  of  sentencing\r\n\napplication  are   often  difficult   to  pigeonhole  as   either\r\n\npredominantly factual  or legal.    See, e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nNewman,  982 F.2d  665, 671  (1st  Cir. 1992);  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPilgrim Market  Corp., 944  F.2d 14, 16  (1st Cir.  1991); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Gill, 99 F.3d  484, 486 (1st  Cir. 1996).   The\r                                \r\n\nquestion is  whether  \"'a particular  victim was  less likely  to\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthwart the crime, rather than  more likely to suffer harm  if the\r\n\ncrime is  successful.'\"  Id.

At the same time, we have recognized  that in some\r\n\ncases   inferences  to  be   drawn  regarding   particular  class\r\n\ncharacteristics may be so strong  that \"there can be little doubt\r\n\nabout unusual vulnerability  of class members within  the meaning\r\n\nof  section  3A1.1.\"   Gill,  99  F.3d at  487.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3A1.1 comment. n.2; see also Gill, 99 F.3d at 487.\r                                                      \r\n\n          We  are concerned with the application of section 3A1.1\r\n\nin  the context  of  this case.    The PSR  revealed  that Fosher\r\n\nsurveyed the victim's home and determined that it was occupied by\r\n\nan  elderly woman,  her  daughter,  and  her  daughter's  infant.\r\n\nFollowing this surveillance, the perpetrators declined the use of\r\n\nweapons to commit the robbery.  Based on the victim's age and the\r\n\nperpetrators' decision  that  the use  of  weapons would  not  be\r\n\nnecessary,  the  district  court concluded  that  Fosher  knew or\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nshould  have  known that  the  victim  in  this case  would  have\r\n\n\"impaired capacity\" to prevent the  entry into and robbery of her\r\n\nhome.  From  our review of  the record, it  appears the  district\r\n\ncourt failed to address the \"individual characteristics\" required\r\n\nto  support a  finding  that a  particular  victim was  unusually\r\n\nvulnerable.    Because of  this conclusion,  we must  remand this\r\n\nissue to the district court for its consideration.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nII.  Role in the offense\r          II.  Role in the offense\r\n\n          We  review a  district  court's  role  in  the  offense\r\n\ndeterminations  for clear error.   See United States v. D'Andrea,\r                                                                          \r\n\n107 F.3d  949, 956 (1st Cir. 1997).   A court making a four-level\r\n\nrole-in-the-offense  adjustment under  U.S.S.G. section  3B1.1(a)\r\n\nmust  first  determine   \"whether  the  defendant  acted   as  an\r\n\norganizer/leader of  a specific  criminal activity.   If so,  the\r\n\ncourt  asks  the  separate  question  of  whether  that  criminal\r\n\nactivity  involved  five  or more  participants,  defined  in the\r\n\nCommentary as  persons who  are 'criminally  responsible for  the\r\n\ncommission of the  offense . . .  .'\"  United States  v. Preakos,\r                                                                          \r\n\n907  F.2d  7, 10  (1st  Cir.  1990)  (quoting U.S.S.G.     3B1.1,\r\n\nCommentary).  In determining a  defendant's role in the  offense,\r\n\nthe  sentencing   court  need  not  look  only  to  the  elements\r\n\nunderlying the conviction,  but may  consider \"the  whole of  the\r\n\ndefendant's relevant conduct.\"  United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n612, 615 (1st  Cir. 1993); see also U.S.S.G. Ch. 3, Pt. B, intro.\r                                             \r\n\ncomment.  Fosher does not challenge the sentencing court's status\r\n\ndetermination.   His  argument focuses  on  whether the  district\r\n\ncourt  properly found five participants in  the home invasion and\r\n\nrobbery.\r\n\n          The commentary defines a \"participant\" as \"a person who\r\n\nis criminally  responsible for the commission of the offense, but\r\n\nneed not  have been convicted.\"   U.S.S.G.   3B1.1  comment. app.\r\n\nn.1.  Fosher concedes that there were four criminally responsible\r\n\nparticipants:  him, Chinn, Corso,  and Schoff.  At the sentencing\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nhearing, the government argued that both Philip Corso and Bomengo\r\n\nwere criminally responsible participants even though they did not\r\n\nactually participate in  the robbery.  We need  only confirm that\r\n\none  of them was  a criminally responsible  participant to affirm\r\n\nthe   district  court's  upward   adjustment.     Philip  Corso's\r\n\nassistance  in devising the perpetrator's scheme is sufficient to\r\n\nfind  that  he  is  a  participant  within  the  meaning  of  the\r\n\nguidelines.   Philip  Corso  assisted  Schoff  in  targeting  the\r\n\nvictim's home for the commission of this robbery, he provided the\r\n\nhome in which the planning meeting took place, he participated in\r\n\nthe planning meeting with the four robbery perpetrators,  and, in\r\n\nresponse to  the perpetrators'  discussion regarding  the use  of\r\n\nweapons, he  advised  against the  necessity of  weapons to  gain\r\n\nentry into the victim's home.  Such acts were sufficient  to find\r\n\nPhilip  Corso to  be  a  participant in  the  commission of  this\r\n\nrobbery.  We therefore find no error in the district court's role\r\n\nin the offense determination.\r\n\nIII.  Criminal History Category\r          III.  Criminal History Category\r\n\n          In 1977,  Fosher was  convicted of  armed bank  robbery\r\n\nunder the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C.   5005 et seq.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(repealed  1984).  In  1982,  pursuant  to  the  Act's  set-aside\r\n\nprovisions,  see 18  U.S.C.    5021,  Fosher was  unconditionally\r                          \r\n\ndischarged and his conviction  was set aside.  Fosher  challenges\r\n\nthe sentencing court's inclusion of his FYCA set-aside conviction\r\n\nin the calculation  of his Criminal History Category.   He claims\r\n\nthat his set-aside  conviction is to be treated  as an \"expunged\"\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nconviction under  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2.   We have yet  to address the\r\n\nissue of whether a conviction set  aside under the FYCA should be\r\n\ncounted  under the Sentencing Guidelines.4   When faced with this\r\n\nissue, a majority  of our sister circuits have ruled that an FYCA\r\n\nconviction  may properly be included in calculating a defendant's\r\n\ncriminal history, see United States v. Moreno, 94 F.3d 1453 (10th\r                                                       \r\n\nCir.  1996); United  States v.

Kammerdiener, 945 F.2d 300 (9th Cir. 1991).5\r                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   Fosher claims that two  opinions of this circuit  relating to\r\nthe  FYCA support his  contention that his  set-aside convictions\r\nmay not  be included in  calculating his criminal history.   Both\r\nopinions  are  inapposite,  as  neither  was  decided  under  the\r\nSentencing Guidelines.   See United States v. Doe,  732 F.2d 229,\r                                                           \r\n232 (1st Cir. 1984)  (ruling that FYCA does  not allow record  of\r\nconviction to  be destroyed  and noting that  the FYCA  set aside\r\nprovision \"prevents the fact of conviction from being used to the\r\nyouth offender's  legal detriment\");  Mestre Morera  v. INS,  462\r                                                                     \r\nF.2d 1030, 1032  (1st Cir. 1972) (in ruling  that FYCA conviction\r\nmay not  be used  to deport petitioner,  finding that  purpose of\r\nFYCA is to give  an offender \"a second chance, free  of all taint\r\nof a conviction\").\r\n\n5    Fosher also  cites  opinions  from  two other  circuits  for\r\nsupport,  but none  of those  opinions ruled that  FYCA set-aside\r\nconvictions are not  to be counted under  the guidelines criminal\r\nhistory provisions.   See United States v. Corrado,  53 F.3d 620,\r                                                            \r\n621 n.1 (3d Cir. 1995) (noting that government conceded that FYCA\r\nconviction should not be counted); United States v.

The\r\n\nCommentary provides the following:\r\n\n          A  number   of  jurisdictions   have  various\r\n          procedures   pursuant   to   which   previous\r\n          convictions may be set aside or the defendant\r\n          may  be  pardoned  for reasons  unrelated  to\r\n          innocence or errors of law, e.g., in order to\r                                                    \r\n          restore civil rights or  to remove the stigma\r\n          associated   with   a   criminal  conviction.\r\n          Sentences resulting from such convictions are\r\n          to be counted.  However, expunged convictions\r\n          are not to be counted.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.2,  comment app. note 10.   A set-aside  under the\r\n\nFYCA is  made for  \"reasons unrelated to  innocence or  errors of\r\n\nlaw\"  of the  type  that  the guidelines  contemplate  are to  be\r\n\nconsidered  in calculating Criminal  History.  The  FYCA, section\r\n\n5021, provided:\r\n\n          (a)  Upon the unconditional  discharge by the\r\n          Commission  of  a  committed  youth  offender\r\n          before the expiration of the maximum sentence\r\n          imposed  upon him,  the  conviction shall  be\r\n          automatically  set aside  and the  Commission\r\n          shall   issue  to   the   youth  offender   a\r\n          certificate to that effect.\r\n\n          (b)  Where  a youth offender has  been placed\r\n          on probation  by  the court,  the  court  may\r\n          thereafter,      in      its      discretion,\r\n          unconditionally discharge such youth offender\r\n          from probation prior to the expiration of the\r\n          maximum period of probation theretofore fixed\r\n          by   the   court,   which   discharge   shall\r\n          automatically set  aside the  conviction, and\r\n          the court shall issue to the youth offender a\r\n          certificate to that effect.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nCir. 1992)  (holding that  sealed record  under Vermont  juvenile\r\nstatute   was   improperly   considered   in   criminal   history\r\ncalculation).\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    5021 (repealed).   The language of  the statute does\r\n\nnot call  for expunging a  youth offender's records,  but instead\r\n\nmandates  that the youth offender  shall receive a certificate to\r\n\nthe effect that  the conviction has been set aside.  A conviction\r\n\nunder  the  FYCA is  set  aside  not because  of  legal  error or\r\n\ninnocence, but  because the offender's  \"post-offense conduct has\r\n\npersuaded the court to terminate his sentence of probation before\r\n\nthe assigned  completion date.\"   United States v.  McDonald, 991\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 866, 871 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (analyzing a set-aside  conviction\r\n\nunder  the  District  of  Columbia's  Youth  Rehabilitation  Act,\r\n\nanalogous to the FYCA).  The  FYCA's use of the term \"set  aside\"\r\n\nis not  the  same  as the  Guideline's  treatment  of  \"expunged\"\r\n\nconvictions,  but is more analogous to the Guideline's definition\r\n\nof a  \"set aside\" conviction,  one that is  to be counted  in the\r\n\ncriminal history  calculation.   Moreover, had Congress  intended\r\n\nthat all records of a youthful conviction  under the FYCA be made\r\n\ncompletely  unavailable  or  destroyed such  that  they  could no\r\n\nlonger be considered for any future purposes, Congress could have\r\n\nspecified the remedy of expungement  rather than a certificate of\r\n\nset-aside.

Fosher (\"Fosher\") pled guilty to four counts\r\n\nof an indictment, which charged him with racketeering conspiracy,\r\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.    1962(d), racketeering, in  violation\r\n\nof  18  U.S.C.    1962(c),  interstate  transportation  of stolen\r\n\nproperty, in  violation of 18  U.S.C.   2314, and  conspiracy, in\r\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.   371.  On  March 5, 1996, the sentencing\r\n\ncourt  imposed  upward  adjustments for  an  unusually vulnerable\r\n\nvictim and for Fosher's  role in the offense.   The court further\r\n\ndetermined  that Fosher's armed bank robbery conviction under the\r\n\nFederal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C.   5005 et seq. (\"FYCA\"),\r                                                                 \r\n\npreviously set aside  pursuant to that Act, was properly included\r\n\nin the Criminal History Category calculation.  The district court\r\n\ncalculated Fosher's  Total Offense Level  at 33 and  his Criminal\r\n\nHistory  Category at  III, resulting  in  a guideline  sentencing\r\n\nrange of 168  to 210 months.   The government requested that,  in\r\n\nlight  of  Fosher's  substantial assistance,  the  court  grant a\r\n\ndownward departure under   5K1.1  and impose a 60 month sentence.\r\n\nThe court granted the government's downward departure motion, and\r\n\nsentenced Fosher to 78 months' imprisonment.  Fosher  appeals his\r\n\nsentence, arguing that  the district court  erred in its  rulings\r\n\nregarding  the unusually vulnerable  victim and  the role  in the\r\n\noffense  adjustments,  as  well  as  its  inclusion  in  Fosher's\r\n\nCriminal History Category  of his set-aside conviction  under the\r\n\nFYCA.

The  airline\r\n\ntickets for  both were  purchased by Fosher.   Chinn  stayed with\r\n\nFosher, while Corso  stayed with his father, Philip  Corso.  Upon\r\n\narrival  in Fort  Lauderdale, Chinn  and  Corso were  taken by  a\r\n\nfriend of Philip  Corso to a  restaurant to meet  Fosher and  Joe\r\n\nBomengo  (\"Bomengo\").   During  lunch, Fosher  told them  about a\r\n\nhouse he had targeted  for a home invasion.  Donald  Marks Schoff\r\n\n(\"Schoff\") had told  Fosher that the house  contained $500,000 in\r\n\ngold coins and a five carat diamond ring and was occupied by a 62\r\n\nyear old  woman, her daughter  and granddaughter.   Fosher stated\r\n\nthat he  wanted Chinn  and Corso  to  enter the  house, while  he\r\n\nwaited outside  in a  van and  Schoff waited  at the  end of  the\r\n\nstreet listening to a police  scanner.  They also discussed using\r\n\nweapons  and   Fosher  unsuccessfully  sought  weapons   from  an\r\n\nacquaintance he ran into in the restaurant.\r\n\n          Thereafter, Fosher,  Chinn, Corso, Bomengo,  and Schoff\r\n\nmet Philip  Corso at Corso's  house.  Schoff described  where the\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmoney was kept.  The  participants looked at some guns  at Philip\r\n\nCorso's  house and  wanted  to  borrow the  guns.   Philip  Corso\r\n\ndeclined to let  the group use  the guns because  the guns  \"were\r\n\nhardly needed  since the  victim was  an older  woman.\"   At  the\r\n\nmeeting,  Bomengo suggested that the participants pose as florist\r\n\ndelivery  men.   Fosher determined  that  he would  rent a  white\r\n\nminivan to  resemble  a  florist  delivery  truck.    During  the\r\n\ndiscussion,  Fosher  made  decisions and  assigned  roles  to the\r\n\nparticipants.\r\n\n          On  the  morning  of January  8,  1992,  Fosher, Chinn,\r\n\nCorso, and Schoff executed the home invasion.  Fosher, Chinn, and\r\n\nCorso  drove to  the  victim's  house in  the  van, while  Schoff\r\n\nfollowed in a second car.  On the way to the victim's house, they\r\n\npurchased a floral arrangement and  gloves and \"ties\" to bind the\r\n\nvictims.    Corso and  Chinn  went  to the  front  door with  the\r\n\nflowers.  When the victim came to the door, they entered.   Corso\r\n\nasked her  for  the keys  to the  floor safe  in  the garage  and\r\n\nattempted to open it.   Fosher and Schoff  entered the garage  to\r\n\nhelp him.   Upon opening the safe, they  discovered only $500,000\r\n\nworth  of gold coins.   They approached the  victim and asked her\r\n\nwhere the other safe  and the five carat diamond ring  were.  The\r\n\nmen  took the  victim to  her  jewelry lockbox  and took  jewelry\r\n\nvalued at $23,000.   When they were  unable to find a  five carat\r\n\ndiamond, Fosher told Chinn, within the hearing of the victim, \"if\r\n\nshe doesn't tell you where the other safe is, shoot her.\"   Chinn\r\n\ntold the victim that he would not let them hurt her.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          When they  left the  victim's house,  the four  went to\r\n\nFosher's condominium, where they divided the coins.   Fosher made\r\n\nCorso throw away the jewelry for fear that it might allow someone\r\n\nto  identify them.   Corso left  Florida soon  thereafter, taking\r\n\n$80,000 in coins with him  to Massachusetts.  Chinn also returned\r\n\nto  Massachusetts, carrying cash  received from Fosher  after the\r\n\ncoins had been melted down.\r\n\n          On May 11,  1995, a federal grand jury  returned a five\r\n\ncount indictment against Fosher and Corso.  On  June  27,   1995,\r\n\nFosher executed a plea and  cooperation agreement with the United\r\n\nStates Attorney's Office, agreeing to plead guilty to four counts\r\n\nof the indictment.1   The agreement provided that, at sentencing,\r\n\nthe  government would take  the position under  the United States\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines  (\"U.S.S.G.\") that  Fosher's offense  level\r\n\nwas 33, for which the guideline  sentencing range was 135 to  168\r\n\nmonths.   The  agreement  noted  that  Fosher  objected  to  this\r\n\ncalculation and reserved  the right to argue for  a lower offense\r\n\nlevel.    Fosher agreed  to  cooperate with  the  government and,\r\n\nassuming  he provided substantial  assistance, the  U.S. Attorney\r\n\nagreed to file a motion for a two level downward adjustment under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5K1.1.\r\n\n          On July  6,  1995, Fosher  pled  guilty to  Counts  One\r\n\nthrough  Four.   At his  March 5,  1996, sentencing  hearing, the\r\n\nprobation department presented  its PSR, in which  the department\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   The United States  Attorney's Office agreed to  dismissed the\r\nfifth count.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nconcluded  that the  four  counts  constituted  seven  groups  of\r\n\noffenses.    The  probation department  calculated  the  Adjusted\r\n\nOffense Level  for  each  group and  determined  that  the  group\r\n\nrelating to  an  invasion and  robbery,  executed by  Fosher  and\r\n\nothers, of the  home of a 62  year old Fort Lauderdale  woman had\r\n\nthe highest Adjusted  Offense Level at 33.   This included a two-\r\n\nlevel  upward adjustment for an unusually vulnerable victim under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3A1.12 and a four-level  upward adjustment for being a\r\n\nleader or organizer of five or more participants under U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n3B1.1.3  After applying the grouping rules under U.S.S.G.   3D1.4\r\n\nand  providing  for  a  downward  adjustment  for  acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility, the probation department  concluded that Fosher's\r\n\nTotal Offense Level was 33.\r\n\n          The  probation   department  concluded   that  Fosher's\r\n\nCriminal History Category was III, including in the calculation a\r\n\nconviction for armed bank robbery under the FYCA.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Section 3A1.1(b) provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          If the  defendant knew  or should  have known\r\n          that a  victim of the  offense was  unusually\r\n          vulnerable  due to  age,  physical or  mental\r\n          condition, . . . increase by 2 levels.\r\n\n3  Section 3B1.1(a) provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          Based on the defendant's role in the offense,\r\n          increase the offense level as follows:\r\n\n          (a)  If the  defendant was  an organizer\r\n               or  leader of  a criminal  activity\r\n               that   involved   five    or   more\r\n               participants   or   was   otherwise\r\n               extensive, increase by 4 levels.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          On  February 26, 1996,  Fosher filed objections  to the\r\n\nupward adjustments  in calculation of  the offense level  for the\r\n\nFort Lauderdale  home invasion and  to the inclusion of  his FYCA\r\n\nconviction  in the  Criminal History  Category  calculation.   He\r\n\nargued that  the FYCA conviction should not be considered because\r\n\nit  had been \"set  aside\" pursuant to  the FYCA on  September 24,\r\n\n1982.\r\n\n          At the  sentencing hearing,  the district court  agreed\r\n\nwith the findings  in the PSR and imposed  upward adjustments for\r\n\nan  unusually vulnerable  victim  and for  Fosher's  role in  the\r\n\noffense.    The  court  further  determined  that  Fosher's  FYCA\r\n\nconviction was properly included in the Criminal History Category\r\n\ncalculation.  The  district court, therefore, set  Fosher's Total\r\n\nOffense Level  at 33  and his Criminal  History Category  at III,\r\n\nresulting in a  guideline sentencing range of 168  to 210 months.\r\n\nThe  government submitted a  motion requesting that,  in light of\r\n\nFosher's  substantial  assistance,  the court  grant  a  downward\r\n\ndeparture and impose a 60-month  sentence.  The court allowed the\r\n\ngovernment's    5K1.1 downward  departure  motion, but  sentenced\r\n\nFosher to 78 months' imprisonment.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\nI.  Unusually vulnerable victim\r          I.  Unusually vulnerable victim\r\n\n          The  government insists that  the issue of  whether the\r\n\nvictim  of the  Fort  Lauderdale  home  invasion  was  \"unusually\r\n\nvulnerable\" is a factual issue and therefore that the clear error\r\n\nstandard applies.  Fosher argues  vigorously that the facts being\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nundisputed, the  only question  presented is a  legal one  of the\r\n\nsentencing  court's application of  the guidelines to  the facts,\r\n\nrequiring de  novo review.    \"[Q]uestions .  . .  of the  proper\r                            \r\n\napplication of  a legal  standard to undisputed  facts . .  . are\r\n\nusually called 'mixed questions' of fact and law.\"  United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

The PSR  revealed  that Fosher\r\n\nsurveyed the victim's home and determined that it was occupied by\r\n\nan  elderly woman,  her  daughter,  and  her  daughter's  infant.\r\n\nFollowing this surveillance, the perpetrators declined the use of\r\n\nweapons to commit the robbery.  Based on the victim's age and the\r\n\nperpetrators' decision  that  the use  of  weapons would  not  be\r\n\nnecessary,  the  district  court concluded  that  Fosher  knew or\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nshould  have  known that  the  victim  in  this case  would  have\r\n\n\"impaired capacity\" to prevent the  entry into and robbery of her\r\n\nhome.  From  our review of  the record, it  appears the  district\r\n\ncourt failed to address the \"individual characteristics\" required\r\n\nto  support a  finding  that a  particular  victim was  unusually\r\n\nvulnerable.    Because of  this conclusion,  we must  remand this\r\n\nissue to the district court for its consideration.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nII.  Role in the offense\r          II.

Ch. 3, Pt. B, intro.\r                                             \r\n\ncomment.  Fosher does not challenge the sentencing court's status\r\n\ndetermination.   His  argument focuses  on  whether the  district\r\n\ncourt  properly found five participants in  the home invasion and\r\n\nrobbery.\r\n\n          The commentary defines a \"participant\" as \"a person who\r\n\nis criminally  responsible for the commission of the offense, but\r\n\nneed not  have been convicted.\"   U.S.S.G.   3B1.1  comment. app.\r\n\nn.1.  Fosher concedes that there were four criminally responsible\r\n\nparticipants:  him, Chinn, Corso,  and Schoff.  At the sentencing\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nhearing, the government argued that both Philip Corso and Bomengo\r\n\nwere criminally responsible participants even though they did not\r\n\nactually participate in  the robbery.  We need  only confirm that\r\n\none  of them was  a criminally responsible  participant to affirm\r\n\nthe   district  court's  upward   adjustment.     Philip  Corso's\r\n\nassistance  in devising the perpetrator's scheme is sufficient to\r\n\nfind  that  he  is  a  participant  within  the  meaning  of  the\r\n\nguidelines.   Philip  Corso  assisted  Schoff  in  targeting  the\r\n\nvictim's home for the commission of this robbery, he provided the\r\n\nhome in which the planning meeting took place, he participated in\r\n\nthe planning meeting with the four robbery perpetrators,  and, in\r\n\nresponse to  the perpetrators'  discussion regarding  the use  of\r\n\nweapons, he  advised  against the  necessity of  weapons to  gain\r\n\nentry into the victim's home.  Such acts were sufficient  to find\r\n\nPhilip  Corso to  be  a  participant in  the  commission of  this\r\n\nrobbery.  We therefore find no error in the district court's role\r\n\nin the offense determination.\r\n\nIII.  Criminal History Category\r          III.  Criminal History Category\r\n\n          In 1977,  Fosher was  convicted of  armed bank  robbery\r\n\nunder the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C.   5005 et seq.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(repealed  1984).  In  1982,  pursuant  to  the  Act's  set-aside\r\n\nprovisions,  see 18  U.S.C.    5021,  Fosher was  unconditionally\r                          \r\n\ndischarged and his conviction  was set aside.  Fosher  challenges\r\n\nthe sentencing court's inclusion of his FYCA set-aside conviction\r\n\nin the calculation  of his Criminal History Category.   He claims\r\n\nthat his set-aside  conviction is to be treated  as an \"expunged\"\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nconviction under  U.S.S.G.   4A1.2.

A set-aside  under the\r\n\nFYCA is  made for  \"reasons unrelated to  innocence or  errors of\r\n\nlaw\"  of the  type  that  the guidelines  contemplate  are to  be\r\n\nconsidered  in calculating Criminal  History.  The  FYCA, section\r\n\n5021, provided:\r\n\n          (a)  Upon the unconditional  discharge by the\r\n          Commission  of  a  committed  youth  offender\r\n          before the expiration of the maximum sentence\r\n          imposed  upon him,  the  conviction shall  be\r\n          automatically  set aside  and the  Commission\r\n          shall   issue  to   the   youth  offender   a\r\n          certificate to that effect.\r\n\n          (b)  Where  a youth offender has  been placed\r\n          on probation  by  the court,  the  court  may\r\n          thereafter,      in      its      discretion,\r\n          unconditionally discharge such youth offender\r\n          from probation prior to the expiration of the\r\n          maximum period of probation theretofore fixed\r\n          by   the   court,   which   discharge   shall\r\n          automatically set  aside the  conviction, and\r\n          the court shall issue to the youth offender a\r\n          certificate to that effect.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nCir. 1992)  (holding that  sealed record  under Vermont  juvenile\r\nstatute   was   improperly   considered   in   criminal   history\r\ncalculation).\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    5021 (repealed).   The language of  the statute does\r\n\nnot call  for expunging a  youth offender's records,  but instead\r\n\nmandates  that the youth offender  shall receive a certificate to\r\n\nthe effect that  the conviction has been set aside.  A conviction\r\n\nunder  the  FYCA is  set  aside  not because  of  legal  error or\r\n\ninnocence, but  because the offender's  \"post-offense conduct has\r\n\npersuaded the court to terminate his sentence of probation before\r\n\nthe assigned  completion date.\"   United States v.

The  FYCA's use of the term \"set  aside\"\r\n\nis not  the  same  as the  Guideline's  treatment  of  \"expunged\"\r\n\nconvictions,  but is more analogous to the Guideline's definition\r\n\nof a  \"set aside\" conviction,  one that is  to be counted  in the\r\n\ncriminal history  calculation.   Moreover, had Congress  intended\r\n\nthat all records of a youthful conviction  under the FYCA be made\r\n\ncompletely  unavailable  or  destroyed such  that  they  could no\r\n\nlonger be considered for any future purposes, Congress could have\r\n\nspecified the remedy of expungement  rather than a certificate of\r\n\nset-aside.
