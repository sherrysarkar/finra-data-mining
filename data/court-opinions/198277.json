Frank H. Freedman, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n\nGibson, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n   Stephen Paul Maidman for appellant.\n   William M. Welch, II, with whom Donald K. Stern, United States\nAttorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\nJanuary 7, 1999\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Ralph Goodridge was tried in June\n1997 for the robbery of a bank in West Springfield, Massachusetts,\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.  2113(a).  Goodridge was also charged\nwith using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, id. 924(c), and with being a felon in possession of a firearm, id. \n922(g).  On June 23, 1997, the jury found Goodridge guilty on all\ncounts.  After sentencing, Goodridge filed the present appeal,\nclaiming that the district court committed plain error in allowing\ncertain statements by government counsel during closing arguments\nto which Goodridge made no objection at the time.\nThe robbery was committed by two masked men, so no one\ninside the bank could identify the robbers conclusively.  However,\nGoodridge was seen outside the bank, and a good deal of\ncircumstantial evidence connected Goodridge to the crime.  While\nthe evidence was ample to permit a jury to find him guilty beyond\na reasonable doubt, it was perhaps not so certain that a serious\ntrial error would have been patently harmless.\nAt the start of his closing argument, the prosecutor\nstated:  \"Ralph Goodridge is a bank robber.  It is who he is.  It\nis what he does.\"  The same statement was repeated part way through\nthe government's closing argument.  In neither instance was any\nobjection taken at the time.  Defense counsel argued after trial,\nand asserts again on this appeal, that the government's comments\nwrongly insinuated to the jury that Goodridge had committed earlier\nbank robberies, and that the jury may have convicted in part based\non the belief that someone who had committed prior bank robberies\nwas more likely to have committed this one.\nIt would have been improper for the government to imply\nthat it had private knowledge of other bank robberies committed by\nGoodridge.  But the government says that the statement was intended\nto make a different, legitimate argument.  One of the main themes\nin Goodridge's defense relied upon evidence that he had been\nunmarked later in the day of the robbery by red dye or tear gas\nwhich had been detonated in a concealed package when the robbers\nwere transporting currency stolen from the bank.  Cf. United Statesv. Brien, 59 F.3d 274, 275 (1st Cir. 1995).\nIn response, the government says that the evidence\npermitted the jury to infer, from other aspects of the robbery,\nthat the robbers were experienced in such crimes (e.g., they used\na radio scanner pre-programmed to police frequencies).  On this\npremise, the government argues, and we agree, the government could\nfairly invite the jury to consider that the robbers might likewise\nhave known about exploding dye packs and have known how to take\nsome precaution--here, wrapping the currency in a pillowcase--to\navoid being splattered if and when such a device detonated.\nIf the prosecutor had put the matter solely in those\nterms, no objection could have been made.  The difficulty arises\nbecause the two challenged statements made by the prosecutor could\nbe understood in this way, or as suggesting government knowledge of\nprior bank robberies by Goodridge, or both.  If the government had\ndeliberately intended the jury to draw the second inference, this\nwould weigh heavily in favor of reversal.  See United States v.\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir. 1995).  But while the statements\nin question were likely thought out in advance, we cannot conclude\nthat the prosecutor was deliberately attempting to convey the\nimpermissible inference.\nFurther, the threat of unfair prejudice is fairly weak. \nTrue, the remarks invited the jury to conceive of Goodridge as an\nexperienced bank robber.  But that was a permissible inference--\nbased on the evidence in this case--so long as the jury did not\nalso conclude that the government was asserting private knowledge\nof prior bank robberies.  And any implication in the closing\nargument that the government did have such knowledge is vague and\ninexplicit.\nWe conclude that the statements themselves did not\nconstitute plain error requiring the judge to halt and correct them\nsua sponte.  The lack of objection, where objection is easily made\nand is likely to avoid retrial, is a high barrier.  See United\nStates v. Nunez, 146 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 1998).  Goodridge has\nnot scaled it.\nAffirmed.\n",
