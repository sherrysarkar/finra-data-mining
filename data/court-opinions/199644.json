Douglas P.

Claimant Christine Dias appeals the\n\ndecision of the district court which upheld the denial of\n\nSocial Security disability benefits.                   We have carefully\n\nreviewed the record and the parties' briefs and affirm the\n\ndistrict court judgment for essentially the reasons stated\n\nin that court's Memorandum and Order, dated January 8, 2001.\n\nWe add only the following comments.\n\n             1.    The conclusions of Dr. May Louie, claimant's\n\ntreating     physician,       that    claimant's      Charcot-Marie-Tooth\n\ndisease meets the listing for peripheral neuropathies and\n\nthat claimant is disabled are not binding on the Commissioner\n\nas   these    determinations          are   reserved     solely     for    the\n\nCommissioner.       See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(e)(1) and (e)(2).\n\n             2.     As for claimant's argument that she cannot\n\nperform    the     full    range     of   sedentary    work   due   to    both\n\nexertional        and     non-exertional      limitations,      there      are\n\nconflicts in the evidence.            Claimant's own testimony at the\n\nhearing was contradictory and Dr. Louie's assessment of\n\nclaimant's residual functional capacity (RFC) is inconsistent\n\nwith her observations of claimant as recorded in her office\n\nnotes.    Other evidence inconsistent with the opinion of Dr.\n\nLouie can be found in the report of Dr. Alan Mandell and in\n\nthe other RFC assessments in the record.                  This evidence,\n\fcontrary to claimant's contention, is entitled to be credited\n\nby the Commissioner.    See Rodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services, 819 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(per curiam).   Because conflicts are for the Commissioner to\n\nresolve, not the courts, Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and\n\nHuman Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981), the\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -3-\n\f",
