Daniel R. Dominguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nJohnny Rivera-Gonzalez on brief for appellant.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive and Nelson\r\nPerez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorneys, and Jose A. Quiles-\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        March 26, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and record,\r\nwe perceive no merit in appellant's contentions.\r\n    While there may be some question about the standard of\r\nreview applicable to appellant's first-time challenge to his\r\nguilty plea, see United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d\r\n1215, 1219-20 (1st Cir. 1995), we need not resolve that\r\nuncertainty here.  \r\n    Rule 11 requires the district court to determine that the\r\nplea in voluntarily and intelligently entered, but there is no\r\nspecific requirement that the district court ask about\r\nprescription drug use.  Carey v. United States, 50 F.3d 1097,\r\n1099 (1st Cir. 1995).  However, once informed that the\r\ndefendant has ingested substances capable of impairing his\r\nability to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his\r\nconstitutional rights, the district court must broaden its\r\ninquiry to determine the dosages consumed and the effects, if\r\nany, such medications might be likely to have on the\r\ndefendant's clear-headedness.  United States v. Parra-Ibanez,\r\n936 F.2d 588, 596 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n    Here, appellant complains that the district court should\r\nhave broadened its inquiry in light of a psychiatric evaluation\r\nreport (then 5 months old) indicating that appellant used\r\ninsulin and Prozac.  However, the transcript of the plea\r\nhearing itself shows that defendant specifically denied recent\r\nuse of any drug:  he was asked whether he was \"presently on\r\nmedication or have you used any narcotic drug within the last\r\ntwenty-four hours?\" and he answered, \"No.\"  Based solely on\r\nthat record before us, we decline to require any further\r\ninquiry.  The facts of this case are distinguishable from those\r\nin Parra-Ibanez, and so the result reached there does not\r\nobtain here.\r\n    Rule 11 requirements do not apply to sentencing hearings,\r\nand so we reject appellant's claim that the district court was\r\nrequired to conduct a colloquy at sentencing.  And appellant's\r\nclaim regarding the interpreters involved in his psychiatric\r\nevaluation is wholly without merit.\r\n    Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
