Charles Harding, the defendant, appeals\n\na district court order denying his motion for summary judgment\n\nand granting that of the plaintiff, Gerard Miller.               Miller had\n\nsued Harding for being the recipient of a fraudulent conveyance\n\nfrom a third party, Keith Dominick, the operator of a Ponzi\n\nscheme.1      Because Harding has not raised, and thus has waived,\n\nthe one argument that could merit a reversal, we affirm.\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n              The following facts have been drawn from the district\n\ncourt's opinion in this case, as well as from CFTC v. Dominick,\n\n1996 WL 406833 (M.D. Fla. 1996).\n\n              Keith Dominick operated his Ponzi investment scheme\n\nfrom February 1992 through April 1994.             During that time, he\n\ntook investments from approximately 70 pool participants, adding\n\nup   to   a   total   of   $5.9    million.   He   represented    to   these\n\ninvestors that their money was to be invested in the commodities\n\nmarket, and that they would receive very high returns.             Over the\n\ncourse of those years, Dominick in fact invested only about $2\n\n\n\n      1\n      A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment strategy wherein\nearly investors are paid phony returns using later investors'\nmoney. These returns, which tend to be unusually high, serve as\na marketing tool to lure in new investors. Little, if any, of\nthe money ever gets invested as promised, and the scheming pool\noperator embezzles much of it. Dominick ran such a scheme from\nearly 1992 through April 1994. He did so by selling shares in\nan investment company he had acquired to implement the ruse.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fmillion of the $5.9 million he attracted.               The remainder was\n\neither dispersed to early investors as a spur to attract new\n\nbusiness, or embezzled for his own needs (including the purchase\n\nof his home and the payment of his federal taxes, among other\n\nthings).      On    September   14,    1993,    in   furtherance    of   his\n\nactivities, Dominick acquired Main Street Investment Group, Inc.\n\n[hereinafter \"Main Street\" or the \"corporation\"].              After that\n\ndate, he conducted his investment/Ponzi scheme through that\n\nentity.\n\n            Harding made all of his investments between September\n\nand December, 1992.      During that period, he invested a total of\n\n$185,000.    Subsequently, over the period of time from December\n\n1992   through     February   1994,    he    received   \"returns\"   on   his\n\ninvestment totaling $497,000.               In November 1993, Miller, a\n\nlawyer, purchased 5,000 shares in Main Street at a cost of $200\n\nper share, for a total of $1 million.           He received one return on\n\nhis investment, $3,500 in the form of a wire transfer to a third\n\nparty made at his request, but lost the remaining $996,500\n\nentirely.    In April 1994, Miller reported what he believed to be\n\nsuspicious activity by Main Street and Dominick to the FBI and\n\nthe CFTC.    On June 15, 1994, the CFTC filed a complaint against\n\nDominick and Main Street in the United States District Court for\n\nthe Middle District of Florida, alleging violations of the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fCommodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.                As a result of\n\nthat       filing,   an   equity   receiver   for   both   Main   Street   and\n\nDominick was appointed.            The receiver was granted very broad\n\npowers with respect to Dominick and Main Street.2\n\n              The equity receiver demanded $312,000 from Harding,\n\nrepresenting the difference between Harding's investment and his\n\nreturn.        Ultimately, Harding settled with the receiver for\n\n$215,000.       Later, in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts, Miller sued Harding for $97,000, the\n\nremainder of his profit, on the basis that this sum had been\n\nfraudulently conveyed to Harding by Dominick, a tort debtor of\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       The equity receiver was granted the power to take over\nDominick's and Main Street's assets, including funds of\ninvestors, and to\n\n       investigate the assets, liabilities, transfers of real\n       and personal property, commodity trading activity and\n       commodity pool operation of defendants Dominick and\n       Main Street and institute such actions and legal\n       proceedings as the Receiver deems necessary against\n       individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations\n       or unincorporated organizations for the purpose of\n       recovering funds or property of defendants Dominick\n       and Main Street, including funds of investors, which\n       the Receiver may claim to be wrongfully or improperly\n       in the possession, custody or control of others.\n\nCFTC v. Dominick, No. 94-661-CIV-ORL-18 (M.D. Fla. July 15,\n1994) (agreed order of preliminary injunction and appointment of\nreceiver). The equity receiver was to represent the interests\nof the corporation and its investors.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fMiller.3   Harding defended on the ground that Miller's claim\n\ninvolved harm to the corporation, and thus belonged to the\n\nequity receiver, who had already settled it.     Harding did not\n\nrespond to Miller's argument that he was suing on the basis of\n\na transfer from Dominick, as his tort debtor, and not one from\n\nthe corporation.   The district court granted summary judgment to\n\nMiller and denied it to Harding, awarding Miller $97,000.   This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n     3 Miller is a tort creditor of Dominick on the basis of\nMiller's claim for fraud in the inducement. Miller obtained a\ndefault judgment against Dominick for this tort on May 7, 1997,\nbut Dominick was judgment-proof.\n\n                               -6-\n\f                              II. DISCUSSION\n\n            An equity receiver, like a bankruptcy trustee, has\n\nstanding for all claims that would belong to the entity in\n\nreceivership, and which would thus benefit its creditors and\n\ninvestors,    but   no   standing   to     represent   the   creditors   and\n\ninvestors in their individual claims.            See Scholes v. Lehmann,\n\n56 F.3d 750, 753 (7th Cir. 1995) (addressing this issue in a\n\nPonzi scheme receivership case); see also Fisher v. Apostolou,\n\n155 F.3d 876, 879 (7th Cir. 1998) (making the same observation\n\nin a bankruptcy case).        For this reason, Miller's only possible\n\nclaim   against     Harding   is   for   a   fraudulent   conveyance     from\n\nDominick himself, as an individual tort debtor to Miller, and\n\nnot for a fraudulent conveyance from the corporation in which\n\nMiller had invested.      The latter claim belonged to the receiver,\n\nwho has already settled it.          We shall thus consider Miller's\n\ncomplaint only to the extent that it is based on the former\n\ntheory and not the latter.\n\n            Miller's complaint did not properly allege a fraudulent\n\nconveyance.     We have described the nature of an appropriate\n\nfraudulent conveyance claim by setting out the three paradigm\n\nexamples.    See Boston Trading Group, Inc. v. Burnazos, 835 F.2d\n\n1504, 1508 (1st Cir. 1987).          In all three examples the debtor\n\ntransferred his own funds to someone else in an effort to avoid\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fpayment to his creditors.   See id.    Because the creditor's claim\n\nis against the transferor of the funds, the only money to\n\nconsider is that which in fact belongs (or belonged, prior to\n\nthe transfer) to the debtor.\n\n         In his own complaint, however, Miller makes it clear\n\nthat the monies transferred to Harding never did rightfully\n\nbelong to Dominick.     The gravamen of Miller's allegations is\n\nthat, with respect to both his investments and the investments\n\nof others, Dominick wrongfully diverted funds earmarked for\n\ninvestment in the commodities market to his own use or to early\n\ninvestors in the Ponzi scheme (such as Harding).         By accusing\n\nDominick of wrongfully siphoning funds for his own use, Miller\n\nunwittingly acknowledges the defect in his claim.       The complaint\n\nthus fails to set forth an essential element of Miller's claim\n\nagainst Harding: that the $97,000 sought in this lawsuit ever\n\nbelonged to Dominick.\n\n         Unfortunately,     however,    Harding   has     failed   to\n\nappreciate the nature of Miller's claim from beginning to end,\n\nand thus has not responded to it.       In the district court, and\n\nnow again on appeal, Harding missed the essential theory of\n\nMiller's case: that, as the victim of Dominick's fraudulent\n\ninducement, he (Miller) was a tort creditor of Dominick's since\n\nthe time of his investment.      Absent the key defect we have\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fpointed out, this could be the basis for a valid claim of\n\nfraudulent conveyance.       Harding thus overlooked the fact that\n\nthis was a separate claim that belonged to Miller, and not to\n\nthe corporation, and failed to defend himself against it by\n\npointing out the defect.      As a result of this oversight, some of\n\nHarding's    appellate     arguments,      like    his   summary      judgment\n\narguments, are entirely beside the point.\n\n            There   are,   however,    three      arguments    presented      by\n\nHarding which, if we were to accept, would provide bases for\n\noverturning the district court's judgment in favor of Miller:\n\n(1) that Miller is collaterally estopped from relitigating the\n\nquestion    of   Harding's   total    liability;     (2)    that     there   was\n\nadequate    consideration    for     the   transfer;     and   (3)    that   the\n\ndistrict court misinterpreted the definition of \"creditor\" under\n\nfraudulent transfer law.      On the latter two issues, which go to\n\nthe merits of Miller's claim, we adopt the reasoning of the\n\ndistrict court and affirm on those bases.                  As to collateral\n\nestoppel, however, we differ with the district court's holding\n\nthat Miller and the receiver lack privity and that Miller did\n\nnot have a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether the\n\n$97,000 sought in this lawsuit was fraudulently transferred.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that the Florida proceedings are not\n\nyet final, and the equity receiver's settlement with Harding is\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fstill susceptible of being set aside.   Collateral estoppel thus\n\ncannot apply.   See Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 111 F.3d 205,209\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (\"Collateral estoppel, now often called issue\n\npreclusion, prevents a party from relitigating at a second trial\n\nissues determined between the same parties by an earlier final\n\njudgment . . .\").\n\n         Although Harding may not have achieved the result he\n\nexpected when he settled with the equity receiver, that is due\n\nto his failure to controvert the claim that Miller has made\n\nagainst him in this action.   As a policy matter, individuals in\n\nHarding's position should be able to settle with receivers\n\nwithout fear of this sort of litigation.       Because Miller's\n\nsuccess in this case is due Harding's waiver of the proper\n\ndefense, we do not expect that it will encourage future actions\n\namong parties similarly situated to those here.\n\n         Accordingly, and with some reticence, the opinion below\n\nis AFFIRMED.    No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

For this reason, Miller's only possible\n\nclaim   against     Harding   is   for   a   fraudulent   conveyance     from\n\nDominick himself, as an individual tort debtor to Miller, and\n\nnot for a fraudulent conveyance from the corporation in which\n\nMiller had invested.      The latter claim belonged to the receiver,\n\nwho has already settled it.          We shall thus consider Miller's\n\ncomplaint only to the extent that it is based on the former\n\ntheory and not the latter.\n\n            Miller's complaint did not properly allege a fraudulent\n\nconveyance.     We have described the nature of an appropriate\n\nfraudulent conveyance claim by setting out the three paradigm\n\nexamples.    See Boston Trading Group, Inc. v. Burnazos, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1504</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1508 (1st Cir. 1987).          In all three examples the debtor\n\ntransferred his own funds to someone else in an effort to avoid\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fpayment to his creditors.   See id.    Because the creditor's claim\n\nis against the transferor of the funds, the only money to\n\nconsider is that which in fact belongs (or belonged, prior to\n\nthe transfer) to the debtor.\n\n         In his own complaint, however, Miller makes it clear\n\nthat the monies transferred to Harding never did rightfully\n\nbelong to Dominick.     The gravamen of Miller's allegations is\n\nthat, with respect to both his investments and the investments\n\nof others, Dominick wrongfully diverted funds earmarked for\n\ninvestment in the commodities market to his own use or to early\n\ninvestors in the Ponzi scheme (such as Harding).         By accusing\n\nDominick of wrongfully siphoning funds for his own use, Miller\n\nunwittingly acknowledges the defect in his claim.       The complaint\n\nthus fails to set forth an essential element of Miller's claim\n\nagainst Harding: that the $97,000 sought in this lawsuit ever\n\nbelonged to Dominick.\n\n         Unfortunately,     however,    Harding   has     failed   to\n\nappreciate the nature of Miller's claim from beginning to end,\n\nand thus has not responded to it.       In the district court, and\n\nnow again on appeal, Harding missed the essential theory of\n\nMiller's case: that, as the victim of Dominick's fraudulent\n\ninducement, he (Miller) was a tort creditor of Dominick's since\n\nthe time of his investment.      Absent the key defect we have\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fpointed out, this could be the basis for a valid claim of\n\nfraudulent conveyance.       Harding thus overlooked the fact that\n\nthis was a separate claim that belonged to Miller, and not to\n\nthe corporation, and failed to defend himself against it by\n\npointing out the defect.      As a result of this oversight, some of\n\nHarding's    appellate     arguments,      like    his   summary      judgment\n\narguments, are entirely beside the point.\n\n            There   are,   however,    three      arguments    presented      by\n\nHarding which, if we were to accept, would provide bases for\n\noverturning the district court's judgment in favor of Miller:\n\n(1) that Miller is collaterally estopped from relitigating the\n\nquestion    of   Harding's   total    liability;     (2)    that     there   was\n\nadequate    consideration    for     the   transfer;     and   (3)    that   the\n\ndistrict court misinterpreted the definition of \"creditor\" under\n\nfraudulent transfer law.      On the latter two issues, which go to\n\nthe merits of Miller's claim, we adopt the reasoning of the\n\ndistrict court and affirm on those bases.                  As to collateral\n\nestoppel, however, we differ with the district court's holding\n\nthat Miller and the receiver lack privity and that Miller did\n\nnot have a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether the\n\n$97,000 sought in this lawsuit was fraudulently transferred.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that the Florida proceedings are not\n\nyet final, and the equity receiver's settlement with Harding is\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fstill susceptible of being set aside.   Collateral estoppel thus\n\ncannot apply.   See Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 111 F.3d 205,209\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (\"Collateral estoppel, now often called issue\n\npreclusion, prevents a party from relitigating at a second trial\n\nissues determined between the same parties by an earlier final\n\njudgment . . .\").\n\n         Although Harding may not have achieved the result he\n\nexpected when he settled with the equity receiver, that is due\n\nto his failure to controvert the claim that Miller has made\n\nagainst him in this action.   As a policy matter, individuals in\n\nHarding's position should be able to settle with receivers\n\nwithout fear of this sort of litigation.       Because Miller's\n\nsuccess in this case is due Harding's waiver of the proper\n\ndefense, we do not expect that it will encourage future actions\n\namong parties similarly situated to those here.\n\n         Accordingly, and with some reticence, the opinion below\n\nis AFFIRMED.    No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f</pre>",
