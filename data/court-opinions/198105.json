F/K/A BEAL BANC S.A.,\r\n\n                 Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n                   RICHARD H. KROCK,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n     Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nDavid D. Pavek, with whom James R. Everson, Messner, Pavek &amp;\r\nReeves, LLC., William V. Sopp, John F. Tocci, and Finnegan, Hickey,\r\nDinsmoor &amp; Johnson, P.C., were on brief for appellant.\r\nAlan M. Spiro, with whom Edwards &amp; Angell were on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nSeptember 3, 1998\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  In this debt collection\r\ncase, the plaintiff, Beal Bank S.S.B. (\"Beal Bank\"), seeks to\r\ncollect on a note that was part of a written settlement agreement\r\ncontaining a clause that precluded oral modifications.  The debtor,\r\nRichard H. Krock, interposes what he claims was a subsequent oral\r\nmodification of the contract.  The district court, after trial,\r\nfound that the oral modification was in fact agreed upon and was an\r\nenforceable contract under Massachusetts law.  The court concluded\r\ntherefore that the debtor was not liable to the bank.  Holding that\r\nthe district court's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous,\r\nand applying the law of Massachusetts in this diversity action, we\r\naffirm the court's conclusion that the oral modification was\r\nenforceable.  We remand nevertheless for recalculation of the\r\namount owed.\r\n                         Facts\r\nIn 1991, Pier 37 Associates Limited Partnership (\"Pier\r\n37\") executed a promissory note in the amount of $3.6 million to\r\nFirst Mutual Bank for Savings.  This note was secured in part by a\r\nmortgage on a marina located in Falmouth, Massachusetts.  In\r\naddition, defendant Richard H. Krock, who was a general partner of\r\nPier 37, gave a personal guarantee of the note, limited to\r\n$1,600,000.\r\nWhen First Mutual Bank became insolvent, the Federal\r\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") took over its assets.  The\r\nFDIC sued Pier 37, Krock, and others, to collect on the note. \r\nWhile the case was pending, the FDIC assigned its interest in the\r\nnote to BSB Mortgage, Inc. (\"BSB\"), an affiliate of Beal Bank, for\r\napproximately $1,000,000.  In turn, BSB assigned its interest to\r\nBeal Bank. \r\nIn 1993, Beal Bank foreclosed on the property.  The\r\nparties to the litigation, after substantial negotiations, entered\r\ninto a settlement agreement whereby Krock paid Beal Bank $150,000\r\nin cash and executed a $350,000 promissory note, payable over ten\r\nyears in annual installments.  The agreement contained a clause\r\nstating that it was complete and integrated, and that no subsequent\r\nmodifications could be made to the agreement except in writing.\r\nKrock testified that he negotiated an oral side agreement\r\nin which Beal Bank would, if the property sold for over $900,000,\r\nreduce Krock's debt by two-thirds of the amount by which the sale\r\nprice exceeded $900,000.  Krock first discussed this side agreement\r\nwith Will Balthrope, then a vice president of Beal Bank, prior to\r\nthe execution of the settlement agreement.  Krock testified that\r\nBalthrope once again agreed to the offset plan after execution but\r\nbefore Beal Bank sold the marina in 1995 for $1,505,000.  The\r\nexcess of the sale price over $900,000 was $605,000, so, under\r\nKrock's interpretation of the side agreement, his obligation would\r\nbe reduced by two-thirds of that, or $403,333.  Because this\r\nreduction exceeds the face amount of Krock's note to Beal Bank,\r\nKrock asserts he owes Beal Bank nothing.\r\nThe district court, after a bench trial, ruled that the\r\nside agreement did exist, implicitly found it valid under\r\nMassachusetts law, and applied the agreement to reduce Krock's debt\r\nto zero.  The court's decision turned on its finding that Krock was\r\nentirely credible in his testimony regarding the side agreement. \r\nThe court also noted that Balthrope, who was the only other person\r\nbesides Krock with personal knowledge of whether or not there was\r\na subsequent oral modification, and who therefore could have\r\nsupported the Bank's position that Krock's oral agreement claim was\r\nuntrue, was inexplicably not called to the stand nor was his\r\ntestimony preserved, although he had been a bank employee up until\r\ntwo months before trial.  Beal Bank appealed the district court's\r\ndecision.\r\n                       Discussion\r\nTwo issues control the outcome of this case.  One is\r\nfactual:  was there a side agreement made between Krock and\r\nBalthrope, and was it made after the execution of the written\r\nsettlement agreement?  The unrebutted testimony of Krock, accepted\r\nas credible by the district court, plays a major role in answering\r\nthis question.  The second issue is legal:  even if Krock's\r\ntestimony is taken as 100% true as to the existence and timing of\r\nthe side agreement, would such an oral side agreement be\r\nenforceable under Massachusetts law to modify the terms of the\r\nwritten and completely integrated settlement agreement?  We begin\r\nour analysis with the pertinent Massachusetts law.\r\nWe have previously summarized the relevant aspects of\r\nMassachusetts contract law as follows:\r\nEvidence of prior or contemporaneous oral\r\nagreements cannot be admitted to vary or\r\nmodify the terms of an unambiguous written\r\ncontract.  New England Fin. Resources, Inc. v.\r\nCoulouras, 566 N.E.2d 1136, 1139 (Mass. App.\r\nCt. 1991) (parol evidence rule precludes use\r\nof oral evidence to modify integrated\r\nagreement); Aerostatic Eng'g Corp. v.\r\nSzczawinski, 294 N.E.2d 521, 522 (Mass. App.\r\nCt. 1973) (oral agreement cannot modify\r\npayment terms unambiguously expressed in\r\nwritten contract).  Instead, \"parties are\r\nbound by the plain terms of their contract.\"\r\nHiller v. Submarine Signal Co., 91 N.E.2d 667,\r\n669 (1950) (restrictive agreement between\r\nindustrial park developer and park tenant\r\ninterpreted according to meaning of\r\nunambiguous written agreement).\r\n\nFairfield 274-278 Clarendon Trust v. Dwek, 970 F.2d 990, 993-94\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThus, if Krock's side agreement with Balthrope was made\r\nbefore the execution of the written settlement agreement, then the\r\nwritten agreement supersedes it and the side agreement is barred by\r\nthe parol evidence rule.  See id.   \r\nIn the present case, Beal Bank devoted a great deal of\r\nits opening brief to its assertion that the parol evidence rule\r\nbars testimony about an oral modification made prior to the\r\nexecution of the settlement agreement.  Yet at trial the district\r\ncourt sustained each and every objection that was properly made\r\nunder the parol evidence rule.  Krock's brief pointed this out, and\r\nmade clear that Krock was not relying on the pre-execution\r\nnegotiations to modify the written instrument.  Rather, he rested\r\nhis defense on the contention that he and Balthrope agreed to a\r\nsubsequent modification of the settlement agreement.\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, if a subsequent agreement is\r\nmade, after the execution of a written contract, it may be\r\nenforceable.  See New England Factors v. Genstil, 76 N.E.2d 151,\r\n154 (Mass. 1947) (holding that the parol evidence rule does not\r\napply \"where the terms of a written agreement have been modified by\r\nsubsequent oral agreement\").  As a leading authority has put it:\r\nBecause the parol evidence rule applies only\r\nto precontractual negotiations, it does not\r\nbar evidence of subsequent negotiations to\r\nshow modification of the contract.  Even a\r\ncompletely integrated agreement can therefore\r\nbe modified or rescinded orally.\r\n\nE. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts  7.6 (2d ed. 1990).  Thus, \"[t]he\r\nparol evidence rule has no application to the situation . . . where\r\nit could be found that a new oral contract was entered into between\r\nthe parties which superseded the original contract.\"  L.W.\r\nSeverance &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Angley, 125 N.E.2d 415, 420 (Mass. 1955).\r\nEven a fully integrated contract   i.e., a written contract\r\ncontaining a clause stating that subsequent modifications must be\r\nin writing   may, under appropriate circumstances and with\r\nappropriate proof, be modified by a subsequent oral agreement.  SeeCambridgeport Sav. Bank v. Boersner, 597 N.E.2d 1017, 1022 (Mass.\r\n1992) (\"[A] provision that an agreement may not be amended orally\r\nbut only by a written instrument does not necessarily bar oral\r\nmodification of the contract.\"); cf. Farnsworth, supra,  7.6 (\"Can\r\nthe parties, by inserting a no-oral-modification clause,\r\neffectively permit only written modifications?  The common-law\r\nanswer has been that they cannot.\"); Wagner v. Graziano Const. Co.,\r\n136 A.2d 82, 83 (Pa. 1957) (\"The most ironclad written contract can\r\nalways be cut into by the acetylene torch of parol modification\r\nsupported by adequate proof. . . .  The hand that pens a writing\r\nmay not gag the mouths of the assenting parties.\").  \r\nMassachusetts does, however, impose a heavy burden on the\r\nparty seeking to modify an integrated written contract by a\r\nsubsequent oral agreement:  \"The evidence of a subsequent oral\r\nmodification must be of sufficient force to overcome the\r\npresumption that the integrated and complete agreement, which\r\nrequires written consent to modification, expresses the intent of\r\nthe parties,\" at least as of that time, that the written agreement\r\nrather than any alleged subsequent oral modification should govern. \r\nBoersner, 597 N.E.2d at 1022 n.10.  Whether the intent of the\r\nparties has changed is, of course, a question of fact to be\r\ndetermined by the trier of fact.\r\nKrock testified that he had a conversation with Balthrope\r\nafter execution of the written agreement, and that Balthrope stated\r\na new commitment to reduce Krock's debt obligation by two-thirds of\r\nany amount by which the sale price of the Pier 37 property exceeded\r\n$900,000.\r\nThe district court found Krock's testimony to be\r\ncredible:\r\n[T]he sole disputed factual issue pending\r\nbefore the Court is the credibility of the\r\nwitness Defendant Krock regarding the\r\nexistence of the Side Agreement.  I believe\r\nhis testimony, as it was forthright and\r\nconsistent and his demeanor while under\r\nintense cross-examination displayed the\r\nattitude of an individual who was telling the\r\ntruth with conviction.\r\n\nNot only did the district court find Krock's testimony\r\nwholly believable, but it was essentially unrebutted.  In contrast\r\nwith Krock's testimony as to the existence of the side agreement,\r\nthe court noted that \r\nthe only other witness to the Side Agreement\r\nwas Mr. Balthrope who was not called to\r\ntestify on behalf of [Beal Bank].  Although\r\nMr. Balthrope was listed as a prospective\r\nwitness by the [Bank] in its pretrial filings\r\nand left the employment of the bank only in\r\nJuly [approximately two months before the\r\ntrial], for some inexplicable reason, he was\r\nnot called to the stand nor was his testimony\r\npreserved by way of deposition.  Therefore,\r\nthe credible testimony of the Defendant Krock\r\nstands unrebutted and I accept it.\r\n\nThe court was entitled to draw an adverse inference\r\nagainst Beal Bank because of the absence of any testimony from\r\nBalthrope.  Balthrope was the only person, other than Krock, who\r\nhad personal knowledge as to whether there was indeed a subsequent\r\nside agreement, and what such an agreement may have included. \r\nMoreover, for years prior to the trial, up until two months before\r\ntrial, Balthrope was an employee of the Bank and under its control. \r\nEven Balthrope's termination, pursuant to a layoff, was within the\r\nBank's control.  The bank had included Balthrope on its witness\r\nlist up until the Friday before trial began.  Yet the Bank failed\r\nto present Balthrope's testimony to the court (through subpoena or\r\notherwise) and failed to preserve his testimony through deposition. \r\nIn light of all these circumstances surrounding the Bank's \"missing\r\nwitness,\" the court was entitled to draw an adverse inference\r\nagainst the Bank that Balthrope was not produced because his\r\ntestimony would have been damaging, i.e., it would not have\r\ncontradicted Krock's on the question of the subsequent oral\r\nmodification.  See, e.g., Bath Iron Works Corp. v. United States,\r\n34 Fed. Cl. 218, 340-41 (1995), aff'd, 98 F.3d 1357 (Fed. Cir.\r\n1996).  Nor did the bank attempt to rebut this inference by\r\nproviding a legitimate explanation for its failure, such as might\r\nbe the case if the witness had suddenly and unexpectedly died.  \r\nThe Bank did produce one witness in an effort to\r\ncontradict Krock's testimony regarding the subsequent side\r\nagreement:  Steven D. Harper, a commercial loan officer at the bank\r\nfor one year, who had taken over the Krock file from Balthrope. \r\nThe district court considered Harper's demeanor under direct- and\r\ncross-examination, re-direct, re-cross, re-re-direct, and re-re-\r\ncross, and declined to rely on Harper's evidence to undercut\r\nKrock's testimony.  Harper's initial testimony was that he had had\r\nconversations with Balthrope \"regarding the documentation on the\r\nKrock promissory note.\"  Harper had asked Balthrope whether there\r\nwere any documents in the bank's files that would bear upon Krock's\r\nallegation that there was a subsequent side agreement.  Balthrope\r\nhad told Harper that there were no such documents and that he \"did\r\nnot know of any agreement as such.\"  Harper's original testimony\r\ndid not mention any discussion with Balthrope other than about\r\nwritten documentation.  There was nothing one way or the other\r\nabout a possible oral modification, in Harper's direct, cross, re-\r\ndirect, or re-cross examinations.  The only testimony by Harper on\r\noral modification was on re-re-direct.  The district court was\r\nentitled to discount Harper's testimony on re-re-direct, based\r\nupon lack of credibility, regarding anything Balthrope told him\r\nother than about the existence or absence of documents in the\r\nfiles.  We find no clear error in the district court's decision to\r\naccept Krock's \"unrebutted\" testimony.\r\nIn addition to the unrebutted credible testimony of\r\nKrock, the court, in determining intent, was entitled to consider\r\nthe conduct of the parties.  \"Mutual agreement on modification of\r\nthe requirement of a writing may . . . be inferred from the conduct\r\nof the parties and from the attendant circumstances of the\r\n[particular] case.\"  Boersner, 597 N.E.2d at 1022 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted); see Schinkel v. Maxi-Holding, Inc., 565\r\nN.E.2d 1219, 1223 (Mass. App. Ct.), rev. denied, 409 Mass. 1104\r\n(1991).  Here, the parties acted in a way that was consistent with\r\nKrock's testimony that there was a subsequent oral modification.  \r\nWhen Krock's first payment was due under the settlement\r\nagreement, on November 1, 1994, he had no funds and did not pay it. \r\nThe property had not yet been sold by the Bank; the sale did not\r\ntake place until June 1, 1995.  Yet the Bank took no action against\r\nKrock in November 1994 nor in early 1995; indeed, it did not file\r\nsuit against Krock until December 1995, more than six months after\r\nthe sale of the Pier 37 property.  Krock testified as to a\r\nconversation he had with Balthrope after his default but before the\r\nsale.  According to Krock's unrebutted testimony, Balthrope told\r\nhim the Bank \"wouldn't do anything, he [Balthrope] wouldn't do\r\nanything until such time as the sale took place and . . . the\r\nreduction, if any, in the note could be quantified, and then the\r\nwhole thing would be restructured based upon the reduced amount of\r\nthe note and the reduced payment.\"  Consistent with this\r\nconversation, Krock waited until the sale took place; he did not\r\npay any part of his $40,000 payment that was due on November 1,\r\n1994, nor in early 1995.  Likewise, the Bank took no action against\r\nhim prior to its June 1, 1995 sale of the property.\r\nAfter the sale but before suit was filed against him,\r\nKrock had another conversation with Balthrope.  Krock told\r\nBalthrope that, in light of the high price received for the\r\nproperty, their oral agreement should wipe out his debt on the\r\nnote.  Krock testified that Balthrope did not dispute the validity\r\nof the subsequent oral modification or Krock's interpretation of\r\nit; instead, he responded by saying \"they're not going to pursue it\r\nanyway because the financials show that there is no ability to\r\npay.\"  Although the Bank eventually did pursue Krock by filing\r\nsuit in December 1995, the Bank's actions (or non-action) prior to\r\nthat time is consistent with Krock's version of events.  \r\nWe conclude that the district court's acceptance of\r\nKrock's version of events was not clearly erroneous, even applying\r\nthe requirement under Massachusetts law that Krock has to meet a\r\nheavier burden of proof in order for an oral modification to be\r\neffective against a written contract.  As part of that heavier\r\nburden, Massachusetts courts typically require \"'ample evidence,'\"\r\ndemonstrating that \"the party denying the existence of a\r\nmodification had . . . 'unequivocally' expressed [its] approval 'of\r\nthe many pertinent details' of the new agreement.\"  Boersner, 597\r\nN.E.2d at 1022 (quoting First Pa. Mortgage Trust v. Dorchester Sav.\r\nBank, 481 N.E.2d 1132, 1139 (Mass. 1985)).  We think the above-\r\ndescribed evidence is \"ample,\" and the only \"pertinent detail[]\" of\r\nthe new agreement was the offset by two-thirds of the sale price's\r\nexcess over $900,000.  According to Krock's credible testimony,\r\nBalthrope agreed to this detail \"unequivocally.\"\r\nWe hold therefore that the district court did not clearly\r\nerr in concluding that Krock's version of events was credible, nor\r\ndid it err in its legal conclusion that the subsequent modification\r\nthat Krock described is enforceable.  We turn briefly to the Bank's\r\nother arguments on appeal.\r\nThe Bank contends that the alleged subsequent\r\nmodification agreement fails because no consideration was given by\r\nKrock in exchange for the Bank's willingness to modify the amount\r\nof Krock's debt based on the sale price of the Pier 37 property. \r\nThe Bank acknowledges that, \"under appropriate proof, an oral\r\nmodification may be found,\" but if so, \"the new contract created by\r\nthe subsequent modification must be supported by consideration.\" \r\nBank Br. at 15 (citing Siegel v. Knott, 55 N.E.2d 889, 890 (Mass.\r\n1944) (\"The mode of performance required by a written contract may\r\nbe varied by a subsequent oral agreement based upon a valid\r\nconsideration.\")).  The Bank points out that Krock did not take any\r\n\"action in reliance on the alleged reaffirmation of the prior\r\nagreement other than to continue to fail to make the payments he\r\nagreed to make under the Note.\"  Id.  The Bank also relies heavily\r\non 3 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts  1826 (4th ed. 1992),\r\nas quoted in De Blois v. Boylston &amp; Tremont Corp., 183 N.E. 823,\r\n827 (Mass. 1933):\r\n[A] subsequent contract completely covering\r\nthe same subject-matter and made by the same\r\nparties as an earlier agreement, but\r\ncontaining terms inconsistent with the former\r\ncontract, so that the two cannot stand\r\ntogether, rescinds, substitutes and is\r\nsubstituted for the earlier contract and\r\nbecomes the only agreement of the parties on\r\nthe subject.  But the subsequent agreement\r\nmust have sufficient consideration.  Therefore\r\nif the undertaking by one party is simply to\r\nperform the whole or part of what he promised\r\nin the original contract, it will not support\r\na promise by the other party to perform what\r\nhe previously agreed and something more.\r\n\nThe Bank asserts that this is still good law in Massachusetts.\r\nAs Krock points out, however, the Bank never made this\r\nconsideration argument below.  Although Krock stated in his\r\nopposition to the Bank's motion in limine that consideration is not\r\nrequired for an oral modification to be effective against a written\r\ncontract under Massachusetts law, the Bank did not respond in its\r\npretrial motion papers, conferences, or at trial.  Moreover, after\r\nthe district court ruled against it, the Bank failed to file any\r\nmotion for a new trial or to alter or amend judgment within the\r\nten-day period set forth in Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure Rule.  And in the motion for reconsideration that the\r\nBank filed on the twentieth day, the Bank again failed to mention\r\nlack of consideration as a defect in Krock's case.\r\nAs we have said on numerous occasions, we will not\r\nconsider on appeal issues that could have been, but were not,\r\nraised in the trial court.  See Sullivan v. National Football\r\nLeague, 34 F.3d 1091, 1097 n.1 (1st Cir. 1994); Desjardins v. Van\r\nBuren Community Hosp., 969 F.2d 1280, 1282 (1st Cir. 1992).  \"An\r\nappeal is not an opportunity to conjure new arguments not raised\r\nbefore the district court.\"  Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer\r\nProductions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 530 (1st Cir. 1995); see NASCO,\r\nInc. v. Public Storage, Inc., 29 F.3d 28, 31 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(holding that theory not presented to district court and raised for\r\nthe first time on appeal is deemed waived).  In particular, having\r\nfailed to object below (or to raise the issue at all), it is too\r\nlate for the Bank to object that there was no evidence on which the\r\ncourt could find consideration to support the contract\r\nmodification.  See Johnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 565 F.2d 790,\r\n795 n.6 (1st Cir. 1977).  The argument has been waived.  See Howellv. FDIC, 986 F.2d 569, 572 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nEven if we were to reach the merits of the Bank's\r\nconsideration argument, it would not change our result.  The\r\ndoctrine of consideration does not necessarily bar enforcement of\r\na subsequent oral contract modification.  \"Modifications . . . have\r\nlong been recognized in law as valid, without additional\r\nconsideration, even when based on oral agreements modifying\r\nexecutory written contracts.\"  Roddy &amp; McNulty Ins. Agency, Inc. v.\r\nA.A. Proctor &amp; Co., 452 N.E.2d 308, 314 (Mass. App. Ct.), rev.\r\ndenied, 454 N.E.2d 1276 (1983).  \"The contract, when modified by\r\nthe subsequent oral agreement, is substituted for the contract as\r\noriginally made, and the original consideration attaches to and\r\nsupports the modified contract.\"  Thomas v. Barnes, 31 N.E. 683,\r\n684 (Mass. 1892).\r\nIt remains, of course, a factual question whether a party\r\nintends to relinquish her contractual rights by entering into a\r\nsubsequent agreement.  See Roddy &amp; McNulty, 452 N.E.2d at 314.  In\r\nthe instant case, as discussed supra, the district court assessed\r\nthe evidence, in particular, Krock's credibility in recounting his\r\ndescription of events, the lack of credibility and of personal\r\nknowledge on the part of the Bank's witness, Harper, and the\r\nunexplained absence of the Bank's former vice president, Balthrope,\r\nwho was the only person besides Krock who was privy to the actual\r\nconversations in dispute.  On the basis of its assessment of the\r\nevidence, the district court determined that a subsequent\r\nmodification was indeed agreed upon by the parties and was\r\nenforceable.  The court's decision was not clearly erroneous.\r\nBeal Bank's final argument is that, even if the district\r\ncourt was correct that the subsequent oral modification was\r\nenforceable as testified to by Krock, the court erred in applying\r\nthat modified agreement.  The district court calculated the amount\r\nby which the sale price of the Pier 37 property ($1,505,000)\r\nexceeded $900,000, i.e., $605,000, and multiplied it by two-thirds,\r\nfor an offset of $403,333.  The court then applied this offset to\r\nthe principal amount of Krock's obligation to the bank, $350,000. \r\nThe court therefore determined that the offset totally extinguished\r\nKrock's debt.  Beal Bank argues that the $403,333 reduction should\r\ninstead be applied against the gross amount of the obligation   \r\nincluding accrued interest, late charges, and legal fees   \r\ncalculated as of the time of trial.  So calculated, Krock would\r\nstill owe the bank over $100,000.  \r\nKrock points out that Beal Bank failed to raise this\r\noffset argument at the district court level, including in its\r\nmotion for reconsideration, where it made an entirely different\r\nargument.  Krock argues that the Bank has therefore waived its\r\noffset argument; it cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. \r\nSee Brown, 68 F.3d at 530.\r\nBut prior to receiving Judge Harrington's ruling, Beal\r\nBank did not know what offset terms he would hold were contained in\r\nthe oral modification.  (The Bank did not even know whether Judge\r\nHarrington would find that the parties had agreed to an oral\r\nmodification.)  Thus the Bank could not have raised its offset\r\nargument below, except through a post-trial motion, and such a\r\nmotion is not a prerequisite for perfecting its appeal of the\r\ndistrict court's judgment.  We turn therefore to the merits of the\r\nBank's calculation argument.\r\nWe agree with Krock that the Bank's argument does not\r\nmake sense as to how to apply the offset.  We have found that the\r\ndistrict court properly accepted Krock's testimony as to the nature\r\nand terms of the side agreement.  Thus, the proper calculation\r\nunder the side agreement would apply two-thirds of the amount by\r\nwhich the sale price exceeded $900,000 against Krock's debt at the\r\ntime the property was sold.  If this had been done at that time,\r\nKrock's debt would have been substantially reduced; there would be\r\nno basis for the Bank to have continued charging him interest and\r\ncollection charges against the extinguished portion of the debt. \r\nMuch of the debt as calculated by the Bank would have been erased. \r\nTherefore, we reject the Bank's position that interest and late\r\ncharges should have continued to accrue on Krock's entire debt\r\nthrough the time of trial, before applying the orally agreed-upon\r\noffset.  \r\nBut we also think Krock's contention that the offset\r\nentirely canceled his obligation is exaggerated.  Krock argues on\r\nappeal that the premium should be applied against the $350,000 face\r\namount of the note.  His testimony at trial was simply that it\r\nwould be applied against \"my debt.\"  The words \"my debt\" would\r\nseem, on their face, to include both the principal on the note and\r\nany interest that had accrued up until the time the offset kicked\r\nin.  When the Pier 37 property was sold, on or about June 1, 1995,\r\nthere was at least some interest that had accrued since the date of\r\nthe note in November 1993.  Krock points out that, as of\r\nNovember 8, 1995, the Bank was claiming that his debt was\r\n$449,010.86.  Thus, as of June 1, more than five months earlier,\r\nKrock's debt would have been somewhat less than that amount,\r\nincluding both principal and interest, but clearly more than the\r\n$350,000 face amount of the note that the district court used.  It\r\nappears that the total debt would have been more than the\r\n$403,333.33 offset that should have been applied against it,\r\nleaving some smaller amount still due.  And the Bank would now be\r\nentitled to interest that has subsequently accrued on that smaller\r\namount, between the June 1, 1995 date of offset and the present.  \r\nWe do not, however, think it fair for the Bank to charge\r\nKrock for its attorneys' fees for this litigation, because it is\r\nnot at all clear that any litigation would have been necessary if\r\nthe Bank had simply sought to collect the smaller amount that we\r\nnow hold it was due as of June 1, 1995, as opposed to denying the\r\noffset and seeking to collect the much larger amount that it\r\nclaimed in this action (including an additional three years' worth\r\nof interest on $403,333). \r\nWe therefore remand for a calculation of the proper\r\namount owed, accepting Krock's testimony as to what exactly was\r\ncontained in the subsequently agreed-upon modification of the\r\noriginal contract.  That is, the court should apply the offset as\r\nof the date of sale of the Pier 37 property, and apply it to\r\nKrock's accumulated total debt as of that date.  The district court\r\nshould then calculate the interest that would have accrued on that\r\nreduced amount of debt, from that offset date through the present.\r\nAffirmed as to the existence of the oral modification and\r\nas to its terms; remanded for calculation of the amount owed under\r\nthe modified contract.\r\n",

Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n     Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nDavid D.

Spiro, with whom Edwards &amp; Angell were on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nSeptember 3, 1998\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  In this debt collection\r\ncase, the plaintiff, Beal Bank S.S.B. (\"Beal Bank\"), seeks to\r\ncollect on a note that was part of a written settlement agreement\r\ncontaining a clause that precluded oral modifications.  The debtor,\r\nRichard H. Krock, interposes what he claims was a subsequent oral\r\nmodification of the contract.  The district court, after trial,\r\nfound that the oral modification was in fact agreed upon and was an\r\nenforceable contract under Massachusetts law.  The court concluded\r\ntherefore that the debtor was not liable to the bank.  Holding that\r\nthe district court's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous,\r\nand applying the law of Massachusetts in this diversity action, we\r\naffirm the court's conclusion that the oral modification was\r\nenforceable.  We remand nevertheless for recalculation of the\r\namount owed.\r\n                         Facts\r\nIn 1991, Pier 37 Associates Limited Partnership (\"Pier\r\n37\") executed a promissory note in the amount of $3.6 million to\r\nFirst Mutual Bank for Savings.  This note was secured in part by a\r\nmortgage on a marina located in Falmouth, Massachusetts.  In\r\naddition, defendant Richard H. Krock, who was a general partner of\r\nPier 37, gave a personal guarantee of the note, limited to\r\n$1,600,000.\r\nWhen First Mutual Bank became insolvent, the Federal\r\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") took over its assets.  The\r\nFDIC sued Pier 37, Krock, and others, to collect on the note. \r\nWhile the case was pending, the FDIC assigned its interest in the\r\nnote to BSB Mortgage, Inc. (\"BSB\"), an affiliate of Beal Bank, for\r\napproximately $1,000,000.  In turn, BSB assigned its interest to\r\nBeal Bank. \r\nIn 1993, Beal Bank foreclosed on the property.  The\r\nparties to the litigation, after substantial negotiations, entered\r\ninto a settlement agreement whereby Krock paid Beal Bank $150,000\r\nin cash and executed a $350,000 promissory note, payable over ten\r\nyears in annual installments.  The agreement contained a clause\r\nstating that it was complete and integrated, and that no subsequent\r\nmodifications could be made to the agreement except in writing.\r\nKrock testified that he negotiated an oral side agreement\r\nin which Beal Bank would, if the property sold for over $900,000,\r\nreduce Krock's debt by two-thirds of the amount by which the sale\r\nprice exceeded $900,000.  Krock first discussed this side agreement\r\nwith Will Balthrope, then a vice president of Beal Bank, prior to\r\nthe execution of the settlement agreement.  Krock testified that\r\nBalthrope once again agreed to the offset plan after execution but\r\nbefore Beal Bank sold the marina in 1995 for $1,505,000.  The\r\nexcess of the sale price over $900,000 was $605,000, so, under\r\nKrock's interpretation of the side agreement, his obligation would\r\nbe reduced by two-thirds of that, or $403,333.  Because this\r\nreduction exceeds the face amount of Krock's note to Beal Bank,\r\nKrock asserts he owes Beal Bank nothing.\r\nThe district court, after a bench trial, ruled that the\r\nside agreement did exist, implicitly found it valid under\r\nMassachusetts law, and applied the agreement to reduce Krock's debt\r\nto zero.  The court's decision turned on its finding that Krock was\r\nentirely credible in his testimony regarding the side agreement. \r\nThe court also noted that Balthrope, who was the only other person\r\nbesides Krock with personal knowledge of whether or not there was\r\na subsequent oral modification, and who therefore could have\r\nsupported the Bank's position that Krock's oral agreement claim was\r\nuntrue, was inexplicably not called to the stand nor was his\r\ntestimony preserved, although he had been a bank employee up until\r\ntwo months before trial.  Beal Bank appealed the district court's\r\ndecision.\r\n                       Discussion\r\nTwo issues control the outcome of this case.  One is\r\nfactual:  was there a side agreement made between Krock and\r\nBalthrope, and was it made after the execution of the written\r\nsettlement agreement?  The unrebutted testimony of Krock, accepted\r\nas credible by the district court, plays a major role in answering\r\nthis question.  The second issue is legal:  even if Krock's\r\ntestimony is taken as 100% true as to the existence and timing of\r\nthe side agreement, would such an oral side agreement be\r\nenforceable under Massachusetts law to modify the terms of the\r\nwritten and completely integrated settlement agreement?  We begin\r\nour analysis with the pertinent Massachusetts law.\r\nWe have previously summarized the relevant aspects of\r\nMassachusetts contract law as follows:\r\nEvidence of prior or contemporaneous oral\r\nagreements cannot be admitted to vary or\r\nmodify the terms of an unambiguous written\r\ncontract.

See id.   \r\nIn the present case, Beal Bank devoted a great deal of\r\nits opening brief to its assertion that the parol evidence rule\r\nbars testimony about an oral modification made prior to the\r\nexecution of the settlement agreement.  Yet at trial the district\r\ncourt sustained each and every objection that was properly made\r\nunder the parol evidence rule.  Krock's brief pointed this out, and\r\nmade clear that Krock was not relying on the pre-execution\r\nnegotiations to modify the written instrument.  Rather, he rested\r\nhis defense on the contention that he and Balthrope agreed to a\r\nsubsequent modification of the settlement agreement.\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, if a subsequent agreement is\r\nmade, after the execution of a written contract, it may be\r\nenforceable.  See New England Factors v.

The hand that pens a writing\r\nmay not gag the mouths of the assenting parties.\").  \r\nMassachusetts does, however, impose a heavy burden on the\r\nparty seeking to modify an integrated written contract by a\r\nsubsequent oral agreement:  \"The evidence of a subsequent oral\r\nmodification must be of sufficient force to overcome the\r\npresumption that the integrated and complete agreement, which\r\nrequires written consent to modification, expresses the intent of\r\nthe parties,\" at least as of that time, that the written agreement\r\nrather than any alleged subsequent oral modification should govern. \r\nBoersner, 597 N.E.2d at 1022 n.10.  Whether the intent of the\r\nparties has changed is, of course, a question of fact to be\r\ndetermined by the trier of fact.\r\nKrock testified that he had a conversation with Balthrope\r\nafter execution of the written agreement, and that Balthrope stated\r\na new commitment to reduce Krock's debt obligation by two-thirds of\r\nany amount by which the sale price of the Pier 37 property exceeded\r\n$900,000.\r\nThe district court found Krock's testimony to be\r\ncredible:\r\n[T]he sole disputed factual issue pending\r\nbefore the Court is the credibility of the\r\nwitness Defendant Krock regarding the\r\nexistence of the Side Agreement.  I believe\r\nhis testimony, as it was forthright and\r\nconsistent and his demeanor while under\r\nintense cross-examination displayed the\r\nattitude of an individual who was telling the\r\ntruth with conviction.\r\n\nNot only did the district court find Krock's testimony\r\nwholly believable, but it was essentially unrebutted.  In contrast\r\nwith Krock's testimony as to the existence of the side agreement,\r\nthe court noted that \r\nthe only other witness to the Side Agreement\r\nwas Mr. Balthrope who was not called to\r\ntestify on behalf of [Beal Bank].  Although\r\nMr. Balthrope was listed as a prospective\r\nwitness by the [Bank] in its pretrial filings\r\nand left the employment of the bank only in\r\nJuly [approximately two months before the\r\ntrial], for some inexplicable reason, he was\r\nnot called to the stand nor was his testimony\r\npreserved by way of deposition.  Therefore,\r\nthe credible testimony of the Defendant Krock\r\nstands unrebutted and I accept it.\r\n\nThe court was entitled to draw an adverse inference\r\nagainst Beal Bank because of the absence of any testimony from\r\nBalthrope.  Balthrope was the only person, other than Krock, who\r\nhad personal knowledge as to whether there was indeed a subsequent\r\nside agreement, and what such an agreement may have included. \r\nMoreover, for years prior to the trial, up until two months before\r\ntrial, Balthrope was an employee of the Bank and under its control. \r\nEven Balthrope's termination, pursuant to a layoff, was within the\r\nBank's control.  The bank had included Balthrope on its witness\r\nlist up until the Friday before trial began.  Yet the Bank failed\r\nto present Balthrope's testimony to the court (through subpoena or\r\notherwise) and failed to preserve his testimony through deposition. \r\nIn light of all these circumstances surrounding the Bank's \"missing\r\nwitness,\" the court was entitled to draw an adverse inference\r\nagainst the Bank that Balthrope was not produced because his\r\ntestimony would have been damaging, i.e., it would not have\r\ncontradicted Krock's on the question of the subsequent oral\r\nmodification.  See, e.g., Bath Iron Works Corp. v. United States,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340-41 (1995), aff'd, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir.\r\n1996).  Nor did the bank attempt to rebut this inference by\r\nproviding a legitimate explanation for its failure, such as might\r\nbe the case if the witness had suddenly and unexpectedly died.  \r\nThe Bank did produce one witness in an effort to\r\ncontradict Krock's testimony regarding the subsequent side\r\nagreement:  Steven D. Harper, a commercial loan officer at the bank\r\nfor one year, who had taken over the Krock file from Balthrope. \r\nThe district court considered Harper's demeanor under direct- and\r\ncross-examination, re-direct, re-cross, re-re-direct, and re-re-\r\ncross, and declined to rely on Harper's evidence to undercut\r\nKrock's testimony.  Harper's initial testimony was that he had had\r\nconversations with Balthrope \"regarding the documentation on the\r\nKrock promissory note.\"  Harper had asked Balthrope whether there\r\nwere any documents in the bank's files that would bear upon Krock's\r\nallegation that there was a subsequent side agreement.  Balthrope\r\nhad told Harper that there were no such documents and that he \"did\r\nnot know of any agreement as such.\"  Harper's original testimony\r\ndid not mention any discussion with Balthrope other than about\r\nwritten documentation.  There was nothing one way or the other\r\nabout a possible oral modification, in Harper's direct, cross, re-\r\ndirect, or re-cross examinations.  The only testimony by Harper on\r\noral modification was on re-re-direct.  The district court was\r\nentitled to discount Harper's testimony on re-re-direct, based\r\nupon lack of credibility, regarding anything Balthrope told him\r\nother than about the existence or absence of documents in the\r\nfiles.  We find no clear error in the district court's decision to\r\naccept Krock's \"unrebutted\" testimony.\r\nIn addition to the unrebutted credible testimony of\r\nKrock, the court, in determining intent, was entitled to consider\r\nthe conduct of the parties.  \"Mutual agreement on modification of\r\nthe requirement of a writing may . . . be inferred from the conduct\r\nof the parties and from the attendant circumstances of the\r\n[particular] case.\"  Boersner, 597 N.E.2d at 1022 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted); see Schinkel v.

Here, the parties acted in a way that was consistent with\r\nKrock's testimony that there was a subsequent oral modification.  \r\nWhen Krock's first payment was due under the settlement\r\nagreement, on November 1, 1994, he had no funds and did not pay it. \r\nThe property had not yet been sold by the Bank; the sale did not\r\ntake place until June 1, 1995.  Yet the Bank took no action against\r\nKrock in November 1994 nor in early 1995; indeed, it did not file\r\nsuit against Krock until December 1995, more than six months after\r\nthe sale of the Pier 37 property.  Krock testified as to a\r\nconversation he had with Balthrope after his default but before the\r\nsale.  According to Krock's unrebutted testimony, Balthrope told\r\nhim the Bank \"wouldn't do anything, he [Balthrope] wouldn't do\r\nanything until such time as the sale took place and . . . the\r\nreduction, if any, in the note could be quantified, and then the\r\nwhole thing would be restructured based upon the reduced amount of\r\nthe note and the reduced payment.\"  Consistent with this\r\nconversation, Krock waited until the sale took place; he did not\r\npay any part of his $40,000 payment that was due on November 1,\r\n1994, nor in early 1995.  Likewise, the Bank took no action against\r\nhim prior to its June 1, 1995 sale of the property.\r\nAfter the sale but before suit was filed against him,\r\nKrock had another conversation with Balthrope.  Krock told\r\nBalthrope that, in light of the high price received for the\r\nproperty, their oral agreement should wipe out his debt on the\r\nnote.  Krock testified that Balthrope did not dispute the validity\r\nof the subsequent oral modification or Krock's interpretation of\r\nit; instead, he responded by saying \"they're not going to pursue it\r\nanyway because the financials show that there is no ability to\r\npay.\"  Although the Bank eventually did pursue Krock by filing\r\nsuit in December 1995, the Bank's actions (or non-action) prior to\r\nthat time is consistent with Krock's version of events.  \r\nWe conclude that the district court's acceptance of\r\nKrock's version of events was not clearly erroneous, even applying\r\nthe requirement under Massachusetts law that Krock has to meet a\r\nheavier burden of proof in order for an oral modification to be\r\neffective against a written contract.  As part of that heavier\r\nburden, Massachusetts courts typically require \"'ample evidence,'\"\r\ndemonstrating that \"the party denying the existence of a\r\nmodification had . . . 'unequivocally' expressed [its] approval 'of\r\nthe many pertinent details' of the new agreement.\"  Boersner, 597\r\nN.E.2d at 1022 (quoting First Pa. Mortgage Trust v.

We think the above-\r\ndescribed evidence is \"ample,\" and the only \"pertinent detail[]\" of\r\nthe new agreement was the offset by two-thirds of the sale price's\r\nexcess over $900,000.  According to Krock's credible testimony,\r\nBalthrope agreed to this detail \"unequivocally.\"\r\nWe hold therefore that the district court did not clearly\r\nerr in concluding that Krock's version of events was credible, nor\r\ndid it err in its legal conclusion that the subsequent modification\r\nthat Krock described is enforceable.  We turn briefly to the Bank's\r\nother arguments on appeal.\r\nThe Bank contends that the alleged subsequent\r\nmodification agreement fails because no consideration was given by\r\nKrock in exchange for the Bank's willingness to modify the amount\r\nof Krock's debt based on the sale price of the Pier 37 property. \r\nThe Bank acknowledges that, \"under appropriate proof, an oral\r\nmodification may be found,\" but if so, \"the new contract created by\r\nthe subsequent modification must be supported by consideration.\" \r\nBank Br. at 15 (citing Siegel v.

The Bank points out that Krock did not take any\r\n\"action in reliance on the alleged reaffirmation of the prior\r\nagreement other than to continue to fail to make the payments he\r\nagreed to make under the Note.\"  Id.  The Bank also relies heavily\r\non 3 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts  1826 (4th ed. 1992),\r\nas quoted in De Blois v. Boylston &amp; Tremont Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n827 (Mass. 1933):\r\n[A] subsequent contract completely covering\r\nthe same subject-matter and made by the same\r\nparties as an earlier agreement, but\r\ncontaining terms inconsistent with the former\r\ncontract, so that the two cannot stand\r\ntogether, rescinds, substitutes and is\r\nsubstituted for the earlier contract and\r\nbecomes the only agreement of the parties on\r\nthe subject.  But the subsequent agreement\r\nmust have sufficient consideration.  Therefore\r\nif the undertaking by one party is simply to\r\nperform the whole or part of what he promised\r\nin the original contract, it will not support\r\na promise by the other party to perform what\r\nhe previously agreed and something more.\r\n\nThe Bank asserts that this is still good law in Massachusetts.\r\nAs Krock points out, however, the Bank never made this\r\nconsideration argument below.  Although Krock stated in his\r\nopposition to the Bank's motion in limine that consideration is not\r\nrequired for an oral modification to be effective against a written\r\ncontract under Massachusetts law, the Bank did not respond in its\r\npretrial motion papers, conferences, or at trial.  Moreover, after\r\nthe district court ruled against it, the Bank failed to file any\r\nmotion for a new trial or to alter or amend judgment within the\r\nten-day period set forth in Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure Rule.  And in the motion for reconsideration that the\r\nBank filed on the twentieth day, the Bank again failed to mention\r\nlack of consideration as a defect in Krock's case.\r\nAs we have said on numerous occasions, we will not\r\nconsider on appeal issues that could have been, but were not,\r\nraised in the trial court.

The\r\ndoctrine of consideration does not necessarily bar enforcement of\r\na subsequent oral contract modification.  \"Modifications . . . have\r\nlong been recognized in law as valid, without additional\r\nconsideration, even when based on oral agreements modifying\r\nexecutory written contracts.\"  Roddy &amp; McNulty Ins.

See Roddy &amp; McNulty, 452 N.E.2d at 314.  In\r\nthe instant case, as discussed supra, the district court assessed\r\nthe evidence, in particular, Krock's credibility in recounting his\r\ndescription of events, the lack of credibility and of personal\r\nknowledge on the part of the Bank's witness, Harper, and the\r\nunexplained absence of the Bank's former vice president, Balthrope,\r\nwho was the only person besides Krock who was privy to the actual\r\nconversations in dispute.  On the basis of its assessment of the\r\nevidence, the district court determined that a subsequent\r\nmodification was indeed agreed upon by the parties and was\r\nenforceable.  The court's decision was not clearly erroneous.\r\nBeal Bank's final argument is that, even if the district\r\ncourt was correct that the subsequent oral modification was\r\nenforceable as testified to by Krock, the court erred in applying\r\nthat modified agreement.  The district court calculated the amount\r\nby which the sale price of the Pier 37 property ($1,505,000)\r\nexceeded $900,000, i.e., $605,000, and multiplied it by two-thirds,\r\nfor an offset of $403,333.  The court then applied this offset to\r\nthe principal amount of Krock's obligation to the bank, $350,000. \r\nThe court therefore determined that the offset totally extinguished\r\nKrock's debt.  Beal Bank argues that the $403,333 reduction should\r\ninstead be applied against the gross amount of the obligation   \r\nincluding accrued interest, late charges, and legal fees   \r\ncalculated as of the time of trial.  So calculated, Krock would\r\nstill owe the bank over $100,000.  \r\nKrock points out that Beal Bank failed to raise this\r\noffset argument at the district court level, including in its\r\nmotion for reconsideration, where it made an entirely different\r\nargument.  Krock argues that the Bank has therefore waived its\r\noffset argument; it cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. \r\nSee Brown, 68 F.3d at 530.\r\nBut prior to receiving Judge Harrington's ruling, Beal\r\nBank did not know what offset terms he would hold were contained in\r\nthe oral modification.  (The Bank did not even know whether Judge\r\nHarrington would find that the parties had agreed to an oral\r\nmodification.)  Thus the Bank could not have raised its offset\r\nargument below, except through a post-trial motion, and such a\r\nmotion is not a prerequisite for perfecting its appeal of the\r\ndistrict court's judgment.  We turn therefore to the merits of the\r\nBank's calculation argument.\r\nWe agree with Krock that the Bank's argument does not\r\nmake sense as to how to apply the offset.  We have found that the\r\ndistrict court properly accepted Krock's testimony as to the nature\r\nand terms of the side agreement.  Thus, the proper calculation\r\nunder the side agreement would apply two-thirds of the amount by\r\nwhich the sale price exceeded $900,000 against Krock's debt at the\r\ntime the property was sold.  If this had been done at that time,\r\nKrock's debt would have been substantially reduced; there would be\r\nno basis for the Bank to have continued charging him interest and\r\ncollection charges against the extinguished portion of the debt. \r\nMuch of the debt as calculated by the Bank would have been erased. \r\nTherefore, we reject the Bank's position that interest and late\r\ncharges should have continued to accrue on Krock's entire debt\r\nthrough the time of trial, before applying the orally agreed-upon\r\noffset.  \r\nBut we also think Krock's contention that the offset\r\nentirely canceled his obligation is exaggerated.  Krock argues on\r\nappeal that the premium should be applied against the $350,000 face\r\namount of the note.  His testimony at trial was simply that it\r\nwould be applied against \"my debt.\"  The words \"my debt\" would\r\nseem, on their face, to include both the principal on the note and\r\nany interest that had accrued up until the time the offset kicked\r\nin.  When the Pier 37 property was sold, on or about June 1, 1995,\r\nthere was at least some interest that had accrued since the date of\r\nthe note in November 1993.  Krock points out that, as of\r\nNovember 8, 1995, the Bank was claiming that his debt was\r\n$449,010.86.  Thus, as of June 1, more than five months earlier,\r\nKrock's debt would have been somewhat less than that amount,\r\nincluding both principal and interest, but clearly more than the\r\n$350,000 face amount of the note that the district court used.  It\r\nappears that the total debt would have been more than the\r\n$403,333.33 offset that should have been applied against it,\r\nleaving some smaller amount still due.  And the Bank would now be\r\nentitled to interest that has subsequently accrued on that smaller\r\namount, between the June 1, 1995 date of offset and the present.  \r\nWe do not, however, think it fair for the Bank to charge\r\nKrock for its attorneys' fees for this litigation, because it is\r\nnot at all clear that any litigation would have been necessary if\r\nthe Bank had simply sought to collect the smaller amount that we\r\nnow hold it was due as of June 1, 1995, as opposed to denying the\r\noffset and seeking to collect the much larger amount that it\r\nclaimed in this action (including an additional three years' worth\r\nof interest on $403,333). \r\nWe therefore remand for a calculation of the proper\r\namount owed, accepting Krock's testimony as to what exactly was\r\ncontained in the subsequently agreed-upon modification of the\r\noriginal contract.  That is, the court should apply the offset as\r\nof the date of sale of the Pier 37 property, and apply it to\r\nKrock's accumulated total debt as of that date.  The district court\r\nshould then calculate the interest that would have accrued on that\r\nreduced amount of debt, from that offset date through the present.\r\nAffirmed as to the existence of the oral modification and\r\nas to its terms; remanded for calculation of the amount owed under\r\nthe modified contract.\r\n</pre>",
