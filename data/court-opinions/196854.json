Based on the entire record of\r\n\nsentencing,  which  reveals   the  defendant   unquestionably\r\n\naccountable  for up to 100  kilograms of cocaine,  we find no\r\n\nabuse of discretion in  the district court's implicit finding\r\n\nof good cause to allow the government's tardy objection.\r\n\n          Affirmed.
