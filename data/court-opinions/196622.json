Less, Counsel,  Department  of  Correction, on  brief  for\r                        \r\nappellee, Larry E. DuBois.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        March 8, 1996\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Plaintiff-appellant, who was committed\r                                \r\n\nin 1983 to  the Bridgewater,  Massachusetts Treatment  Center\r\n\nfor  the Sexually  Dangerous, appeals  the  dismissal of  his\r\n\ncivil rights  complaint under 42  U.S.C.   1983 as  barred by\r\n\nthe  statute of  limitations.    The  district  court  fairly\r\n\nconstrued the  complaint as  seeking damages for  appellant's\r\n\ntransfer,  in 1990, to M.C.I., Cedar Junction where allegedly\r\n\nhe  was held  without  treatment  for more  than  a year,  in\r\n\nviolation of state law governing the indeterminate commitment\r\n\nof sexually dangerous  persons under Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 123A.\r\n\nCorrectly   applying  federal   law   standards,  the   court\r\n\ndetermined that the  alleged cause of  action accrued at  the\r\n\nlatest on September  25, 1991, when the  state court declared\r\n\nthe  transfer  improper  and ordered  plaintiff's  return  to\r\n\nBridgewater.  Appellant's continued  incarceration at M.C.I.,\r\n\nCedar Junction  for a period  of time after the  accrual date\r\n\ndid not  trigger a  new limitations  period  because in  fact\r\n\nappellant had requested or approved the stay of his return to\r\n\nBridgewater while  he petitioned  for release  on the  ground\r\n\nthat he was \"no longer  sexually dangerous.\"  Thus, the court\r\n\nproperly held  this complaint  barred by  the borrowed  state\r\n\nlimitations period of three years  for the commencement of an\r\n\naction sounding in tort under 42 U.S.C.   1983.\r\n\n          Plaintiff argues on appeal that his suit was timely\r\n\ncommenced by  his earlier filing  in the district court  of a\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npetition for a  writ of habeas corpus, which  he describes as\r\n\n\"identical\"  to the  instant complaint.1    We have  compared\r                                                   1\r\n\nplaintiff's  pending  petition  for  habeas  relief with  the\r\n\ncomplaint  in  this  action.   Without  attempting  a precise\r\n\ncharacterization of  his allegations,  we  conclude that  the\r\n\npleadings are significantly  different from one another.   In\r\n\nthe  habeas petition plaintiff seeks release from his current\r\n\nimprisonment at the Bridgewater treatment center.  The thrust\r\n\nof his civil  rights complaint, as  we have said, is  a quest\r\n\nfor damages for  the period during which he  was incarcerated\r\n\nwithout  treatment at M.C.I.,  Cedar Junction.   Although the\r\n\ncivil rights complaint  also contains a demand  for immediate\r\n\nrelease, it  was properly  dismissed without prejudice  since\r\n\nhabeas corpus  is the exclusive  remedy for a  state prisoner\r\n\nseeking release from  his current confinement.   See Heck  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHumphrey, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2369 (1994).  Any implied claim for\r                    \r\n\ndamages  based on  the  alleged  invalidity  of  the  current\r\n\nconfinement also was  properly dismissed, as premature.   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 2373.   The district court's observations in  footnote one\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1   The  habeas proceeding  was closed in  November, 1994,\r               1\r\napparently  due to  a clerical  error.   It  was reopened  on\r\nplaintiff's motion during the  pendency of this appeal.   See\r                                                                         \r\nTate v.

Although  plaintiff represented  to\r\nthe district court that he  would withdraw this appeal if his\r\nhabeas case was  reopened, he has not sought  to dismiss this\r\nappeal.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nof   its  memorandum  order   do  not  require   a  different\r\n\nconclusion.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
