Julio  Andre  Valdez  challenges  the\r                      Per  Curiam.  \r                                 \r\n\ndistrict court's refusal to depart downward from the sentence\r\n\nprescribed by the U.S.  Sentencing Guidelines.  Specifically,\r\n\nhe argues that the  sentencing disparity between cocaine base\r\n\nand  powder  cocaine  related  offenses  violates the  Eighth\r\n\nAmendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          A jury convicted Valdez  of one count of conspiracy\r\n\nto distribute  cocaine base (\"crack\" cocaine)  and two counts\r\n\nof  distributing cocaine base in violation of 18 U.S.C.    2,\r\n\n841,  and 846 on  April 25, 1995.   Valdez had  been arrested\r\n\nafter  twice  selling crack  cocaine  to  a Drug  Enforcement\r\n\nAgency informant in Providence, Rhode Island. \r\n\n          Based on the total  amount of cocaine base involved\r\n\nin  the   transactions  (105   grams),  the   district  court\r\n\ndetermined  Valdez's  base  offense   level  under  the  U.S.\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines  to be 32.   His two  prior convictions\r\n\nresulted  in a criminal  history category of III.   The judge\r\n\nimposed a  sentence  of 151  months in  jail and  5 years  of\r\n\nsupervised  release,  with  special  conditions  relating  to\r\n\ndeportation  and  substance  abuse counseling  --  the lowest\r\n\nsentence permissible within the applicable guideline range. \r\n\n          At the sentencing hearing Valdez made two arguments\r\n\nfor downward  departure.   First, he  argued that  the United\r\n\n                              2\r\r\n\nStates Sentencing Commission's  February 1995 Special  Report\r\n\nto  Congress (the \"Report\"),  which recommended  reducing the\r\n\ndisparity between sentences for  crack offenses and those for\r\n\ncocaine  offenses,  constituted  a   mitigating  circumstance\r\n\nwarranting a downward departure  under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0, p.s.\r\n\nSecond,  he argued that  the court should also  depart on the\r\n\nbasis  of  various  personal  characteristics,  such  as  his\r\n\nlimited  education, pursuant  to U.S.S.G.    5H1,  p.s.   The\r\n\ncourt rejected these arguments and refused to depart.\r\n\n          Apparently having abandoned the claims for downward\r\n\ndeparture  based  on  specific  offender  characteristics and\r\n\nmitigating circumstances,1 Valdez  appeals his sentence on  a\r\n\nnewly  raised ground:  that  the  100-to-1 disparity  between\r\n\ncrack  and  powder  cocaine  penalties  violates  the  Eighth\r\n\nAmendment, and the district court was thus required to depart\r\n\ndownward.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The court does not have appellate jurisdiction over\r\n\na  court's discretionary  refusal  to depart  downward.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100, 103 (1st Cir. 1997);\r                                     \r\n\nUnited States v.  Sanchez, 81  F.3d 9, 10  (1st Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Although Valdez's brief does not appear to challenge the\r\ncourt's refusal to depart on the ground that the Report\r\nconstitutes \"mitigating circumstances,\" the government\r\naddresses the claim in its brief.  To the extent that Valdez\r\npresents this argument, we reject it.  As we have previously\r\nheld, the Report is not a permissible ground for departure. \r\nUnited States v. Andrade, 94 F.3d 9, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1996).   \r                                    \r\n\n                              3\r\r\n\ndenied, 117 S. Ct. 201 (1996).   We can, however, review  the\r                  \r\n\nrefusal if it was based on the mistaken belief that the court\r\n\nhad no  authority to depart.   See Saldana, 109  F.3d at 103.\r                                                      \r\n\nEven assuming that the court's failure to depart downward sua\r                                                                         \r\n\nsponte on a ground  not raised before it is  reviewable under\r                  \r\n\nthe latter principle, Valdez  still has a hurdle to  clear to\r\n\nachieve appellate review.\r\n\n          We  reject  Valdez's new  argument that  the Eighth\r\n\nAmendment prohibited  the sentence  he received.   Because of\r\n\nhis failure to raise  the constitutional claim below,  we can\r\n\nreview  only for plain  error.  United States  v. Carvell, 74\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 8, 14 (1st  Cir. 1996) (\"[I]ssues not raised  below will\r\n\nnot be heard on  appeal unless there was plain error.\").   We\r\n\nsee  no plain  error  here,  nor  has  any  such  error  been\r\n\npresented to us.  See United States v. Graciani,  61 F.3d 70,\r                                                           \r\n\n76 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"At most, the Eighth Amendment gives rise\r\n\nto  a  narrow  proportionality  principle,   forbidding  only\r\n\nextreme sentences that  are significantly disproportionate to\r\n\nthe  underlying crime.\"  (internal  citations  and  quotation\r\n\nmarks  omitted)).  For  this reason, we decline  to reach the\r\n\nmerits of Valdez's Eighth  Amendment argument or his argument\r\n\nthat  this court  should  reconsider its  decision in  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Singleterry,  29 F.3d 733, 740-41  (1st Cir. 1994),\r                                 \r\n\nthat, inter  alia, the sentencing disparity  does not violate\r                             \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe  Due   Process  and  Equal  Protection   Clauses  of  the\r\n\nConstitution. \r\n\n          As for  Valdez's belated argument  that the cocaine\r\n\nin this case was not in fact crack cocaine, it is too little,\r\n\ntoo  late.  While  it is within  our discretion to  review an\r\n\nissue  raised  for  the  first  time  in  a  reply  brief  if\r\n\nexceptional circumstances  are shown, Aetna Cas.  Sur. Co. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nP. &amp; B. Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1571 (1st Cir. 1994), we find\r                            \r\n\nno  such  circumstance in  this  case  and  thus  decline  to\r\n\nexercise that discretion.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n",

We can, however, review  the\r                  \r\n\nrefusal if it was based on the mistaken belief that the court\r\n\nhad no  authority to depart.   See Saldana, 109  F.3d at 103.\r                                                      \r\n\nEven assuming that the court's failure to depart downward sua\r                                                                         \r\n\nsponte on a ground  not raised before it is  reviewable under\r                  \r\n\nthe latter principle, Valdez  still has a hurdle to  clear to\r\n\nachieve appellate review.\r\n\n          We  reject  Valdez's new  argument that  the Eighth\r\n\nAmendment prohibited  the sentence  he received.
