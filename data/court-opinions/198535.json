Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nWilliam T. Boyle on brief for appellant.\r\nJerry Lee Robertson on supplemental brief pro se.\r\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Stephanie S.\r\nBrowne, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 24, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of the record and the briefs,\r\nwe conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying\r\nan enhancement for obstruction of justice.  The guidelines\r\nthemselves, as well as the pre-sentence report, gave ample notice\r\nthat the enhancement might be applied.  The district court's\r\nfindings were specific enough, and we have no reason to second-\r\nguess the district court's negative view of defendant's probity.  \r\nWe also have reviewed to the extent possible the arguments\r\nraised in defendant's supplemental brief.  Even were those\r\narguments adequately developed and properly before us, we would\r\nfind no merit in any of them.  Contrary to defendant's arguments:\r\nthe affidavit sufficiently supported the warrant; the evidence\r\nsufficiently supported the convictions; and the jury instructions\r\nsufficiently explained the elements of the offenses and the\r\ngovernment's burden of proof.  Further, defendant's sentence was\r\ncalculated appropriately in light of the conviction for possession\r\nwith intent to distribute heroin within 1000 feet of a school; the\r\nweapons enhancement was not clearly erroneous in light of the\r\ncircumstances in which the drugs and guns were found; and,\r\nconsidering defendant's criminal past along with the outstanding\r\nwarrants, we cannot say that the degree of the departure was\r\noutside the district court's discretion in such matters. \r\nThe judgment is affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.  The\r\nbail appeal, no. 98-2130, is dismissed as moot.\n",
