United  States, 486  U.S.  531, 536-37  (1988).\r                                        \r\n\nCongress intended  to  prevent  courts  from  second-guessing\r\n\nsocial,  economic or political  policy decisions made  by the\r\n\nother  two branches  of government.   United  States v.

We agree  that the decision to erect a\r\n\nsteel  pole barrier on  the perimeter of  Punta Borinquen Air\r\n\nBase, so as to prevent entry of automobiles onto  the base in\r\n\naccidents,  was the  exercise  of a  discretionary  function.\r\n\nCertainly no  statute or  regulation  required or  prohibited\r\n\nplacement  of  the  barrier,  so an  element  of  choice  was\r\n\ninvolved.  Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536.  Further, the decision\r                                \r\n\nwas the type of policy decision Congress intended to immunize\r\n\nfrom suit.  Before the  barrier was erected, cars involved in\r\n\naccidents in this  spot would commonly  go through the  chain\r\n\nlink  fence  surrounding  the base.    The  barrier prevented\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nunauthorized cars from entering the secured base.  The courts\r\n\nhave no place second-guessing military commanders'  decisions\r\n\nregarding how best to secure military bases.

This court has held that such decisions are\r\n\nprotected under  the discretionary  function exception,  even\r\n\nwhere they involve  a \"'trade-off between greater  safety and\r\n\ngreater combat effectiveness.'\"   Ayer v.

We express no  opinion on this issue,  since the\r\n\nlower court alternatively found that even if the decision was\r\n\nnot protected under 28 U.S.C.    2680(a), the claim failed on\r\n\nthe merits since the government acted reasonably in providing\r\n\nthe amount and type of warning given.1\r                                                 1\r\n\n     Affirmed.
