JACKSON,\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                            v.\n\n              POLAROID CORPORATION, ET AL.,\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\n\n      APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n    [Hon. George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n                          Before\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\n           Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges. \n\n Emma L. Jackson on brief pro se.\n Vali Buland on brief for appellees, The Cambridge Human Rights\nCommission, Margot Kosberg, Executive Director and Beatrice Acland,\nFact Finder.\n Richard D. Glovsky, Daniel S. Tarlow and Glovsky, Tarlow &amp;\nMilberg LLP on brief for appellees, Polaroid Corporation, Julie O.\nPetrini, Philip G. Kiely, Sr., Edward S. Roman, Richard F. Delima,\nAlana Sharenow, Francis J. Caufield and Elisa Terrasi.\n\nJanuary 4, 1999\n\n        Per Curiam.  The district court dismissed appellant\nEmma Jackson's action against appellees (Polaroid Corp.,\nseveral of its employees, the Cambridge Human Rights\nCommission, and two of its agents) for failure to file a\ncomplaint which complied with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (requiring\na \"short and plain statement\" of a claim).  Specifically, the\ncomplaint appellant served on appellees (an amended complaint)\nconsisted of 54 single-spaced typewritten pages and 141\nparagraphs.  The district court did not dismiss this complaint\noutright, however; rather, it entered an order giving appellant\na deadline by which to file a substitute complaint that\ncomplied with Rule 8(a).\n          Three weeks after the deadline passed, appellant\nfiled a substitute amended complaint.  This time, the complaint\nwas 180 pages long (consisting of mainly double-spaced pages)\nand contained over 350 paragraphs and over 80 counts; it also\nincluded footnotes.  After receiving the substitute complaint,\nthe district court dismissed the case for failure to obey its\nearlier order.  The court also denied appellant's motions for\nreconsideration and clarification.\n          Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) provides, in relevant part,\nthat a district court may dismiss an action \"[f]or failure of\nthe plaintiff . . . to comply with these rules or any order of\ncourt . . . .\"  We review a Rule 41(b) dismissal for abuse of\ndiscretion.  Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 647 (1stCir. 1990).  On a review of the record, we find that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in this case.\n          The severity, and the deliberateness, of the\nviolation of Rule 8 are obvious.  Not only was the amended\ncomplaint long and redundant, but, after being specifically\nwarned to file a complaint that complied with Rule 8, appellant\nfiled another complaint that suffered from the identical\nproblems.  See Kuehl v. FDIC, 8 F.3d 905, 908 (1st Cir. 1993). \nFurther, that the court and the defendants would be prejudiced\nby having to deal with either the amended or substitute amended\ncomplaint also is clear.  \"Unnecessary prolixity in a pleading\nplaces an unjustified burden on the court and the party who\nmust respond to it because they are forced to select the\nrelevant material from a mass of verbiage.\"  5 Charles Alan\nWright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n1281, at 522 (2d ed. 1990).\n          Finally, it was not an abuse of discretion to employ\na sanction less drastic than dismissal.  \"[T]he law is well\nestablished in this circuit that where a noncompliant litigant\nhas manifested a disregard for orders of the court and been\nsuitably forewarned of the consequences of continued\nintransigence, a trial judge need not first exhaust milder\nsanctions before resorting to dismissal.\"  Figueroa Ruiz,\nsupra, 896 F.2d at 649 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).  Thus, appellant's blatant disregard of the district\ncourt's order to file a complaint that complied with Rule 8,\nalong with the specific warning that dismissal would follow\nsuch noncompliance, provided a sufficient basis for the\ndismissal.\n          Based on the foregoing, the district court also did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motions for\nreconsideration and clarification.\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed. \nAppellant's pending motions are denied as moot.\n",
