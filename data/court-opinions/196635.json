Quiles-Espinosa,\r                                                                          \r\nSenior  Litigation  Counsel,  and  Nelson  Perez-Sosa,  Assistant\r                                                               \r\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                           \r\n\n                                          \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.   Appellant, in this  prosecution for possession\r                         \r\n\nof marihuana with intent to distribute (21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) and\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    2),  appeals from  the  court's refusal  to  depart\r\n\ndownward from  the  46-month sentence  recommended  and  accepted\r\n\npursuant to his plea agreement.\r\n\n     The only formal request  for a downward departure was  based\r\n\non  the  circumstances  that appellant  was  the  father of  four\r\n\nchildren,  from age 3  to age 12;  that his wife  was a practical\r\n\nnurse working  with AIDS  patients and  earned $332.00  every two\r\n\nweeks;  that  food has  been  scarce; that,  having  no immediate\r\n\nfamily  available, she has had  to leave her  children alone when\r\n\nworking;  and   that  the  children   receive  psychological  and\r\n\npsychiatric help on a voluntary basis.\r\n\n     At the sentencing hearing, the court and appellant's counsel\r\n\ndiscussed the  circumstances in United States v. Sclamo, 997 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n970 (1st  Cir. 1993), a case  in which we affirmed  a decision of\r\n\nthe  district court to depart downward.  In that case, defendant,\r\n\nthough not a  biological father, nevertheless was  described by a\r\n\npsychologist  as having  demonstrated  over time  a critical  and\r\n\nunique role in  his relationship  with a child  suffering from  a\r\n\nclinical disorder, with a prognosis of risk of serious regression\r\n\nshould defendant be incarcerated.  In the  case at bar, the court\r\n\nnoted  that the persuasive factors in Sclamo were not present and\r                                                      \r\n\nthat  the  family's  turmoil   was  no  more  than  the   natural\r\n\nconsequences of a father's  imprisonment.  It concluded  that the\r\n\ncriteria  for departure set forth in United States v. Rivera, 994\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nF.2d  942 (1st Cir.  1993), had not  been met.   This conclusion,\r\n\nbeing a refusal to exercise discretion to depart downward, is not\r\n\nreviewable.  United States v. Romero, 32 F.3d  641, 653 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1994).\r\n\n     Appellant has briefed a second issue -- that the court erred\r\n\nin not considering coercion  as a ground for downward  departure.\r\n\nOur threshold question is whether any such request was made.\r\n\n     This  is the sequence of events.  At the sentencing hearing,\r\n\nafter  defense counsel  presented  her argument  based on  family\r\n\ncircumstances,  the  court  asked  if  defendant  wished  to  say\r\n\nanything.  He  then gave the  following narrative:   he had  been\r\n\ninvited by a man he thought was a \"noble person\" to go fishing at\r\n\nSt.  Thomas; once  there,  baiting a  net,  he learned  that  the\r\n\nmission was  to get marihuana; he  was to be paid  forty or fifty\r\n\nthousand  dollars for  his participation;  when he  endeavored to\r\n\nleave, his associate exhibited a cellular phone and said he would\r\n\ncall the owner of the marihuana, who would \"see that you and your\r\n\nfamily disappear.\"\r\n\n     Appellant closed his remarks by saying that he had been hurt\r\n\nirreparably, \"for  which reason at  any time the  government will\r\n\narrest him I am willing to unmask him.  That is all.\"\r\n\n     Then  followed three  versions of  what appellant  had said.\r\n\nThe prosecutor pointed out  the inconsistency between appellant's\r\n\ntestimony and  the plea agreement, where  appellant had confessed\r\n\nto participating in the smuggling venture.  The court thought the\r\n\nstory was not a denial of entering the venture but an explanation\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof  how  appellant  became  involved.    It  recognized  that his\r\n\n\"reasons . . . bordered on coercion\" but that this had never been\r\n\nasserted as a defense.  And appellant's counsel  volunteered that\r\n\nappellant had tried to show \"that he is willing at  any time that\r\n\nthe  government needs him, to  cooperate fully and  like he said,\r\n\n'desen mascarar' [unmask] that person that has caused some damage\r\n\nto him and his family.\"\r\n\n     On this record  we cannot say that the court  was faced with\r\n\nany  request to depart downward.   Reviewing for  plain error, we\r\n\nfind  none.   Not only  did  the plea  agreement  contain a  flat\r\n\nacknowledgement  of appellant's participation,  without caveat or\r\n\nexcuse,  but after  the prosecutor  orally summarized  the events\r\n\nleading  up to arrest, the appellant stated his agreement and did\r\n\nnot  accept  the  court's  offer  to  add   any  \"corrections  or\r\n\nmodifications.\"\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                       \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     Chief Judge Torruella                             March 14, 1996\r\n     Judge Cyr\r\n\n     United States v.
