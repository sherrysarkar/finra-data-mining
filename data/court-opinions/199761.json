Appellant Kathleen Hardy fell\n\non a path at the top of Loon Mountain, breaking her leg.                    She\n\nclaims that appellee Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation (\"Loon\n\nMountain\"   or   \"Loon\")   was    responsible    for     her    injury.     The\n\ndistrict court concluded that a New Hampshire recreational use\n\nstatute   immunized   appellee     from   liability      and    thus   granted\n\nsummary judgment for the company.           We affirm.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n      Loon Mountain operates a recreational area on United States\n\nForest Service land in Lincoln, New Hampshire, under a special\n\nuse permit that gives the company a nonexclusive right to offer\n\nrecreational programs at the site.           Loon's mainstay during the\n\nwinter months is its operation of a ski area.                  In the summer,\n\nits   activities   include    a   gondola    ride   to    the    top   of   the\n\nmountain.   The mountain peak houses sightseeing activities, a\n\nsnack bar, and hiking paths.          Under the terms of the Forest\n\nService permit, visitors may hike and sightsee in the area\n\nwithout paying a fee.\n\n      On August 2, 1998, appellant visited Loon Mountain with\n\nseveral companions.        After entering the gondola house at the\n\nbottom of the mountain and reading information about the varied\n\nactivities at the top, each member of appellant's group paid\n\nfive dollars to ride Loon's gondola to the top of the mountain.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fOnce    they    arrived      at    their    destination,         they   saw     a    sign\n\ndirecting visitors to various activities.                   Loon did not charge\n\nadmission       fees   for    any    of    the    activities      offered       at    the\n\nmountain's      crest.    Appellant        visited   the    snack       bar    and   the\n\nglacial caves, and saw a live presentation by \"the Mountain Man\"\n\n(who regaled the visitors with tales of \"folklore, legend, and\n\nlocal history\").         Appellant accessed Loon's various activities\n\non     paths,    bridges      and     wooden      stairways       constructed         and\n\nmaintained by Loon.          Appellant fell and suffered her injuries on\n\nthe way back to the gondola.\n\n       Appellant brought this diversity tort claim, alleging that\n\nappellee negligently designed, constructed and maintained the\n\npath    where    she   fell,       failed    to    warn    her    of    a     hazardous\n\ncondition, and provided her inadequate emergency service after\n\nher fall.        The district court granted appellee's motion for\n\nsummary judgment, holding that a New Hampshire recreational use\n\nstatute rendered Loon immune from liability.\n\n                             II.    Standard of Review\n\n       We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, examining the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.                           See\n\nEuromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).      Summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows\n\nthat there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.             See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c).     The facts here are largely undisputed, so we\n\nfocus mainly on the legal question of the applicability of New\n\nHampshire's recreational use statutes.\n\n                             III.    Discussion\n\n    New Hampshire, like most other states, has enacted statutes\n\ngranting immunity to landowners who allow the public to access\n\ntheir land for recreational purposes.             The statutes, however,\n\nare not limitless: although their precise wording differs, there\n\nis no immunity if the landowner charges the public for access to\n\nthe land.     Both the statutes and their exceptions are logical\n\nbecause they encourage free and open use of recreational space.\n\nWhen landowners directly profit from such access, however, it is\n\nonly fair that they be subject to liability for their negligent\n\nactions.\n\n    In response to appellant's negligence allegations, appellee\n\nsought   to   invoke   two    of    New    Hampshire's   recreational   use\n\nstatutes, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 508:14 and 212:34, contending\n\nthey both were applicable because Loon did not charge for the\n\nactivities at the top of the mountain.           The district court found\n\n§ 508:14 dispositive, and thus did not address § 212:34.                 We\n\nagree that § 508:14 confers immunity upon Loon, and we therefore\n\nalso do not consider the second provision.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f    The statute pertinently provides that \"[a]n owner, occupant,\n\nor lessor of land . . . who without charge permits any person to\n\nuse land for recreational purposes . . . shall not be liable for\n\npersonal injury or property damage. . . .\" N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 508:14 (emphasis added).      \"Charge\" is not defined.       Appellant\n\nargues that the word \"charge\" should be construed broadly to\n\ninclude her five-dollar gondola fee.           She also contends that\n\n§ 508:14's legislative history is inconsistent with a finding of\n\nimmunity    here,   because   the   statute   was   intended   to   convey\n\nimmunity only for gratuitous temporary use of land (for events\n\nsuch as horse shows) and for off-road vehicles.\n\n    The New Hampshire Supreme Court has not addressed the\n\ncontours of the term \"charge\" as used in § 508.14; we must\n\ntherefore divine its likely construction.            See Stratford Sch.\n\nDist., S.A.U. #58 v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., 162 F.3d 718,\n\n720 (1st Cir. 1998) (a federal court sitting in diversity must\n\npredict how the state court would resolve a novel legal issue by\n\nlooking to analogous decisions in other jurisdictions).                 We\n\nbelieve the district court correctly concluded that the New\n\nHampshire   court   likely    would   adopt   the   majority   view   that\n\n\"charge\" means an actual admission fee paid for permission to\n\nenter the land for recreational purposes.           See Howard v. United\n\nStates, 181 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 1999) (payment of fee to private\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\finstructor for sailing lessons in restricted military harbor is\n\nnot a charge by the government); Wilson v. United States, 989\n\nF.2d       953   (8th   Cir.   1993)   (fee   for   use   of   facilities   in\n\ncampground not a charge to use the surrounding land); Flohr v.\n\nPenn. Power & Light Co., 800 F. Supp. 1252 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (no\n\ncharge to access recreational activities where only fee paid was\n\nto rent campsite); Livingston v. Penn. Power & Light Co., 609 F.\n\nSupp. 643, 648 (E.D. Pa. 1985) (easement and license fees to\n\naccess a lake \"cannot logically be considered . . . 'quid pro\n\nquo[s]'\" and thus are not charges);             Majeske v. Jekyll Island\n\nState Park Auth., 209 Ga. App. 118, 433 S.E.2d 304 (Ga. App.\n\n1993) (parking fee does not constitute a charge where fee was\n\nper car, not per occupant, and any other means of accessing the\n\npark was free); City of Louisville v. Silcox, 977 S.W.2d 254\n\n(Ky. Ct. App. 1998) (same).1\n\n\n       1\n       Appellant reasons that many of these cases are inapposite\nbecause the statutes at issue defined \"charge.\"              The\ndefinitions, however, are hardly novel, and are in line with the\neveryday plain meaning of \"charge.\" Compare, e.g., Pa. St. 68\nP.S. § 477-2(4) (\"[T]he admission price or fee asked in return\nfor invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land.\")\nwith The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 347 (2d\ned. 1983) (\"[T]o impose or ask a price or fee. . . .\").\nFurthermore, because the plain meaning of the term \"charge\"\nleads to a sensible construction of the statute, we do not delve\ninto its legislative history. See In re 229 Main St. L.P., 262\nF.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[R]ecourse to [legislative history]\nis impermissible to vary the words of an unambiguous statute\nwhere those words, straightforwardly applied, yield an entirely\nplausible result.\"); New Hampshire v. Rothe, 142 N.H. 483, 485,\n\n                                       -7-\n\f      Moreover, that construction is consistent with our holding\n\nin Collins v. Martella, 17 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994), our only\n\nopinion considering the limits of New Hampshire's recreational\n\nuse statutes.     In Collins, we held that there was no charge for\n\naccessing    a   beach    where       residents       paid   dues   to   a   beach\n\nassociation.     Id. at 5.      Our opinion turned on the crucial fact\n\nthat the residents were permitted to use the beach regardless of\n\nwhether they paid dues.          Therefore, dues payments by some were\n\ninconsequential.       Here, appellant concedes that she could have\n\nhiked to the mountain's summit for free; instead, she opted to\n\npay   five   dollars     to    ride   the     gondola.       Whatever    mode   of\n\ntransportation she used to arrive at the summit is immaterial:\n\nthe attractions there were free to all.                      The gondola fee,\n\ntherefore, was not a \"charge\" for appellant's use of the land on\n\nwhich she was injured.\n\n      Appellant argues that the term \"charge\" should be broadly\n\nconstrued    because     the   exemption       from    liability    provided    by\n\n§ 508:14 is in \"derogation of common law,\" Collins, 17 F.3d at\n\n4, and thus must be given limited application.                      As explained\n\nsupra, however, the critical flaw in appellant's argument is\n\nthat the gondola fee was in exchange for the gondola ride, not\n\nfor access to the attractions.              Accepting appellant's argument\n\n\n703 A.2d 884, 885 (1997) (same).\n\n                                        -8-\n\fand taking it to its logical conclusion would require that any\n\ncharge by Loon to facilitate access to its attractions would\n\nconstitute a charge (such as a fee for a bus ride from a hotel\n\nto the base of the mountain).        We think the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court would find that such tangential exchanges of money\n\nare not within the ambit of the term \"charge,\" although the\n\nstatute as a whole is narrowly construed.\n\n    Our construction of the term \"charge\" promotes sound public\n\npolicy.   If we were to construe the gondola fee as a charge, the\n\nresult would be inconsistent applications of § 508:14.      Under\n\nappellant's rationale, Loon would not be immune in her case, but\n\nwould be exempted from liability for the same accident if the\n\nperson had hiked up the mountain.     Because the injury occurred\n\nin the course of an activity for which there was no charge, §\n\n508:14 is applicable and the district court properly granted\n\nsummary judgment for Loon Mountain.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Because the injury occurred in the course of an activity for which there was no charge, &#167; 508:14 is applicable and the district court properly granted summary judgment for Loon Mountain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Appellant reasons that many of these cases are inapposite because the statutes at issue defined \"charge.\" The definitions, however, are hardly novel, and are in line with the everyday plain meaning of \"charge.\" Compare, e.g., Pa.

Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge Robert G. Eaton, with whom Michelle LaCount, Christopher E.

She claims that appellee Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation (\"Loon Mountain\" or \"Loon\") was responsible for her injury. The district court concluded that a New Hampshire recreational use statute immunized appellee from liability and thus granted summary judgment for the company. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loon Mountain operates a recreational area on United States Forest Service land in Lincoln, New Hampshire, under a special use permit that gives the company a nonexclusive right to offer recreational programs at the site. Loon's mainstay during the winter months is its operation of a ski area. In the summer, its activities include a gondola ride to the top of the mountain. The mountain peak houses sightseeing activities, a snack bar, and hiking paths. Under the terms of the Forest Service permit, visitors may hike and sightsee in the area without paying a fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 2, 1998, appellant visited Loon Mountain with several companions. After entering the gondola house at the bottom of the mountain and reading information about the varied activities at the top, each member of appellant's group paid five dollars to ride Loon's gondola to the top of the mountain. Once they arrived at their destination, they saw a sign directing visitors to various activities. Loon did not charge admission fees for any of the activities offered at the mountain's crest. Appellant visited the snack bar and the glacial caves, and saw a live presentation by \"the Mountain Man\" (who regaled the visitors with tales of \"folklore, legend, and local history\"). Appellant accessed Loon's various activities on paths, bridges and wooden stairways constructed and maintained by Loon. Appellant fell and suffered her injuries on the way back to the gondola.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant brought this diversity tort claim, alleging that appellee negligently designed, constructed and maintained the path where she fell, failed to warn her of a hazardous condition, and provided her inadequate emergency service after her fall. The district court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, holding that a New Hampshire recreational use statute rendered Loon immune from liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, examining the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Euromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751692\"><a href=\"/opinion/751692/euromotion-inc-dba-prime-wholesalers-v-bmw-of-north-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span>, 869 (1st Cir. 1998). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The facts here are largely undisputed, so we focus mainly on the legal question of the applicability of New Hampshire's recreational use statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire, like most other states, has enacted statutes granting immunity to landowners who allow the public to access their land for recreational purposes. The statutes, however, are not limitless: although their precise wording differs, there is no immunity if the landowner charges the public for access to the land. Both the statutes and their exceptions are logical because they encourage free and open use of recreational space. When landowners directly profit from such access, however, it is only fair that they be subject to liability for their negligent actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to appellant's negligence allegations, appellee sought to invoke two of New Hampshire's recreational use statutes, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167;&#167; 508:14 and 212:34, contending they both were applicable because Loon did not charge for the activities at the top of the mountain. The district court found &#167; 508:14 dispositive, and thus did not address &#167; 212:34. We agree that &#167; 508:14 confers immunity upon Loon, and we therefore also do not consider the second provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute pertinently provides that \"[a]n owner, occupant, or lessor of land . . . who without charge permits any person to use land for recreational purposes . . . shall not be liable for personal injury or property damage. . . .\" N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 508:14 (emphasis added). \"Charge\" is not defined. Appellant argues that the word \"charge\" should be construed broadly to include her five-dollar gondola fee. She also contends that &#167; 508:14's legislative history is inconsistent with a finding of immunity here, because the statute was intended to convey immunity only for gratuitous temporary use of land (for events such as horse shows) and for off-road vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire Supreme Court has not addressed the contours of the term \"charge\" as used in &#167; 508.14; we must therefore divine its likely construction. See Stratford Sch. Dist., S.A.U. #58 v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198249\"><a href=\"/opinion/198249/stratford-v-employers/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span>, 720 (1st Cir. 1998) (a federal court sitting in diversity must predict how the state court would resolve a novel legal issue by looking to analogous decisions in other jurisdictions). We believe the district court correctly concluded that the New Hampshire court likely would adopt the majority view that \"charge\" means an actual admission fee paid for permission to enter the land for recreational purposes.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764970\"><a href=\"/opinion/764970/frances-howard-v-united-states-of-america-us-sailing-association-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 1999) (payment of fee to private instructor for sailing lessons in restricted military harbor is not a charge by the government); Wilson v.

Ct. App. 1998) (same).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, that construction is consistent with our holding in Collins v. Martella, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195214\"><a href=\"/opinion/195214/collins-v-martella/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1994), our only opinion considering the limits of New Hampshire's recreational use statutes. In Collins, we held that there was no charge for accessing a beach where residents paid dues to a beach association. Id. at 5. Our opinion turned on the crucial fact that the residents were permitted to use the beach regardless of whether they paid dues. Therefore, dues payments by some were inconsequential. Here, appellant concedes that she could have hiked to the mountain's summit for free; instead, she opted to pay five dollars to ride the gondola. Whatever mode of transportation she used to arrive at the summit is immaterial: the attractions there were free to all. The gondola fee, therefore, was not a \"charge\" for appellant's use of the land on which she was injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the term \"charge\" should be broadly construed because the exemption from liability provided by &#167; 508:14 is in \"derogation of common law,\" Collins, 17 F.3d at 4, and thus must be given limited application. As explained supra, however, the critical flaw in appellant's argument is that the gondola fee was in exchange for the gondola ride, not for access to the attractions. Accepting appellant's argument and taking it to its logical conclusion would require that any charge by Loon to facilitate access to its attractions would constitute a charge (such as a fee for a bus ride from a hotel to the base of the mountain). We think the New Hampshire Supreme Court would find that such tangential exchanges of money are not within the ambit of the term \"charge,\" although the statute as a whole is narrowly construed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our construction of the term \"charge\" promotes sound public policy. If we were to construe the gondola fee as a charge, the result would be inconsistent applications of &#167; 508:14. Under appellant's rationale, Loon would not be immune in her case, but would be exempted from liability for the same accident if the person had hiked up the mountain. Because the injury occurred in the course of an activity for which there was no charge, &#167; 508:14 is applicable and the district court properly granted summary judgment for Loon Mountain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Appellant reasons that many of these cases are inapposite because the statutes at issue defined \"charge.\" The definitions, however, are hardly novel, and are in line with the everyday plain meaning of \"charge.\" Compare, e.g., Pa.
