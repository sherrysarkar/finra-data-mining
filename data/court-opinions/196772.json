Plaintiff A.G.  Edwards, Jr.  appeals\r                                \r\n\nfrom  the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor\r\n\nof  defendants New  England Telephone  and Telegraph  Co. and\r\n\nNYNEX Corp.  We affirm the judgment of the district court for\r\n\nthe reasons  stated in  the court's Memorandum  and Decision.\r\n\nWe add only the following comments:\r\n\n          1.   It is plain  that the district court liberally\r\n\nconstrued plaintiff's pleadings as  required by cases such as\r\n\nHaines  v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972).  Indeed, for purposes\r                             \r\n\nof  its analysis on the merits, it gave plaintiff the benefit\r\n\nof  the  doubt  and  accepted  as  true  his  assertion  that\r\n\ndefendants  owned  the telephones  in  question.   The  court\r\n\nnonetheless  determined  that,  aside  from  speculation  and\r\n\nconjecture, plaintiff  had provided no facts  tending to show\r                                                        \r\n\nthat  the telephones  were defectively  designed or  that the\r\n\nsounds  the  telephones  emitted  caused  his  hearing  loss.\r\n\nDespite his pro se status,  plaintiff still was obligated  to\r\n\ncomply with what the substantive law required.  See Eagle Eye\r                                                                         \r\n\nFishing Corp. v.  United States  Dep't of  Commerce, 20  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n503,  506  (1st  Cir.  1994) (\"[t]he  Constitution  does  not\r\n\nrequire judges . . . to take up the slack when a party elects\r\n\nto represent himself\").\r\n\n          2.   We also see nothing amiss with the process the\r\n\ndistrict court  employed in deciding  defendants' motion  for\r\n\nsummary  judgment.  While the record must be construed in the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nnon-movant's  favor,  that party  still must  submit specific\r                                                                         \r\n\nfacts  sufficient to  show a  real  dispute.   Griggs-Ryan v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSmith,  904 F.2d  112, 115  (1st Cir.  1990).   \"[C]onclusory\r                 \r\n\nresponses unsupported by evidence  . . . will [not]  serve to\r\n\ndefeat a  properly focused  Rule 56  motion.\"   Id. (citation\r                                                               \r\n\nomitted)  (non-movant may  not  simply rest  upon his  or her\r\n\npleadings).   As  the  district court  found, plaintiff  only\r\n\noffered his conclusions without specifying  any corroborative\r\n\nfacts.   Based on  this state of  affairs, a  hearing was not\r\n\nmandated.  Cf.  Posadas de  Puerto Rico, Inc.  v. Radin,  856\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 399,  400-01  (1st  Cir.  1988)  (where  the  facts  are\r\n\nundisputed, a hearing is not  necessary).  As for plaintiff's\r\n\nrequest for more time to substantiate his claims, he does not\r\n\nindicate  exactly  what  facts  additional   discovery  would\r\n\nreveal.    Thus,  the  district  court  did  not   abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion when it implicitly denied this entreaty.  See Bank\r                                                                         \r\n\nOne Texas, N.A.  v. A. J. Warehouse,  Inc., 968 F.2d 94,  100\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1992) (a district court may grant summary judgment\r\n\ndespite an  opposing party's  assertion that discovery  would\r\n\nlead  to more facts where the opposing party does not specify\r\n\nthe facts that discovery would reveal).\r\n\n          3.   The district court refused to  enter a default\r\n\njudgment  against defendants or  summarily deny  their motion\r\n\nfor  summary judgment  for failing  to confer  with plaintiff\r\n\nprior to filing their motion for summary judgment.  See L.R.,\r                                                                   \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nD.Mass. 7.1(A)(2).  The parties had attended a non-productive\r\n\nsettlement conference about a year and a half after plaintiff\r\n\nbegan  the  action.   The  defendants  filed the  motion  for\r\n\nsummary  judgment  just   six  weeks  after   the  settlement\r\n\nconference.   Because plaintiff  was not  likely to  change a\r\n\nposition he had held  for over a year in the  six-week period\r\n\nafter  the abortive  conference, the  district court  did not\r\n\nabuse its  discretion in  not imposing such  severe sanctions\r\n\nagainst defendants.  See Gerakaris v. Champagne, 913 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n\n646,  651  (D. Mass.  1996)  (neglecting to  confer  prior to\r\n\nfiling  a motion to dismiss, which was certain to be opposed,\r\n\ndoes not warrant the summary denial of the motion).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
