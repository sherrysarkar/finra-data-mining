The difficulty  of wending\r                      LYNCH, Circuit  Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nthrough this country's immigration laws -- for the immigrants\r\n\ninvolved, for  the courts, and even for  the federal agencies\r\n\ncharged with  enforcing the  laws --  is illustrated  by this\r\n\ncase.    For  the  courts,  what  is  involved   is  properly\r\n\nascertaining congressional intent in  light of constitutional\r\n\nguarantees   in  decision  of  cases.    For  this  Cambodian\r\n\nimmigrant, Ran Choeum, what  is involved is whether she  will\r\n\nbe deported, possibly  back to  that war-torn  land she  left\r\n\nwhen  she was  a child.    She petitions  for  review of  two\r\n\ndecisions  of the Board  of Immigration Appeals  (\"BIA\"), one\r\n\ndated February 9,  1996, denying her applications  for asylum\r\n\nand withholding and  for discretionary waiver, and  one dated\r\n\nApril 22, 1997, denying her motions to reopen.\r\n\n          In the  interim, the complexity of  the immigration\r\n\nlaws was  enhanced by two new  statutes.  On April  24, 1996,\r\n\nthe  Antiterrorism and Effective  Death Penalty Act,  Pub. L.\r\n\n104-132, 110  Stat. 1214  (1996) (\"AEDPA\"),  was signed  into\r\n\nlaw.   On September 30, 1996,  (the same day Choeum  moved to\r\n\nreopen before  the BIA)  the Illegal  Immigration Reform  and\r\n\nImmigrant Responsibility Act, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009\r\n\n(1996)  (\"IIRIRA\"), was  signed  into  law.    Both  statutes\r\n\ncontain jurisdiction-stripping  provisions removing  from the\r\n\nfederal circuit courts of appeals their previous jurisdiction\r\n\nover certain categories of final orders of deportation.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          This case was originally argued on May 9, 1997.  In\r\n\na decision dated July 2, 1997, we upheld the decisions of the\r\n\nBIA  on reasoning which rejected particular arguments by both\r\n\nsides.    Each party  filed  petitions  for rehearing.    The\r\n\nImmigration  and   Naturalization  Service   (INS),  in   its\r\n\nrehearing petition, for  the first time raised a new argument\r\n\nthat this court lacked jurisdiction to review both of the BIA\r\n\norders because  AEDPA   440(a)  precludes  jurisdiction  over\r\n\ndeportations for \"aggravated felonies\" under IIRIRA   321.  \r\n\n          It  would have been  vastly preferable,  of course,\r\n\nfor the  INS to  have asserted  this jurisdictional  argument\r\n\ninitially,  and we have  some concern about  the government's\r\n\nburdening of  immigrants with  the obligation  to respond  to\r\n\nnew-found statutory interpretations  by the INS after  a case\r\n\nhas  been heard and decided.1  Nonetheless, because rehearing\r\n\nwas timely sought and parties may not waive issues of subject\r\n\nmatter jurisdiction,2  we  granted  rehearing  on  particular\r\n\nissues.  We withdraw our  earlier opinion and restate in this\r\n\nopinion   those  of  our  earlier  conclusions  which  remain\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In another sense,  however, Choeum is the  beneficiary of\r\nthe  government's  shifting  position.   Because  mandate has\r\nnever issued, and because Choeum has not been deported during\r\nthe pendency of this  appeal, the effect of the  government's\r\ndelay in making  its new jurisdictional argument  has been to\r\ndelay Choeum's deportation.\r\n\n2.  See United States v. Baucum,  80 F.3d 539, 541 (D.C. Cir.\r                                           \r\n1996); Michigan Employment Security Comm'n v. Wolverine Radio\r                                                                         \r\nCo., Inc.,  930 F.2d 1132,  1137-38 (6th Cir.  1991); Escobar\r                                                                         \r\nRuiz v. INS, 813 F.2d 283, 286 n.3 (9th Cir. 1987).\r                       \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\npertinent.  We  conclude that we have jurisdiction  to review\r\n\nthe  first decision of  the BIA, which  requires deportation,\r\n\nand sustain that decision on its merits.  We conclude that we\r\n\nlack  jurisdiction  over  the  second  BIA  decision, denying\r\n\nChoeum's petition to reopen.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Ran  Choeum, an  immigrant  from Cambodia,  pleaded\r\n\nguilty in  New York  state court to  charges of  burglary and\r\n\nkidnapping.    The  charges stemmed  from  a  crime in  which\r\n\nChoeum's boyfriend,  seeking  to settle  a family  grievance,\r\n\nmurdered  two  elderly  relatives  of  his  sister's  fianc .\r\n\nChoeum,  who left  the scene before  the murders  took place,\r\n\npleaded guilty to burglary and kidnapping in order to avoid a\r\n\npossible  murder conviction  under  the  felony murder  rule.\r\n\nWhile Choeum  was in prison, deportation  proceedings against\r\n\nher commenced. \r\n\n          Choeum seeks review of the BIA order of deportation\r\n\nof  April  24, 1996.    She  argues  that AEDPA  changes  the\r\n\nstandard for  determining whether  an alien  is eligible  for\r\n\nwithholding  of  deportation.    She  also  argues  that  the\r\n\nAttorney General's regulation under which her application for\r\n\nasylum  was denied  exceeds the  authority  delegated to  the\r\n\nAttorney General by Congress.  Finally, she contends that the\r\n\nBIA  abused   its  discretion   in  failing   to  grant   her\r\n\ndiscretionary relief  from deportation.   She also  petitions\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nfor review of  the BIA's decision of April  22, 1997, denying\r\n\nher motion to reopen.\r\n\n          The  INS, for its  part, argues that,  under AEDPA,\r\n\nthis court  lacks jurisdiction to  review Choeum's petitions.\r\n\nThe  jurisdictional argument comes in two  parts.  First, the\r\n\nINS argues that  this court has  no jurisdiction over  either\r\n\npetition  for  review  because  AEDPA    440(a),  8  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1105a(a)(10),  removes  jurisdiction  over  deportations  for\r\n\n\"aggravated felonies\" as that term is more broadly defined in\r\n\nIIRIRA    321(a), 8  U.S.C.   1101(a)(43).   In light  of the\r\n\neffective date  provided in  IIRIRA   321(c),  we agree  that\r\n\nthere  is no  jurisdiction over the  second petition  on this\r\n\nground, but the first petition survives this attack.  Second,\r\n\nthe INS argues there is  still no jurisdiction over the first\r\n\npetition for review because she is an alien who has committed\r\n\na  firearms offense under  8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(C),  in this\r\n\ncase, burglary,  and AEDPA   440(a) does not permit review of\r\n\ndeportations based on  such grounds.   We hold that  judicial\r\n\nreview  remains available  because in the  agency deportation\r\n\nproceedings, Choeum was charged with deportability based only\r\n\non  her  kidnapping  offense,  which  is  a  crime  of  moral\r\n\nturpitude under 8  U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(i), and not  with a\r\n\nfirearms offense. \r\n\n          We further  hold that  the INS  may not  substitute\r\n\nalternative  grounds for  deportation at  this  stage in  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nproceedings, and that its argument  fails both as a matter of\r\n\nstatutory  construction  and because  it  raises  due process\r\n\nconcerns under the  Constitution.  Therefore, AEDPA  does not\r\n\ndeprive this  court of  jurisdiction to  hear Choeum's  first\r\n\npetition.    Choeum's legal  arguments,  however, while  ably\r\n\nmade, do not convince us that the BIA erred in denying Choeum\r\n\nthe various forms of relief  sought.  Accordingly, the  BIA's\r\n\ndecision is affirmed.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Ran Choeum was born in a small Cambodian village in\r\n\n1969.    She was  one of  twelve children;  her father  was a\r\n\nsoldier and her mother supported the family by rice  farming.\r\n\nIn 1973,  her father  was killed.   The  Khmer Rouge came  to\r\n\npower  in the  area  in 1975,  and  Choeum's mother,  fearing\r\n\nretaliation for her husband's  military activities, fled with\r\n\nher  children to another  village.   Choeum's mother  died in\r\n\n1978  of starvation  and illness.   In 1979,  Choeum's oldest\r\n\nsister  brought  Choeum  and  two  other  sisters,  the  only\r\n\nsurviving members  of  the  family,  to  a  refugee  camp  in\r\n\nThailand;  they lived  in  various camps  for  the next  five\r\n\nyears.\r\n\n          On  March 27,  1985, Choeum  and  her sisters  were\r\n\nadmitted  to the United States as  refugees; Choeum was later\r\n\ngranted permanent resident status, retroactive to  that date.\r\n\nThe  Choeums'  sponsors  helped them  to  obtain  welfare and\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nhousing.  Choeum, who was fifteen at the time, had never been\r\n\nto school in  Cambodia and spoke no English.   Choeum briefly\r\n\nattended high school  in Brooklyn, but  dropped out when  she\r\n\nbecame pregnant by her boyfriend, a Cambodian immigrant named\r\n\nLak Ling.   Choeum's son Wicky  was born on January  2, 1987.\r\n\nAt   Lak  Ling's  request,  Choeum   and  her  son  moved  to\r\n\nPhiladelphia to live with his relatives.\r\n\n          In  June  1988,  Lak  Ling,  Choeum  and  the  baby\r\n\ntravelled to New  York for Ling's sister's  engagement party.\r\n\nWhen they arrived at Ling's parents' house, they learned that\r\n\nthe sister, who was only  fourteen, and her fianc , a twenty-\r\n\neight year old  Cambodian man, had  disappeared and that  the\r\n\nfianc 's family  had not  paid the  $2,000 dowry  owed Ling's\r\n\nfamily.  \r\n\n          The next night,  June 5, Choeum went outside to buy\r\n\nice  cream for her  son.  She  saw Ling  in a car  with three\r\n\nChinese  men she did not  know.  Ling told her  to get in the\r\n\ncar,  and told  her that they  were going to  get his sister.\r\n\nWhen they arrived at a large apartment house on Ocean Avenue,\r\n\nBrooklyn,  they all  went upstairs  and Ling  told Choeum  to\r\n\nknock on  the door  of  the apartment  where Ling's  sister's\r\n\nfianc 's  parents lived.   No  one answered.   After  driving\r\n\naround, they  returned  to  the  house and  the  Chinese  men\r\n\nknocked on the  door.  One  of the men  was carrying a  paper\r\n\nbag.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          This time, the  door was opened.  The  men went in,\r\n\nand Choeum  followed.   The Chinese  men began  searching the\r\n\napartment,  while  Ling  talked  to  his   sister's  fianc 's\r\n\nparents. The Chinese men began piling up money and jewelry on\r\n\nthe floor in  front of the parents.   One of the  Chinese men\r\n\nbrought two young  children into the  room.  Ling  instructed\r\n\nthem to tie the children up.  Ling assured Choeum that he was\r\n\njust  trying to  scare the  parents into revealing  where his\r\n\nsister was.  The men  brought the children into another room,\r\n\ntook  out a  knife, cut  the  telephone cord,  and bound  the\r\n\nchildren  with it.   One  of  the children  says that  Choeum\r\n\nhelped  tie up  the children  and put  tape on  their mouths.\r\n\nAccording to Choeum, she merely watched, and then she noticed\r\n\nthat her  boyfriend was holding  a gun.  Choeum  asserts that\r\n\nshe became scared, went back  into the other room, and untied\r\n\nthe  children; the Immigration Judge, however, did not credit\r\n\nthis testimony.  One of the men yelled at her to get out when\r\n\nhe saw her near the children.   All four men then screamed at\r\n\nChoeum to leave  and wait in the  car.  She went  outside and\r\n\nwaited.   When the  men returned to  the car  fifteen minutes\r\n\nlater, she  asked if anything had happened;  Ling assured her\r\n\nthat everything was fine.  Choeum returned to Ling's parents'\r\n\nhouse.\r\n\n          The next morning, Choeum was arrested.  It was then\r\n\nthat  she learned  that the  two adults  at the  Ocean Avenue\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\napartment had been murdered.   She was charged with a variety\r\n\nof crimes,  but agreed  to cooperate with  the police  and to\r\n\nhelp them find  Ling.  Facing  a possible murder  conviction,\r\n\nChoeum pleaded guilty  to kidnapping in the  third degree and\r\n\nburglary  in the  first degree,  with  a three  to nine  year\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          While   in   prison,  Choeum   received   favorable\r\n\nperformance assessments, particularly from her teachers.  She\r\n\nmade rapid progress in English, and came close to achieving a\r\n\nGED  despite her complete  lack of formal  education.  Choeum\r\n\nwas  released  in  September  1991.   She  moved  to  Lowell,\r\n\nMassachusetts  to live with  her sisters and  their children.\r\n\nShe enrolled in  job training programs, eventually  finding a\r\n\nmanufacturing  job.   The social  services professionals  who\r\n\nworked with her  were impressed by her eagerness  to work and\r\n\nto improve herself.\r\n\n          In 1993,  Choeum gave birth to a second son, David.\r\n\nDavid's father left her after  she became pregnant and has no\r\n\ncontact with  his son.  Choeum  quit her job when  she became\r\n\npregnant  with David, and  receives welfare and  food stamps.\r\n\nChoeum still resides  near her sisters  in Lowell, and  helps\r\n\nthem,  as  none of  the  others  are proficient  in  English.\r\n\nChoeum's older  son, Wicky,  lives in  Philadelphia with  Lak\r\n\nLing's parents,  who gained  custody of  him during  Choeum's\r\n\nimprisonment.  Choeum does not see Wicky often, but speaks to\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nhim monthly on the phone.  Choeum asserts in her most  recent\r\n\naffidavit that she is  pregnant with a third child.  She also\r\n\nasserts that,  because she fears for their  safety, she would\r\n\nleave Wicky and David in this country were she to be deported\r\n\nto Cambodia.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          Deportation  proceedings  were   initiated  against\r\n\nChoeum with the issuance of an Order to Show Cause (\"OSC\") on\r\n\nSeptember   18,  1990.     The   OSC   charged  Choeum   with\r\n\ndeportability pursuant to the then-current version of Section\r\n\n241(a)(4)3 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), in\r\n\nthat she  had been  convicted of a  crime of  moral turpitude\r\n\ncommitted  within five  years after  entry  and sentenced  to\r\n\nimprisonment  for a year  or more.   The OSC  stated that the\r\n\ncrime of  moral turpitude  was kidnapping.   The OSC  did not\r\n\nrefer to Choeum's  burglary conviction either in  the factual\r\n\nallegations or in the grounds for deportability.\r\n\n          In her responsive pleadings, filed March 31,  1992,\r\n\nChoeum  admitted the  factual  allegations  in  the  OSC  and\r\n\nconceded  deportability  as  charged.   She  also  sought the\r\n\nopportunity to apply for  asylum, withholding of deportation,\r\n\nand  waiver  of  deportability pursuant  to  INA    212(c), 8\r\n\nU.S.C.   1182(c).\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The  section has been  amended several times  since then;\r\nthe   current   version   of   the   provision   is   Section\r\n241(a)(2)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(i).\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          A hearing was  held before an Immigration  Judge on\r\n\nAugust  7, 1992.   The  facts and  circumstances of  Choeum's\r\n\ncrime were  fully  explored, including  through testimony  by\r\n\nChoeum's  defense attorney.  The Immigration Judge denied her\r\n\napplications  for asylum  under  INA    208(a),  8  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1158(a),  and   for  withholding  of  deportation  under  INA\r\n\n  243(h),  8  U.S.C.     1253(h), on  the  grounds  that such\r\n\napplications  must  be  denied  if  the  alien,  having  been\r\n\nconvicted  of  a  particularly serious  crime  in  the United\r\n\nStates,  constitutes  a   danger  to  the  community.     The\r\n\nImmigration  Judge  found  that, based  on  all  the evidence\r\n\nconcerning Choeum's burglary and  kidnapping convictions, she\r\n\nhad \"in fact been convicted of a particularly serious crime.\"\r\n\nHe noted that the BIA has interpreted the  statutory language\r\n\nto mean  that an  alien convicted  of a particularly  serious\r\n\ncrime  necessarily  constitutes a  danger  to  the community.\r\n\nTherefore, he  ruled, Choeum was  not eligible for  asylum or\r\n\nwithholding of deportation.\r\n\n          Regarding Choeum's application  for a discretionary\r\n\nwaiver under INA   212(c), the Immigration Judge engaged in a\r\n\ncareful balancing  of the  equities.   Going through  factors\r\n\nidentified as significant  by the BIA, the  Immigration Judge\r\n\nfound that Choeum's separation from Wicky and her sisters and\r\n\nthe conditions  in  Cambodia were  significant  factors,  but\r\n\nthose  facts  did  not overcome  the  egregious  and horrible\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nnature  of her  crime.    On this  ground,  the Judge  denied\r\n\nChoeum's application for discretionary waiver as well. \r\n\n          Choeum  appealed the decision  to the  BIA, arguing\r\n\nthat the  equities, including the  birth of her  second child\r\n\nafter   the  hearing,  warranted  an  exercise  of  favorable\r\n\ndiscretion under INA   212(c), and that the Immigration Judge\r\n\nshould have made a separate determination that Choeum posed a\r\n\ndanger to the  community before denying her  applications for\r\n\nasylum and withholding of  deportation.  In a  decision dated\r\n\nFebruary   9,  1996,  the   BIA  dismissed  Choeum's  appeal,\r\n\nreaffirming its view that an  alien who has been convicted of\r\n\na particularly serious crime necessarily constitutes a danger\r\n\nto  the  community  and  is  ineligible  for  withholding  of\r\n\ndeportation  and asylum.    The BIA  further  found that  the\r\n\nImmigration   Judge   gave   proper   consideration  to   the\r\n\ndiscretionary factors in denying Choeum's request for Section\r\n\n212(c) relief.\r\n\n          AEDPA  was signed  into  law  on  April  24,  1996.\r\n\nChoeum's petition for review was filed with this court on May\r\n\n9, 1996.   On September 30,  1996, Choeum filed  a motion  to\r\n\nreopen with the BIA, based on new evidence, particularly  the\r\n\nbirth of David and  the expectation of a third child,  and on\r\n\nthe argument that AEDPA   413(f), 8 U.S.C.   1253(h), removed\r\n\nthe bar to withholding of deportation for aliens convicted of\r\n\nparticularly  serious crimes.  The BIA denied Choeum's motion\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nto reopen  on  April  22,  1997,  finding  that  under  AEDPA\r\n\n  440(d),  Choeum  was  now  statutorily ineligible  for  INA\r\n\n  212(c)  relief, and rejecting  her interpretation  of AEDPA\r\n\n  413(f).    Choeum  has  asked this  court  to  review  this\r\n\ndecision as well.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\nA.  Jurisdiction:  The Effective Date of IIRIRA   321(c)\r                                                                    \r\n\n          Correctly pointing out that  Congress in the IIRIRA\r\n\nexpanded  the   definition  of   \"aggravated  felonies\"   and\r\n\nprecluded  judicial review  over deportations  for aggravated\r\n\nfelonies, the INS  argues this court lacks  jurisdiction over\r\n\nboth petitions.  Because we agree that kidnapping, the  basis\r\n\nfor  the order deporting  Choeum is an  \"aggravated felony,\"4\r\n\nthe decisive question has to do with when this new definition\r\n\nbecame effective and  the application of that  effective date\r\n\nto the facts of this case.\r\n\n          IIRIRA    321(c) establishes  the \"effective  date\"\r\n\nafter  which these  definitions  of \"aggravated  felony\"  are\r\n\nbinding:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Under IIRIRA   321(a), an \"aggravated felony\" is \"a crime\r\nof violence (as defined  in section 16  of Title 18, but  not\r\nincluding a purely political  offense) for which the term  of\r\nimprisonment at least one year.\" 8 U.S.C.   1101(a)(43)(F). A\r\n\"crime of violence\" is defined as  \"an offense that has as an\r\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\r\nforce against the  person or property of another.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n  16(a).  Because  kidnapping satisfies the terms of 8 U.S.C.\r\n  16(a)  and Choeum's term of imprisonment exceeded one year,\r\nChoeum committed an aggravated felony under IIRIRA  321(a).  \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          The amendments made by this section shall\r\n          apply  to actions  taken on or  after the\r                                              \r\n          date  of  the  enactment  of  this   Act,\r\n          regardless   of   when   the   conviction\r\n          occurred . . . .\r\n\nIIRIRA   321(c) (emphasis added).   The IIRIRA was enacted on\r\n\nSeptember 30,  1996, so federal  courts may not  hear appeals\r\n\nfrom \"actions taken\" regarding  final orders for  deportation\r\n\noccurring  after September  30,  1996  where  the  basis  for\r\n\ndeportation is  commission (at  any time)  of an  \"aggravated\r\n\nfelony.\"\r\n\n          IIRIRA    321(c)  does not  itself define  \"actions\r\n\ntaken.\"   Neither  of  the  interpretations  offered  by  the\r\n\nparties  appear appropriate.   Choeum  argues  that the  most\r\n\nsensible  interpretation of \"actions taken\" is that it refers\r\n\nto  immigration proceedings  brought  against the  immigrant.\r\n\nChoeum  thus  characterizes  \"actions\"   in  the  immigration\r\n\ncontext as analogous to a civil action.  Choeum cites Black's\r                                           \r\n\nLaw  Dictionary in support of this proposition, that \"action\"\r\n\nshould be defined in its  \"usual sense\" as a \"lawsuit brought\r\n\nin court\" --  i.e., the filing of the complaint.   Under this\r                              \r\n\ndefinition,  \"actions taken\"  would  refer  only  to  removal\r\n\nproceedings  begun   after  September   30,  1996,   with  no\r                              \r\n\nretroactive  application to  pending  proceedings.   The  INS\r\n\nbegan removal proceedings against Choeum in 1990.\r\n\n          The  INS  argues  that  \"actions  taken\" means  any\r                                                                         \r\n\naction  taken  regarding  the  case  constitutes  an  \"action\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ntaken.\"   The  INS argues  that  judicial review  is such  an\r\n\naction.  Thus,  this court's exercising of  jurisdiction over\r\n\nthe  matter (by  hearing  the  case in  May,  1997), the  INS\r\n\nargues, causes the court to be divested of jurisdiction.  The\r\n\nINS relies for  support on a two page, per  curiam opinion in\r\n\nMendez-Morales v. INS,  119 F.3d 738  (8th Cir. 1997),  which\r                                 \r\n\ndecides that \"[b]ecause  judicial review by this  court would\r\n\nbe an 'action taken' for purposes of IIRIRA   321(c), we have\r\n\nno jurisdiction to hear [petitioner's] appeal.\"   Id. at 739.\r                                                                 \r\n\nThat court  did  not  explain  this  statement  nor  cite  to\r\n\nauthority.  As to the second petition, the INS says that this\r\n\ncourt has no  jurisdiction because, in  any event, the  BIA's\r\n\ndenial of Choeum's  motion to reopen her  case constitutes an\r\n\n\"action taken\" after  the September 30, 1996 date.   We agree\r\n\nonly with the latter argument.\r\n\n          Both sides  present untenable definitions  in their\r\n\narguments.    It  is   not  obvious  that  \"action\"  in   the\r\n\nimmigration context does or  should have the same  meaning as\r\n\nan  \"action\" in  the civil  context.   The  court of  appeals\r\n\nreview actions  by the  administrative agency in  deportation\r\n\ncases  and Choeum attacks  four different actions  on review.\r\n\nChoeum's position assumes  there can be only  one action, and\r\n\nthat is the  initial filing in a matter.   The INS's position\r\n\nis also  flawed:  it  is unlikely Congress intended  the very\r\n\nact  of exercising jurisdiction to trigger the destruction of\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthat  jurisdiction.  If Congress had intended to affect every\r\n\npetition pending in a court,  there was much clearer language\r\n\navailable to  express such an  intent.  Neither does  it make\r\n\nsense that federal jurisdiction should be dependent on when a\r\n\ncourt  schedules a  hearing  on a  particular petition.   For\r\n\nexample, it seems  irrational that a federal court would have\r\n\njurisdiction over a matter if it heard  argument on September\r\n\n29, 1996, but would not have jurisdiction if it postponed the\r                                        \r\n\nargument until October 1, 1996.\r\n\n          Valderrama-Fonseca  v. INS, 116  F.3d 853 (9th Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1997) is the only other  opinion we have found that considers\r\n\nthe definition of \"actions taken\" under IIRIRA   321(c).  The\r\n\nfacts are similar to this case.  The INS sought to  deport an\r\n\nalien because  he had committed  burglary, a crime  of \"moral\r\n\nturpitude;\" the INS then argued that AEDPA   440(a) precluded\r\n\njudicial review of the final order of deportation because the\r\n\ncrime   was  also  an  \"aggravated  felony\"  under  8  U.S.C.\r\n\n  1101(a)(43).   There  was  no  question  that  the  alien's\r\n\noffense  would  constitute  an  \"aggravated  felony\"  if  the\r\n\nrevised  definition were  applicable  under IIRIRA    321(c);\r\n\nhence  the precise issue upon which jurisdiction depended was\r\n\nwhether  an \"action\"  had been  \"taken\"  after September  30,\r\n\n1996.\r\n\n          The court  offered three  potential definitions  of\r\n\n\"actions taken.\"  \"Actions taken\" could refer  to: (l) orders\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nand decisions issued against an alien by the Attorney General\r\n\nacting through the BIA or  Immigration Judge, (2) steps taken\r\n\nby the alien, such as applying for discretionary relief,  (3)\r\n\nto any action by  anyone, including a circuit court.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n856.     The  court   did  not  consider   Choeum's  proposed\r\n\ndefinition:  that  \"actions taken\" refers exclusively  to the\r\n\ncommencement of deportation proceedings against the alien.\r\n\n          We largely  agree with  the holding  of Valderrama-\r                                                                         \r\n\nFonseca.  The third reading is improbable:  it makes no sense\r                   \r\n\nthat  federal  jurisdiction  should  be  based  on  the  oral\r\n\nargument  calendar.  The  second definition is  plausible, as\r\n\nIIRIRA     309(c)(4)(A)  refers to  an  \"action  for judicial\r\n\nreview,\" which would be initiated by the client herself.  But\r\n\nwe need  not  decide the  issue on  the facts  of this  case.\r\n\nChoeum filed  her first  petition for review  on May  9, 1996\r\n\nwell before the effective date.   The first definition is the\r\n\nstrongest and  most sensible:  that \"actions taken\" refers to\r\n\nactions and decisions of  the Attorney General.   \"This makes\r\n\nlogical and  practical sense,  as 'actions  taken' is  easily\r\n\nunderstood  to  encompass things  done  by  an agency  to  an\r\n\nalien.\" Id.  This interpretation is also consistent with  how\r                       \r\n\nthe  word \"actions\"  is used  in another  section of  the INA\r\n\nlimiting federal court  jurisdictional section of the  INA, 8\r\n\nU.S.C.  1252(g):\r\n\n          Except  as provided  in this  section and\r\n          notwithstanding  any  other  provision of\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          law, no court  shall have jurisdiction to\r\n          hear any cause  or claim by or  on behalf\r\n          of any alien arising from the decision or\r\n          action   by  the   Attorney  General   to\r\n          commence  proceedings,  adjudicate cases,\r\n          or  execute  removal orders  against  any\r\n          alien under this chapter.\r\n\n          We conclude  that jurisdiction over  Choeum's first\r\n\npetition is  not removed  by virtue of  AEDPA   440(a).   The\r\n\ndecision  of the immigration  judge and the  BIA's affirmance\r\n\nall  occurred prior  to  October  1,  1996,  so  the  revised\r\n\n\"aggravated  felony\" rules in  IIRIRA   321(a) do  not apply.\r\n\nBy  the same reasoning, this court does not have jurisdiction\r                                                       \r\n\nover  Choeum's second petition,  because the BIA's  denial of\r\n\nChoeum's motion  to reopen occurred on April  22, 1997, which\r\n\nis   after  the   October  1,   1996   triggering  date   for\r                      \r\n\napplicability of the  \"aggravated felony\" rules.   We dismiss\r\n\nthe second petition.\r\n\nB.  Jurisdiction:  AEDPAand Basis for BIA's Deportation Order\r                                                                         \r\n\n          The INS  also filed a  motion to dismiss  with this\r\n\ncourt,  arguing  that  Section 440(a)  of  AEDPA,  apart from\r\n\nIIRIRA,  deprives this  court of  jurisdiction  to hear  this\r\n\ncase.   That section  ousts the  jurisdiction of  the federal\r\n\ncourts  to review the  deportation petitions of,  among other\r\n\nclasses  of aliens, aliens  deportable by reason  of firearms\r\n\noffenses  under 8 U.S.C.    1251(a)(2)(C).  The  INS contends\r\n\nthat  Choeum's  burglary  conviction  was  such  an  offense.\r\n\nHowever,  at the  deportation proceedings,  the  INS did  not\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nassert  the burglary   offense  as  a basis  for deportation.\r\n\nInstead, the INS  rested on the kidnapping  offense, although\r\n\nthe INS did not argue that the kidnapping was also a firearms\r\n\noffense.   The  INS's argument  seems to  be that  because it\r\n\nmight have  sought to deport  Choeum based  on her  burglary-\r                 \r\n\nfirearms conviction, even though it  chose not to do so, this\r                                                          \r\n\ncourt lacks jurisdiction to review Choeum's deportation based\r\n\nupon her  kidnapping non-firearms offense because  this court\r\n\nlacks   jurisdiction    over   a    burglary-firearms   based\r\n\ndeportation,  even  though   this  was  not  the   basis  for\r\n\ndeportation.\r\n\n          Section 440(a) of AEDPA  amended Section 106(a)(10)\r\n\nof the INA,  8 U.S.C.   1105a(a)(10),5 to  provide that final\r\n\norders of deportation  against aliens who are  \"deportable by\r\n\nreason  of  having  committed\"   certain  types  of  criminal\r\n\noffenses, including firearms offenses, \"shall  not be subject\r\n\nto review by  any court.\"  AEDPA   440(a), 110 Stat. at 1276-\r\n\n77.    This  provision of  AEDPA  applies  to pending  cases.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Section 106 of  the INA, 8 U.S.C.   1105a was repealed by\r\n   306(b) of  the Illegal  Immigration  Reform and  Immigrant\r\nResponsibility Act of 1996, Pub.

INS, 101  F.3d 785, 790  (1st Cir. 1996).   Under\r                           \r\n\nAEDPA, judicial review  remains available to aliens  who have\r\n\ncommitted  other types of offenses, including aliens who have\r\n\nbeen convicted  of only  one crime of  moral turpitude.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nAEDPA   440(a); 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A).  The  INS  contends\r\n\nthat the first degree burglary charge to which Choeum pleaded\r\n\nguilty  was  a   firearms  offense  as  defined   by  Section\r\n\n241(a)(2)(C) of the  INA, which renders deportable  any alien\r\n\nwho \"is convicted  under any law  of  . .  . using . .  . any\r\n\nweapon  . . .  which is a firearm  . . .  in violation of any\r\n\nlaw.\"    8  U.S.C.     1251(a)(2)(C).    Therefore,  the  INS\r\n\ncontends,   Choeum  is   \"deportable  by  reason   of  having\r\n\ncommitted\" a  firearms offense  and Section  440(a) of  AEDPA\r\n\ndeprives this court of jurisdiction to hear her petition.\r\n\n          Choeum makes  two responses to the  INS's argument.\r\n\nFirst, Choeum argues that she  was not, in fact, convicted of\r\n\na  firearms offense,  as her  plea colloquy reveals  that she\r\n\nherself did not \"use\" a handgun.6  Second, Choeum points out,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Under New York law, a person is guilty of burglary in the\r\nfirst  degree \"when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully\r\nin a dwelling with intent to commit a crime therein, and when\r\nin effecting entry  or while in the dwelling  or in immediate\r\nflight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime:\r                                                                    \r\n    1.  Is armed with explosives or a deadly weapon; or\r\n    2.  Causes physical  injury to  any person  who is  not a\r\n    participant in the crime; or \r\n    3.  Uses  or threatens the  immediate use of  a dangerous\r\n    instrument; or \r\n    4.  Display what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle,\r\n    shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm . . . .\"\r\nN.Y. Penal Law   140.30 (emphasis added).\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\ncorrectly,  that  the  OSC  only  referenced  the  kidnapping\r\n\nconviction.  \r\n\n          It  is undisputed that  the burglary conviction was\r\n\nnot charged as a  basis for deportation in the  OSC, and that\r\n\nChoeum's  concession of  deportability  only encompassed  the\r\n\ngrounds  charged  in the  OSC,  i.e.  that  she was  in  fact\r                                                \r\n\ndeportable because the  kidnapping conviction was a  crime of\r\n\nmoral  turpitude.   The  Immigration Judge  did,  as the  INS\r\n\npoints  out,  hear  extensive  testimony  on  the  nature  of\r\n\nChoeum's  crime.   Notably, however,  he  did not  attempt to\r\n\ndetermine whether Choeum had used a firearm, because that was\r\n\nnot an issue in the proceedings before him. \r\n\n          The INS's argument is essentially a linguistic one.\r\n\nAccording  to the INS,  for purposes of  jurisdiction, aliens\r\n\n\"deportable by reason of\"  having committed firearms offenses\r                       \r\n\nare not only those aliens  who have been ordered deported for\r                                                                     \r\n\nfirearms  offenses,  but  also  those  aliens  who  could  be\r                                                                         \r\n\ndeported  for  that  reason.    As   a  matter  of  statutory\r\n\nconstruction, that  argument  is  somewhat  illogical:    The\r\n\ncontested  phrase comes  from  Section  440(a)  of  AEDPA,  a\r\n\nstatutory  section  solely  concerned with  final  orders  of\r\n\ndeportation.   The  section therefore  applies,  by its  very\r\n\nterms,  only  to  aliens  who  have  actually  been  adjudged\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n    Thus, under  New York law,  Choeum could be convicted  of\r\nburglary in the  first degree simply by virtue  of Ling's use\r\nof the gun.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ndeportable.   It is  therefore highly doubtful  that, in that\r\n\ncontext, Congress meant \"deportable by reason of\" to mean, as\r\n\nthe  INS would  have it,  \"potentially  susceptible to  being\r\n\ndeported by reason of . . .\"  \r\n\n          The  reading of the  statute that the  INS proposes\r\n\nalso raises due  process concerns.   \"It is well  established\r\n\nthat  the Fifth Amendment  entitles aliens to  due process of\r\n\nlaw in  deportation proceedings.\"   Reno v. Flores,  507 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n292, 306 (1993).  At the core  of these due process rights is\r\n\nthe  right to  notice of  the  nature of  the  charges and  a\r\n\nmeaningful opportunity  to be  heard.   See, e.g.,  Kwong Hai\r                                                                         \r\n\nChew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 596-98 (1953); Kaczmarczyk  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nINS, 933 F.2d 588, 596 (7th Cir. 1991)(citing cases).  \r               \r\n\n          We do  not need to  determine what  form of  notice\r\n\nwould be constitutionally required, because the statutory and\r\n\nregulatory  scheme under  which  deportation proceedings  are\r\n\nconducted  mandate  specific  procedures.    The  INA  itself\r\n\nprovides that, in deportation proceedings, written notice  --\r\n\nreferred to as  an order to show  cause -- shall be  given to\r\n\nthe  alien  specifying,  among other  things,  \"[t]he charges\r\n\nagainst the alien and the statutory provisions alleged to  be\r\n\nhave  been  violated.\"    8 U.S.C.     1252b(a)(1)(D).    INS\r\n\nregulations permit  the INS  to lodge  additional charges  of\r\n\ndeportability  \"at any  time  during  a  hearing\"  before  an\r\n\nImmigration Judge, but specifically state that these  charges\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nmust be submitted in writing for service on the alien and for\r\n\nentry into the record, that  the Immigration Judge shall read\r\n\nthe additional charges to the  alien and explain them to her,\r\n\nand  that the  alien may  have a  reasonable time,  including\r\n\nrequesting a continuance,  to respond to  additional charges.\r\n\n8 C.F.R.   242.16(d).  It is undisputed that the INS did not,\r\n\nat  any time, reopen  deportation proceedings to  comply with\r\n\nthese statutory and regulatory formalities.\r\n\n          In United States v. Hirsch, 308  F.2d 562 (9th Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1962), the BIA  had ordered petitioner deported on  the basis\r\n\nof   crimes  which  were   admitted  into  evidence   at  his\r\n\ndeportation hearing, but which were never added to the  INS's\r\n\ncharge against him.  The  court found that this procedure not\r\n\nonly violated INS  regulations similar to the  ones discussed\r\n\nabove, but also  contravened basic notions of  procedural due\r\n\nprocess:\r\n\n          [A]t all pertinent  times, petitioner was\r\n          entitled  to a  statement of  the charges\r\n          against  him,  to  a   hearing  of  those\r\n          charges, and to answer them. \r\n               Procedural due  process requires  no\r\n          less, and such due process is required in\r\n          such  a  hearing.    We  have  frequently\r\n          commented upon the severity of the remedy\r\n          of  deportation,   with  the   consequent\r\n          requirement  that  prescribed  procedures\r\n          must  be followed  for the  protection of\r\n          the alien.   Surely being advised  of the\r\n          charges  upon  which  the  proceeding  is\r\n          based is fundamental to due process.\r\n\nId. at 566-67 (internal citations omitted).\r               \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n          Here the INS  is not actually attempting  to deport\r\n\nthe  petitioner  on  uncharged  grounds,   but  rather  using\r\n\nuncharged grounds to cut off judicial review.  However,  this\r\n\ncourt has  found that  even arguably  lesser deprivations  of\r\n\nnotice  and  the  opportunity  to  be  heard  \"ran  afoul  of\r\n\npetitioner's  procedural rights.\"   Gebremicheal  v.  INS, 10\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 28,  39 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that BIA could not rely\r\n\non  extra-record facts  concerning human  rights in  Ethiopia\r\n\nwithout  affording petitioner an opportunity to respond).  In\r\n\nthese  circumstances,  where  the  word  \"deportable\"  has  a\r\n\nmeaning that the context makes plain, and  the INS asks us to\r\n\nchoose a different  interpretation, we are influenced  by the\r\n\nmaxim  of statutory construction  that tells us  to interpret\r\n\nstatutes so as to avoid constitutional concerns.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 483 (1988); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nThree  Juveniles,  61  F.3d  86,  90 (1st  Cir.  1995).    We\r                            \r\n\ntherefore  reject  the  INS's  suggested  interpretation   of\r\n\nSection 440(a)'s use of \"deportable by reason of.\"     \r\n\n          The  INS  suggests  that this  court  can  make the\r\n\nnecessary determination  that Choeum's offense was a firearms\r\n\noffense,  implying that  briefing  and  argument before  this\r\n\ncourt provide sufficient notice.   The INS points out that in\r\n\nKolster,  we  termed  deportability  \"a  largely   mechanical\r                   \r\n\ndetermination  based on facts  that can often  be objectively\r\n\nascertained.\"  101 F.3d at 789.  That description, of course,\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nassumes  that the necessary facts will be before the decision\r\n\nmaker.    Use  of  a  firearm  not  being  an  issue  in  the\r\n\nproceedings below,  the record  before this  court cannot  be\r\n\nconsidered complete and  the INS argument fails  on pragmatic\r\n\ngrounds.7  More importantly, it is not the institutional role\r\n\nof this  court to serve  as a factfinding  body on  issues of\r\n\nfirst impression.  \r\n\n          We  hold that the  INS cannot, consistent  with due\r\n\nprocess  and  the   statutory  and  regulatory   requirements\r\n\ngoverning its  own  proceedings, substitute  new grounds  for\r\n\ndeportation at this stage in  the proceedings, solely for the\r\n\npurposes  of depriving  the federal courts  of jurisdiction.8\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The INS draws our attention to Yang v. INS, 109 F.3d 1185\r                                                          \r\n(7th  Cir.  1997).   In that  case, petitioner  contested the\r\nadministrative  finding that he  was deportable by  reason of\r\nhaving committed  certain crimes,  crimes which  would render\r\nhim  ineligible,  under  AEDPA, for  judicial  review  of his\r\ndeportation  order.   The Seventh  Circuit  asserted that  \"a\r\ncourt  has   jurisdiction  to   determine   whether  it   has\r\njurisdiction\" and reviewed  the record to see if  the law had\r\nbeen  properly applied  to petitioner's  case.  Id.  at 1192.\r                                                               \r\nThat  situation, where the  court reviews  the administrative\r\nrecord to determine if the  law has been correctly applied to\r\npetitioner's  case, is not  analogous to the  situation here,\r\nwhere the  question to be  answered was not addressed  in the\r\nproceedings below.\r\n\n8.  To the extent that Abdel-Razek  v. INS, 114 F.3d 831 (9th\r                                                      \r\nCir. 1997), takes a different position on this issue, we find\r\nit unpersuasive.   But  we do  not  believe that  Abdel-Razek\r                                                                         \r\nreally  conflicts  with  our  conclusion.    Abdel-Razek, and\r                                                                    \r\nMendez-Morales v. INS,  119 F.3d 738  (9th Cir. 1997),  which\r                                 \r\nthe INS also  cites, both involve aliens who  had committed a\r\nsingle  crime which was  the sole basis  for their respective\r\ndeportations,  and  the  issue  was  whether  the  INS  could\r\nsubstitute  one ground for deportation, i.e., commission of a\r                                                        \r\ncrime  of moral turpitude,  for another, i.e.,  an aggravated\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nWe  therefore  need  not determine  whether  or  not Choeum's\r\n\nconviction for  burglary in  the first  degree constitutes  a\r\n\nfirearms offense.  We turn to Choeum's claims of legal error,\r\n\nbased on the grounds on which the INS actually proceeded. \r\n\n                              V.\r\n\n          Choeum appeals the  February 9, 1996 denial  of her\r\n\napplications  for   three  separate  types  of   relief  from\r\n\ndeportation:  (1) withholding  of  deportation under  Section\r\n\n243(h) of the  INA, 8 U.S.C.    1253(h); (2)  asylum under  8\r\n\nU.S.C.   1158;9 and (3) discretionary waiver of deportability\r\n\nunder Section 212(c)  of the INA, 8  U.S.C.   1182(c).10   We\r\n\naddress each of these claims in turn.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nfelony.   This  a different  situation  than we  have in  the\r\npresent  case,  where  Choeum  had  committed  two  different\r\ncrimes, and the INS wishes to use one crime as the  basis for\r\ndeportation but then the other crime as the basis for denying\r                                          \r\nthis  court jurisdiction.  By citing Abdel-Razek as authority\r                                                            \r\nthat  opposes this  conclusion, the  INS  confuses the  legal\r\ngrounds for deportation with its underlying factual basis.\r\n\n9.  Withholding of deportation and asylum are similar in that\r\nboth offer relief from deportation based on the likelihood of\r\npersecution  in the alien's home country.   Asylum requires a\r\ngreater showing  than withholding,  and carries  with it  the\r\nentitlement  to  become  a  lawful  permanent  resident,  and\r\neventually a citizen.   Withholding, on the  other hand, does\r\nnot  give the  alien the  automatic  right to  remain in  the\r\nUnited States;  the alien  may still be  deported to  a third\r\ncountry in  which she would not face persecution.  See INS v.\r                                                                      \r\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 428 n.6 (1987).\r                           \r\n\n10.

Section\r\n\n243(h)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C.   1253(h)(1), provides that:\r\n\n          The Attorney General shall  not deport or\r\n          return any  alien . .  . to a  country if\r\n          the Attorney General determines that such\r\n          alien's   life   or  freedom   would   be\r\n          threatened in such country on account  of\r\n          race,  religion, nationality,  membership\r\n          in   a   particular  social   group,   or\r\n          political opinion.\r\n\nAn alien who meets this standard of eligibility, and who does\r\n\nnot   fall  under  a  statutory  exception,  is  entitled  to\r                                                                     \r\n\nwithholding  of  deportation; the  Attorney General  does not\r\n\nhave discretion  in  Section 243(h)  proceedings.

The new provision states, in relevant part:\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of\r\n          law,  paragraph   (1)  [the   withholding\r\n          provision] shall  apply to  any alien  if\r\n          the Attorney  General determines,  in the\r\n          discretion of the Attorney General, that\r\n          . . .\r\n          (B) the  application of paragraph  (1) to\r\n          such   alien  is   necessary  to   ensure\r\n          compliance with  the 1967  United Nations\r\n          Protocol  Relating   to  the   Status  of\r\n          Refugees.\r\n\n8 U.S.C.   1253(h)(3).\r\n\n          Choeum   argues  that,   by   directing  that   the\r\n\nwithholding   provisions   be  applied   so  as   to  \"ensure\r\n\ncompliance\" with the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to\r\n\nthe Status  of Refugees,  19 U.S.T.  6223, T.I.A.S.

Thus, according  to\r                     \r\n\nChoeum, Section  413(f)  of AEDPA  expressed a  congressional\r\n\nintent to  reject the  BIA's rulings  that Section  243(h)(2)\r\n\nrequires  only  a  determination  that  the  alien  has  been\r\n\nconvicted of a particularly serious crime.11\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  The  INS initially argued  that Section 413(f)  of AEDPA\r\ndid  not apply  to  Choeum's case,  as  AEDPA Section  413(g)\r\ninstructed  that the amendments made by Section 413(f) should\r\napply only to  those applications on  which final action  had\r\nnot been  taken before the  date of  AEDPA's enactment,  i.e.\r                                                                         \r\nApril 30, 1996.

The UNHCR Handbook, for its part, does not\r\n\nunambiguously support Choeum's  position. The UNHCR Handbook,\r\n\nwhile  requiring  an  individualized  determination  of   the\r\n\napplicability of Article 33.2's exclusion clause, focusses on\r\n\nthe  definition of \"serious non-political crime\" and does not\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nexplicitly  require a  separate dangerousness  determination.\r\n\nSee UNHCR Handbook, supra,    154-57, at 36-37.\r                                     \r\n\n          The INS, in  contrast, points this court  to Matter\r                                                                         \r\n\nof Q-T-M-T-, Interim Dec. 3300, 1996 WL 784581, *16 (BIA Dec.\r                       \r\n\n21, 1996).

[E]very  reviewing court  reaching this\r\n          issue has sustained  our prior holding in\r\n          this  regard.    Indeed,   in  1995,  the\r\n          Attorney  General  issued   a  regulation\r\n          adopting  this  construction  of  section\r\n          243(h)(2)(B).          8     C.F.R.      \r\n          208.16(c)(2)(ii)(1995).   Moreover, there\r\n          is nothing in  the legislative history of\r\n          either the AEDPA or the IIRIRA suggesting\r\n          that Congress had any intent to  override\r\n          this  well-settled  construction  of  the\r\n          law.  And, particularly  in enacting  the\r\n          IIRIRA, Congress reflected its ability to\r\n          clearly  address and  override Board  and\r\n          judicial constructions  of the  law which\r\n          it  deemed erroneous.   Thus,  we do  not\r\n          find our  ruling on  this  issue [to  be]\r\n          affected by section 243(h)(3) of the Act.\r\n\nId.  \r               \r\n\n          The INS further argues that the reason for enacting\r\n\nSection  413(f) was  that AEDPA  expanded  the definition  of\r\n\n\"aggravated  felony\"   to  include   crimes  that  might   be\r\n\nconsidered less serious  than those the Protocol  intended to\r\n\ncover in its exclusion clause.  Section 243(h)(2) of the INA,\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\n8 U.S.C.   1253(h)(2), expressly states that, for withholding\r\n\npurposes, \"an alien  convicted of an aggravated  felony shall\r\n\nbe  considered  to  have  committed  a  particularly  serious\r\n\ncrime.\"  The INS contends  that AEDPA Section 413(f) was thus\r\n\nintended  to preserve  the Attorney General's  flexibility in\r\n\nassessing whether crimes now  defined as aggravated  felonies\r\n\nwere, in fact,  \"particularly serious\" within the  meaning of\r\n\nthe Protocol.\r\n\n          In interpreting Section  413(f) of  AEDPA, we  must\r\n\nfirst determine if the statutory language makes the intent of\r\n\nCongress  clear and unambiguous; if the statute is ambiguous,\r\n\nwe   give  deference  to  the  BIA's  interpretation  of  the\r\n\nimmigration  laws, unless  that interpretation  is arbitrary,\r\n\ncapricious, or contrary to the statute.

It  directs the  Attorney  General to  ensure\r\n\ncompliance with the Protocol,  yet as noted, the  language of\r\n\nthe  Protocol's  withholding   provisions  has  already  been\r\n\ncodified as United States statutory law.  Section 413(f) thus\r\n\nappears, at first glance, to be surplusage.  The  legislative\r\n\nhistory of AEDPA is similarly unhelpful.\r\n\n          The import of Section 413(f) is thus ambiguous, and\r\n\nwe  turn to the agency  interpretation.  The reasoning behind\r\n\nthe BIA's interpretation  is fairly persuasive.   Congress is\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\npresumed to be  aware of the BIA's  longstanding construction\r\n\nof the Particularly  Serious Crime Exception.

If  Section 413(f) of AEDPA were meant\r                 \r\n\nto correct  that construction, Congress  certainly would have\r\n\ndone so in a less oblique fashion.  We also note that Section\r\n\n413 of AEDPA, as a whole, is entitled \"Denial of Other Relief\r\n\nto Alien Terrorists,\" and that the legislation  shows few, if\r\n\nany, indications of having  intended to expand the rights  of\r                                                          \r\n\ncriminal aliens.  In  this context, the INS's  explanation of\r\n\nwhy Section 413(f) was enacted is certainly a reasonable one.\r\n\n          In turn,  Choeum's arguments are  unpersuasive.  As\r\n\nnoted,  the UNHCR Handbook does not unambiguously support her\r\n\ninterpretation of the Protocol.  Moreover, the Supreme Court,\r\n\nwhile acknowledging  that the  UNHCR Handbook  is \"useful  in\r\n\ngiving  content   to  the   obligations  that   the  Protocol\r\n\nestablishes,\"  expressly disclaimed  the suggestion  that the\r\n\nHandbook had \"the  force of law or in any way binds the INS.\"\r\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 439 n.22.  \r                           \r\n\n          In  this context,  where the statute  is ambiguous,\r\n\nand the  BIA has offered  a reasonable interpretation  of its\r\n\nprovisions, it would be improper for this court to substitute\r\n\nthe  advisory  opinion  of  an  international  body  for  the\r\n\nreasoned judgment of the domestic  administrative agency with\r\n\nprimary   responsibility  for   administering  the   statute.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  find  that  the  interpretation  of Section\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\n243(h)(2)(B)  and Section 243(h)(3) adopted by the BIA is not\r\n\nunreasonable, arbitrary,  or  capricious.    Consequently,  a\r\n\nseparate inquiry into Choeum's dangerousness to the community\r\n\nwas not required.  See Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 559.  Choeum\r                                                 \r\n\nwas not eligible for withholding of deportation.\r\n\nB. Asylum\r                     \r\n\n          Choeum next argues that  the regulation under which\r\n\nshe  was deemed ineligible  for asylum exceeds  the authority\r\n\ndelegated to the Attorney General by Congress.  \r\n\n          An  INS regulation  provides that:  \"An application\r\n\nfor asylum shall  be denied if . . . [t]he alien, having been\r\n\nconvicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime\r\n\nin the United States, constitutes a danger to the community .\r\n\n. .  .\"   8  C.F.R.    208.14(d)(1).12   This regulation  was\r\n\npromulgated pursuant  to then-current  Section 208(a)  of the\r\n\nINA, 8 U.S.C.   1158(a),13  which provided:\r\n\n          The  Attorney General  shall establish  a\r\n          procedure for an alien . . . to apply for\r\n          asylum,  and  the  alien  may be  granted\r\n          asylum in the discretion of the  Attorney\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  8  C.F.R.   208.14(d) previously  appeared at 8 C.F.R.  \r\n208.14(c), and  is referred to  by its former  designation in\r\nthe administrative proceedings in this case, and in the cases\r\ndiscussed herein.\r\n\n13.  Section  604 of  IIRIRA, \"Asylum  Reform,\" substantially\r\namends Section  208 of the  INA, 8  U.S.C.   1158.   However,\r\nSection 604 of IIRIRA applies only to applications for asylum\r\nfiled on or  after April 1, 1997.   See IIRIRA    604(c), 110\r                                                   \r\nStat. 3009-694.    References  in this  opinion  are  to  the\r\nearlier version of 8 U.S.C.    1158, which may be found at  8\r\nU.S.C.A.   1158 (West 1996).\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n          General   if    the   Attorney    General\r\n          determines that such  alien is a  refugee\r\n          within the meaning of . . . this title.\r\n\n          Choeum points out that, in 1990, the same year that\r\n\nthe challenged regulation was adopted, Congress enacted  what\r\n\nwas then 8 U.S.C.    1158(d), which provided that \"[a]n alien\r\n\nwho has been convicted of an aggravated  felony . . . may not\r\n\napply for or be granted asylum.\"  8 U.S.C.   1158(d).  Choeum\r\n\nargues that, by negative implication, Congress did not intend\r\n\na similar per  se bar  for aliens  convicted of  particularly\r                             \r\n\nserious  crimes, and that  the Attorney General  exceeded the\r\n\nauthority delegated by Congress in  barring a larger class of\r\n\naliens than that barred by statute.\r\n\n          The statute expressly  conferred broad authority on\r\n\nthe  Attorney General to  \"establish a procedure\"  for asylum\r\n\napplications, and the  granting of asylum is  explicitly left\r\n\nto the Attorney  General's discretion.  Under  Chevron, where\r                                                                  \r\n\nCongress \"explicitly left a gap  for the agency to fill,\" and\r\n\nwhere there is  thus \"an express  delegation of authority  to\r\n\nthe agency to  elucidate a specific provision of  the statute\r\n\nby  regulation,\"  we  should uphold a  gap-filling regulation\r\n\nunless it  is \"arbitrary, capricious, or  manifestly contrary\r\n\nto the statute.\"  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44.\r                                     \r\n\n          The  Attorney General's  determination that  aliens\r\n\nconvicted of particularly serious crimes should be ineligible\r\n\nfor asylum is not unreasonable.   Applying Chevron, we do not\r                                                              \r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\nfind that the regulation exceeds the broad grant of authority\r\n\nconferred  by  the enabling  statute.   Accordingly, Choeum's\r\n\napplication for asylum was properly denied.  We note that the\r\n\ntwo other circuits to have  considered the argument made here\r\n\nby Choeum have also upheld  the regulation.  See Ahmetovic v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nINS, 62 F.3d 48, 51  (2d Cir. 1995)(finding that Congress did\r               \r\n\nnot  intend  to  limit  agency's  power  to impose  a  higher\r\n\nstandard on asylum seekers);  Komarenko v. INS, 35 F.3d  432,\r                                                          \r\n\n436 (9th Cir. 1994)(noting similarity of asylum regulation to\r\n\nstatutory   withholding  provisions   for  aliens   who  have\r\n\ncommitted particularly serious crimes).14  \r\n\nC. 212(c) Waiver\r                            \r\n\n          Choeum  also  argues  that   the  BIA  abused   its\r\n\ndiscretion  in  denying  her  application  for  a  waiver  of\r\n\ndeportation  under  Section 212(c)  of  the INA,  8  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1182(c).\r\n\n          The  BIA denied  Choeum's  application for  Section\r\n\n212(c)  relief twice,  first  when affirming  the Immigration\r\n\nJudge's  decision and again  when denying Choeum's  motion to\r\n\nreopen.  We  consider only the first of these denials.  See 8\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.   1105a(a)(6)(\"[W]henever a petitioner seeks review of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.   We also note that,  in the asylum provisions of IIRIRA,\r\nCongress  has  made   aliens  who  have  been   convicted  of\r\nparticularly  serious  crimes  ineligible  for  asylum,   and\r\nexplicitly stated that  the Attorney General may  provide, by\r                      \r\nregulation,  additional  limitations  and  conditions on  the\r\nconsideration of  an application for  asylum. See 8  U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n1158(b)(2)(A)(ii); 1158(d)(5)(B) (1997 version).\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nan order under  this section, any review sought  with respect\r\n\nto a motion to  reopen or reconsider such  an order shall  be\r\n\nconsolidated with the review of the order.\").15  \r\n\n          We  only  have  jurisdiction  to  review  the BIA's\r\n\ninitial  denial of  Section  212(c)  relief.    Relief  under\r\n\nSection 212(c) is  discretionary, and review by this court is\r\n\nfor abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Hazzard v. INS, 951 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n435,  438 (1st  Cir. 1991).   We  will uphold  such a  denial\r\n\nunless  it  was   made  \"without   a  rational   explanation,\r\n\ninexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on\r\n\nan impermissible basis.\"  Id. \r                                         \r\n\n          Here,  the  BIA found  that  the Immigration  Judge\r\n\n\"gave proper consideration to the discretionary factors.\"  We\r\n\nagree, and can find no abuse of discretion.    Choeum's crime\r\n\nwas, as  the Immigration Judge found,  profoundly disturbing.\r\n\nChoeum   argues  that   the   Immigration  Judge   improperly\r\n\ndetermined  that she  showed little  remorse.   However,  the\r\n\nImmigration  Judge  observed  her  demeanor  and  heard   her\r\n\ntestimony.    This  finding  essentially  turns  on  Choeum's\r\n\ncredibility and does not provide a basis to overrule the BIA.\r\n\nChoeum  also argues  that  the  Immigration Judge  improperly\r\n\nemphasized  her reliance on  welfare, by failing  to consider\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  As noted, IIRIRA  repealed 8 U.S.C.   1105a.   See supra\r                                                                         \r\nnote 2.  IIRIRA does  adopt a consolidation provision that is\r\nsubstantially similar  to the  old provision.   See IIRIRA   \r                                                               \r\n306(a)(2) (current 8 U.S.C.   1252(b)(6)).  \r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nthe  circumstances that  have made  it  difficult for  her to\r\n\nwork.    Many of  these  circumstances  are of  Choeum's  own\r\n\nmaking.    Moreover,  many,  if  not  most  immigrants,  face\r\n\nlanguage   and  educational   barriers   that  make   finding\r\n\nemployment challenging. \r\n\n          Choeum's  only argument  of substance  is  that, by\r\n\naffirming the decision  of the Immigration Judge  \"based upon\r\n\nand  for the  reasons set  forth in  that decision,\"  the BIA\r\n\napparently did not  consider the  new evidence  of the  post-\r\n\nhearing birth of her son David.  The INS replies that the BIA\r\n\nis an  appellate body and  that Choeum failed to  comply with\r\n\nthe proper procedure for presenting new evidence, which is to\r\n\nmove  to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge, see\r                                                                         \r\n\n8 C.F.R.   3.2.\r\n\n          While  the BIA may, in its discretion, consider new\r\n\nevidence  presented  for  the  first time  on  appeal,  it is\r\n\ncertainly appropriate  for the  BIA to  insist on  compliance\r\n\nwith  the proper  procedures.    Fair  proceedings  are  best\r\n\nassured  through proper entry into the record of all relevant\r\n\nevidence, and through  the ability of the  factfinder to sift\r\n\nthat  evidence.    The  BIA  has  given  notice,  in  earlier\r\n\ndecisions, that it  may refuse to consider  new evidence that\r\n\nis not part of the record before the Immigration Judge.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., Matter of C-,  20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 529,  1992 WL 200361, *6\r                              \r\n\n(BIA   May  28, 1992).    In these  circumstances, the  BIA's\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\ninsistence that the procedural formalities be observed cannot\r\n\nbe considered an abuse of discretion.16\r\n\n          Accordingly, the decisions of the BIA challenged in\r\n\nthe  first petition  are affirmed.   The  second petition  is\r                                             \r\n\ndismissed.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  We  also note  that  the  birth of  a  second child  was\r\nunlikely to  substantially shift the equities of petitioner's\r\ncase.  While it is true that Choeum has a second child, he is\r\nvery  young, allegedly has  no relationship with  his father,\r\nand   presumably does  not yet have  significant ties  to the\r\nUnited  States.   Additionally,  the BIA,  by relying  on the\r\nrecord before  the Immigration  Judge, did  not consider  the\r\nother  post-hearing   events  in  Choeum's   life,  including\r\nquitting  her  job,  returning to  reliance  on  welfare, and\r\nfailing  to pursue  further  her  GED  or  other  educational\r\navenues. \r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n",

For  the  courts,  what  is  involved   is  properly\r\n\nascertaining congressional intent in  light of constitutional\r\n\nguarantees   in  decision  of  cases.    For  this  Cambodian\r\n\nimmigrant, Ran Choeum, what  is involved is whether she  will\r\n\nbe deported, possibly  back to  that war-torn  land she  left\r\n\nwhen  she was  a child.    She petitions  for  review of  two\r\n\ndecisions  of the Board  of Immigration Appeals  (\"BIA\"), one\r\n\ndated February 9,  1996, denying her applications  for asylum\r\n\nand withholding and  for discretionary waiver, and  one dated\r\n\nApril 22, 1997, denying her motions to reopen.\r\n\n          In the  interim, the complexity of  the immigration\r\n\nlaws was  enhanced by two new  statutes.  On April  24, 1996,\r\n\nthe  Antiterrorism and Effective  Death Penalty Act,  Pub. L.\r\n\n104-132, 110  Stat. 1214  (1996) (\"AEDPA\"),  was signed  into\r\n\nlaw.   On September 30, 1996,  (the same day Choeum  moved to\r\n\nreopen before  the BIA)  the Illegal  Immigration Reform  and\r\n\nImmigrant Responsibility Act, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009\r\n\n(1996)  (\"IIRIRA\"), was  signed  into  law.    Both  statutes\r\n\ncontain jurisdiction-stripping  provisions removing  from the\r\n\nfederal circuit courts of appeals their previous jurisdiction\r\n\nover certain categories of final orders of deportation.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          This case was originally argued on May 9, 1997.  In\r\n\na decision dated July 2, 1997, we upheld the decisions of the\r\n\nBIA  on reasoning which rejected particular arguments by both\r\n\nsides.    Each party  filed  petitions  for rehearing.    The\r\n\nImmigration  and   Naturalization  Service   (INS),  in   its\r\n\nrehearing petition, for  the first time raised a new argument\r\n\nthat this court lacked jurisdiction to review both of the BIA\r\n\norders because  AEDPA   440(a)  precludes  jurisdiction  over\r\n\ndeportations for \"aggravated felonies\" under IIRIRA   321.  \r\n\n          It  would have been  vastly preferable,  of course,\r\n\nfor the  INS to  have asserted  this jurisdictional  argument\r\n\ninitially,  and we have  some concern about  the government's\r\n\nburdening of  immigrants with  the obligation  to respond  to\r\n\nnew-found statutory interpretations  by the INS after  a case\r\n\nhas  been heard and decided.1  Nonetheless, because rehearing\r\n\nwas timely sought and parties may not waive issues of subject\r\n\nmatter jurisdiction,2  we  granted  rehearing  on  particular\r\n\nissues.  We withdraw our  earlier opinion and restate in this\r\n\nopinion   those  of  our  earlier  conclusions  which  remain\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In another sense,  however, Choeum is the  beneficiary of\r\nthe  government's  shifting  position.   Because  mandate has\r\nnever issued, and because Choeum has not been deported during\r\nthe pendency of this  appeal, the effect of the  government's\r\ndelay in making  its new jurisdictional argument  has been to\r\ndelay Choeum's deportation.\r\n\n2.

We  conclude that we have jurisdiction  to review\r\n\nthe  first decision of  the BIA, which  requires deportation,\r\n\nand sustain that decision on its merits.  We conclude that we\r\n\nlack  jurisdiction  over  the  second  BIA  decision, denying\r\n\nChoeum's petition to reopen.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Ran  Choeum, an  immigrant  from Cambodia,  pleaded\r\n\nguilty in  New York  state court to  charges of  burglary and\r\n\nkidnapping.    The  charges stemmed  from  a  crime in  which\r\n\nChoeum's boyfriend,  seeking  to settle  a family  grievance,\r\n\nmurdered  two  elderly  relatives  of  his  sister's  fianc .\r\n\nChoeum,  who left  the scene before  the murders  took place,\r\n\npleaded guilty to burglary and kidnapping in order to avoid a\r\n\npossible  murder conviction  under  the  felony murder  rule.\r\n\nWhile Choeum  was in prison, deportation  proceedings against\r\n\nher commenced. \r\n\n          Choeum seeks review of the BIA order of deportation\r\n\nof  April  24, 1996.    She  argues  that AEDPA  changes  the\r\n\nstandard for  determining whether  an alien  is eligible  for\r\n\nwithholding  of  deportation.    She  also  argues  that  the\r\n\nAttorney General's regulation under which her application for\r\n\nasylum  was denied  exceeds the  authority  delegated to  the\r\n\nAttorney General by Congress.  Finally, she contends that the\r\n\nBIA  abused   its  discretion   in  failing   to  grant   her\r\n\ndiscretionary relief  from deportation.   She also  petitions\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nfor review of  the BIA's decision of April  22, 1997, denying\r\n\nher motion to reopen.\r\n\n          The  INS, for its  part, argues that,  under AEDPA,\r\n\nthis court  lacks jurisdiction to  review Choeum's petitions.\r\n\nThe  jurisdictional argument comes in two  parts.  First, the\r\n\nINS argues that  this court has  no jurisdiction over  either\r\n\npetition  for  review  because  AEDPA    440(a),  8  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1105a(a)(10),  removes  jurisdiction  over  deportations  for\r\n\n\"aggravated felonies\" as that term is more broadly defined in\r\n\nIIRIRA    321(a), 8  U.S.C.   1101(a)(43).   In light  of the\r\n\neffective date  provided in  IIRIRA   321(c),  we agree  that\r\n\nthere  is no  jurisdiction over the  second petition  on this\r\n\nground, but the first petition survives this attack.  Second,\r\n\nthe INS argues there is  still no jurisdiction over the first\r\n\npetition for review because she is an alien who has committed\r\n\na  firearms offense under  8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(C),  in this\r\n\ncase, burglary,  and AEDPA   440(a) does not permit review of\r\n\ndeportations based on  such grounds.   We hold that  judicial\r\n\nreview  remains available  because in the  agency deportation\r\n\nproceedings, Choeum was charged with deportability based only\r\n\non  her  kidnapping  offense,  which  is  a  crime  of  moral\r\n\nturpitude under 8  U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(i), and not  with a\r\n\nfirearms offense. \r\n\n          We further  hold that  the INS  may not  substitute\r\n\nalternative  grounds for  deportation at  this  stage in  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nproceedings, and that its argument  fails both as a matter of\r\n\nstatutory  construction  and because  it  raises  due process\r\n\nconcerns under the  Constitution.  Therefore, AEDPA  does not\r\n\ndeprive this  court of  jurisdiction to  hear Choeum's  first\r\n\npetition.    Choeum's legal  arguments,  however, while  ably\r\n\nmade, do not convince us that the BIA erred in denying Choeum\r\n\nthe various forms of relief  sought.  Accordingly, the  BIA's\r\n\ndecision is affirmed.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Ran Choeum was born in a small Cambodian village in\r\n\n1969.    She was  one of  twelve children;  her father  was a\r\n\nsoldier and her mother supported the family by rice  farming.\r\n\nIn 1973,  her father  was killed.   The  Khmer Rouge came  to\r\n\npower  in the  area  in 1975,  and  Choeum's mother,  fearing\r\n\nretaliation for her husband's  military activities, fled with\r\n\nher  children to another  village.   Choeum's mother  died in\r\n\n1978  of starvation  and illness.   In 1979,  Choeum's oldest\r\n\nsister  brought  Choeum  and  two  other  sisters,  the  only\r\n\nsurviving members  of  the  family,  to  a  refugee  camp  in\r\n\nThailand;  they lived  in  various camps  for  the next  five\r\n\nyears.\r\n\n          On  March 27,  1985, Choeum  and  her sisters  were\r\n\nadmitted  to the United States as  refugees; Choeum was later\r\n\ngranted permanent resident status, retroactive to  that date.\r\n\nThe  Choeums'  sponsors  helped them  to  obtain  welfare and\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nhousing.  Choeum, who was fifteen at the time, had never been\r\n\nto school in  Cambodia and spoke no English.   Choeum briefly\r\n\nattended high school  in Brooklyn, but  dropped out when  she\r\n\nbecame pregnant by her boyfriend, a Cambodian immigrant named\r\n\nLak Ling.   Choeum's son Wicky  was born on January  2, 1987.\r\n\nAt   Lak  Ling's  request,  Choeum   and  her  son  moved  to\r\n\nPhiladelphia to live with his relatives.\r\n\n          In  June  1988,  Lak  Ling,  Choeum  and  the  baby\r\n\ntravelled to New  York for Ling's sister's  engagement party.\r\n\nWhen they arrived at Ling's parents' house, they learned that\r\n\nthe sister, who was only  fourteen, and her fianc , a twenty-\r\n\neight year old  Cambodian man, had  disappeared and that  the\r\n\nfianc 's family  had not  paid the  $2,000 dowry  owed Ling's\r\n\nfamily.  \r\n\n          The next night,  June 5, Choeum went outside to buy\r\n\nice  cream for her  son.  She  saw Ling  in a car  with three\r\n\nChinese  men she did not  know.  Ling told her  to get in the\r\n\ncar,  and told  her that they  were going to  get his sister.\r\n\nWhen they arrived at a large apartment house on Ocean Avenue,\r\n\nBrooklyn,  they all  went upstairs  and Ling  told Choeum  to\r\n\nknock on  the door  of  the apartment  where Ling's  sister's\r\n\nfianc 's  parents lived.   No  one answered.   After  driving\r\n\naround, they  returned  to  the  house and  the  Chinese  men\r\n\nknocked on the  door.  One  of the men  was carrying a  paper\r\n\nbag.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          This time, the  door was opened.  The  men went in,\r\n\nand Choeum  followed.   The Chinese  men began  searching the\r\n\napartment,  while  Ling  talked  to  his   sister's  fianc 's\r\n\nparents. The Chinese men began piling up money and jewelry on\r\n\nthe floor in  front of the parents.   One of the  Chinese men\r\n\nbrought two young  children into the  room.  Ling  instructed\r\n\nthem to tie the children up.  Ling assured Choeum that he was\r\n\njust  trying to  scare the  parents into revealing  where his\r\n\nsister was.  The men  brought the children into another room,\r\n\ntook  out a  knife, cut  the  telephone cord,  and bound  the\r\n\nchildren  with it.   One  of  the children  says that  Choeum\r\n\nhelped  tie up  the children  and put  tape on  their mouths.\r\n\nAccording to Choeum, she merely watched, and then she noticed\r\n\nthat her  boyfriend was holding  a gun.  Choeum  asserts that\r\n\nshe became scared, went back  into the other room, and untied\r\n\nthe  children; the Immigration Judge, however, did not credit\r\n\nthis testimony.  One of the men yelled at her to get out when\r\n\nhe saw her near the children.   All four men then screamed at\r\n\nChoeum to leave  and wait in the  car.  She went  outside and\r\n\nwaited.   When the  men returned to  the car  fifteen minutes\r\n\nlater, she  asked if anything had happened;  Ling assured her\r\n\nthat everything was fine.  Choeum returned to Ling's parents'\r\n\nhouse.\r\n\n          The next morning, Choeum was arrested.  It was then\r\n\nthat  she learned  that the  two adults  at the  Ocean Avenue\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\napartment had been murdered.   She was charged with a variety\r\n\nof crimes,  but agreed  to cooperate with  the police  and to\r\n\nhelp them find  Ling.  Facing  a possible murder  conviction,\r\n\nChoeum pleaded guilty  to kidnapping in the  third degree and\r\n\nburglary  in the  first degree,  with  a three  to nine  year\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          While   in   prison,  Choeum   received   favorable\r\n\nperformance assessments, particularly from her teachers.  She\r\n\nmade rapid progress in English, and came close to achieving a\r\n\nGED  despite her complete  lack of formal  education.  Choeum\r\n\nwas  released  in  September  1991.   She  moved  to  Lowell,\r\n\nMassachusetts  to live with  her sisters and  their children.\r\n\nShe enrolled in  job training programs, eventually  finding a\r\n\nmanufacturing  job.   The social  services professionals  who\r\n\nworked with her  were impressed by her eagerness  to work and\r\n\nto improve herself.\r\n\n          In 1993,  Choeum gave birth to a second son, David.\r\n\nDavid's father left her after  she became pregnant and has no\r\n\ncontact with  his son.  Choeum  quit her job when  she became\r\n\npregnant  with David, and  receives welfare and  food stamps.\r\n\nChoeum still resides  near her sisters  in Lowell, and  helps\r\n\nthem,  as  none of  the  others  are proficient  in  English.\r\n\nChoeum's older  son, Wicky,  lives in  Philadelphia with  Lak\r\n\nLing's parents,  who gained  custody of  him during  Choeum's\r\n\nimprisonment.  Choeum does not see Wicky often, but speaks to\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nhim monthly on the phone.  Choeum asserts in her most  recent\r\n\naffidavit that she is  pregnant with a third child.  She also\r\n\nasserts that,  because she fears for their  safety, she would\r\n\nleave Wicky and David in this country were she to be deported\r\n\nto Cambodia.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          Deportation  proceedings  were   initiated  against\r\n\nChoeum with the issuance of an Order to Show Cause (\"OSC\") on\r\n\nSeptember   18,  1990.     The   OSC   charged  Choeum   with\r\n\ndeportability pursuant to the then-current version of Section\r\n\n241(a)(4)3 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), in\r\n\nthat she  had been  convicted of a  crime of  moral turpitude\r\n\ncommitted  within five  years after  entry  and sentenced  to\r\n\nimprisonment  for a year  or more.   The OSC  stated that the\r\n\ncrime of  moral turpitude  was kidnapping.   The OSC  did not\r\n\nrefer to Choeum's  burglary conviction either in  the factual\r\n\nallegations or in the grounds for deportability.\r\n\n          In her responsive pleadings, filed March 31,  1992,\r\n\nChoeum  admitted the  factual  allegations  in  the  OSC  and\r\n\nconceded  deportability  as  charged.   She  also  sought the\r\n\nopportunity to apply for  asylum, withholding of deportation,\r\n\nand  waiver  of  deportability pursuant  to  INA    212(c), 8\r\n\nU.S.C.   1182(c).\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The  section has been  amended several times  since then;\r\nthe   current   version   of   the   provision   is   Section\r\n241(a)(2)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A)(i).\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          A hearing was  held before an Immigration  Judge on\r\n\nAugust  7, 1992.   The  facts and  circumstances of  Choeum's\r\n\ncrime were  fully  explored, including  through testimony  by\r\n\nChoeum's  defense attorney.  The Immigration Judge denied her\r\n\napplications  for asylum  under  INA    208(a),  8  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1158(a),  and   for  withholding  of  deportation  under  INA\r\n\n  243(h),  8  U.S.C.     1253(h), on  the  grounds  that such\r\n\napplications  must  be  denied  if  the  alien,  having  been\r\n\nconvicted  of  a  particularly serious  crime  in  the United\r\n\nStates,  constitutes  a   danger  to  the  community.     The\r\n\nImmigration  Judge  found  that, based  on  all  the evidence\r\n\nconcerning Choeum's burglary and  kidnapping convictions, she\r\n\nhad \"in fact been convicted of a particularly serious crime.\"\r\n\nHe noted that the BIA has interpreted the  statutory language\r\n\nto mean  that an  alien convicted  of a particularly  serious\r\n\ncrime  necessarily  constitutes a  danger  to  the community.\r\n\nTherefore, he  ruled, Choeum was  not eligible for  asylum or\r\n\nwithholding of deportation.\r\n\n          Regarding Choeum's application  for a discretionary\r\n\nwaiver under INA   212(c), the Immigration Judge engaged in a\r\n\ncareful balancing  of the  equities.   Going through  factors\r\n\nidentified as significant  by the BIA, the  Immigration Judge\r\n\nfound that Choeum's separation from Wicky and her sisters and\r\n\nthe conditions  in  Cambodia were  significant  factors,  but\r\n\nthose  facts  did  not overcome  the  egregious  and horrible\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nnature  of her  crime.    On this  ground,  the Judge  denied\r\n\nChoeum's application for discretionary waiver as well. \r\n\n          Choeum  appealed the decision  to the  BIA, arguing\r\n\nthat the  equities, including the  birth of her  second child\r\n\nafter   the  hearing,  warranted  an  exercise  of  favorable\r\n\ndiscretion under INA   212(c), and that the Immigration Judge\r\n\nshould have made a separate determination that Choeum posed a\r\n\ndanger to the  community before denying her  applications for\r\n\nasylum and withholding of  deportation.  In a  decision dated\r\n\nFebruary   9,  1996,  the   BIA  dismissed  Choeum's  appeal,\r\n\nreaffirming its view that an  alien who has been convicted of\r\n\na particularly serious crime necessarily constitutes a danger\r\n\nto  the  community  and  is  ineligible  for  withholding  of\r\n\ndeportation  and asylum.    The BIA  further  found that  the\r\n\nImmigration   Judge   gave   proper   consideration  to   the\r\n\ndiscretionary factors in denying Choeum's request for Section\r\n\n212(c) relief.\r\n\n          AEDPA  was signed  into  law  on  April  24,  1996.\r\n\nChoeum's petition for review was filed with this court on May\r\n\n9, 1996.   On September 30,  1996, Choeum filed  a motion  to\r\n\nreopen with the BIA, based on new evidence, particularly  the\r\n\nbirth of David and  the expectation of a third child,  and on\r\n\nthe argument that AEDPA   413(f), 8 U.S.C.   1253(h), removed\r\n\nthe bar to withholding of deportation for aliens convicted of\r\n\nparticularly  serious crimes.  The BIA denied Choeum's motion\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nto reopen  on  April  22,  1997,  finding  that  under  AEDPA\r\n\n  440(d),  Choeum  was  now  statutorily ineligible  for  INA\r\n\n  212(c)  relief, and rejecting  her interpretation  of AEDPA\r\n\n  413(f).    Choeum  has  asked this  court  to  review  this\r\n\ndecision as well.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\nA.  Jurisdiction:  The Effective Date of IIRIRA   321(c)\r                                                                    \r\n\n          Correctly pointing out that  Congress in the IIRIRA\r\n\nexpanded  the   definition  of   \"aggravated  felonies\"   and\r\n\nprecluded  judicial review  over deportations  for aggravated\r\n\nfelonies, the INS  argues this court lacks  jurisdiction over\r\n\nboth petitions.  Because we agree that kidnapping, the  basis\r\n\nfor  the order deporting  Choeum is an  \"aggravated felony,\"4\r\n\nthe decisive question has to do with when this new definition\r\n\nbecame effective and  the application of that  effective date\r\n\nto the facts of this case.\r\n\n          IIRIRA    321(c) establishes  the \"effective  date\"\r\n\nafter  which these  definitions  of \"aggravated  felony\"  are\r\n\nbinding:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Under IIRIRA   321(a), an \"aggravated felony\" is \"a crime\r\nof violence (as defined  in section 16  of Title 18, but  not\r\nincluding a purely political  offense) for which the term  of\r\nimprisonment at least one year.\" 8 U.S.C.   1101(a)(43)(F). A\r\n\"crime of violence\" is defined as  \"an offense that has as an\r\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\r\nforce against the  person or property of another.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n  16(a).  Because  kidnapping satisfies the terms of 8 U.S.C.\r\n  16(a)  and Choeum's term of imprisonment exceeded one year,\r\nChoeum committed an aggravated felony under IIRIRA  321(a).  \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          The amendments made by this section shall\r\n          apply  to actions  taken on or  after the\r                                              \r\n          date  of  the  enactment  of  this   Act,\r\n          regardless   of   when   the   conviction\r\n          occurred . . . .\r\n\nIIRIRA   321(c) (emphasis added).   The IIRIRA was enacted on\r\n\nSeptember 30,  1996, so federal  courts may not  hear appeals\r\n\nfrom \"actions taken\" regarding  final orders for  deportation\r\n\noccurring  after September  30,  1996  where  the  basis  for\r\n\ndeportation is  commission (at  any time)  of an  \"aggravated\r\n\nfelony.\"\r\n\n          IIRIRA    321(c)  does not  itself define  \"actions\r\n\ntaken.\"   Neither  of  the  interpretations  offered  by  the\r\n\nparties  appear appropriate.   Choeum  argues  that the  most\r\n\nsensible  interpretation of \"actions taken\" is that it refers\r\n\nto  immigration proceedings  brought  against the  immigrant.\r\n\nChoeum  thus  characterizes  \"actions\"   in  the  immigration\r\n\ncontext as analogous to a civil action.  Choeum cites Black's\r                                           \r\n\nLaw  Dictionary in support of this proposition, that \"action\"\r\n\nshould be defined in its  \"usual sense\" as a \"lawsuit brought\r\n\nin court\" --  i.e., the filing of the complaint.   Under this\r                              \r\n\ndefinition,  \"actions taken\"  would  refer  only  to  removal\r\n\nproceedings  begun   after  September   30,  1996,   with  no\r                              \r\n\nretroactive  application to  pending  proceedings.   The  INS\r\n\nbegan removal proceedings against Choeum in 1990.\r\n\n          The  INS  argues  that  \"actions  taken\" means  any\r                                                                         \r\n\naction  taken  regarding  the  case  constitutes  an  \"action\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ntaken.\"   The  INS argues  that  judicial review  is such  an\r\n\naction.  Thus,  this court's exercising of  jurisdiction over\r\n\nthe  matter (by  hearing  the  case in  May,  1997), the  INS\r\n\nargues, causes the court to be divested of jurisdiction.

As to the second petition, the INS says that this\r\n\ncourt has no  jurisdiction because, in  any event, the  BIA's\r\n\ndenial of Choeum's  motion to reopen her  case constitutes an\r\n\n\"action taken\" after  the September 30, 1996 date.   We agree\r\n\nonly with the latter argument.\r\n\n          Both sides  present untenable definitions  in their\r\n\narguments.    It  is   not  obvious  that  \"action\"  in   the\r\n\nimmigration context does or  should have the same  meaning as\r\n\nan  \"action\" in  the civil  context.   The  court of  appeals\r\n\nreview actions  by the  administrative agency in  deportation\r\n\ncases  and Choeum attacks  four different actions  on review.\r\n\nChoeum's position assumes  there can be only  one action, and\r\n\nthat is the  initial filing in a matter.   The INS's position\r\n\nis also  flawed:  it  is unlikely Congress intended  the very\r\n\nact  of exercising jurisdiction to trigger the destruction of\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthat  jurisdiction.  If Congress had intended to affect every\r\n\npetition pending in a court,  there was much clearer language\r\n\navailable to  express such an  intent.  Neither does  it make\r\n\nsense that federal jurisdiction should be dependent on when a\r\n\ncourt  schedules a  hearing  on a  particular petition.   For\r\n\nexample, it seems  irrational that a federal court would have\r\n\njurisdiction over a matter if it heard  argument on September\r\n\n29, 1996, but would not have jurisdiction if it postponed the\r                                        \r\n\nargument until October 1, 1996.\r\n\n          Valderrama-Fonseca  v.

The\r\n\nfacts are similar to this case.  The INS sought to  deport an\r\n\nalien because  he had committed  burglary, a crime  of \"moral\r\n\nturpitude;\" the INS then argued that AEDPA   440(a) precluded\r\n\njudicial review of the final order of deportation because the\r\n\ncrime   was  also  an  \"aggravated  felony\"  under  8  U.S.C.\r\n\n  1101(a)(43).   There  was  no  question  that  the  alien's\r\n\noffense  would  constitute  an  \"aggravated  felony\"  if  the\r\n\nrevised  definition were  applicable  under IIRIRA    321(c);\r\n\nhence  the precise issue upon which jurisdiction depended was\r\n\nwhether  an \"action\"  had been  \"taken\"  after September  30,\r\n\n1996.\r\n\n          The court  offered three  potential definitions  of\r\n\n\"actions taken.\"  \"Actions taken\" could refer  to: (l) orders\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nand decisions issued against an alien by the Attorney General\r\n\nacting through the BIA or  Immigration Judge, (2) steps taken\r\n\nby the alien, such as applying for discretionary relief,  (3)\r\n\nto any action by  anyone, including a circuit court.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n856.     The  court   did  not  consider   Choeum's  proposed\r\n\ndefinition:  that  \"actions taken\" refers exclusively  to the\r\n\ncommencement of deportation proceedings against the alien.\r\n\n          We largely  agree with  the holding  of Valderrama-\r                                                                         \r\n\nFonseca.  The third reading is improbable:  it makes no sense\r                   \r\n\nthat  federal  jurisdiction  should  be  based  on  the  oral\r\n\nargument  calendar.  The  second definition is  plausible, as\r\n\nIIRIRA     309(c)(4)(A)  refers to  an  \"action  for judicial\r\n\nreview,\" which would be initiated by the client herself.  But\r\n\nwe need  not  decide the  issue on  the facts  of this  case.\r\n\nChoeum filed  her first  petition for review  on May  9, 1996\r\n\nwell before the effective date.   The first definition is the\r\n\nstrongest and  most sensible:  that \"actions taken\" refers to\r\n\nactions and decisions of  the Attorney General.   \"This makes\r\n\nlogical and  practical sense,  as 'actions  taken' is  easily\r\n\nunderstood  to  encompass things  done  by  an agency  to  an\r\n\nalien.\" Id.  This interpretation is also consistent with  how\r                       \r\n\nthe  word \"actions\"  is used  in another  section of  the INA\r\n\nlimiting federal court  jurisdictional section of the  INA, 8\r\n\nU.S.C.  1252(g):\r\n\n          Except  as provided  in this  section and\r\n          notwithstanding  any  other  provision of\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          law, no court  shall have jurisdiction to\r\n          hear any cause  or claim by or  on behalf\r\n          of any alien arising from the decision or\r\n          action   by  the   Attorney  General   to\r\n          commence  proceedings,  adjudicate cases,\r\n          or  execute  removal orders  against  any\r\n          alien under this chapter.\r\n\n          We conclude  that jurisdiction over  Choeum's first\r\n\npetition is  not removed  by virtue of  AEDPA   440(a).   The\r\n\ndecision  of the immigration  judge and the  BIA's affirmance\r\n\nall  occurred prior  to  October  1,  1996,  so  the  revised\r\n\n\"aggravated  felony\" rules in  IIRIRA   321(a) do  not apply.\r\n\nBy  the same reasoning, this court does not have jurisdiction\r                                                       \r\n\nover  Choeum's second petition,  because the BIA's  denial of\r\n\nChoeum's motion  to reopen occurred on April  22, 1997, which\r\n\nis   after  the   October  1,   1996   triggering  date   for\r                      \r\n\napplicability of the  \"aggravated felony\" rules.   We dismiss\r\n\nthe second petition.\r\n\nB.  Jurisdiction:  AEDPAand Basis for BIA's Deportation Order\r                                                                         \r\n\n          The INS  also filed a  motion to dismiss  with this\r\n\ncourt,  arguing  that  Section 440(a)  of  AEDPA,  apart from\r\n\nIIRIRA,  deprives this  court of  jurisdiction  to hear  this\r\n\ncase.   That section  ousts the  jurisdiction of  the federal\r\n\ncourts  to review the  deportation petitions of,  among other\r\n\nclasses  of aliens, aliens  deportable by reason  of firearms\r\n\noffenses  under 8 U.S.C.    1251(a)(2)(C).  The  INS contends\r\n\nthat  Choeum's  burglary  conviction  was  such  an  offense.\r\n\nHowever,  at the  deportation proceedings,  the  INS did  not\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nassert  the burglary   offense  as  a basis  for deportation.\r\n\nInstead, the INS  rested on the kidnapping  offense, although\r\n\nthe INS did not argue that the kidnapping was also a firearms\r\n\noffense.   The  INS's argument  seems to  be that  because it\r\n\nmight have  sought to deport  Choeum based  on her  burglary-\r                 \r\n\nfirearms conviction, even though it  chose not to do so, this\r                                                          \r\n\ncourt lacks jurisdiction to review Choeum's deportation based\r\n\nupon her  kidnapping non-firearms offense because  this court\r\n\nlacks   jurisdiction    over   a    burglary-firearms   based\r\n\ndeportation,  even  though   this  was  not  the   basis  for\r\n\ndeportation.\r\n\n          Section 440(a) of AEDPA  amended Section 106(a)(10)\r\n\nof the INA,  8 U.S.C.   1105a(a)(10),5 to  provide that final\r\n\norders of deportation  against aliens who are  \"deportable by\r\n\nreason  of  having  committed\"   certain  types  of  criminal\r\n\noffenses, including firearms offenses, \"shall  not be subject\r\n\nto review by  any court.\"  AEDPA   440(a), 110 Stat. at 1276-\r\n\n77.    This  provision of  AEDPA  applies  to pending  cases.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Section 106 of  the INA, 8 U.S.C.   1105a was repealed by\r\n   306(b) of  the Illegal  Immigration  Reform and  Immigrant\r\nResponsibility Act of 1996, Pub.

Under\r                           \r\n\nAEDPA, judicial review  remains available to aliens  who have\r\n\ncommitted  other types of offenses, including aliens who have\r\n\nbeen convicted  of only  one crime of  moral turpitude.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nAEDPA   440(a); 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(A).  The  INS  contends\r\n\nthat the first degree burglary charge to which Choeum pleaded\r\n\nguilty  was  a   firearms  offense  as  defined   by  Section\r\n\n241(a)(2)(C) of the  INA, which renders deportable  any alien\r\n\nwho \"is convicted  under any law  of  . .  . using . .  . any\r\n\nweapon  . . .  which is a firearm  . . .  in violation of any\r\n\nlaw.\"    8  U.S.C.     1251(a)(2)(C).    Therefore,  the  INS\r\n\ncontends,   Choeum  is   \"deportable  by  reason   of  having\r\n\ncommitted\" a  firearms offense  and Section  440(a) of  AEDPA\r\n\ndeprives this court of jurisdiction to hear her petition.\r\n\n          Choeum makes  two responses to the  INS's argument.\r\n\nFirst, Choeum argues that she  was not, in fact, convicted of\r\n\na  firearms offense,  as her  plea colloquy reveals  that she\r\n\nherself did not \"use\" a handgun.6  Second, Choeum points out,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Under New York law, a person is guilty of burglary in the\r\nfirst  degree \"when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully\r\nin a dwelling with intent to commit a crime therein, and when\r\nin effecting entry  or while in the dwelling  or in immediate\r\nflight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime:\r                                                                    \r\n    1.  Is armed with explosives or a deadly weapon; or\r\n    2.  Causes physical  injury to  any person  who is  not a\r\n    participant in the crime; or \r\n    3.  Uses  or threatens the  immediate use of  a dangerous\r\n    instrument; or \r\n    4.  Display what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle,\r\n    shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm . . . .\"\r\nN.Y.

The  Immigration Judge  did,  as the  INS\r\n\npoints  out,  hear  extensive  testimony  on  the  nature  of\r\n\nChoeum's  crime.   Notably, however,  he  did not  attempt to\r\n\ndetermine whether Choeum had used a firearm, because that was\r\n\nnot an issue in the proceedings before him. \r\n\n          The INS's argument is essentially a linguistic one.\r\n\nAccording  to the INS,  for purposes of  jurisdiction, aliens\r\n\n\"deportable by reason of\"  having committed firearms offenses\r                       \r\n\nare not only those aliens  who have been ordered deported for\r                                                                     \r\n\nfirearms  offenses,  but  also  those  aliens  who  could  be\r                                                                         \r\n\ndeported  for  that  reason.    As   a  matter  of  statutory\r\n\nconstruction, that  argument  is  somewhat  illogical:    The\r\n\ncontested  phrase comes  from  Section  440(a)  of  AEDPA,  a\r\n\nstatutory  section  solely  concerned with  final  orders  of\r\n\ndeportation.   The  section therefore  applies,  by its  very\r\n\nterms,  only  to  aliens  who  have  actually  been  adjudged\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n    Thus, under  New York law,  Choeum could be convicted  of\r\nburglary in the  first degree simply by virtue  of Ling's use\r\nof the gun.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ndeportable.   It is  therefore highly doubtful  that, in that\r\n\ncontext, Congress meant \"deportable by reason of\" to mean, as\r\n\nthe  INS would  have it,  \"potentially  susceptible to  being\r\n\ndeported by reason of . . .\"  \r\n\n          The  reading of the  statute that the  INS proposes\r\n\nalso raises due  process concerns.   \"It is well  established\r\n\nthat  the Fifth Amendment  entitles aliens to  due process of\r\n\nlaw in  deportation proceedings.\"   Reno v.

Withholding of deportation and asylum are similar in that\r\nboth offer relief from deportation based on the likelihood of\r\npersecution  in the alien's home country.   Asylum requires a\r\ngreater showing  than withholding,  and carries  with it  the\r\nentitlement  to  become  a  lawful  permanent  resident,  and\r\neventually a citizen.   Withholding, on the  other hand, does\r\nnot  give the  alien the  automatic  right to  remain in  the\r\nUnited States;  the alien  may still be  deported to  a third\r\ncountry in  which she would not face persecution.

As  the express  terms  of  the\r                 \r\n\nConvention do  not differ  from those  of the  United States'\r\n\nParticularly Serious Crime Exception, the explicit  reference\r\n\nto the Protocol in AEDPA's Section 413(f) would not appear to\r\n\nmodify that Exception.\r\n\n          Choeum   argues,  however,   that  Section   413(f)\r\n\nexpresses a congressional  intent to  incorporate the  United\r\n\nNations'   interpretation  of   the  Protocol's   withholding\r\n\nprovisions  into United States  immigration law.   She refers\r\n\nthis  court  to  an  advisory  opinion  on  AEDPA  issued  by\r\n\nRepresentative Anne  Willem Bijleveld  of the United  Nations\r\n\nHigh  Commissioner for  Refugees  (\"UNHCR\")  to the  American\r\n\nImmigration Lawyers Association, and to the UNHCR Handbook on\r                                                                         \r\n\nProcedures  and  Criteria   for  Determining  Refugee  Status\r                                                                         \r\n\n(1979)(\"UNHCR Handbook\").  \r\n\n          Mr. Bijleveld's opinion takes the position that the\r\n\nProtocol  requires a  signatory  state  to  make  a  separate\r\n\ndetermination that the refugee it  seeks to expel is a danger\r\n\nto the community.  The UNHCR Handbook, for its part, does not\r\n\nunambiguously support Choeum's  position. The UNHCR Handbook,\r\n\nwhile  requiring  an  individualized  determination  of   the\r\n\napplicability of Article 33.2's exclusion clause, focusses on\r\n\nthe  definition of \"serious non-political crime\" and does not\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nexplicitly  require a  separate dangerousness  determination.\r\n\nSee UNHCR Handbook, supra,    154-57, at 36-37.\r                                     \r\n\n          The INS, in  contrast, points this court  to Matter\r                                                                         \r\n\nof Q-T-M-T-, Interim Dec. 3300, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">784581</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *16 (BIA Dec.\r                       \r\n\n21, 1996).

[E]very  reviewing court  reaching this\r\n          issue has sustained  our prior holding in\r\n          this  regard.    Indeed,   in  1995,  the\r\n          Attorney  General  issued   a  regulation\r\n          adopting  this  construction  of  section\r\n          243(h)(2)(B).          8     C.F.R.      \r\n          208.16(c)(2)(ii)(1995).   Moreover, there\r\n          is nothing in  the legislative history of\r\n          either the AEDPA or the IIRIRA suggesting\r\n          that Congress had any intent to  override\r\n          this  well-settled  construction  of  the\r\n          law.  And, particularly  in enacting  the\r\n          IIRIRA, Congress reflected its ability to\r\n          clearly  address and  override Board  and\r\n          judicial constructions  of the  law which\r\n          it  deemed erroneous.   Thus,  we do  not\r\n          find our  ruling on  this  issue [to  be]\r\n          affected by section 243(h)(3) of the Act.\r\n\nId.  \r               \r\n\n          The INS further argues that the reason for enacting\r\n\nSection  413(f) was  that AEDPA  expanded  the definition  of\r\n\n\"aggravated  felony\"   to  include   crimes  that  might   be\r\n\nconsidered less serious  than those the Protocol  intended to\r\n\ncover in its exclusion clause.  Section 243(h)(2) of the INA,\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\n8 U.S.C.   1253(h)(2), expressly states that, for withholding\r\n\npurposes, \"an alien  convicted of an aggravated  felony shall\r\n\nbe  considered  to  have  committed  a  particularly  serious\r\n\ncrime.\"  The INS contends  that AEDPA Section 413(f) was thus\r\n\nintended  to preserve  the Attorney General's  flexibility in\r\n\nassessing whether crimes now  defined as aggravated  felonies\r\n\nwere, in fact,  \"particularly serious\" within the  meaning of\r\n\nthe Protocol.\r\n\n          In interpreting Section  413(f) of  AEDPA, we  must\r\n\nfirst determine if the statutory language makes the intent of\r\n\nCongress  clear and unambiguous; if the statute is ambiguous,\r\n\nwe   give  deference  to  the  BIA's  interpretation  of  the\r\n\nimmigration  laws, unless  that interpretation  is arbitrary,\r\n\ncapricious, or contrary to the statute.  Chevron, 467 U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n842-45 (1984); Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 554.\r                                         \r\n\n          The  plain language of  Section 413(f) is  not very\r\n\nilluminating.   It  directs the  Attorney  General to  ensure\r\n\ncompliance with the Protocol,  yet as noted, the  language of\r\n\nthe  Protocol's  withholding   provisions  has  already  been\r\n\ncodified as United States statutory law.  Section 413(f) thus\r\n\nappears, at first glance, to be surplusage.  The  legislative\r\n\nhistory of AEDPA is similarly unhelpful.\r\n\n          The import of Section 413(f) is thus ambiguous, and\r\n\nwe  turn to the agency  interpretation.  The reasoning behind\r\n\nthe BIA's interpretation  is fairly persuasive.   Congress is\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\npresumed to be  aware of the BIA's  longstanding construction\r\n\nof the Particularly  Serious Crime Exception.   See Mosquera-\r                                                                         \r\n\nPerez, 3 F.3d at 559.  If  Section 413(f) of AEDPA were meant\r                 \r\n\nto correct  that construction, Congress  certainly would have\r\n\ndone so in a less oblique fashion.  We also note that Section\r\n\n413 of AEDPA, as a whole, is entitled \"Denial of Other Relief\r\n\nto Alien Terrorists,\" and that the legislation  shows few, if\r\n\nany, indications of having  intended to expand the rights  of\r                                                          \r\n\ncriminal aliens.  In  this context, the INS's  explanation of\r\n\nwhy Section 413(f) was enacted is certainly a reasonable one.\r\n\n          In turn,  Choeum's arguments are  unpersuasive.  As\r\n\nnoted,  the UNHCR Handbook does not unambiguously support her\r\n\ninterpretation of the Protocol.  Moreover, the Supreme Court,\r\n\nwhile acknowledging  that the  UNHCR Handbook  is \"useful  in\r\n\ngiving  content   to  the   obligations  that   the  Protocol\r\n\nestablishes,\"  expressly disclaimed  the suggestion  that the\r\n\nHandbook had \"the  force of law or in any way binds the INS.\"\r\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 439 n.22.  \r                           \r\n\n          In  this context,  where the statute  is ambiguous,\r\n\nand the  BIA has offered  a reasonable interpretation  of its\r\n\nprovisions, it would be improper for this court to substitute\r\n\nthe  advisory  opinion  of  an  international  body  for  the\r\n\nreasoned judgment of the domestic  administrative agency with\r\n\nprimary   responsibility  for   administering  the   statute.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  find  that  the  interpretation  of Section\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\n243(h)(2)(B)  and Section 243(h)(3) adopted by the BIA is not\r\n\nunreasonable, arbitrary,  or  capricious.    Consequently,  a\r\n\nseparate inquiry into Choeum's dangerousness to the community\r\n\nwas not required.  See Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 559.  Choeum\r                                                 \r\n\nwas not eligible for withholding of deportation.\r\n\nB. Asylum\r                     \r\n\n          Choeum next argues that  the regulation under which\r\n\nshe  was deemed ineligible  for asylum exceeds  the authority\r\n\ndelegated to the Attorney General by Congress.  \r\n\n          An  INS regulation  provides that:  \"An application\r\n\nfor asylum shall  be denied if . . . [t]he alien, having been\r\n\nconvicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime\r\n\nin the United States, constitutes a danger to the community .\r\n\n. .  .\"   8  C.F.R.    208.14(d)(1).12   This regulation  was\r\n\npromulgated pursuant  to then-current  Section 208(a)  of the\r\n\nINA, 8 U.S.C.   1158(a),13  which provided:\r\n\n          The  Attorney General  shall establish  a\r\n          procedure for an alien . . . to apply for\r\n          asylum,  and  the  alien  may be  granted\r\n          asylum in the discretion of the  Attorney\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  8  C.F.R.   208.14(d) previously  appeared at 8 C.F.R.  \r\n208.14(c), and  is referred to  by its former  designation in\r\nthe administrative proceedings in this case, and in the cases\r\ndiscussed herein.\r\n\n13.  Section  604 of  IIRIRA, \"Asylum  Reform,\" substantially\r\namends Section  208 of the  INA, 8  U.S.C.   1158.   However,\r\nSection 604 of IIRIRA applies only to applications for asylum\r\nfiled on or  after April 1, 1997.   See IIRIRA    604(c), 110\r                                                   \r\nStat. 3009-694.    References  in this  opinion  are  to  the\r\nearlier version of 8 U.S.C.    1158, which may be found at  8\r\nU.S.C.A.   1158 (West 1996).\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n          General   if    the   Attorney    General\r\n          determines that such  alien is a  refugee\r\n          within the meaning of . . . this title.\r\n\n          Choeum points out that, in 1990, the same year that\r\n\nthe challenged regulation was adopted, Congress enacted  what\r\n\nwas then 8 U.S.C.    1158(d), which provided that \"[a]n alien\r\n\nwho has been convicted of an aggravated  felony . . . may not\r\n\napply for or be granted asylum.\"  8 U.S.C.   1158(d).  Choeum\r\n\nargues that, by negative implication, Congress did not intend\r\n\na similar per  se bar  for aliens  convicted of  particularly\r                             \r\n\nserious  crimes, and that  the Attorney General  exceeded the\r\n\nauthority delegated by Congress in  barring a larger class of\r\n\naliens than that barred by statute.\r\n\n          The statute expressly  conferred broad authority on\r\n\nthe  Attorney General to  \"establish a procedure\"  for asylum\r\n\napplications, and the  granting of asylum is  explicitly left\r\n\nto the Attorney  General's discretion.  Under  Chevron, where\r                                                                  \r\n\nCongress \"explicitly left a gap  for the agency to fill,\" and\r\n\nwhere there is  thus \"an express  delegation of authority  to\r\n\nthe agency to  elucidate a specific provision of  the statute\r\n\nby  regulation,\"  we  should uphold a  gap-filling regulation\r\n\nunless it  is \"arbitrary, capricious, or  manifestly contrary\r\n\nto the statute.\"  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44.\r                                     \r\n\n          The  Attorney General's  determination that  aliens\r\n\nconvicted of particularly serious crimes should be ineligible\r\n\nfor asylum is not unreasonable.   Applying Chevron, we do not\r                                                              \r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\nfind that the regulation exceeds the broad grant of authority\r\n\nconferred  by  the enabling  statute.   Accordingly, Choeum's\r\n\napplication for asylum was properly denied.  We note that the\r\n\ntwo other circuits to have  considered the argument made here\r\n\nby Choeum have also upheld  the regulation.

We  consider only the first of these denials.  See 8\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.   1105a(a)(6)(\"[W]henever a petitioner seeks review of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.   We also note that,  in the asylum provisions of IIRIRA,\r\nCongress  has  made   aliens  who  have  been   convicted  of\r\nparticularly  serious  crimes  ineligible  for  asylum,   and\r\nexplicitly stated that  the Attorney General may  provide, by\r                      \r\nregulation,  additional  limitations  and  conditions on  the\r\nconsideration of  an application for  asylum.

Relief  under\r\n\nSection 212(c) is  discretionary, and review by this court is\r\n\nfor abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Hazzard v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573876\"><a href=\"/opinion/573876/ronald-hazzard-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r                                                               \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  438 (1st  Cir. 1991).   We  will uphold  such a  denial\r\n\nunless  it  was   made  \"without   a  rational   explanation,\r\n\ninexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on\r\n\nan impermissible basis.\"  Id. \r                                         \r\n\n          Here,  the  BIA found  that  the Immigration  Judge\r\n\n\"gave proper consideration to the discretionary factors.\"  We\r\n\nagree, and can find no abuse of discretion.    Choeum's crime\r\n\nwas, as  the Immigration Judge found,  profoundly disturbing.\r\n\nChoeum   argues  that   the   Immigration  Judge   improperly\r\n\ndetermined  that she  showed little  remorse.   However,  the\r\n\nImmigration  Judge  observed  her  demeanor  and  heard   her\r\n\ntestimony.    This  finding  essentially  turns  on  Choeum's\r\n\ncredibility and does not provide a basis to overrule the BIA.\r\n\nChoeum  also argues  that  the  Immigration Judge  improperly\r\n\nemphasized  her reliance on  welfare, by failing  to consider\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  As noted, IIRIRA  repealed 8 U.S.C.   1105a.   See supra\r                                                                         \r\nnote 2.  IIRIRA does  adopt a consolidation provision that is\r\nsubstantially similar  to the  old provision.   See IIRIRA   \r                                                               \r\n306(a)(2) (current 8 U.S.C.   1252(b)(6)).  \r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nthe  circumstances that  have made  it  difficult for  her to\r\n\nwork.    Many of  these  circumstances  are of  Choeum's  own\r\n\nmaking.    Moreover,  many,  if  not  most  immigrants,  face\r\n\nlanguage   and  educational   barriers   that  make   finding\r\n\nemployment challenging. \r\n\n          Choeum's  only argument  of substance  is  that, by\r\n\naffirming the decision  of the Immigration Judge  \"based upon\r\n\nand  for the  reasons set  forth in  that decision,\"  the BIA\r\n\napparently did not  consider the  new evidence  of the  post-\r\n\nhearing birth of her son David.  The INS replies that the BIA\r\n\nis an  appellate body and  that Choeum failed to  comply with\r\n\nthe proper procedure for presenting new evidence, which is to\r\n\nmove  to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge, see\r                                                                         \r\n\n8 C.F.R.   3.2.\r\n\n          While  the BIA may, in its discretion, consider new\r\n\nevidence  presented  for  the  first time  on  appeal,  it is\r\n\ncertainly appropriate  for the  BIA to  insist on  compliance\r\n\nwith  the proper  procedures.    Fair  proceedings  are  best\r\n\nassured  through proper entry into the record of all relevant\r\n\nevidence, and through  the ability of the  factfinder to sift\r\n\nthat  evidence.    The  BIA  has  given  notice,  in  earlier\r\n\ndecisions, that it  may refuse to consider  new evidence that\r\n\nis not part of the record before the Immigration Judge.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., Matter of C-,  20 I. &amp; N.

In these  circumstances, the  BIA's\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\ninsistence that the procedural formalities be observed cannot\r\n\nbe considered an abuse of discretion.16\r\n\n          Accordingly, the decisions of the BIA challenged in\r\n\nthe  first petition  are affirmed.   The  second petition  is\r                                             \r\n\ndismissed.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  We  also note  that  the  birth of  a  second child  was\r\nunlikely to  substantially shift the equities of petitioner's\r\ncase.  While it is true that Choeum has a second child, he is\r\nvery  young, allegedly has  no relationship with  his father,\r\nand   presumably does  not yet have  significant ties  to the\r\nUnited  States.   Additionally,  the BIA,  by relying  on the\r\nrecord before  the Immigration  Judge, did  not consider  the\r\nother  post-hearing   events  in  Choeum's   life,  including\r\nquitting  her  job,  returning to  reliance  on  welfare, and\r\nfailing  to pursue  further  her  GED  or  other  educational\r\navenues. \r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n</pre>",
