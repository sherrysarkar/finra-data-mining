The United  States\r\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts denied the writ.\r\n\nMartin appeals.\r\n\n          As a preliminary matter, we must explore, for the first\r\n\ntime  in  this  circuit,  the  interrelationship  between  habeas\r\n\npetitions and the  newly enacted Prison Litigation Reform Act  of\r\n\n1996 (PLRA).   Once that expedition  is finished, we address  the\r\n\nmerits of Martin's claim.  In the end, we affirm the judgment  of\r\n\nthe district court.\r\n\nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\n          On \r                      May \r                          7, \r                            1991, \r                                  a \r                                    Barnstable County (Massachusetts) grand\r\n\njury indicted  Martin on charges of  breaking and entering.   See\r\n\nMass. Gen.  Laws ch. 266, S 18 (1990).  Later that year, a  petit\r\n\njury \r              found \r                    the petitioner guilty as charged, and the court imposed\r\n\na substantial prison sentence.   Martin's subsequent attempts  to\r\n\ngain surcease in the  state court system proved unavailing.   See\r\n\nCommonwealth v. Martin, 653 N.E.2d 603 (Mass. App. Ct.),  further\r\n\nrev. denied, 654 N.E.2d 1202 (Mass. 1995).\r\n\n          On March 12, 1996, the petitioner applied for a writ of\r\n\nhabeas corpus in the federal district court, see 28 U.S.C. S 2254\r\n\n(1994), naming as respondents  various state officials (who,  for\r\n\nease in reference, we call \"the Commonwealth\").  He premised  the\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\napplication on  a claim that the  trial court's exclusion of  his\r\n\nmother from the courtroom during  part of the testimony of a  key\r\n\nprosecution \r                     witness deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to a\r\n\npublic trial.   The district  court, without much  in the way  of\r\n\nindependent \r                     elaboration, turned a deaf ear and thereafter denied a\r\n\ncertificate  of  probable  cause.    We  nonetheless  granted   a\r\n\ncertificate of appealability.  See 28 U.S.C.A. S 2253(c)(1) (West\r\n\nSupp. 1997).\r\n\nII.  THE COURSE OF TRIAL\r\n\n          To understand the petitioner's claim, we must  rehearse\r\n\nhis trial  in the  Barnstable Superior Court.   We  offer only  a\r\n\nsynopsis, confident  that the reader  who thirsts for  additional\r\n\ndetail can find it elsewhere.  See Martin, 653 N.E.2d at 604-06.\r\n\n          The \r                       Commonwealth alleged that Martin and Niles Hinckley,\r\n\nhis half-brother, broke into the office of the Yarmouth town dump\r\n\nand \r             stole \r                   a \r                     safe.  After removing the safe from the building, they\r\n\ntold \r              a \r                friend, Thomas Violette, that they needed help to transport\r\n\n\"something \r                    big.\" \r                          \r                          Violette obliged.  As the three men left the dump\r\n\nin Hinckley's car, with  the safe aboard, they came across  Linda\r\n\nRose, \r               whose \r                    automobile \r                               had failed her.  She joined them.  The group\r\n\nproceeded to Rose's home.   Once there, the men dragged the  safe\r\n\ninto the house and tried to open it.  Unsettled by this endeavor,\r\n\nRose \r              departed with her children.  Violette also grew anxious about\r\n\nhis involvement; he left the premises a few minutes after  Martin\r\n\nand Hinckley began working on the safe, pondered his predicament,\r\n\nand  then made  a beeline  for  the police.   The  culprits  were\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\napprehended and charged in short order.\r\n\n          Martin  and  Hinckley   were  tried   together.     The\r\n\nCommonwealth called Rose as a witness in its case in chief.   She\r\n\nstated repeatedly that she did  not see (or, at least, could  not\r\n\nrecall) much of what  had transpired on the evening in  question.\r\n\nThe \r             prosecutor told the judge at sidebar that Rose was nervous and\r\n\nscared and  suggested that her  professed lapses  of memory  were\r\n\ndisingenuous.  The trial adjourned in the midst of Rose's  cross-\r\n\nexamination.\r\n\n          On the  next trial day,  the prosecutor voiced  concern\r\n\nabout \r               possible witness intimidation and the judge conducted a voir\r\n\ndire outside the presence  of the jury.  During that  proceeding,\r\n\nRose \r              admitted \r                      that \r                           portions of her previous testimony had been less\r\n\nthan truthful.  She also  stated that she had been frightened  by\r\n\nJames \r               Martin \r                      (the petitioner's brother, who, she said, had pointed\r\n\nat her  from the  back  of the  courtroom), by  the  petitioner's\r\n\ngirlfriend, \r                     and by an unidentified woman (who, she said, had given\r\n\nher \r             dirty \r                  looks, \r                         \"scaring [her] from testifying\").  Rose went on to\r\n\nrecount \r                 that \r                     the \r                         petitioner's girlfriend had signalled her to \"come\r\n\nover and talk\" outside the courtroom; that the petitioner himself\r\n\nhad accosted her shortly  after his arrest and instructed her  to\r\n\ntestify (falsely) that Hinckley had acted alone in  expropriating\r\n\nthe  safe; and  that, on  another occasion,  the Martin  brothers\r\n\nordered her to deny the petitioner's role in the burglary.\r\n\n          Based \r                         on \r                            Rose's statements, the court determined that it\r\n\nwas \r             \"in \r                 the \r                     interest of justice that the Commonwealth be permitted\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nto reopen and redirect  on Miss Rose.\"   In so ruling, the  judge\r\n\nwitnesses (including Rose) and that the petitioner had been found\r\n\n uilty \r                of \r                   intimidating Rose.  The judge then ordered the courtroom\r\n\nc\r          noted \r               that \r                    James Martin already had pleaded guilty to intimidating\r          glosed \r                during \r                      the \r                          remainder of Rose's testimony and refused to make\r\n\nan exception for  the petitioner's mother.1  During her  reopened\r\n\ntestimony, Rose described the petitioner's attempts to intimidate\r\n\nher, \r              but \r                 her \r                     recollection of the evening in question did not differ\r\n\nmaterially from her original testimony.\r\n\nIII.  THE PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT\r\n\n          We begin with the PLRA, Pub. L. No. 104-134, tit. VIII,\r\n\n110 \r             Stat. \r                   1321, 1366 (1996), which, among other things, amended 28\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1915 to require convicts  to pay the full amount of  the\r\n\nfiling \r                fees \r                     in civil actions.  See PLRA, S 804, 110 Stat. at 1373-\r\n\n1375.  The petitioner  did not pay a  filing fee to the  district\r\n\ncourt  and  has not  paid  any  other fees  associated  with  the\r\n\nmaintenance \r                     of his suit.2  Thus, the threshold question is whether\r\n\nthe PLRA applies to habeas petitions brought in federal court  by\r\n\nstate prisoners.\r\n\n          Though \r                          habeas proceedings are technically civil actions,\r\n\nsee\r             \r             Ex \r                parte \r                      Tom Tong, 108 U.S. 556, 559 (1883), the Supreme Court\r\n\nhas long recognized that the label is ill-fitting and that habeas\r\n\n     1Although the closure order exempted the press,  there is no\r\nevidence \r                  in \r                     the \r                        record \r                               that any reporters were in attendance during\r\nRose's reopened testimony.  See Martin, 653 N.E.2d at 605.\r\n\n       2The  petitioner did  file a  motion to  proceed in  forma\r\npauperis,  and although  the district  court did  not grant  that\r\nmotion, he appears eligible for such a dispensation.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nis \r            in \r               fact \r                   a \r                     unique \r                            creature of the law.  See Harris v. Nelson, 394\r\n\nU.S. 286,  293-94  (1969).   Here, despite  the  undiscriminating\r\n\nreference \r                   to \r                     \"civil \r                            actions,\" no fewer than four pieces of evidence\r\n\nindicate \r                  that Congress did not intend the PLRA to intrude into the\r\n\nhabeas \r                realm. \r                        \r                       First, \r                              Congress, in enacting the PLRA, took dead aim\r\n\nat suits  challenging conditions of  confinement, and nothing  in\r\n\neither the PLRA's  text or its legislative history suggests  that\r\n\nhabeas cases were perceived  to comprise a part of this  problem.\r\n\nSecond, Congress specifically addressed  what it perceived to  be\r\n\nhabeas \r                abuses in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\r\n\nof 1996  (AEDPA), Pub.  L. No. 104-132,  tit. I,  110 Stat.  1216\r\n\n(1996), \r                 which it enacted contemporaneous with passage of the PLRA,\r\n\nand the abuses it  enumerated did not include the non-payment  of\r\n\nfiling \r                fees. \r                       See Reyes v. Keane, 90 F.3d 676, 678 (2d Cir. 1996).\r\n\nThird, \r                extending the PLRA to habeas cases would deny habeas review\r\n\nto any prisoner  proceeding in forma pauperis who had  previously\r\n\nfiled  three groundless  (though  unrelated)  civil  suits  while\r\n\nincarcerated,\r                       see 28 U.S.C.A. S 1915(g) (West Supp. 1997), thereby\r\n\nfrustrating a  storied tradition of  reasonable access to  habeas\r\n\nreview. \r                  \r                  See\r                      \r                      Martin\r                            \r                            v. \r                               Un\r                                 ited States, 96 F.3d 853, 855-56 (7th Cir.\r\n\n1996).  We seriously  doubt that Congress would have purposed  to\r\n\nnarrow the habeas gateway in so restrictive a manner without some\r\n\nexplicit  reference to that  effect.  Last,  but not least,  this\r\n\ndrastic \r                 curtailment \r                            is \r                               largely unnecessary because the AEDPA itself\r\n\neffectively curbs frivolous  habeas litigation through limits  on\r\n\nsuccessive petitions.  See 28 U.S.C.A. S 2244 (West Supp. 1997).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          We are not alone  in finding these indicia  persuasive.\r\n\n    the circuits that  have addressed this question to date  hav\r\n\n                        not apply to habeas petitions.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          On April 24, 1996   over a month after Martin filed his\r\n\npetition    the  President  signed the  AEDPA into  law,  thereby\r\n\naltering \r                  the \r                      legal framework which governs federal judicial review\r\n\nof habeas corpus applications.  See Pub. L. No. 104-132, tit.  I,\r\n\n110 \r             Stat. \r                   1216 (1996).  The Supreme Court has now decided that the\r\n\nAEDPA \r               does \r                    not apply to habeas petitions which were pending at the\r\n\ntime the new law took effect.

THE MERITS\r\n\n          Refined \r                           to \r                              bare essence, the petitioner's constitutional\r\n\nclaim is  that his Sixth  Amendment right to  a public trial  was\r\n\noffended by the exclusion of his mother from the courtroom during\r\n\nRose's reopened testimony.\r\n\n                               A.\r\n\n          This  claim   rests  primarily   on  the   petitioner's\r\n\ninterpretation of  Waller v.  Georgia, 467  U.S. 39  (1984).   In\r\n\nWaller,\r                 \r                 the \r                     Supreme Court set forth a quadripartite test that must\r\n\nbe passed to justify closing a courtroom in a criminal case:\r\n\n          [T]he party seeking to close the hearing must\r\n          advance an overriding interest that is likely\r\n          to  be prejudiced,  the  closure must  be  no\r\n          broader  than   necessary  to  protect   that\r\n          interest,  the  trial  court  must   consider\r\n          reasonable  alternatives   to   closing   the\r\n\nprovisions \r                    of the AEDPA applied to habeas petitions pending on its\r\neffective  date) with  Jeffries v.  Wood, No.  95-99003, 1997  WL\r\n253326, at *11 (9th Cir. May  12, 1997) (en banc) and Burkett  v.\r\nLove, 89 F.3d 135, 138 (3d  Cir. 1996) and Edens v. Hannigan,  87\r\nF.3d \r              1109, \r                    1112 \r                        n.1 \r                            (10th Cir. 1996) (all holding to the contrary).\r\nWe had  chosen the former  path in an  earlier iteration of  this\r\nopinion.  Because Martin's case was still pending before us on  a\r\npetition for rehearing  when Lindh was  decided, we withdrew  our\r\nearlier opinion and now reevaluate Martin's claims under the pre-\r\nAEDPA standard.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n          proceeding, \r                               and it must make findings adequate\r\n          to support the closure.\r\n\nId.\r             \r             at \r                48. \r                    \r                    The \r                        petitioner does not challenge the judge's authority\r\n\nto exclude  from  the  courtroom those  whose  presence  actually\r\n\nintimidates \r                     a witness.  Rather, emphasizing Waller's second prong,\r\n\nhe posits  that the  exclusion  of his  mother was  broader  than\r\n\nnecessary to  protect  the overriding  interest of  ensuring  the\r\n\nintegrity of the ongoing trial.\r\n\n          We \r                      do \r                         not \r                             agree.  Nothing in Waller or in any other case\r\n\ncited \r               by \r                  the \r                     petitioner \r                                suggests that a trial judge, presented with\r\n\nevidence of repeated attempts at witness intimidation and a  live\r\n\nwitness  who  harbors  a  plausible  fear  of  testifying  before\r\n\nspectators known and unknown to her, must undertake an assessment\r\n\nof the  exact  level of  affrightment  created by  each  specific\r\n\nspectator, one by one, before closing a courtroom to the public.4\r\n\nRose \r              already \r                      had \r                         been \r                              frightened and intimidated by the petitioner,\r\n\nthe  petitioner's brother,  the petitioner's  girlfriend, and  an\r\n\nunidentified woman.  The trial court's closure order was  neither\r\n\nbroader  nor longer  than was  reasonably necessary  to end  this\r\n\n  \r            \r             \r              \r              4\r               On \r                  direct review, the Massachusetts Appeals Court summarized\r\nthe matter as follows:\r\n\n          While \r                         we \r                            think the judge should have expressly\r\n          rather than implicitly determined whether the\r\n          witness would have had difficulty  testifying\r\n          with the defendant's  mother present, it  was\r\n          not \r                       constitutional error requiring a new trial\r\n          not to do so in the particular  circumstances\r\n          of \r                      recent \r                             intimidation by other family members\r\n          and persons sympathetic to the defendant.\r\n\nMartin, 653 N.E.2d  at 606.   We believe that  this is a  correct\r\nsynthesis of applicable constitutional principles.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nwidespread reign of harassment and secure the witness's  accurate\r\n\ntestimony.\r\n\n          Our judgment that the trial court's closure order  does\r\n\nnot run  afoul of  Waller is buttressed  by the Second  Circuit's\r\n\ndecision \r                  in \r                     W\r                      oods v. Kuhlmann, 977 F.2d 74, 78 (2d Cir. 1992).  In\r\n\nWoods, a prosecutor informed the judge that one or two members of\r\n\nthe  defendant's family had  visited a witness  at her house  and\r\n\nwarned her not to testify, and the judge then excluded all family\r\n\nmembers from the  courtroom during the witness's testimony.   The\r\n\nWoods\r               \r               defendant \r                        argued, \r                                as does the petitioner here, that the trial\r\n\ncourt's order swept too  broadly.  The court of appeals  rejected\r\n\nthis argument, concurring with the trial judge that \"the  closure\r\n\norder \r               was \r                   no \r                      broader than was necessary to enable [the witness] to\r\n\ntestify\" and that a narrower closure would have been ineffective.\r\n\nId.\r             \r             at \r                77. \r                     \r                    In \r                       short, \r                              Woo\r                                 ds strongly supports the result reached by\r\n\nthe district court in this case.\r\n\n                               B.\r\n\n          The petitioner  has one  last string  to his  bow.   He\r\n\ninsists that we should consider the exclusion of his mother  from\r\n\nthe \r             courtroom under a \"heightened\" standard which presumably would\r\n\nbe applicable  whenever a court excluded  a family member from  a\r\n\ncriminal \r                  defendant's \r                             trial.  The short, entirely dispositive answer\r\n\nto this  plaint is that  the Supreme Court  opinion on which  the\r\n\npetitioner relies,  In re Oliver, 333  U.S. 257 (1948), does  not\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\ncontain any  such requirement.5  Nothing  in Oliver or, for  that\r\n\nmatter, \r                 in \r                    Vidal\r                         \r                         v. \r                            Willi\r                                 ams, 31 F.3d 67, 69 (2d Cir. 1994) (noting\r\n\n\"a \r            special \r                    concern \r                           for \r                               assuring the attendance of family members of\r\n\nthe  accused\"), suggests that  a trial court  need go beyond  the\r\n\nalready  stringent  requirements  of  Waller  before  removing  a\r\n\ndefendant's \r                     family members from the courtroom.  Those requirements\r\n\n  \r           including \r                     the existence of an overriding interest that is likely\r\n\nto be prejudiced in the  absence of closure and that the  closure\r\n\nmust be no more expansive than necessary to protect that interest\r\n\n  adequately  safeguard a defendant's interest in permitting  his\r\n\nfamily to be present in the courtroom.\r\n\n          In \r                      sum, \r                           we \r                              not only reject the petitioner's assertion of\r\n\na \r           heightened \r                      standard for the exclusion of family members from the\r\n\ncourtroom, but we also note the exquisite irony of Martin raising\r\n\nthe argument where, as here, his relatives played prominent roles\r\n\nin  menacing  a witness.    On  these peculiar  facts,  it  seems\r\n\nespecially reasonable for the trial court to have concluded  that\r\n\nthe \r             witness's founded fears would only be quelled if the courtroom\r\n\nwere cleared  of  spectators associated  with those  persons  who\r\n\nalready had threatened her.\r\n\nVII.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We \r                      need \r                           go \r                              no further.  Since the PLRA does not apply in\r\n\nthe habeas context, Martin's application was properly before  the\r\n\n      5Oliver  dealt with an entirely  secret trial in which  the\r\ndefendant was denied both counsel and proper notice.  See Oliver,\r\n333 \r             U.S. \r                  at \r                     258-59.  It is altogether dissimilar to this case, and\r\ncannot \r                begin \r                      to \r                        bear \r                             the \r                                 load that the petitioner so casually piles\r\nupon it.\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\ndistrict court notwithstanding  his failure to pay a filing  fee.\r\n\nAccordingly, \r                      we reach the merits.  Once there, however, we discern\r\n\nno constitutional error  in the state  trial court's decision  to\r\n\nclose the courtroom during the testimony of Linda Rose.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r\n\n                               12\r\n",

Once that expedition  is finished, we address  the\r\n\nmerits of Martin's claim.  In the end, we affirm the judgment  of\r\n\nthe district court.\r\n\nI.

See\r\n\nMass. Gen.  Laws ch. 266, S 18 (1990).  Later that year, a  petit\r\n\njury \r              found \r                    the petitioner guilty as charged, and the court imposed\r\n\na substantial prison sentence.   Martin's subsequent attempts  to\r\n\ngain surcease in the  state court system proved unavailing.   See\r\n\nCommonwealth v.

He premised  the\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\napplication on  a claim that the  trial court's exclusion of  his\r\n\nmother from the courtroom during  part of the testimony of a  key\r\n\nprosecution \r                     witness deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to a\r\n\npublic trial.   The district  court, without much  in the way  of\r\n\nindependent \r                     elaboration, turned a deaf ear and thereafter denied a\r\n\ncertificate  of  probable  cause.    We  nonetheless  granted   a\r\n\ncertificate of appealability.  See 28 U.S.C.A. S 2253(c)(1) (West\r\n\nSupp. 1997).\r\n\nII.  THE COURSE OF TRIAL\r\n\n          To understand the petitioner's claim, we must  rehearse\r\n\nhis trial  in the  Barnstable Superior Court.   We  offer only  a\r\n\nsynopsis, confident  that the reader  who thirsts for  additional\r\n\ndetail can find it elsewhere.  See Martin, 653 N.E.2d at 604-06.\r\n\n          The \r                       Commonwealth alleged that Martin and Niles Hinckley,\r\n\nhis half-brother, broke into the office of the Yarmouth town dump\r\n\nand \r             stole \r                   a \r                     safe.  After removing the safe from the building, they\r\n\ntold \r              a \r                friend, Thomas Violette, that they needed help to transport\r\n\n\"something \r                    big.\" \r                          \r                          Violette obliged.  As the three men left the dump\r\n\nin Hinckley's car, with  the safe aboard, they came across  Linda\r\n\nRose, \r               whose \r                    automobile \r                               had failed her.  She joined them.  The group\r\n\nproceeded to Rose's home.   Once there, the men dragged the  safe\r\n\ninto the house and tried to open it.  Unsettled by this endeavor,\r\n\nRose \r              departed with her children.  Violette also grew anxious about\r\n\nhis involvement; he left the premises a few minutes after  Martin\r\n\nand Hinckley began working on the safe, pondered his predicament,\r\n\nand  then made  a beeline  for  the police.   The  culprits  were\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\napprehended and charged in short order.\r\n\n          Martin  and  Hinckley   were  tried   together.     The\r\n\nCommonwealth called Rose as a witness in its case in chief.   She\r\n\nstated repeatedly that she did  not see (or, at least, could  not\r\n\nrecall) much of what  had transpired on the evening in  question.\r\n\nThe \r             prosecutor told the judge at sidebar that Rose was nervous and\r\n\nscared and  suggested that her  professed lapses  of memory  were\r\n\ndisingenuous.  The trial adjourned in the midst of Rose's  cross-\r\n\nexamination.\r\n\n          On the  next trial day,  the prosecutor voiced  concern\r\n\nabout \r               possible witness intimidation and the judge conducted a voir\r\n\ndire outside the presence  of the jury.  During that  proceeding,\r\n\nRose \r              admitted \r                      that \r                           portions of her previous testimony had been less\r\n\nthan truthful.  She also  stated that she had been frightened  by\r\n\nJames \r               Martin \r                      (the petitioner's brother, who, she said, had pointed\r\n\nat her  from the  back  of the  courtroom), by  the  petitioner's\r\n\ngirlfriend, \r                     and by an unidentified woman (who, she said, had given\r\n\nher \r             dirty \r                  looks, \r                         \"scaring [her] from testifying\").  Rose went on to\r\n\nrecount \r                 that \r                     the \r                         petitioner's girlfriend had signalled her to \"come\r\n\nover and talk\" outside the courtroom; that the petitioner himself\r\n\nhad accosted her shortly  after his arrest and instructed her  to\r\n\ntestify (falsely) that Hinckley had acted alone in  expropriating\r\n\nthe  safe; and  that, on  another occasion,  the Martin  brothers\r\n\nordered her to deny the petitioner's role in the burglary.\r\n\n          Based \r                         on \r                            Rose's statements, the court determined that it\r\n\nwas \r             \"in \r                 the \r                     interest of justice that the Commonwealth be permitted\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nto reopen and redirect  on Miss Rose.\"   In so ruling, the  judge\r\n\nwitnesses (including Rose) and that the petitioner had been found\r\n\n uilty \r                of \r                   intimidating Rose.  The judge then ordered the courtroom\r\n\nc\r          noted \r               that \r                    James Martin already had pleaded guilty to intimidating\r          glosed \r                during \r                      the \r                          remainder of Rose's testimony and refused to make\r\n\nan exception for  the petitioner's mother.1  During her  reopened\r\n\ntestimony, Rose described the petitioner's attempts to intimidate\r\n\nher, \r              but \r                 her \r                     recollection of the evening in question did not differ\r\n\nmaterially from her original testimony.\r\n\nIII.  THE PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT\r\n\n          We begin with the PLRA, Pub. L. No. 104-134, tit. VIII,\r\n\n110 \r             Stat. \r                   1321, 1366 (1996), which, among other things, amended 28\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1915 to require convicts  to pay the full amount of  the\r\n\nfiling \r                fees \r                     in civil actions.  See PLRA, S 804, 110 Stat. at 1373-\r\n\n1375.  The petitioner  did not pay a  filing fee to the  district\r\n\ncourt  and  has not  paid  any  other fees  associated  with  the\r\n\nmaintenance \r                     of his suit.2  Thus, the threshold question is whether\r\n\nthe PLRA applies to habeas petitions brought in federal court  by\r\n\nstate prisoners.\r\n\n          Though \r                          habeas proceedings are technically civil actions,\r\n\nsee\r             \r             Ex \r                parte \r                      Tom Tong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90890\"><a href=\"/opinion/90890/ex-parte-tom-tong/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559 (1883), the Supreme Court\r\n\nhas long recognized that the label is ill-fitting and that habeas\r\n\n     1Although the closure order exempted the press,  there is no\r\nevidence \r                  in \r                     the \r                        record \r                               that any reporters were in attendance during\r\nRose's reopened testimony.  See Martin, 653 N.E.2d at 605.\r\n\n       2The  petitioner did  file a  motion to  proceed in  forma\r\npauperis,  and although  the district  court did  not grant  that\r\nmotion, he appears eligible for such a dispensation.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nis \r            in \r               fact \r                   a \r                     unique \r                            creature of the law.

Rather, emphasizing Waller's second prong,\r\n\nhe posits  that the  exclusion  of his  mother was  broader  than\r\n\nnecessary to  protect  the overriding  interest of  ensuring  the\r\n\nintegrity of the ongoing trial.\r\n\n          We \r                      do \r                         not \r                             agree.

In\r\n\nWoods, a prosecutor informed the judge that one or two members of\r\n\nthe  defendant's family had  visited a witness  at her house  and\r\n\nwarned her not to testify, and the judge then excluded all family\r\n\nmembers from the  courtroom during the witness's testimony.

Those requirements\r\n\n  \r           including \r                     the existence of an overriding interest that is likely\r\n\nto be prejudiced in the  absence of closure and that the  closure\r\n\nmust be no more expansive than necessary to protect that interest\r\n\n  adequately  safeguard a defendant's interest in permitting  his\r\n\nfamily to be present in the courtroom.\r\n\n          In \r                      sum, \r                           we \r                              not only reject the petitioner's assertion of\r\n\na \r           heightened \r                      standard for the exclusion of family members from the\r\n\ncourtroom, but we also note the exquisite irony of Martin raising\r\n\nthe argument where, as here, his relatives played prominent roles\r\n\nin  menacing  a witness.    On  these peculiar  facts,  it  seems\r\n\nespecially reasonable for the trial court to have concluded  that\r\n\nthe \r             witness's founded fears would only be quelled if the courtroom\r\n\nwere cleared  of  spectators associated  with those  persons  who\r\n\nalready had threatened her.\r\n\nVII.

Since the PLRA does not apply in\r\n\nthe habeas context, Martin's application was properly before  the\r\n\n      5Oliver  dealt with an entirely  secret trial in which  the\r\ndefendant was denied both counsel and proper notice.

It is altogether dissimilar to this case, and\r\ncannot \r                begin \r                      to \r                        bear \r                             the \r                                 load that the petitioner so casually piles\r\nupon it.\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\ndistrict court notwithstanding  his failure to pay a filing  fee.\r\n\nAccordingly, \r                      we reach the merits.  Once there, however, we discern\r\n\nno constitutional error  in the state  trial court's decision  to\r\n\nclose the courtroom during the testimony of Linda Rose.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r\n\n                               12\r\n</pre>",
