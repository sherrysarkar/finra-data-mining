Quirs Lpez, John Q.\r\nKelly, and Kelly &amp; Campo LLP were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\nApril 1, 1999\r\n\n*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.  SELYA, Circuit Judge.  On September 15, 1995, a tragedy\r\noccurred at a three-story beach house in Santurce, Puerto Rico,\r\nowned by Esther Feliciano Romn (Feliciano).  Because a hurricane\r\nhad been forecasted, a gaggle of relatives, neighbors, friends, and\r\nacquaintances had been assisting in securing the beach house.  The\r\nproperty itself comprised two stories operated by On The Beach,\r\nInc. (OTB) as the \"Numero Uno Guest House,\" and a third floor that\r\nserved as a private residence for Feliciano (who was OTB's\r\npresident) and her husband, Chris Laube.\r\nJorge Alberto Leyva, variously described as a good friend\r\nof Laube and an employee or prospective employee of OTB, was one of\r\nthose who participated in the pre-hurricane preparations.  In the\r\ncourse of this activity, Leyva fell from a third-floor terrace. \r\nFive days later, he died from injuries sustained in the fall.\r\nInvoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1332(a),\r\nLeyva's family   all of whom were domiciled in Florida   brought a\r\nwrongful death action in the federal district court against OTB,\r\nFeliciano, and Laube.  The complaint attributed Leyva's demise to\r\na dangerous condition on the third-floor terrace (principally, the\r\nabsence of a railing at one spot) and asserted two main theories of\r\nliability against the several defendants.  First, the plaintiffs\r\nalleged in substance that the decedent had been an employee of the\r\ndefendants when injured, and that the defendants had breached a\r\nduty \"to provide [him] a safe workplace.\"  Alternatively, the\r\nplaintiffs alleged in substance that Feliciano and/or Laube were\r\nliable because they failed to maintain their premises in a\r\nreasonably safe condition and allowed (or, indeed, requested) the\r\ndecedent to \"perform an inherently dangerous task\" thereon.\r\nOTB and Feliciano (in her capacity as an officer,\r\ndirector, and shareholder of OTB) moved for partial summary\r\njudgment on the ground that, contrary to the plaintiffs'\r\nallegations, the decedent had not been employed by OTB on the date\r\nof the accident.  Their motion addressed only the first of the\r\nplaintiffs' two theories.  It in no way sought brevis disposition\r\non the second theory, that is, on the claims asserted against Laube\r\nor against Feliciano in her individual capacity.  In a preliminary\r\nmargin order dated August 7, 1997, the district court acknowledged\r\nas much; the court wrote:  \"This motion only seeks to dismiss the\r\ncause of action against the corporation and the cause of action\r\nagainst E. Feliciano in her corporate capacity.\"  The margin\r\nnotation went on to pledge that \"[t]he court will address the\r\nmotion accordingly.\"\r\nThe plaintiffs opposed the defendants' motion for partial\r\nsummary judgment, and the court eventually took it under\r\nadvisement.  On July 7, 1998, the court reneged on its earlier\r\npledge; in a comprehensive opinion, it not only granted partial\r\nsummary judgment as requested in the motion papers but also entered\r\njudgment against the plaintiffs on all remaining claims.  SeeLeyva v. On The Beach, Inc., Civ. No. 96-2116 (JAF), slip op. (July\r\n7, 1998) (unpublished).  The plaintiffs do not challenge the entry\r\nof summary judgment in favor of OTB and Feliciano in her corporate\r\ncapacity, but, rather, restrict their appeal to the court's\r\ntreatment of the individual liability claims.\r\nWe need not linger long.  To be sure, district courts\r\npossess the power to grant summary judgments on their own\r\ninitiative.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326\r\n(1986); Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  But unbesought summary judgments can prove problematic\r\nin the absence of proper procedural protections.  To alleviate\r\ndifficulties of this sort, we have counseled caution in the use of\r\nthat technique.  See, e.g., Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-Marquez,\r\n878 F.2d 1555, 1561 (1st Cir. 1989) (warning, in regard to suasponte summary judgments, that \"unnecessary haste frequently\r\nresults in more leisurely repentance\").  Moreover, we have placed\r\ntwo constraints on a district court's authority to grant summary\r\njudgment sua sponte:\r\nFirst, a district court ordinarily may order\r\nsummary judgment on its own initiative only\r\nwhen discovery is sufficiently advanced that\r\nthe parties have enjoyed a reasonable\r\nopportunity to glean the material facts. \r\nSecond, the court may enter summary judgment\r\nsua sponte only if it first gives the targeted\r\nparty appropriate notice and a chance to\r\npresent its evidence on the essential elements\r\nof the claim or defense.\r\n\nBerkovitz, 89 F.3d at 29 (citations omitted); accord Stella v. Town\r\nof Tewksbury, 4 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nIn the instant case, the parties disagree about the\r\nstatus of pretrial discovery at the time the district court acted,\r\nand, thus, it is unclear whether the first condition precedent to\r\na sua sponte summary judgment was met.  We may skirt that\r\nimbroglio, however, for both of the Berkovitz conditions ordinarily\r\nmust be fulfilled in order for a sua sponte summary judgment to\r\nwithstand scrutiny   and in this case, the second condition was\r\nnever satisfied.\r\nIn the context of a sua sponte summary judgment, \"notice\"\r\nmeans that the targeted party \"had reason to believe the court\r\nmight reach the issue and received a fair opportunity to put its\r\nbest foot forward.\"  Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561.  The court\r\nbelow gave no such notice.  Prior to making the spontaneous ruling,\r\nit never informed the plaintiffs that it was considering a judgment\r\nthat would extirpate their claims against Laube and/or Feliciano in\r\nher individual capacity.  By the same token, it never invited the\r\nplaintiffs to assemble and proffer their best evidence in\r\nconnection with those claims.  To the contrary, the court's margin\r\norder, inscribed well before it ruled on the defendants' motion,\r\nstated in no uncertain terms that its decision would conform to the\r\nlimited scope of the motion.  When a court announces that it will\r\nfollow a procedural course, the parties are entitled to rely on\r\nthat announcement unless and until the court signals an impending\r\nchange and affords a reasonable opportunity to regroup.  SeeBerkovitz, 89 F.3d at 30; Stella, 4 F.3d at 55-56.  The court's\r\nfailure to adhere to these guidelines requires vacation of the\r\nchallenged portion of the judgment below.\r\nThe defendants' principal rejoinder is that notice would\r\nhave been a futile exercise because the plaintiffs have no case: \r\nthe accident was unforeseeable, and pretrial discovery has\r\nunearthed nothing that would show negligence on Feliciano's or\r\nLaube's part.  That may well be true.  From the pleadings and the\r\nbriefs, the plaintiffs' case appears to be an uphill climb.  But\r\ncourts contemplating the entry of summary judgment cannot simply\r\npresume that plaintiffs will lose difficult cases and act\r\naccordingly.  Cf. Greenburg v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth.,\r\n835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 does not ask\r\nwhich party's evidence is more plentiful, or better credentialled,\r\nor stronger.\").  When, as now, the question comes down to one of\r\nfact, a plaintiff is entitled to advance warning that the nisiprius court is considering terminating his case by means of summary\r\njudgment, a fair opportunity to marshal whatever evidence he can\r\nmuster, and a chance to put forward his assembled evidence, along\r\nwith developed legal argumentation, in an effort to persuade the\r\ntrier that a full-blown trial is warranted.  When a trial court\r\nfails to furnish such notice and pretermits the plaintiff's\r\npresentation, it would be unseemly for an appellate court to\r\nrequire the plaintiff to go outside the record and make an\r\naffirmative showing that his claim is viable.  In all but the most\r\nunusual cases, the record underlying that sort of fact-intensive\r\nanalysis must first be constructed in the district court.\r\nWe need go no further.  Because the lower court did not\r\nafford the plaintiffs adequate notice and a suitable opportunity to\r\nbe heard before it exceeded the scope of the motion that was\r\npending before it, we vacate so much of the court's order as\r\npurports to enter judgment in favor of Laube, Feliciano in her\r\nindividual capacity, and their respective insurers, see supra note\r\n1.  We do not foreclose the possibility of summary judgment should\r\nthe defendants so move, nor do we take any view as to the likely\r\noutcome of the case upon further proceedings below.\r\n\nVacated in part and remanded.  Costs to appellants.\n",

The plaintiffs do not challenge the entry of summary judgment in favor of OTB and Feliciano in her corporate capacity, but, rather, restrict their appeal to the court's treatment of the individual liability claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long.  To be sure, district courts possess the power to grant summary judgments on their own initiative.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 326, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But unbesought summary judgments can prove problematic in the absence of proper procedural protections.  To alleviate difficulties of this sort, we have counseled caution in the use of that technique.  See, e.g., Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-Marquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526040\"><a href=\"/opinion/526040/jardines-bacata-limited-v-aniceto-diaz-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span>, 1561 (1st Cir.1989) (warning, in regard to sua sponte summary judgments, that \"unnecessary haste frequently results in more leisurely repentance\").  Moreover, we have placed two constraints on a district court's authority to grant summary judgment sua sponte:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>First, a district court ordinarily may order summary judgment on its own initiative only when discovery is sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.  Second, the court may enter summary judgment sua sponte only if it first gives the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berkovitz, 89 F.3d at 29 (citations omitted);  accord Stella v. Town of Tewksbury, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194924\"><a href=\"/opinion/194924/stella-v-tewksbury-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the parties disagree about the status of pretrial discovery at the time the district court acted, and, thus, it is unclear whether the first condition precedent to a sua sponte summary judgment was met.  We may skirt that imbroglio, however, for both of the Berkovitz conditions ordinarily must be fulfilled in order for a sua sponte summary judgment to withstand scrutiny--and in this case, the second condition was never satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of a sua sponte summary judgment, \"notice\" means that the targeted party \"had reason to believe the court might reach the issue and received a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward.\"  Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561.   The court below gave no such notice.  Prior to making the spontaneous ruling, it never informed the plaintiffs that it was considering a judgment that would extirpate their claims against Laube and/or Feliciano in her individual capacity.  By the same token, it never invited the plaintiffs to assemble and proffer their best evidence in connection with those claims.  To the contrary, the court's margin order, inscribed well before it ruled on the defendants' motion, stated in no uncertain terms that its decision would conform to the limited scope of the motion.  When a court announces that it will follow a procedural course, the parties are entitled to rely on that announcement unless and until the court signals an impending change and affords a reasonable opportunity to regroup.  See Berkovitz, 89 F.3d at 30;  Stella, 4 F.3d at 55-56.   The court's failure to adhere to these guidelines requires vacation of the challenged portion of the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' principal rejoinder is that notice would have been a futile exercise because the plaintiffs have no case:  the accident was unforeseeable, and pretrial discovery has unearthed nothing that would show negligence on Feliciano's or Laube's part.  That may well be true.  From the pleadings and the briefs, the plaintiffs' case appears to be an uphill climb.  But courts contemplating the entry of summary judgment cannot simply presume that plaintiffs will lose difficult cases and act accordingly.  Cf. Greenburg v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499045\"><a href=\"/opinion/499045/laurence-b-greenburg-etc-v-puerto-rico-maritime-shipping-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 936 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 does not ask which party's evidence is more plentiful, or better credentialed, or stronger.\").  When, as now, the question comes down to one of fact, a plaintiff is entitled to advance warning that the nisi prius court is considering terminating his case by means of summary judgment, a fair opportunity to marshal whatever evidence he can muster, and a chance to put forward his assembled evidence, along with developed legal argumentation, in an effort to persuade the trier that a full-blown trial is warranted.  When a trial court fails to furnish such notice and pretermits the plaintiff's presentation, it would be unseemly for an appellate court to require the plaintiff to go outside the record and make an affirmative showing that his claim is viable.  In all but the most unusual cases, the record underlying that sort of fact-intensive analysis must first be constructed in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Because the lower court did not afford the plaintiffs adequate notice and a suitable opportunity to be heard before it exceeded the scope of the motion that was pending before it, we vacate so much of the court's order as purports to enter judgment in favor of Laube, Feliciano in her individual capacity, and their respective insurers, see supra note 1. We do not foreclose the possibility of summary judgment should the defendants so move, nor do we take any view as to the likely outcome of the case upon further proceedings below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated in part and remanded.
