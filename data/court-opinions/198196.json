ROBINSON, SR.,\r\n                   AS TRUSTEE OF THE ESOP,\r\n\n                   Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n     CONVERSE STEEL FABRICATORS &amp; ERECTORS, INC., ET AL.,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\r\n                                         \r\n\n                   JACK E. ROBINSON, ESQ.,\r\n\n                          Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n         [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Jack E. Robinson and Carpenter &amp; Robinson on brief for\r\nappellants.\r\n\nNovember 6, 1998\r\n\n   Per Curiam.  This appeal is from the district court's refusal\r\nto revoke certain oral findings that were critical of the\r\nperformance of appellant Jack E. Robinson, Jr. (\"Robinson\"), as\r\ncorporate counsel for Converse Construction Company, Inc\r\n(\"Converse\").  The court made its findings during a hearing on May\r\n30, 1997.  The case was dismissed, at the request of the parties,\r\nin a judgment dated April 6, 1998.  The district court declined the\r\nparties' request that the judgment revoke all findings relating to\r\nthe conduct of individuals involved in the case.  The court also\r\ndenied appellants' motion to amend the judgment to include\r\nrevocation of the oral findings.  Specifically, appellants sought\r\nreversal and withdrawal of the district court's finding that\r\nRobinson had been negligent in the discharge of his duties to\r\nConverse.\r\n   \"[I]t is an abecedarian rule that federal appellate courts\r\nreview decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees   not opinions,\r\nfactual findings, reasoning or explanations.\" In re Williams, Nos.\r\n97-2437 and 97-2438, slip op. at 9 (1st Cir. Sept. 11, 1998).  As\r\nwe recently ruled in In re Williams, \"a jurist's derogatory\r\ncomments about a lawyer's conduct, without more, do not constitute\r\na sanction\" and words not expressly identified as a reprimand\r\nprovide no independent basis for an appeal.  Id. at 16-17.\r\n   Appellants argue that the findings in this case did not stand\r\nalone, but instead were made in support of a sanction: the referral\r\nof Robinson's conduct to the Board of Bar Overseers (\"BBO\"). \r\nBecause  we disagree  with  appellants'  characterization of  the \r\n                             -2-\r\nreferral as a \"sanction,\" however, we conclude that neither the\r\nreferral nor the underlying findings are appealable.\r\n   The district court's referral of Robinson's misconduct to the\r\nBBO was not itself a sanction.  Instead, according to the district\r\ncourt, it was merely the first step in a process to investigate the\r\nmisconduct for the purpose of determining \"what sanctions, if any\"\r\nought to be imposed.  The court's directive contemplated that at\r\nsome future time it (or the BBO) might impose a sanction upon\r\nRobinson.  If and when such a sanction is imposed by the district\r\ncourt, Robinson presumably would be entitled to appeal therefrom.\r\nSee Landscape Props., Inc. v. Whisenhunt, 127 F.3d 678, 685 (8th\r\nCir. 1997) (ruling that referral of Rule 11 violation to other\r\njudges in the district to determine whether any disciplinary\r\nactions should be taken against attorney \"was not itself a\r\nsanction\" and noting that if referral is subject to review by\r\ncourt, \"the proper occasion to do so would be in an appeal from any\r\nfurther disciplinary action those judges might take against\r\nappellant\"). We agree with the Eighth Circuit that,\"[a]t this\r\npoint,...that issue is wholly conjectural and academic.\"   Id.\r\n     Appellants' concern that, unchallenged, the district court's\r\nnegligence finding could have preclusive effect in a subsequent\r\nmalpractice action against Robinson by Converse is unfounded. \r\nIssue preclusion \"bars relitigation of any factual or legal issue\r\nthat was actually decided in previous litigation 'between the\r\nparties, whether on the same or a different claim.'\" Grella v.\r\nSalem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1994).  As\r\nappellants maintain (and the district court found), Robinson was\r\nnot a party to the suit at the time that the district court made\r\nthe contested finding.  This is a sufficient answer to the concern\r\nwithout considering other possible objections to preclusion in this\r\nand like cases. See  United States v. Brekke, 97 F.3d 1043, 1049\r\n(8th Cir. 1996); Bell v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 85 F.3d 1451,\r\n1456 (10th Cir. 1996); Amwest Mortgage Corp. v. Grady, 925 F.2d\r\n1162 (9th Cir. 1991).\r\n     We need go no further.  The appeal is dismissed for want of\r\nappellate jurisdiction.  \r\n",
