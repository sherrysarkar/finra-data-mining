  "plain_text": "            United States Court of Appeals\r\n                For the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 97-2251\r\n\n                     UNITED STATES,\r\n\n                       Appellee,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n                     MARLA BARNES,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n      [Hon. Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nStephen B. Hrones with whom Hrones &amp; Garrity was on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n\nJennifer H. Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 27, 1998\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  Marla Barnes appeals from\r\nher conviction for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the United\r\nStates and criminal forfeiture of $2,900 in drug proceeds.  Her\r\nappeal presents a single question:  whether she was tried within\r\nthe 70-day time limit imposed by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.\r\n3161 (1985).\r\nOn the first day of trial, Barnes moved to dismiss the\r\nindictment, alleging that her right to a speedy trial had been\r\nviolated.  The district court denied the motion, and Barnes was\r\nsubsequently tried and convicted on both counts.  For the reasons\r\nthat follow, we conclude that the trial court erred when it denied\r\ndefendant's motion to dismiss.  In this case, the court failed to\r\npolice the speedy trial clock vigilantly during a crucial 5-month\r\nperiod beginning in the fall of 1996 when the trial date was\r\ninexplicably adjourned.  As a result, the 70-day limit was exceeded\r\nby some 121 days.  We find, however, that the seriousness of the\r\noffenses with which defendant was charged, the absence of any\r\nactual prejudice to her, and defendant's own failure to promptly\r\nassert her speedy trial rights warrant dismissal of the indictment\r\nwithout prejudice.  \r\n                      BACKGROUND\r\nWe begin by recounting the path Barnes's case took below. \r\nOn August 10, 1995, a complaint was issued in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Barnes\r\nand her brother Reynaldo Barnes with conspiracy to import cocaine\r\ninto the United States from Panama.  Federal law enforcement\r\nagents arrested Barnes on August 11, 1995 in Brooklyn, New York,\r\npursuant to a warrant issued by the United States District Court\r\nfor the District of Massachusetts.  She appeared before a\r\nmagistrate judge in the Eastern District of New York that same day. \r\nAn order was entered 3 days later removing Barnes to the District\r\nof Massachusetts. \r\nOn August 23, 1995, a federal grand jury returned a two-\r\ncount indictment against Barnes and her brother, charging them with\r\nconspiracy to import cocaine under 21 U.S.C.  963 (1998) and with\r\ncriminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C.  853 (1998).  \r\nBarnes's first appearance before a judicial officer in\r\nMassachusetts took place on September 25, 1995 before United States\r\nMagistrate Judge Joyce L. Alexander.  A briefing schedule for\r\npretrial motions was set at this conference: all motions were to be\r\nfiled by October 3, 1995. \r\nOn September 27, 1995, Reynaldo Barnes filed a motion\r\nseeking additional time to file pretrial motions up to and\r\nincluding October 13, 1995.  This motion was granted.\r\nBarnes was arraigned on October 3, 1995; she entered a\r\nplea of not guilty to both counts.  At defendant's request,\r\nMagistrate Judge Alexander extended the time to file pretrial\r\nmotions to October 20.  \r\nOn October 20, 1995, defendants filed a flurry of\r\npretrial motions seeking, inter alia, a bill of particulars,\r\nvarious discovery items, and Jencks Act material.  Magistrate Judge\r\nAlexander held a hearing on these motions on November 30, 1995,\r\nafter which she took the matters under advisement, and eventually\r\ndisposed of all motions on December 14, 1995.  An order of\r\nexcludable delay was thereafter entered, excluding the period of\r\ntime from October 20 to December 14, 1995.\r\nThere was no formal activity in the case until\r\nJanuary 24, 1996, when the government formally moved the court to\r\nschedule a status conference to \"enable the Court and parties to\r\nestablish a firm date for trial, facilitate the identification and\r\nresolution of any anticipated evidentiary issues at trial, and\r\npossibly facilitate the resolution of this case prior to trial.\" \r\nThe district court granted the motion on January 31, 1996, and\r\nscheduled a conference for February 20, 1996.  By letter dated\r\nFebruary 7, 1996, Reynaldo Barnes requested that the conference be\r\nadjourned because his counsel, William P. Homans, was to be on\r\ntrial in another case that same week.  The court granted the motion\r\non February 9, rescheduling the conference for March 4, 1996.  On\r\nMarch 4, 1996, the status conference was held, during which the\r\ncourt set a trial date of April 8, 1996.\r\nOn March 18, 1996, defendants jointly moved to continue\r\nthe trial date to June 10, 1996 and to exclude the time from the\r\ndate of the motion until the new trial date.  Defendants cited\r\nthree reasons for the request:  Mr. Homans was recovering from\r\npneumonia, defendants were engaged in ongoing plea negotiations\r\nwith the government, and a conflict had arisen in the trial\r\nschedule of Barnes's attorney, Stephen B. Hrones.  Their motion was\r\ngranted by the court on March 19, 1996. \r\nThe critical chain of events central to this appeal then\r\noccurred.  On May 30, 1996, Barnes moved the district court for \r\nanother continuance \"until sometime in late September or early\r\nOctober.\"  She explained that her counsel was engaged in another\r\ntrial on June 10.  The court granted the motion by memorandum order\r\non June 3, 1996 and continued the trial until October 7, 1996 at\r\n11:00 a.m. \r\nThe motion for a continuance was followed by defendants'\r\njoint motion to \"waive their speedy trial rights from June 10 until\r\nthe date set for the new trial in the fall of 1996.\"  The motion to\r\nwaive was granted by margin order on August 28, 1996, and the court\r\nexpressly excluded time from the Speedy Trial clock through\r\nOctober 7, 1996.  \r\nAlthough it is far from certain precisely what happened\r\nnext, the record suggests that the court set this matter down for\r\ntrial for October 7, 1996 at 11:00 a.m. and then telephonically\r\nadjourned the trial without date.  No one appeared for trial on\r\nOctober 7.  Neither defendant nor the government can explain why\r\nthe trial did not go forward.  Neither the government nor any of\r\nthe defendants apparently requested a continuance or objected to\r\nit; no one seems to remember when the trial was adjourned.  The\r\ndistrict court never explicitly excluded time from the speedy trial\r\nclock or made any findings as to why the adjournment was required\r\nin the interests of justice.  It did not issue a written order.  \r\nOn December 3, 1996, after two months had passed, the\r\nparties jointly moved the court for a status conference for the\r\npurpose of setting a trial date.  The motion included an odd\r\nstatement: \"the parties jointly move to exclude the period of delay\r\nin the interests of justice and due to continuing plea\r\nnegotiations, from the date of entry of an Order on defendant's\r\npre-trial motions until such date as this Court sets for trial.\" \r\n(Emphasis added.)  By its terms, the motion sought a retroactive\r\nand an unlimited forward-looking exclusion of time.  The motion was\r\nsigned only by the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") Heidi\r\nBrieger on behalf of both the government and Barnes.  Barnes's\r\nattorney, Mr. Hrones, did not sign the papers.  \r\nSeven days later, Barnes filed a \"Motion to Correct a\r\nJoint Motion for Status Conference\" protesting the government's\r\neffort to have time excluded by the court.  This document stated\r\nthat \"although [her] attorney authorized the Joint Motion for\r\nStatus Conference he did not give authority to [AUSA] Brieger to\r\nadd a paragraph indicating that the defendant had agreed to exclude\r\nthe period of delay.\"  Barnes indicated that she opposed any\r\nexclusion of the delay, having \"made clear for some time now to\r\n[AUSA Brieger] that [sh]e want[ed] a trial.\"  Accordingly, Barnes\r\nrequested that the court \"strike the defendant's name from her\r\nrequest to exclude the delay.\"  The government did not oppose\r\ndefendant's motion to correct.  \r\nOn March 7, 1997   some three months later   the court\r\nsent defendants and the government a notice informing them that a\r\nconference had been scheduled for March 25, 1997.  The court did\r\nnot exclude any time, either forward or backward, as requested in\r\nthe purported joint motion.\r\nTwo noteworthy events transpired at the March 25 status\r\nconference.  First, Reynaldo Barnes moved to change his plea.  The\r\nmotion was granted and a date was set for his anticipated plea of\r\nguilty.  Second, the court reset Barnes's trial date for May 5,\r\n1997.  \r\nOn April 4, 1997, the government, with defendant's\r\nconsent, filed a motion to continue the trial from May 5 to May 19,\r\n1997.  Accordingly, the district court memo endorsed the motion and\r\nrescheduled trial for May 19, 1997.   \r\nOn May 15, 1997, Reynaldo Barnes pled guilty to both\r\noffenses.  The next day, May 16, 1997, the government filed a\r\nmotion in limine seeking an order permitting the government to use\r\ntranscripts of recorded conversations between undercover agents and\r\ndefendants.  \r\nOn May 19, 1997, the first day of trial but before jury\r\nselection, Barnes moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of\r\nthe Speedy Trial Act.  The court denied the motion but made no\r\nfactual findings beyond observing that Mr. Hrones was on trial in\r\nanother case on May 5, \"the last time the case was going to be\r\nscheduled,\" and that Reynaldo Barnes's counsel, Mr. Homans, was\r\nsick for a period of time.  The court then resolved all outstanding\r\nmotions in limine and empaneled the jury. \r\nBarnes was tried and convicted on both counts, and was\r\neventually sentenced to 188 months in prison, to be followed by\r\nfive years of supervised release.  She then timely filed this\r\nappeal.\r\n                      DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Standards\r\nThe Speedy Trial Act \"commands that a defendant be tried\r\nwithin 70 days of the latest of either the filing of an indictment\r\nor information, or the first appearance before a judge or\r\nmagistrate.\"  Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 322 (1986);\r\nsee 18 U.S.C.  3161(c)(1).  The sanction for failure to adhere to\r\nthis time limit is severe   the indictment is dismissed on motion\r\nof the defendant.  See 18 U.S.C.  3162(a)(2).  In determining\r\nwhether a violation of the Act has occurred, certain \"periods of\r\ndelay shall be excluded in computing the time within which . . .\r\nthe trial . . . must commence.\"  18 U.S.C.  3161(h).   \r\nThe following are among the kinds of delays that are\r\nproperly omitted from this calculation:\r\n\n[a]ny period of delay resulting from other\r\nproceedings concerning the defendant,\r\nincluding but not limited to   \r\n\n. . . .\r\n\n(F) delay resulting from any pretrial motion,\r\nfrom the filing of the motion through the\r\nconclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\r\ndisposition of, such motion; \r\n\n. . . .\r\n\n(J) delay reasonably attributable to any\r\nperiod, not to exceed thirty days, during\r\nwhich any proceeding concerning the defendant\r\nis actually under advisement by the court. \r\n\n. . . .\r\n\n(8)(A) Any period of delay resulting from a\r\ncontinuance granted by any judge on his own\r\nmotion or at the request of the defendant or\r\nhis counsel or at the request of the attorney\r\nfor the Government, if the judge granted such\r\ncontinuance on the basis of his findings that\r\nthe ends of justice served by taking such\r\naction outweigh the best interest of the\r\npublic and the defendant in a speedy trial.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  3161(h).\r\nWe review the district court's denial of defendant's\r\nmotion to dismiss based on the Speedy Trial Act de novo.  SeeUnited States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1162 (1st Cir.), cert.denied, 56 U.S. 1032 (1995).  Barnes's motion to dismiss was denied\r\nby the court on the first day of trial without any calculation of\r\nthe Speedy Trial Act timetable.  Accordingly, on this appeal \"[w]e\r\nmust start from scratch in the computation of excludable and\r\nnonexcludable time under the Act.\"  United States v. Pringle, 751\r\nF.2d 419, 429 (1st Cir. 1984).  We do so in two steps.  First, we\r\nmust \"do the basic mathematics and determine the aggregate time\r\nelapsed awaiting trial.\"  United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 600\r\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied,   U.S.  , 117 S. Ct. 156 (1996).  Second,\r\nwe then ascertain how many days should be excluded from the total\r\ntime.  See id. \r\nWith this analytical framework in mind, we turn to\r\ncomputing the number of days that elapsed in the case at bar. \r\nII.  Application\r\nA.  When Did the Time Begin to Accrue?\r\nThe first issue to be resolved is when the speedy trial\r\nclock began to tick.  Section 3161(c)(1) requires that a defendant\r\nbe tried within 70 days of the occurrence of one of two events: \r\nthe filing of the indictment or the defendant's appearance \"before\r\na judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending,\r\nwhichever date last occurs.\"  18 U.S.C.  3161(c)(1).\r\nBarnes, relying on a separate provision of the Act that\r\ngoverns the tolling of time for unreasonable delays associated with\r\nthe transfer of defendants, argues that any amount of time above\r\nand beyond the 10 days between the entry of the order compelling\r\nher removal from New York and her actual arrival in Massachusetts\r\nshould count toward the 70-day limit.  Section 3161(h)(1)(H)\r\nprovides that any unreasonable delay resulting from the transfer of\r\na defendant is excludable, and mandates that any such delay in\r\nexcess of ten days from the date of the order directing\r\ntransportation and \"the defendant's arrival at the destination\" be\r\npresumed unreasonable. \r\nBarnes's reliance on this provision to start the speedy\r\ntrial clock is misplaced.  It is a tolling provision, not one that\r\nsets forth the events that trigger the start of the 70-day period\r\nin which a trial must be held.  The pre-indictment or pre-\r\nappearance transfer of a defendant is not explicitly listed as one\r\nof the only two triggering events in section 3161(c)(1), and we\r\ndecline to read into that provision what was not expressly included\r\nby Congress.  Accordingly, while delay resulting from such a\r\ntransfer may count toward the 30-day arrest-to-indictment period,\r\nsee 18 U.S.C.  3161(b), it does not start the 70-day speedy trial\r\nclock.  The delay resulting from the transfer of Barnes from New\r\nYork to Massachusetts thus took place well before the clock even\r\nbegan to run. \r\nApplying the terms of the Act, we conclude that time on\r\nBarnes's speedy trial clock began to accrue on September 26, 1995,\r\nthe day after her first appearance before a magistrate judge in the\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts.  The date of the conference, is, of\r\ncourse, excludable as a \"proceeding concerning the defendant.\" \r\nUnited States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  The clock stopped on May 19, 1997, Barnes's first day of\r\ntrial.  A total of 601 days passed between the start of the speedy\r\ntrial clock and the date it stopped for good on May 19, 1997.  We\r\nnow evaluate which of these days are excludable and which must be\r\ncounted toward the 70-day deadline.  \r\nB.  Excludable Days\r\nWhile September 26, 1995 must be counted, the entire\r\nperiod between September 27, 1995 and December 14, 1995 must be\r\nexcluded from the final tally.  On September 27, 1995 Barnes's\r\ncodefendant moved for an extension of time to file pretrial\r\nmotions.  The motion was granted until October 13, 1995, and the\r\ndeadline was later extended again until October 20, 1995.  It is\r\nwell-settled that an exclusion of time attributable to one\r\ndefendant is applicable for all codefendants.  See id. at 19. \r\nTherefore, this time is not counted toward the 70 days.  See United\r\nStates v. Jodoin, 672 F.2d 232, 237 (1st Cir. 1982) (excluding time\r\nthat elapsed due to defendant's request for an extension of time as\r\n\"directly attributable to [his] . . . motion\").  The magistrate\r\njudge also properly excluded the period between the actual filing\r\nof the motions (October 20, 1995) and the hearing on the motions\r\n(November 13, 1995), for it falls under section 3161(h)(1)(F) as\r\n\"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the\r\nmotion through the conclusion of the hearing on, . . . such\r\nmotion.\"  Similarly, the magistrate judge correctly excluded the\r\nthirty days between November 14 and December 14 during which she\r\nhad the initial batch of pretrial motions under advisement.  See 18\r\nU.S.C.  3161(h)(1)(J).\r\nThe government concedes that the 40 days between\r\nDecember 15 and January 23, 1996 are not excludable.  We agree. \r\n     1.  Motion Requesting a Status Conference\r\nThe excludability of the next segment of time turns on\r\nwhether the government's motion to set a status conference filed on\r\nJanuary 24, 1996 is a \"pretrial motion\" within the meaning of\r\nsection 3161(h)(1)(F).  Barnes argues that such a motion does not\r\nqualify as a pretrial motion because it is not of a \"substantive\"\r\nnature.  For its part, the government insists that it is a pretrial\r\nmotion and argues that time should be excluded from the moment the\r\nmotion was filed until the date of the requested status conference.\r\nWe hold that a motion requesting the scheduling of a\r\npretrial conference is a \"pretrial motion\" so as to trigger an\r\nexclusion under the Speedy Trial Act.  Section 3161(h)(1)(F)\r\nstates, rather expansively, that delay resulting from \"any pretrial\r\nmotion\" shall be excluded.  It does not distinguish between more\r\nsignificant or complex \"pretrial motions\" and simple or routine\r\nmotions.  For this reason, we have read the term \"pretrial motion\"\r\nbroadly to encompass all manner of motions, ranging from informal\r\nrequests for laboratory reports, see United States v. Jorge, 865\r\nF.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1027 (1989), to\r\n\"implied\" requests for a new trial date, see Santiago-Becerril, 130\r\nF.3d at 17.  A motion requesting the scheduling of a status\r\nconference has undeniable \"pretrial\" significance:  all kinds of\r\nmatters affecting the course of trial, including discovery,\r\nmotions, and trial dates may be discussed at such a conference. \r\nCf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17.1 (\"[T]he court upon motion of any party or\r\nupon its own motion may order one or more conferences to consider\r\nsuch matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial.\"). \r\nThere seems to be no good reason to exclude a motion for a status\r\nconference from the universe of possible pretrial motions.  See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Bellucci, 737 F. Supp. 706, 710 (D. Mass.\r\n1990) (Tauro, D.J.) (holding that motion for status conference was\r\npretrial motion for purposes of tolling Speedy Trial Act).  Hence,\r\nin this case, the clock stopped as soon as the government filed its\r\nmotion seeking a status conference on January 24, 1996. \r\nThe next question is how much time should be tolled.  The\r\nSupreme Court has construed subsection (F) as setting forth a two-\r\ntiered approach to determining the extent of excludable delay\r\ncaused by the submission and disposition of pretrial motions.  SeeHenderson, 476 U.S. at 329-30.  For a pretrial motion on which a\r\nhearing is held, the entire period from the filing of the motion to\r\nthe date of the hearing, regardless of when the hearing is\r\nscheduled, plus up to 30 additional days while the motion is \"under\r\nadvisement\" is automatically excluded.  See id.; Rodriguez, 63 F.3d\r\nat 1163.  By contrast, when \"motions that require no hearing\" are\r\ninvolved, time is tolled only until the \"prompt disposition\" of the\r\nmotion, which ordinarily cannot exceed the 30-day \"under\r\nadvisement\" period.  Henderson, 476 U.S. at 329; see Santiago-\r\nBecerril, 130 F.3d at 17; S. Rep. No. 96-212, 96th Cong., 1st\r\nSess., at 34 (1979) (\"[I]f motions are so simple or routine that\r\nthey do not require a hearing, necessary advisement time should be\r\nconsiderably less than 30 days.\").  A motion is deemed to be taken\r\nunder advisement when \"'the court receives all the papers it\r\nreasonably expects.'\"  Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1163 (quoting\r\nHenderson, 476 U.S. at 329).  \r\nBecause a motion requesting only the scheduling of a\r\nstatus conference requires no \"hearing\"   marked by oral argument,\r\nfactual findings, or legal rulings   but involves merely the simple\r\nadministrative act of setting a date, it must be resolved within 30\r\ndays of the date the Court has received all it expects to properly\r\nconsider the request.  See Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1165-66; United\r\nStates v. Ferris, 751 F.2d 436, 440 (1st Cir. 1984); 18 U.S.C.\r\n3161(h)(1)(J).  It follows that such a motion is resolved as soon\r\nas the conference is actually scheduled   not when the various\r\nmatters for possible discussion, in fact, are broached   and that\r\nthe clock will start again the following day.  The government\r\ndisagrees, arguing that the clock should be tolled until the actual\r\ndate of the conference, which it calls a \"hearing\"; but to adopt\r\nthis reasoning would contravene the language of the Act.  Because\r\nthe setting of the date resolves the motion in its entirety, the\r\nconference cannot possibly represent a \"hearing on . . . such\r\nmotion.\"  18 U.S.C.  3161(h)(1)(F).  \r\nIn United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596 (1st Cir. 1996),\r\nwe held that \"a hearing is any on-the-record colloquy in which the\r\ndistrict court hears the arguments of counsel and considers those\r\narguments prior to deciding a pending motion.\"  Id. at 602.  Our\r\nreasoning today is entirely consistent with that decision.  Once a\r\nconference has been set down on a court's calendar, there is no\r\nlonger any \"pending motion\" to decide.  The motion seeking a status\r\nconference has already been resolved.  \r\nNeedless to say, there are varieties of motions that may\r\nor may not require a hearing.  But we need not wander too deeply\r\ninto this thicket today, for we hold only that motions seeking\r\nnothing more than the scheduling of a conference must be acted upon\r\nwithin 30 days.  In doing so, we emphasize that, consistent with\r\nthe letter and spirit of the Speedy Trial Act, relatively simple\r\nmotions should be disposed of expeditiously or the clock will\r\nresume ticking.\r\nApplying the foregoing principles to the present facts,\r\nwe find that the clock was tolled from January 24 until January 31,\r\n1996.  The clock ran for the next six days and stopped again on\r\nFebruary 7, 1996, when Reynaldo Barnes moved to adjourn the\r\nconference.  Although the court made no express findings in\r\ngranting the motion, the letter motion itself makes clear that\r\nReynaldo Barnes's counsel was unavailable until at least the first\r\nof March due to conflicts with his work and personal schedules. \r\nThus, the court's decision to grant the continuance comports with\r\nthe requirements of section 3161(h)(8)(A).  See United States v.\r\nRush, 738 F.2d 497, 507 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"[I]t is not necessary for\r\nthe court to articulate the basic facts when they are obvious and\r\nset forth in a motion for a continuance.\"), cert. denied, 470 U.S.\r\n1004 (1985).  The clock resumed on March 5, 1996, the day after the\r\nconference.  The clock temporarily stopped again on March 18 due to\r\ndefendants' two overlapping requests to postpone the trial, and\r\nremained stopped until October 8, 1996.  \r\nAt this point, 61 nonexcludable days had already accrued.\r\n     2.  Adjournment of the October 8, 1996 Trial Date\r\nThis case turns on the period starting with the\r\nOctober 8, 1996 trial date.  Frankly, we, like the attorneys for\r\nboth sides, are confused as to the exact circumstances surrounding\r\nthe adjournment of the October 7, 1996 trial date.  It is a\r\nmystery.  Neither the government nor any of the defendants formally\r\nmoved for a continuance, although it is theoretically possible that\r\nsomeone so moved informally.  One would, however, usually expect\r\none party to accuse the other of requesting a continuance if an\r\ninformal request had been made by one of the lawyers; but no\r\nilluminating bout of finger-pointing has erupted.  This suggests\r\nthat the court, on its own volition, ordered the adjournment\r\nwithout date.  The government contends that the trial was\r\nadjourned upon consent of defendant, but the record reflects no\r\nsuch consent.  To accept the government's position therefore\r\nrequires us to infer from silence that defendant's consent was\r\ngiven.  This we cannot do.  What is apparent is that even assuming\r\na trial date was set for October 7 and then continued by the court\r\nwithout objection, the grant of such a continuance   of which there\r\nis no contemporaneous written or oral record   fails to comply with\r\nthe Act.  See Amended Speedy Trial Act Guidelines, Aug. 28, 1981,\r\nreprinted in Robert L. Misner, Speedy Trial Federal and State\r\nPractice, App. B, at 775 (\"The fact that the defendant has\r\nrequested the continuance or consents to it is not in itself\r\nsufficient to toll the operation of the time limits.\").  Whether\r\ntime resulting from a continuance may toll the Act depends on\r\nwhether the court abused its discretion by granting the\r\ncontinuance.  See Pringle, 751 F.2d at 432.  \r\nWe find that the court should not have adjourned the\r\ntrial date in the manner that it did.  A trial court's discretion\r\nto invoke the ends of justice exception by granting a continuance\r\nis exceedingly \"narrow,\" and should not be done \"lightly or\r\nroutinely.\"  United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1044 (1st\r\nCir. 1983). \r\nWhile a continuance may have been entirely justified\r\nunder the circumstances, the court failed to set forth \"in the\r\nrecord of the case . . . its reasons for finding that the ends of\r\njustice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the\r\nbest interest of the public and defendant in a speedy trial.\"  18\r\nU.S.C.  3161(8)(A).  There is simply no record of the continuance. \r\nAlthough we have held that there is no need to articulate the basic\r\nfacts critical to a motion for a continuance when they are set\r\nforth in the motion papers, see Rush, 738 F.2d at 507, here, no one\r\nmoved to continue the trial.  Consequently, we cannot say with any\r\nreasonable certainty that the continuance met the ends of justice\r\nstandard, especially where the parties themselves have offered no\r\nexplanation for why or when the trial date was adjourned.  The lack\r\nof findings is particularly troubling because of the open-ended\r\nnature of the continuance granted here.  A firm trial date was not\r\nset until the March 25, 1997 conference   more than five months\r\nafter it was last continued.  For these reasons, we find that the\r\ntrial court abused its discretion in granting (or sua sponteordering) the continuance, and the resulting delay of 56 days must\r\nbe counted against the speedy trial clock.\r\n     3.  The Pringle Exception\r\nIn an effort to defeat the operation of the Act, the\r\ngovernment argues that the entire period of time from October 7,\r\n1996 onward must be excluded because Barnes waived her right to a\r\nspeedy trial.  The government maintains that Barnes's June 6, 1996\r\nwaiver impermissibly lulled it and the district court to sleep.  We\r\nreject the government's theory of an unlimited waiver.\r\nDefendants generally may not elect to waive the\r\nprotections of the Act.  The reason is that the public has at least\r\nas great an interest as the defendant in an expeditious criminal\r\ntrial.  See United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 923 (1st Cir.)\r\n(noting that society has a \"general interest in resolving the guilt\r\nor innocence of those accused of crime rapidly (consistent with\r\nfundamental fairness) and punishing those found to be guilty\"),\r\ncert. denied, 488 U.S. 925 (1988).  \r\nIn United States v. Pringle, 751 F.2d 419 (1st Cir.\r\n1984), we crafted a limited unclean hands exception to this rule. \r\nCf. United States v. Gambino, 59 F.3d 353, 360 (2d Cir. 1995)\r\n(\"[T]hose courts recognizing the [Pringle] exception have placed\r\ntight restrictions on the finding of waiver.\"), cert. denied, 517\r\nU.S. 1187 (1996).  In Pringle, defendants had sought to continue\r\nthe trial, declaring that \"all defendants waive[d] their rights to\r\na speedy trial.\"  751 F.2d at 433.  Defendants later moved to\r\ndismiss the indictment based on the delay that ensued in selecting\r\na new trial date.  The district court denied the motion.  We\r\naffirmed, holding, inter alia, that although a defendant cannot\r\nwaive the right to speedy trial, he or she cannot \"lull[] the court\r\nand prosecution into a false sense of security only to turn around\r\nlater and use the waiver-induced leisurely pace of the case as\r\ngrounds for dismissal.\"  Id. at 434. \r\nThe government here asserts that defendants' June 6, 1996\r\nwaiver was indefinite in scope, tolling the clock up to and\r\nincluding the first date of trial in May 1997.  Relying on\r\nPringle, the government argues that the waiver provided by\r\ndefendants caused the delay by misleading the government and the\r\ncourt into believing that any date would be acceptable to them. \r\nWhile any waiver would technically be inoperative, if the\r\ngovernment is correct about the nature of the waiver, the delay\r\nthat resulted from the waiver would be excludable under Pringle.  \r\nWe are not persuaded that the Pringle exception applies\r\nto the extent suggested by the government.  While defendants'\r\nwaiver definitely contributed to a delay until October 7, Barnes\r\ncannot be held responsible for the delay that occurred after trial\r\nwas initially set for that date and then subsequently continued. \r\nWe reach this conclusion for several reasons.\r\nFirst, defendants did not offer an open-ended waiver. \r\nUnlike the sweeping language contained in defendants' waiver in\r\nPringle, the waiver at issue does not represent defendants' consent\r\nto an indefinite exclusion of time, but authorized time to be\r\nexcluded only \"until the date set for the new trial in the fall of\r\n1996.\"  By its terms, the document did not waive Barnes's speedy\r\ntrial rights indefinitely. \r\nSecond, even if there was any ambiguity as to the scope\r\nof the waiver, the extraneous evidence conclusively puts that doubt\r\nto rest in Barnes's favor.  The waiver closely followed and was\r\ninextricably bound up with Barnes's request for an adjournment\r\nuntil \"late September or early October.\"  Thus, read together with\r\nher motion to continue, the waiver put the district court and the\r\ngovernment on notice that Barnes desired a trial by October 1996. \r\nThird, no one was \"lull[ed]\" to sleep by the waiver.  The\r\n\"joint motion for a status conference\" later drafted by the\r\ngovernment proves this.  In the motion, the parties purportedly\r\nsought an exclusion of time \"from the date of an entry of an Order\r\non defendant's pre-trial motions until such date as this Court sets\r\nfor trial.\"  (A. 37).  But if the government had truly believed\r\nthat Barnes had already provided an open-ended waiver on June 6,\r\n1996, such a broad and seemingly retroactive exclusion of time\r\nwould have been unnecessary.  The government's own actions\r\ntherefore suggest that the government itself believed that there\r\nmight still be a speedy trial problem even after defendants signed\r\nthe waiver.  \r\nIn addition, the trial court acted on defendants' motions\r\n(including the waiver) by continuing the trial only until\r\nOctober 7, 1996, showing that it, too, understood that Barnes\r\nwished to be tried by October 1996.  The date set by the court\r\nstood at the very end of the spectrum of Barnes's waiver.  At best,\r\nBarnes may be said to have consented to and caused the delay\r\nthroughout the fall of 1996, tolling the clock under Pringle until\r\nearly October, but certainly no later.  In other words, the limited\r\nwaiver did not \"create the delay[]\" that transpired when the date\r\nwas adjourned from October 7.  Id. at 434. \r\nNothing in the record even remotely suggests that Barnes\r\nstrategically attempted to \"sandbag\" anyone.  Instead, the record\r\nshows that she made clear to the court and prosecution that she\r\ndesired to be tried in the fall of 1996, at the latest by \"early\r\nOctober.\"  That did not happen.  The reasons for this delay have\r\nnot been made clear by the guardians of the speedy trial clock: the\r\ncourt, and to a lesser extent, the government.  Whether the\r\ncontinuance was justified and the court neglected to make the\r\nnecessary ends of justice findings or the government simply lost\r\ntrack of the days makes no difference.  The unexplained delay\r\noccurred; it must be accounted for.  \r\nIf Barnes is guilty of anything during this crucial time\r\nframe, it is that she did not object earlier.  But her mere failure\r\nto object to a delay does not constitute \"work[ing] both sides of\r\nthe street,\" Pringle, 751 F.2d at 434, and it does not excuse the\r\ntrial court's failure to make explicit findings as to why a\r\ncontinuance best served the interests of justice.  To hold\r\notherwise would be to permit the finding of a waiver whenever a\r\ndefendant fails to object to a continuance.  Such a conclusion\r\nwould turn the Act on its head by shifting the burden of enforcing\r\nthe Act to the defendant. \r\n     4.  Post-Violation Delay\r\nAlthough the Speedy Trial Act was violated as early as\r\nOctober 16, 1996, we press on with our analysis to discern the full\r\nextent of the unexcused trial delay.  Because the continuance was\r\ndefective, the clock continued to run unabated until December 3,\r\n1996, the date the government filed the \"joint motion\" seeking the\r\nscheduling of a conference for the purpose of setting a firm trial\r\ndate and an exclusion of time.\r\nThe motion for a status conference was considered to be\r\nunder advisement on December 10, 1996, the date Barnes filed her\r\nopposition to the request to exclude time.  Hence, the 30-day\r\nperiod from December 11, 1996 through January 9, 1997 is excluded. \r\nBut the trial court did not act on this motion until March 7, 1997,\r\nlong after this 30-day window had shut, and \"[w]e see no reason why\r\nthe pretrial conference could not have been scheduled sooner than\r\nit was.\"  Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1048.  Accordingly, January 10,\r\n1997 through March 24, 1997, the additional 74 days that accrued\r\nbefore the court actually resolved the motion, must count on the\r\nclock.\r\nThe government also contends that terms of the so-called\r\njoint motion for a status conference warrant excluding the time\r\nfrom December 3, 1996 onward.  The problem with this argument is\r\nthat the court never actually excluded any time based on this\r\nmotion.  It simply set a date for a conference months later, either\r\nignoring or implicitly rejecting the request to exclude time. \r\nGiven the hotly-disputed nature of the request, including whether\r\nBarnes had given her consent to make it, we cannot say that the\r\ncourt erred by refusing to exclude time.  For this reason, the\r\nmotion does not toll the Act for more than the 30 days during which\r\nit should have been decided. \r\nMoving forward, we find that the 56 days between\r\nMarch 25, 1997 and May 19, 1997 must be excluded.  At the March 25\r\nconference, Reynaldo Barnes moved to change his plea, and the court\r\naccepted his guilty plea at a hearing on May 15, 1997.  The\r\nintervening time is not counted, for \"all of the days between the\r\ndate a codefendant files a motion for a change of plea and the date\r\nof the change of plea hearing itself are excludable from the\r\n[Act]'s seventy-day time limit.\"  Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at\r\n20.  Moreover, the overlapping adjournment sought by Barnes covers\r\nthe period from April 4, 1997 until the first day of trial.  It\r\ngoes without saying that the government's in limine motion filed\r\nMay 16, 1997 also tolled the clock until the motion was resolved on\r\nthe first day of trial.\r\nTo summarize, we find that 191 days of nonexcludable time\r\nelapsed between Barnes's first appearance before the magistrate\r\njudge in the District of Massachusetts and the first day of trial. \r\nForty-one days passed by the time of defendant's first conference\r\nbefore the district court; 20 days elapsed between February 1 and\r\nOctober 8, 1996; 56 days passed between the October 8, 1996 trial\r\ndate and the filing of the joint motion requesting a conference on\r\nDecember 3, 1996; and 74 days of unexcused time elapsed while the\r\nmotion requesting a pretrial conference was pending (excluding the\r\n30-day under-advisement period).  The 70-day limit was clearly\r\nexceeded.  The indictment should have been dismissed. \r\nC.  The Remedy\r\nThe final inquiry is whether the indictment should now be\r\ndismissed with or without prejudice.  Our usual practice is to\r\nremand to the trial court to address this question, for it is best\r\nsituated to assess the degree of the violation and its likely\r\neffect on the parties involved.  Nevertheless, we find that the\r\nonly proper remedy in this case is to dismiss the indictment\r\nwithout prejudice.  For this reason, as well as for the sake of\r\njudicial economy, we make this determination in the first instance. \r\nSee United States v. McAfee, 780 F.2d 143, 146 (1st Cir. 1985)\r\n(deciding proper remedy on appeal).\r\nOur analysis is guided by the following considerations:\r\n(1) the seriousness of the offenses; (2) the circumstances leading \r\nto the delay; (3) the impact reprosecution would have on the\r\nadministration of justice and the enforcement of the Speedy Trial\r\nAct; and (4) any related miscellaneous factors, including whether\r\nthe delay resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant.  SeeHastings, 847 F.2d at 924; 18 U.S.C.  3162(a)(2).\r\n     1.  Seriousness of the Offenses\r\nAs to the severity of the offenses, we find that this\r\nfactor weighs strongly in favor of dismissal without prejudice.  We\r\nhave often observed that \"the graver the crimes, the greater the\r\ninsult to societal interests if the charges are dropped, once and\r\nfor all, without a meaningful determination of guilt or innocence.\" \r\nHastings, 847 F.2d at 925.  The government charged Barnes with\r\nconspiracy to import 110 kilograms of cocaine into the United\r\nStates in the type of drugs-for-profit scheme that Congress has\r\ndeemed a serious felony.  See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 36\r\nF.3d 1229, 1239 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Conspiracy to distribute a large\r\nquantity of cocaine . . . is a serious crime\"), cert. denied, 513\r\nU.S. 1179 (1995); Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925 (\"By their very nature,\r\ndrugs-for-profit offenses are extremely serious.\"). \r\nDefendant attempts to minimize the gravity of the charges\r\nleveled against her by asserting that the actual importation of\r\ndrugs never took place and by claiming that the evidence at trial\r\nsuggests that no agreement was ever reached as to the criminal\r\nenterprise.  These arguments are easily rejected.  First, the mere\r\nfact that the criminal plan was never successfully carried out is\r\nimmaterial to whether the charge of conspiracy constitutes a\r\nserious offense.  As noted before, there can be little doubt that\r\nit is.  Second, despite Barnes's characterization of the evidence\r\nof her intent to conspire as weak, the trial record, which we must\r\nview in the light most favorable to the government, shows\r\notherwise: a jury convicted Barnes of conspiring to import cocaine\r\nand that verdict necessarily included a finding that Barnes had\r\nagreed with others to traffic in drugs.  In short, that defendant\r\nwas charged with and eventually convicted of a drug trafficking\r\nconspiracy involving a considerable amount of drugs thus militates\r\nheavily in favor of permitting reprosecution.  \r\n     2.  Circumstances Leading to the Delay\r\nWe next consider the relative blame each side bears in\r\nproducing the unexcused delay.  The portrait of delay is somewhat\r\ncomplex.  There is no question that the primary blame must be\r\nassigned to the court.  The district court should have articulated\r\nits reasons for indefinitely continuing the trial date from\r\nOctober 8, 1996 and should not have let several months slip by\r\nbefore scheduling a new conference, much less a firm date for\r\ntrial.  Likewise, the prosecutor, who should already have been\r\naware that, as of the fall of 1996, at least 61 nonexcludable days\r\nhad elapsed, failed to monitor scrupulously the passing days and\r\nalert the court that the deadline fast approached.  \"Even though a\r\nprosecutor does not bear the burden of monitoring the court's\r\ncompliance with the [Speedy Trial Act] in absence of an announced\r\nrule, district courts do look to prosecutors for assistance as\r\nofficers of the court.\"  United States v. Ramirez, 973 F.2d 36, 39\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).\r\nAt the same time, however, there is no evidence that the\r\ndelay was caused by bad faith conduct on the part of the\r\nprosecutor.  We do note, without so finding, that AUSA Brieger's\r\neffort to obtain an exclusion of time could be viewed as causing\r\nsome of the post-violation delay.  A plausible interpretation of\r\nthe facts certainly is that as December 1996 drew near, the\r\ngovernment's lawyer suddenly realized that there might be a speedy\r\ntrial problem and hastily added a retroactive and open-ended\r\nexclusion in an attempt to remedy the perceived difficulty.  The\r\nprosecutor's actions may have misled the court into believing that\r\nBarnes had no objection as to when she might be tried.  But we do\r\nnot attach too much weight to this possibility, for even if the\r\ngovernment's counsel mischaracterized the extent of defendant's\r\nconsent for the December 3, 1996 motion, the speedy trial violation\r\nhad already occurred.  Thus, the government's conduct did not\r\nactually bring about the violation.  There is nothing in the record\r\nto suggest that prosecutorial misconduct rather than administrative\r\nnegligence caused the 70-day deadline to be exceeded in the first\r\nplace.  Where, as here, the actual speedy trial violation resulted\r\nsolely from neglect rather than intentional misconduct, that\r\ncircumstance tips ever so slightly in favor of dismissal without\r\nprejudice.  See, e.g., Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925-26. \r\nThere remains, of course, the possibility that the\r\ngovernment's actions exacerbated the delay even if they were not\r\ndirectly responsible for producing the violation.  We think,\r\nhowever, that Barnes's prompt clarification on December 10, 1996\r\nthat she was not waiving her speedy trial rights but was ready for\r\ntrial sufficed to minimize this danger.  \r\nFinding reason to spread the blame, we note, too, that\r\nBarnes herself could have pushed the proceedings along at various\r\ncrucial junctures but chose not to do so.  She did not behave like\r\na defendant who wanted her day in court posthaste.  Instead, she\r\nrequested several continuances in the spring of 1996.  Furthermore,\r\nshe could have objected to the adjournment of the October 7, 1996\r\ntrial date or at least have voiced her preference for a specific\r\ntrial date, but she failed to clearly and loudly demand a quick\r\ntrial.  And rather than immediately asserting her speedy trial\r\nrights once the violation occurred, she consented to one additional\r\nlengthy continuance after the 70-day period had already run its\r\ncourse.  Defendant never raised the speedy trial claim until the\r\nlast possible moment   when a trial was simply unavoidable. \r\nAlthough Barnes was under no obligation to monitor the clock, we\r\nnevertheless find that her willingness to abide the unexcused delay\r\nof some 5 months and participate in further delay should be counted\r\nagainst her.  Cf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22 (weighing\r\ndefendant's failure to demand speedy trial until eve of trial\r\nagainst him in assessing Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim);\r\nMcAfee, 780 F.2d at 146 (dismissing indictment without prejudice\r\nwhere defense counsel bore some blame for delay).  We have already\r\ndetermined that the indictment must be dismissed.  She should not\r\nbe doubly rewarded for sitting silently as the delay mounted. \r\n     3.  Effect of Reprosecution on Administration of \r\n         Justice and Enforcement of the Act          \r\n\nThe effect that reprosecution would have on the\r\nadministration of justice and enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act\r\nlikewise does not call for barring reprosecution.  To be sure, the\r\norderly administration of justice necessarily is hindered to some\r\ndegree whenever the Act is violated.  Nevertheless, a retrial\r\nshould not take more than one week (the first trial lasted four\r\ndays), and there is no reason to believe that reprosecution would\r\notherwise have a deleterious effect on the fair and efficient\r\nadministration of justice.  \r\nSimilarly, enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act would not\r\nbe unduly hampered by allowing Barnes to be retried.  There is\r\nlittle doubt that the harsh remedy of dismissal with prejudice has\r\ngreater deterrence value than its counterpart.  But considerations\r\nof general deterrence are not dispositive or else dismissal with\r\nprejudice would impermissibly become the preferred tool.  SeeUnited States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326, 334 (1988) (\"Congress did\r\nnot intend any particular type of dismissal to serve as the\r\npresumptive remedy for a Speedy Trial Act violation.\").  Moreover,\r\nthe fact that a retrial might be necessary at all is often\r\ndeterrence enough.  We find that to be true here.  As the Supreme\r\nCourt has observed,\r\nDismissal without prejudice is not a toothless\r\nsanction:  it forces the Government to obtain\r\na new indictment if it decides to reprosecute,\r\nand it exposes the prosecution to dismissal on\r\nstatute of limitations grounds.  Given the\r\nburdens borne by the prosecution and the\r\neffects of delay on the Government's ability\r\nto meet those burdens, substantial delay well\r\nmay make reprosecution, even if permitted,\r\nunlikely.\r\n\nId. at 342.  Conversely, little would be gained in the case at bar\r\nby foreclosing the possibility of another trial.\r\n     4.  Miscellaneous Factors: Length of Delay\r\n              and Actual Prejudice                     \r\n\nTwo final closely related considerations merit\r\ndiscussion:  the length of delay and actual prejudice.  On its\r\nface, the length of delay in this case   more than twice the extent\r\nstatutorily permissible   is troubling.  At first blush the sheer\r\nlength of unexcused delay might suggest actual prejudice, but\r\nBarnes has never once claimed that the delay adversely affected her\r\nability to prepare for trial, much less articulated any facts\r\nsuggesting how she was actually prejudiced by the tardy trial date. \r\nThe absence of any consequential prejudice to defendant points\r\ntoward permitting a new trial.  See Taylor, 487 U.S. at 341. \r\nWeighing all of these circumstances as a whole, we\r\nconclude that dismissal without prejudice is the appropriate\r\nremedy.  In fashioning the proper curative, we find dispositive\r\nthat the crimes charged are grave, that there is no evidence of bad\r\nfaith conduct on the part of the government, that the record\r\nreveals no actual prejudice to the defendant, and that defendant\r\ncontributed to some of the delay by repeatedly seeking adjournments\r\nand by not asserting her rights as soon as the violation occurred. \r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the district court denying defendant's\r\nmotion to dismiss is reversed, the judgment of conviction and\r\nsentence entered against the defendant are hereby vacated, and the\r\nindictment is dismissed as to her without prejudice.\r\nSo ordered.\r\n",

In this case, the court failed to police the speedy trial clock vigilantly during a crucial 5-month period beginning in the fall of 1996 when the trial date was inexplicably adjourned.  As a result, the 70-day limit was exceeded by some 121 days.

On August 10, 1995, a complaint was issued in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Barnes and her brother Reynaldo Barnes with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States from Panama.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Federal law enforcement agents arrested Barnes on August 11, 1995 in Brooklyn, New York, pursuant to a warrant issued by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  She appeared before a magistrate judge in the Eastern District of New York that same day.  An order was entered 3 days later removing Barnes to the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 23, 1995, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Barnes and her brother, charging them with conspiracy to import cocaine under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963 (1998) and with criminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes's first appearance before a judicial officer in Massachusetts took place on September 25, 1995 before United States Magistrate Judge Joyce L. Alexander.  A briefing schedule for pretrial motions was set at this conference:  all motions were to be filed by October 3, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1995, Reynaldo Barnes filed a motion seeking additional time to file pretrial motions up to and including October 13, 1995.  This motion was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes was arraigned on October 3, 1995;  she entered a plea of not guilty to both counts.  At defendant's request, Magistrate Judge Alexander extended the time to file pretrial motions to October 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1995, defendants filed a flurry of pretrial motions seeking, inter alia, a bill of particulars, various discovery items, and Jencks Act material.  Magistrate Judge Alexander held a hearing on these motions on November 30, 1995, after which she took the matters under advisement, and eventually disposed of all motions on December 14, 1995.  An order of excludable delay was thereafter entered, excluding the period of time from October 20 to December 14, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no formal activity in the case until January 24, 1996, when the government formally moved the court to schedule a status conference to \"enable the Court and parties to establish a firm date for trial, facilitate the identification and resolution of any anticipated evidentiary issues at trial, and possibly facilitate the resolution of this case prior to trial.\"   The district court granted the motion on January 31, 1996, and scheduled a conference for February 20, 1996.  By letter dated February 7, 1996, Reynaldo Barnes requested that the conference be adjourned because his counsel, William P. Homans, was to be on trial in another case that same week.  The court granted the motion on February 9, rescheduling the conference for March 4, 1996.  On March 4, 1996, the status conference was held, during which the court set a trial date of April 8, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 1996, defendants jointly moved to continue the trial date to June 10, 1996 and to exclude the time from the date of the motion until the new trial date.  Defendants cited three reasons for the request:  Mr. Homans was recovering from pneumonia, defendants were engaged in ongoing plea negotiations with the government, and a conflict had arisen in the trial schedule of Barnes's attorney, Stephen B. Hrones.  Their motion was granted by the court on March 19, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical chain of events central to this appeal then occurred.  On May 30, 1996, Barnes moved the district court for another continuance \"until sometime in late September or early October.\"   She explained that her counsel was engaged in another trial on June 10.  The court granted the motion by memorandum order on June 3, 1996 and continued the trial until October 7, 1996 at 11:00 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for a continuance was followed by defendants' joint motion to \"waive their speedy trial rights from June 10 until the date set for the new trial in the fall of 1996.\"   The motion to waive was granted by margin order on August 28, 1996, and the court expressly excluded time from the Speedy Trial clock through October 7, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is far from certain precisely what happened next, the record suggests that the court set this matter down for trial for October 7, 1996 at 11:00 a.m. and then telephonically adjourned the trial without date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  No one appeared for trial on October 7. Neither defendant nor the government can explain why the trial did not go forward.  Neither the government nor any of the defendants apparently requested a continuance or objected to it;  no one seems to remember when the trial was adjourned.  The district court never explicitly excluded time from the speedy trial clock or made any findings as to why the adjournment was required in the interests of justice.  It did not issue a written order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1996, after two months had passed, the parties jointly moved the court for a status conference for the purpose of setting a trial date.  The motion included an odd statement:  \"the parties jointly move to exclude the period of delay in the interests of justice and due to continuing plea negotiations, from the date of entry of an Order on defendant's pre-trial motions until such date as this Court sets for trial.\"  (Emphasis added.)   By its terms, the motion sought a retroactive and an unlimited forward-looking exclusion of time.  The motion was signed only by the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") on behalf of both the government and Barnes.  Barnes's attorney, Mr. Hrones, did not sign the papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seven days later, Barnes filed a \"Motion to Correct a Joint Motion for Status Conference\" protesting the government's effort to have time excluded by the court.  This document stated that \"although [her] attorney authorized the Joint Motion for Status Conference he did not give authority to [the AUSA] to add a paragraph indicating that the defendant had agreed to exclude the period of delay.\"   Barnes indicated that she opposed any exclusion of the delay, having \"made clear for some time now to [the AUSA] that [sh]e want[ed] a trial.\"   Accordingly, Barnes requested that the court \"strike the defendant's name from her request to exclude the delay.\"   The government did not oppose defendant's motion to correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7, 1997--some three months later--the court sent defendants and the government a notice informing them that a conference had been scheduled for March 25, 1997.  The court did not exclude any time, either forward or backward, as requested in the purported joint motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two noteworthy events transpired at the March 25 status conference.  First, Reynaldo Barnes moved to change his plea.  The motion was granted and a date was set for his anticipated plea of guilty.  Second, the court reset Barnes's trial date for May 5, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 1997, the government, with defendant's consent, filed a motion to continue the trial from May 5 to May 19, 1997.  Accordingly, the district court memo endorsed the motion and rescheduled trial for May 19, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 15, 1997, Reynaldo Barnes pled guilty to both offenses.  The next day, May 16, 1997, the government filed a motion in limine seeking an order permitting the government to use transcripts of recorded conversations between undercover agents and defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 1997, the first day of trial but before jury selection, Barnes moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of the Speedy Trial Act.  The court denied the motion but made no factual findings beyond observing that Mr. Hrones was on trial in another case on May 5, \"the last time the case was going to be scheduled,\" and that Reynaldo Barnes's counsel, Mr. Homans, was sick for a period of time.  The court then resolved all outstanding motions in limine and empaneled the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes was tried and convicted on both counts, and was eventually sentenced to 188 months in prison, to be followed by five years of supervised release.  She then timely filed this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Speedy Trial Act \"commands that a defendant be tried within 70 days of the latest of either the filing of an indictment or information, or the first appearance before a judge or magistrate.\"  Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 322, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986);  see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1).  The sanction for failure to adhere to this time limit is severe--the indictment is dismissed on motion of the defendant.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2).  In determining whether a violation of the Act has occurred, certain \"periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which ... the trial ... must commence.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following are among the kinds of delays that are properly omitted from this calculation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(F) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(J) delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>(8)(A) Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or his counsel or at the request of the attorney for the Government, if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss based on the Speedy Trial Act de novo.  See United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1162 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1032, 116 S.Ct. 681, 133 L.Ed.2d 529 (1995).  Barnes's motion to dismiss was denied by the court on the first day of trial without any calculation of the Speedy Trial Act timetable.  Accordingly, on this appeal \"[w]e must start from scratch in the computation of excludable and nonexcludable time under the Act.\"  United States v. Pringle, 751 F.2d 419, 429 (1st Cir.1984).  We do so in two steps.  First, we must \"do the basic mathematics and determine the aggregate time elapsed awaiting trial.\"  United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 600 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 156, 136 L.Ed.2d 101 (1996).  Second, we then ascertain how many days should be excluded from the total time.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this analytical framework in mind, we turn to computing the number of days that elapsed in the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. When Did the Time Begin to Accrue?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue to be resolved is when the speedy trial clock began to tick.  Section 3161(c)(1) requires that a defendant be tried within 70 days of the occurrence of one of two events:  the filing of the indictment or the defendant's appearance \"before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes, relying on a separate provision of the Act that governs the tolling of time for unreasonable delays associated with the transfer of defendants, argues that any amount of time above and beyond the 10 days between the entry of the order compelling her removal from New York and her actual arrival in Massachusetts should count toward the 70-day limit.  Section 3161(h)(1)(H) provides that any unreasonable delay resulting from the transfer of a defendant is includable, and mandates that any such delay in excess of ten days from the date of the order directing transportation and \"the defendant's arrival at the destination\" be presumed unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes's reliance on this provision to start the speedy trial clock is misplaced.  It is a tolling provision, not one that sets forth the events that trigger the start of the 70-day period in which a trial must be held.  The pre-indictment or pre-appearance transfer of a defendant is not explicitly listed as one of the only two triggering events in section 3161(c)(1), and we decline to read into that provision what was not expressly included by Congress.  Accordingly, while delay resulting from such a transfer may count toward the 30-day arrest-to-indictment period, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b), it does not start the 70-day speedy trial clock.  The delay resulting from the transfer of Barnes from New York to Massachusetts thus took place well before the clock even began to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the terms of the Act, we conclude that time on Barnes's speedy trial clock began to accrue on September 26, 1995, the day after her first appearance before a magistrate judge in the District of Massachusetts.  The date of the conference, is, of course, excludable as a \"proceeding concerning the defendant.\"  United States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.1997).  The clock stopped on May 19, 1997, Barnes's first day of trial.  A total of 601 days passed between the start of the speedy trial clock and the date it stopped for good on May 19, 1997.  We now evaluate which of these days are excludable and which must be counted toward the 70-day deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Excludable Days</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While September 26, 1995 must be counted, the entire period between September 27, 1995 and December 14, 1995 must be excluded from the final tally.  On September 27, 1995 Barnes's codefendant moved for an extension of time to file pretrial motions.  The motion was granted until October 13, 1995, and the deadline was later extended again until October 20, 1995.  It is well-settled that an exclusion of time attributable to one defendant is applicable for all codefendants.  See id. at 19.   Therefore, this time is not counted toward the 70 days.  See United States v. Jodoin, 672 F.2d 232, 237 (1st Cir.1982) (excluding time that elapsed due to defendant's request for an extension of time as \"directly attributable to [his] ... motion\").  The magistrate judge also properly excluded the period between the actual filing of the motions (October 20, 1995) and the hearing on the motions (November 13, 1995), for it falls under section 3161(h)(1)(F) as \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, ... such motion.\"   Similarly, the magistrate judge correctly excluded the thirty days between November 14 and December 14 during which she had the initial batch of pretrial motions under advisement.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(J).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes that the 40 days between December 15 and January 23, 1996 are not excludable.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Motion Requesting a Status Conference</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The excludability of the next segment of time turns on whether the government's motion to set a status conference filed on January 24, 1996 is a \"pretrial motion\" within the meaning of section 3161(h)(1)(F).  Barnes argues that such a motion does not qualify as a pretrial motion because it is not of a \"substantive\" nature.  For its part, the government insists that it is a pretrial motion and argues that time should be excluded from the moment the motion was filed until the date of the requested status conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that a motion requesting the scheduling of a pretrial conference is a \"pretrial motion\" so as to trigger an exclusion under the Speedy Trial Act.  Section 3161(h)(1)(F) states, rather expansively, that delay resulting from \"any pretrial motion\" shall be excluded.  It does not distinguish between more significant or complex \"pretrial motions\" and simple or routine motions.  For this reason, we have read the term \"pretrial motion\" broadly to encompass all manner of motions, ranging from informal requests for laboratory reports, see United States v. Jorge, 865 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1027, 109 S.Ct. 1762, 104 L.Ed.2d 198 (1989), to \"implied\" requests for a new trial date, see Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 17.   A motion requesting the scheduling of a status conference has undeniable \"pretrial\" significance:  all kinds of matters affecting the course of trial, including discovery, motions, and trial dates may be discussed at such a conference.  Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 17.1 (\"[T]he court upon motion of any party or upon its own motion may order one or more conferences to consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial.\").  There seems to be no good reason to exclude a motion for a status conference from the universe of possible pretrial motions.  See, e.g., United States v. Bellucci, 737 F.Supp. 706, 710 (D.Mass.1990) (Tauro, D.J.)  (holding that motion for status conference was pretrial motion for purposes of tolling Speedy Trial Act).  Hence, in this case, the clock stopped as soon as the government filed its motion seeking a status conference on January 24, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is how much time should be tolled.  The Supreme Court has construed subsection (F) as setting forth a two-tiered approach to determining the extent of excludable delay caused by the submission and disposition of pretrial motions.  See Henderson, 476 U.S. at 329-30, 106 S.Ct. 1871.   For a pretrial motion on which a hearing is held, the entire period from the filing of the motion to the date of the hearing, regardless of when the hearing is scheduled, plus up to 30 additional days while the motion is \"under advisement\" is automatically excluded.  See id.;  Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1163.   By contrast, when \"motions that require no hearing\" are involved, time is tolled only until the \"prompt disposition\" of the motion, which ordinarily cannot exceed the 30-day \"under advisement\" period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Henderson, 476 U.S. at 329, 106 S.Ct. 1871;  see Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 17;  S.Rep. No. 96-212, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., at 34 (1979) (\"[I]f motions are so simple or routine that they do not require a hearing, necessary advisement time should be considerably less than 30 days.\").  A motion is deemed to be taken under advisement when \" 'the court receives all the papers it reasonably expects.' \"  Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1163 (quoting Henderson, 476 U.S. at 329, 106 S.Ct. 1871).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a motion requesting only the scheduling of a status conference requires no \"hearing\"--marked by oral argument, factual findings, or legal rulings--but involves merely the simple administrative act of setting a date, it must be resolved within 30 days of the date the Court has received all it expects to properly consider the request.  See Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1165-66;  United States v. Ferris, 751 F.2d 436, 440 (1st Cir.1984);  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(J).  It follows that such a motion is resolved as soon as the conference is actually scheduled--not when the various matters for possible discussion, in fact, are broached--and that the clock will start again the following day.  The government disagrees, arguing that the clock should be tolled until the actual date of the conference, which it calls a \"hearing\";  but to adopt this reasoning would contravene the language of the Act.  Because the setting of the date resolves the motion in its entirety, the conference cannot possibly represent a \"hearing on ... such motion.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596 (1st Cir.1996), we held that \"a hearing is any on-the-record colloquy in which the district court hears the arguments of counsel and considers those arguments prior to deciding a pending motion.\"  Id. at 602.   Our reasoning today is entirely consistent with that decision.  Once a conference has been set down on a court's calendar, there is no longer any \"pending motion\" to decide.  The motion seeking a status conference has already been resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, there are varieties of motions that may or may not require a hearing.  But we need not wander too deeply into this thicket today, for we hold only that motions seeking nothing more than the scheduling of a conference must be acted upon within 30 days.  In doing so, we emphasize that, consistent with the letter and spirit of the Speedy Trial Act, relatively simple motions should be disposed of expeditiously or the clock will resume ticking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the foregoing principles to the present facts, we find that the clock was tolled from January 24 until January 31, 1996.  The clock ran for the next six days and stopped again on February 7, 1996, when Reynaldo Barnes moved to adjourn the conference.  Although the court made no express findings in granting the motion, the letter motion itself makes clear that Reynaldo Barnes's counsel was unavailable until at least the first of March due to conflicts with his work and personal schedules.  Thus, the court's decision to grant the continuance comports with the requirements of section 3161(h)(8)(A).  See United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 507 (1st Cir.1984) (\"[I]t is not necessary for the court to articulate the basic facts when they are obvious and set forth in a motion for a continuance.\"), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1004, 105 S.Ct. 1355, 84 L.Ed.2d 378 (1985).  The clock resumed on March 5, 1996, the day after the conference.  The clock temporarily stopped again on March 18 due to defendants' two overlapping requests to postpone the trial, and remained stopped until October 8, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, 61 nonexcludable days had already accrued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>2. Adjournment of the October 8, 1996 Trial Date</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case turns on the period starting with the October 8, 1996 trial date.  Frankly, we, like the attorneys for both sides, are confused as to the exact circumstances surrounding the adjournment of the October 7, 1996 trial date.  It is a mystery.  Neither the government nor any of the defendants formally moved for a continuance, although it is theoretically possible that someone so moved informally.  One would, however, usually expect one party to accuse the other of requesting a continuance if an informal request had been made by one of the lawyers;  but no illuminating bout of finger-pointing has erupted.  This suggests that the court, on its own volition, ordered the adjournment without date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The government contends that the trial was adjourned upon consent of defendant, but the record reflects no such consent.  To accept the government's position therefore requires us to infer from silence that defendant's consent was given.  This we cannot do.  What is apparent is that even assuming a trial date was set for October 7 and then continued by the court without objection, the grant of such a continuance--of which there is no contemporaneous written or oral record--fails to comply with the Act.  See Amended Speedy Trial Act Guidelines, Aug. 28, 1981, reprinted in Robert L. Misner, Speedy Trial Federal and State Practice, App.  B, at 775 (\"The fact that the defendant has requested the continuance or consents to it is not in itself sufficient to toll the operation of the time limits.\").  Whether time resulting from a continuance may toll the Act depends on whether the court abused its discretion by granting the continuance.  See Pringle, 751 F.2d at 432.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the court should not have adjourned the trial date in the manner that it did.  A trial court's discretion to invoke the ends of justice exception by granting a continuance is exceedingly \"narrow,\" and should not be done \"lightly or routinely.\"  United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1044 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a continuance may have been entirely justified under the circumstances, the court failed to set forth \"in the record of the case ... its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and defendant in a speedy trial.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A).  There is simply no record of the continuance.  Although we have held that there is no need to articulate the basic facts critical to a motion for a continuance when they are set forth in the motion papers, see Rush, 738 F.2d at 507, here, no one moved to continue the trial.  Consequently, we cannot say with any reasonable certainty that the continuance met the ends of justice standard, especially where the parties themselves have offered no explanation for why or when the trial date was adjourned.  The lack of findings is particularly troubling because of the open-ended nature of the continuance granted here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  A firm trial date was not set until the March 25, 1997 conference--more than five months after it was last continued.  For these reasons, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in granting (or sua sponte ordering) the continuance, and the resulting delay of 56 days must be counted against the speedy trial clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The Pringle Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to defeat the operation of the Act, the government argues that the entire period of time from October 7, 1996 onward must be excluded because Barnes waived her right to a speedy trial.  The government maintains that Barnes's June 6, 1996 waiver impermissibly lulled it and the district court to sleep.  We reject the government's theory of an unlimited waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants generally may not elect to waive the protections of the Act.  The reason is that the public has at least as great an interest as the defendant in an expeditious criminal trial.  See United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 923 (1st Cir.)  (noting that society has a \"general interest in resolving the guilt or innocence of those accused of crime rapidly (consistent with fundamental fairness) and punishing those found to be guilty\"), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 925, 109 S.Ct. 308, 102 L.Ed.2d 327 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Pringle, 751 F.2d 419 (1st Cir.1984), we crafted a limited unclean hands exception to this rule.  Cf. United States v. Gambino, 59 F.3d 353, 360 (2d Cir.1995) (\"[T]hose courts recognizing the [Pringle ] exception have placed tight restrictions on the finding of waiver.\"), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1187, 116 S.Ct. 1671, 134 L.Ed.2d 776 (1996).  In Pringle, defendants had sought to continue the trial, declaring that \"all defendants waive[d] their rights to a speedy trial.\"  751 F.2d at 433.   Defendants later moved to dismiss the indictment based on the delay that ensued in selecting a new trial date.  The district court denied the motion.  We affirmed, holding, inter alia, that although a defendant cannot waive the right to speedy trial, he or she cannot \"lull[ ] the court and prosecution into a false sense of security only to turn around later and use the waiver-induced leisurely pace of the case as grounds for dismissal.\"  Id. at 434.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government here asserts that defendants' June 6, 1996 waiver was indefinite in scope, tolling the clock up to and including the first date of trial in May 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Relying on Pringle, the government argues that the waiver provided by defendants caused the delay by misleading the government and the court into believing that any date would be acceptable to them.  While any waiver would technically be inoperative, if the government is correct about the nature of the waiver, the delay that resulted from the waiver would be excludable under Pringle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded that the Pringle exception applies to the extent suggested by the government.  While defendants' waiver definitely contributed to a delay until October 7, Barnes cannot be held responsible for the delay that occurred after trial was initially set for that date and then subsequently continued.  We reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, defendants did not offer an open-ended waiver.  Unlike the sweeping language contained in defendants' waiver in Pringle, the waiver at issue does not represent defendants' consent to an indefinite exclusion of time, but authorized time to be excluded only \"until the date set for the new trial in the fall of 1996.\"   By its terms, the document did not waive Barnes's speedy trial rights indefinitely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if there was any ambiguity as to the scope of the waiver, the extraneous evidence conclusively puts that doubt to rest in Barnes's favor.  The waiver closely followed and was inextricably bound up with Barnes's request for an adjournment until \"late September or early October.\"   Thus, read together with her motion to continue, the waiver put the district court and the government on notice that Barnes desired a trial by October 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, no one was \"lull[ed]\" to sleep by the waiver.  The \"joint motion for a status conference\" later drafted by the government proves this.  In the motion, the parties purportedly sought an exclusion of time \"from the date of an entry of an Order on defendant's pre-trial motions until such date as this Court sets for trial.\"  (A.37).  But if the government had truly believed that Barnes had already provided an open-ended waiver on June 6, 1996, such a broad and seemingly retroactive exclusion of time would have been unnecessary.  The government's own actions therefore suggest that the government itself believed that there might still be a speedy trial problem even after defendants signed the waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the trial court acted on defendants' motions (including the waiver) by continuing the trial only until October 7, 1996, showing that it, too, understood that Barnes wished to be tried by October 1996.  The date set by the court stood at the very end of the spectrum of Barnes's waiver.  At best, Barnes may be said to have consented to and caused the delay throughout the fall of 1996, tolling the clock under Pringle until early October, but certainly no later.  In other words, the limited waiver did not \"create the delay[ ]\" that transpired when the date was adjourned from October 7.  Id. at 434.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record even remotely suggests that Barnes strategically attempted to \"sandbag\" anyone.  Instead, the record shows that she made clear to the court and prosecution that she desired to be tried in the fall of 1996, at the latest by \"early October.\"   That did not happen.  The reasons for this delay have not been made clear by the guardians of the speedy trial clock:  the court, and to a lesser extent, the government.  Whether the continuance was justified and the court neglected to make the necessary ends of justice findings or the government simply lost track of the days makes no difference.  The unexplained delay occurred;  it must be accounted for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Barnes is guilty of anything during this crucial time frame, it is that she did not object earlier.  But her mere failure to object to a delay does not constitute \"work[ing] both sides of the street,\" Pringle, 751 F.2d at 434, and it does not excuse the trial court's failure to make explicit findings as to why a continuance best served the interests of justice.  To hold otherwise would be to permit the finding of a waiver whenever a defendant fails to object to a continuance.  Such a conclusion would turn the Act on its head by shifting the burden of enforcing the Act to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Post-Violation Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Speedy Trial Act was violated as early as October 16, 1996, we press on with our analysis to discern the full extent of the unexcused trial delay.  Because the continuance was defective, the clock continued to run unabated until December 3, 1996, the date the government filed the \"joint motion\" seeking the scheduling of a conference for the purpose of setting a firm trial date and an exclusion of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for a status conference was considered to be under advisement on December 10, 1996, the date Barnes filed her opposition to the request to exclude time.  Hence, the 30-day period from December 11, 1996 through January 9, 1997 is excluded.  But the trial court did not act on this motion until March 7, 1997, long after this 30-day window had shut, and \"[w]e see no reason why the pretrial conference could not have been scheduled sooner than it was.\"  Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1048.   Accordingly, January 10, 1997 through March 24, 1997, the additional 74 days that accrued before the court actually resolved the motion, must count on the clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also contends that terms of the so-called joint motion for a status conference warrant excluding the time from December 3, 1996 onward.  The problem with this argument is that the court never actually excluded any time based on this motion.  It simply set a date for a conference months later, either ignoring or implicitly rejecting the request to exclude time.  Given the hotly-disputed nature of the request, including whether Barnes had given her consent to make it, we cannot say that the court erred by refusing to exclude time.  For this reason, the motion does not toll the Act for more than the 30 days during which it should have been decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving forward, we find that the 56 days between March 25, 1997 and May 19, 1997 must be excluded.  At the March 25 conference, Reynaldo Barnes moved to change his plea, and the court accepted his guilty plea at a hearing on May 15, 1997.  The intervening time is not counted, for \"all of the days between the date a codefendant files a motion for a change of plea and the date of the change of plea hearing itself are excludable from the [Act]'s seventy-day time limit.\"  Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 20.   Moreover, the overlapping adjournment sought by Barnes covers the period from April 4, 1997 until the first day of trial.  It goes without saying that the government's in limine motion filed May 16, 1997 also tolled the clock until the motion was resolved on the first day of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we find that 191 days of nonexcludable time elapsed between Barnes's first appearance before the magistrate judge in the District of Massachusetts and the first day of trial.  Forty-one days passed by the time of defendant's first conference before the district court;  20 days elapsed between February 1 and October 8, 1996;  56 days passed between the October 8, 1996 trial date and the filing of the joint motion requesting a conference on December 3, 1996;  and 74 days of unexcused time elapsed while the motion requesting a pretrial conference was pending (excluding the 30-day under-advisement period).  The 70-day limit was clearly exceeded.  The indictment should have been dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final inquiry is whether the indictment should now be dismissed with or without prejudice.  Our usual practice is to remand to the trial court to address this question, for it is best situated to assess the degree of the violation and its likely effect on the parties involved.  Nevertheless, we find that the only proper remedy in this case is to dismiss the indictment without prejudice.  For this reason, as well as for the sake of judicial economy, we make this determination in the first instance.  See United States v. McAfee, 780 F.2d 143, 146 (1st Cir.1985) (deciding proper remedy on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis is guided by the following considerations:  (1) the seriousness of the offenses;  (2) the circumstances leading to the delay;  (3) the impact reprosecution would have on the administration of justice and the enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act;  and (4) any related miscellaneous factors, including whether the delay resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant.  See Hastings, 847 F.2d at 924;  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Seriousness of the Offenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the severity of the offenses, we find that this factor weighs strongly in favor of dismissal without prejudice.  We have often observed that \"the graver the crimes, the greater the insult to societal interests if the charges are dropped, once and for all, without a meaningful determination of guilt or innocence.\"  Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925.   The government charged Barnes with conspiracy to import 110 kilograms of cocaine into the United States in the type of drugs-for-profit scheme that Congress has deemed a serious felony.  See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1239 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Conspiracy to distribute a large quantity of cocaine ... is a serious crime\"), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1179, 115 S.Ct. 1164, 130 L.Ed.2d 1120 (1995);  Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925 (\"By their very nature, drugs-for-profit offenses are extremely serious.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant attempts to minimize the gravity of the charges leveled against her by asserting that the actual importation of drugs never took place and by claiming that the evidence at trial suggests that no agreement was ever reached as to the criminal enterprise.  These arguments are easily rejected.  First, the mere fact that the criminal plan was never successfully carried out is immaterial to whether the charge of conspiracy constitutes a serious offense.  As noted before, there can be little doubt that it is.  Second, despite Barnes's characterization of the evidence of her intent to conspire as weak, the trial record, which we must view in the light most favorable to the government, shows otherwise:  a jury convicted Barnes of conspiring to import cocaine and that verdict necessarily included a finding that Barnes had agreed with others to traffic in drugs.  In short, that defendant was charged with and eventually convicted of a drug trafficking conspiracy involving a considerable amount of drugs thus militates heavily in favor of permitting reprosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Circumstances Leading to the Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the relative blame each side bears in producing the unexcused delay.  The portrait of delay is somewhat complex.  There is no question that the primary blame must be assigned to the court.  The district court should have articulated its reasons for indefinitely continuing the trial date from October 8, 1996 and should not have let several months slip by before scheduling a new conference, much less a firm date for trial.  Likewise, the prosecutor, who should already have been aware that, as of the fall of 1996, at least 61 nonexcludable days had elapsed, failed to monitor scrupulously the passing days and alert the court that the deadline fast approached.  \"Even though a prosecutor does not bear the burden of monitoring the court's compliance with the [Speedy Trial Act] in absence of an announced rule, district courts do look to prosecutors for assistance as officers of the court.\"  United States v. Ramirez, 973 F.2d 36, 39 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, however, there is no evidence that the delay was caused by bad faith conduct on the part of the prosecutor.  We do note, without so finding, that government's motion seeking a status conference and a broad exclusion of time could be viewed as causing some of the post-violation delay.  A plausible interpretation of the facts certainly is that as December 1996 drew near, the government's lawyer suddenly realized that there might be a speedy trial problem and hastily added a retroactive and open-ended exclusion in an attempt to remedy the perceived difficulty.  The language contained in the motion may have misled the court into believing that Barnes had no objection as to when she might be tried.  But we do not attach too much weight to this possibility, for even if the government's counsel mischaracterized the extent of defendant's consent for the December 3, 1996 motion, the speedy trial violation had already occurred.  Thus, the government's conduct did not actually bring about the violation.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that prosecutorial misconduct rather than administrative negligence caused the 70-day deadline to be exceeded in the first place.  Where, as here, the actual speedy trial violation resulted solely from neglect rather than intentional misconduct, that circumstance tips ever so slightly in favor of dismissal without prejudice.  See, e.g., Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925-26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains, of course, the possibility that the government's actions exacerbated the delay even if they were not directly responsible for producing the violation.  We think, however, that Barnes's prompt clarification on December 10, 1996 that she was not waiving her speedy trial rights but was ready for trial sufficed to minimize this danger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding reason to spread the blame, we note, too, that Barnes herself could have pushed the proceedings along at various crucial junctures but chose not to do so.  She did not behave like a defendant who wanted her day in court posthaste.   Instead, she requested several continuances in the spring of 1996.  Furthermore, she could have objected to the adjournment of the October 7, 1996 trial date or at least have voiced her preference for a specific trial date, but she failed to clearly and loudly demand a quick trial.  And rather than immediately asserting her speedy trial rights once the violation occurred, she consented to one additional lengthy continuance after the 70-day period had already run its course.  Defendant never raised the speedy trial claim until the last possible moment--when a trial was simply unavoidable.  Although Barnes was under no obligation to monitor the clock, we nevertheless find that her willingness to abide the unexcused delay of some 5 months and participate in further delay should be counted against her.  Cf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22 (weighing defendant's failure to demand speedy trial until eve of trial against him in assessing Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim);  McAfee, 780 F.2d at 146 (dismissing indictment without prejudice where defense counsel bore some blame for delay).  We have already determined that the indictment must be dismissed.  She should not be doubly rewarded for sitting silently as the delay mounted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>3. Effect of Reprosecution on Administration of Justice and</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Enforcement of the Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect that reprosecution would have on the administration of justice and enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act likewise does not call for barring reprosecution.  To be sure, the orderly administration of justice necessarily is hindered to some degree whenever the Act is violated.  Nevertheless, a retrial should not take more than one week (the first trial lasted four days), and there is no reason to believe that reprosecution would otherwise have a deleterious effect on the fair and efficient administration of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act would not be unduly hampered by allowing Barnes to be retried.  There is little doubt that the harsh remedy of dismissal with prejudice has greater deterrence value than its counterpart.  But considerations of general deterrence are not dispositive or else dismissal with prejudice would impermissibly become the preferred tool.  See United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326, 334, 108 S.Ct. 2413, 101 L.Ed.2d 297 (1988) (\"Congress did not intend any particular type of dismissal to serve as the presumptive remedy for a Speedy Trial Act violation.\").  Moreover, the fact that a retrial might be necessary at all is often deterrence enough.  We find that to be true here.  As the Supreme Court has observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>Dismissal without prejudice is not a toothless sanction:  it forces the Government to obtain a new indictment if it decides to reprosecute, and it exposes the prosecution to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.  Given the burdens borne by the prosecution and the effects of delay on the Government's ability to meet those burdens, substantial delay well may make reprosecution, even if permitted, unlikely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 342, 108 S.Ct. 2413.   Conversely, little would be gained in the case at bar by foreclosing the possibility of another trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>4. Miscellaneous Factors:  Length of Delay and Actual Prejudice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two final closely related considerations merit discussion:  the length of delay and actual prejudice.  On its face, the length of delay in this case--more than twice the extent statutorily permissible--is troubling.  At first blush the sheer length of unexcused delay might suggest actual prejudice, but Barnes has never once claimed that the delay adversely affected her ability to prepare for trial, much less articulated any facts suggesting how she was actually prejudiced by the tardy trial date.

Perhaps Mr. Homans, who was sick from pneumonia during this period and eventually died, informally moved for a continuance at some point.  Yet this scenario is unlikely.  The trial court's ambiguous allusion to his illness may have simply been to his earlier request for an adjournment on March 18, 1996.  In addition, the government itself later acknowledged to the trial court that Mr. Homans's health \"didn't create any problem\" and that his associate skillfully replaced him as early as August of 1996.  Finally, the government has not once argued on appeal that Mr. Homans's battle with pneumonia caused the October 8 trial to be adjourned.  Even if this explains why the court adjourned the trial, however, the reason should have been made explicit in the record</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> While open-ended continuances are not per se impermissible in this Circuit, we have often stated that \"it is generally preferable to limit a continuance to a definite period for the sake of clarity and certainty.\"  Rush, 738 F.2d at 508</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The government argues, implausibly, that \"the court could have scheduled the trial for a much later date, and still been within the terms of defendant's waiver;\" that \"[i]n light of this waiver, the defendant should not be allowed to use the period of delay prior to the setting of the new trial date in support of her request for dismissal.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Her appeal presents a single question:  whether she was tried within the 70-day time limit imposed by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first day of trial, Barnes moved to dismiss the indictment, alleging that her right to a speedy trial had been violated.  The district court denied the motion, and Barnes was subsequently tried and convicted on both counts.  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to dismiss.  In this case, the court failed to police the speedy trial clock vigilantly during a crucial 5-month period beginning in the fall of 1996 when the trial date was inexplicably adjourned.  As a result, the 70-day limit was exceeded by some 121 days.  We find, however, that the seriousness of the offenses with which defendant was charged, the absence of any actual prejudice to her, and defendant's own failure to promptly assert her speedy trial rights warrant dismissal of the indictment without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by recounting the path Barnes's case took below.  On August 10, 1995, a complaint was issued in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Barnes and her brother Reynaldo Barnes with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States from Panama.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Federal law enforcement agents arrested Barnes on August 11, 1995 in Brooklyn, New York, pursuant to a warrant issued by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  She appeared before a magistrate judge in the Eastern District of New York that same day.  An order was entered 3 days later removing Barnes to the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 23, 1995, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Barnes and her brother, charging them with conspiracy to import cocaine under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963 (1998) and with criminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes's first appearance before a judicial officer in Massachusetts took place on September 25, 1995 before United States Magistrate Judge Joyce L. Alexander.  A briefing schedule for pretrial motions was set at this conference:  all motions were to be filed by October 3, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 1995, Reynaldo Barnes filed a motion seeking additional time to file pretrial motions up to and including October 13, 1995.  This motion was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes was arraigned on October 3, 1995;  she entered a plea of not guilty to both counts.  At defendant's request, Magistrate Judge Alexander extended the time to file pretrial motions to October 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1995, defendants filed a flurry of pretrial motions seeking, inter alia, a bill of particulars, various discovery items, and Jencks Act material.  Magistrate Judge Alexander held a hearing on these motions on November 30, 1995, after which she took the matters under advisement, and eventually disposed of all motions on December 14, 1995.  An order of excludable delay was thereafter entered, excluding the period of time from October 20 to December 14, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no formal activity in the case until January 24, 1996, when the government formally moved the court to schedule a status conference to \"enable the Court and parties to establish a firm date for trial, facilitate the identification and resolution of any anticipated evidentiary issues at trial, and possibly facilitate the resolution of this case prior to trial.\"   The district court granted the motion on January 31, 1996, and scheduled a conference for February 20, 1996.  By letter dated February 7, 1996, Reynaldo Barnes requested that the conference be adjourned because his counsel, William P. Homans, was to be on trial in another case that same week.  The court granted the motion on February 9, rescheduling the conference for March 4, 1996.  On March 4, 1996, the status conference was held, during which the court set a trial date of April 8, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 1996, defendants jointly moved to continue the trial date to June 10, 1996 and to exclude the time from the date of the motion until the new trial date.  Defendants cited three reasons for the request:  Mr. Homans was recovering from pneumonia, defendants were engaged in ongoing plea negotiations with the government, and a conflict had arisen in the trial schedule of Barnes's attorney, Stephen B. Hrones.  Their motion was granted by the court on March 19, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical chain of events central to this appeal then occurred.  On May 30, 1996, Barnes moved the district court for another continuance \"until sometime in late September or early October.\"   She explained that her counsel was engaged in another trial on June 10.  The court granted the motion by memorandum order on June 3, 1996 and continued the trial until October 7, 1996 at 11:00 a.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for a continuance was followed by defendants' joint motion to \"waive their speedy trial rights from June 10 until the date set for the new trial in the fall of 1996.\"   The motion to waive was granted by margin order on August 28, 1996, and the court expressly excluded time from the Speedy Trial clock through October 7, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is far from certain precisely what happened next, the record suggests that the court set this matter down for trial for October 7, 1996 at 11:00 a.m. and then telephonically adjourned the trial without date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  No one appeared for trial on October 7. Neither defendant nor the government can explain why the trial did not go forward.  Neither the government nor any of the defendants apparently requested a continuance or objected to it;  no one seems to remember when the trial was adjourned.  The district court never explicitly excluded time from the speedy trial clock or made any findings as to why the adjournment was required in the interests of justice.  It did not issue a written order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, 1996, after two months had passed, the parties jointly moved the court for a status conference for the purpose of setting a trial date.  The motion included an odd statement:  \"the parties jointly move to exclude the period of delay in the interests of justice and due to continuing plea negotiations, from the date of entry of an Order on defendant's pre-trial motions until such date as this Court sets for trial.\"  (Emphasis added.)   By its terms, the motion sought a retroactive and an unlimited forward-looking exclusion of time.  The motion was signed only by the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") on behalf of both the government and Barnes.  Barnes's attorney, Mr. Hrones, did not sign the papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seven days later, Barnes filed a \"Motion to Correct a Joint Motion for Status Conference\" protesting the government's effort to have time excluded by the court.  This document stated that \"although [her] attorney authorized the Joint Motion for Status Conference he did not give authority to [the AUSA] to add a paragraph indicating that the defendant had agreed to exclude the period of delay.\"   Barnes indicated that she opposed any exclusion of the delay, having \"made clear for some time now to [the AUSA] that [sh]e want[ed] a trial.\"   Accordingly, Barnes requested that the court \"strike the defendant's name from her request to exclude the delay.\"   The government did not oppose defendant's motion to correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7, 1997--some three months later--the court sent defendants and the government a notice informing them that a conference had been scheduled for March 25, 1997.  The court did not exclude any time, either forward or backward, as requested in the purported joint motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two noteworthy events transpired at the March 25 status conference.  First, Reynaldo Barnes moved to change his plea.  The motion was granted and a date was set for his anticipated plea of guilty.  Second, the court reset Barnes's trial date for May 5, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 1997, the government, with defendant's consent, filed a motion to continue the trial from May 5 to May 19, 1997.  Accordingly, the district court memo endorsed the motion and rescheduled trial for May 19, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 15, 1997, Reynaldo Barnes pled guilty to both offenses.  The next day, May 16, 1997, the government filed a motion in limine seeking an order permitting the government to use transcripts of recorded conversations between undercover agents and defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 19, 1997, the first day of trial but before jury selection, Barnes moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of the Speedy Trial Act.  The court denied the motion but made no factual findings beyond observing that Mr. Hrones was on trial in another case on May 5, \"the last time the case was going to be scheduled,\" and that Reynaldo Barnes's counsel, Mr. Homans, was sick for a period of time.  The court then resolved all outstanding motions in limine and empaneled the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes was tried and convicted on both counts, and was eventually sentenced to 188 months in prison, to be followed by five years of supervised release.

Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. When Did the Time Begin to Accrue?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue to be resolved is when the speedy trial clock began to tick.  Section 3161(c)(1) requires that a defendant be tried within 70 days of the occurrence of one of two events:  the filing of the indictment or the defendant's appearance \"before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes, relying on a separate provision of the Act that governs the tolling of time for unreasonable delays associated with the transfer of defendants, argues that any amount of time above and beyond the 10 days between the entry of the order compelling her removal from New York and her actual arrival in Massachusetts should count toward the 70-day limit.  Section 3161(h)(1)(H) provides that any unreasonable delay resulting from the transfer of a defendant is includable, and mandates that any such delay in excess of ten days from the date of the order directing transportation and \"the defendant's arrival at the destination\" be presumed unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barnes's reliance on this provision to start the speedy trial clock is misplaced.  It is a tolling provision, not one that sets forth the events that trigger the start of the 70-day period in which a trial must be held.  The pre-indictment or pre-appearance transfer of a defendant is not explicitly listed as one of the only two triggering events in section 3161(c)(1), and we decline to read into that provision what was not expressly included by Congress.  Accordingly, while delay resulting from such a transfer may count toward the 30-day arrest-to-indictment period, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b), it does not start the 70-day speedy trial clock.  The delay resulting from the transfer of Barnes from New York to Massachusetts thus took place well before the clock even began to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the terms of the Act, we conclude that time on Barnes's speedy trial clock began to accrue on September 26, 1995, the day after her first appearance before a magistrate judge in the District of Massachusetts.  The date of the conference, is, of course, excludable as a \"proceeding concerning the defendant.\"  United States v.

The clock stopped on May 19, 1997, Barnes's first day of trial.  A total of 601 days passed between the start of the speedy trial clock and the date it stopped for good on May 19, 1997.  We now evaluate which of these days are excludable and which must be counted toward the 70-day deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Excludable Days</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While September 26, 1995 must be counted, the entire period between September 27, 1995 and December 14, 1995 must be excluded from the final tally.  On September 27, 1995 Barnes's codefendant moved for an extension of time to file pretrial motions.  The motion was granted until October 13, 1995, and the deadline was later extended again until October 20, 1995.  It is well-settled that an exclusion of time attributable to one defendant is applicable for all codefendants.  See id. at 19.   Therefore, this time is not counted toward the 70 days.  See United States v. Jodoin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"400080\"><a href=\"/opinion/400080/united-states-v-peter-jodoin/\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 237 (1st Cir.1982) (excluding time that elapsed due to defendant's request for an extension of time as \"directly attributable to [his] ... motion\").  The magistrate judge also properly excluded the period between the actual filing of the motions (October 20, 1995) and the hearing on the motions (November 13, 1995), for it falls under section 3161(h)(1)(F) as \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, ... such motion.\"   Similarly, the magistrate judge correctly excluded the thirty days between November 14 and December 14 during which she had the initial batch of pretrial motions under advisement.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(J).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes that the 40 days between December 15 and January 23, 1996 are not excludable.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Motion Requesting a Status Conference</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The excludability of the next segment of time turns on whether the government's motion to set a status conference filed on January 24, 1996 is a \"pretrial motion\" within the meaning of section 3161(h)(1)(F).  Barnes argues that such a motion does not qualify as a pretrial motion because it is not of a \"substantive\" nature.  For its part, the government insists that it is a pretrial motion and argues that time should be excluded from the moment the motion was filed until the date of the requested status conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that a motion requesting the scheduling of a pretrial conference is a \"pretrial motion\" so as to trigger an exclusion under the Speedy Trial Act.  Section 3161(h)(1)(F) states, rather expansively, that delay resulting from \"any pretrial motion\" shall be excluded.  It does not distinguish between more significant or complex \"pretrial motions\" and simple or routine motions.  For this reason, we have read the term \"pretrial motion\" broadly to encompass all manner of motions, ranging from informal requests for laboratory reports, see United States v. Jorge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516496\"><a href=\"/opinion/516496/united-states-v-youssef-jorge/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span> (1989), to \"implied\" requests for a new trial date, see Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 17.   A motion requesting the scheduling of a status conference has undeniable \"pretrial\" significance:  all kinds of matters affecting the course of trial, including discovery, motions, and trial dates may be discussed at such a conference.  Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 17.1 (\"[T]he court upon motion of any party or upon its own motion may order one or more conferences to consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious trial.\").  There seems to be no good reason to exclude a motion for a status conference from the universe of possible pretrial motions.  See, e.g., United States v. Bellucci, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></span>, 710 (D.Mass.1990) (Tauro, D.J.)  (holding that motion for status conference was pretrial motion for purposes of tolling Speedy Trial Act).  Hence, in this case, the clock stopped as soon as the government filed its motion seeking a status conference on January 24, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is how much time should be tolled.  The Supreme Court has construed subsection (F) as setting forth a two-tiered approach to determining the extent of excludable delay caused by the submission and disposition of pretrial motions.  See Henderson, 476 U.S. at 329-30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1871</span></a></span>.   For a pretrial motion on which a hearing is held, the entire period from the filing of the motion to the date of the hearing, regardless of when the hearing is scheduled, plus up to 30 additional days while the motion is \"under advisement\" is automatically excluded.  See id.;  Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1163.   By contrast, when \"motions that require no hearing\" are involved, time is tolled only until the \"prompt disposition\" of the motion, which ordinarily cannot exceed the 30-day \"under advisement\" period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Henderson, 476 U.S. at 329, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No. 96-212, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., at 34 (1979) (\"[I]f motions are so simple or routine that they do not require a hearing, necessary advisement time should be considerably less than 30 days.\").  A motion is deemed to be taken under advisement when \" 'the court receives all the papers it reasonably expects.' \"  Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1163 (quoting Henderson, 476 U.S. at 329, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1165-66;  United States v. Ferris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446335\"><a href=\"/opinion/446335/united-states-v-donald-f-ferris/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 440 (1st Cir.1984);  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(J).  It follows that such a motion is resolved as soon as the conference is actually scheduled--not when the various matters for possible discussion, in fact, are broached--and that the clock will start again the following day.  The government disagrees, arguing that the clock should be tolled until the actual date of the conference, which it calls a \"hearing\";  but to adopt this reasoning would contravene the language of the Act.  Because the setting of the date resolves the motion in its entirety, the conference cannot possibly represent a \"hearing on ... such motion.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Staula, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196665\"><a href=\"/opinion/196665/united-states-v-staula/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), we held that \"a hearing is any on-the-record colloquy in which the district court hears the arguments of counsel and considers those arguments prior to deciding a pending motion.\"  Id. at 602.   Our reasoning today is entirely consistent with that decision.  Once a conference has been set down on a court's calendar, there is no longer any \"pending motion\" to decide.  The motion seeking a status conference has already been resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, there are varieties of motions that may or may not require a hearing.  But we need not wander too deeply into this thicket today, for we hold only that motions seeking nothing more than the scheduling of a conference must be acted upon within 30 days.  In doing so, we emphasize that, consistent with the letter and spirit of the Speedy Trial Act, relatively simple motions should be disposed of expeditiously or the clock will resume ticking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the foregoing principles to the present facts, we find that the clock was tolled from January 24 until January 31, 1996.  The clock ran for the next six days and stopped again on February 7, 1996, when Reynaldo Barnes moved to adjourn the conference.  Although the court made no express findings in granting the motion, the letter motion itself makes clear that Reynaldo Barnes's counsel was unavailable until at least the first of March due to conflicts with his work and personal schedules.  Thus, the court's decision to grant the continuance comports with the requirements of section 3161(h)(8)(A).  See United States v. Rush, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438673\"><a href=\"/opinion/438673/united-states-v-donald-nixon-rush-larry-joseph-lancelotti-gregory-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 507 (1st Cir.1984) (\"[I]t is not necessary for the court to articulate the basic facts when they are obvious and set forth in a motion for a continuance.\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The clock temporarily stopped again on March 18 due to defendants' two overlapping requests to postpone the trial, and remained stopped until October 8, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, 61 nonexcludable days had already accrued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>2. Adjournment of the October 8, 1996 Trial Date</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case turns on the period starting with the October 8, 1996 trial date.  Frankly, we, like the attorneys for both sides, are confused as to the exact circumstances surrounding the adjournment of the October 7, 1996 trial date.  It is a mystery.  Neither the government nor any of the defendants formally moved for a continuance, although it is theoretically possible that someone so moved informally.  One would, however, usually expect one party to accuse the other of requesting a continuance if an informal request had been made by one of the lawyers;  but no illuminating bout of finger-pointing has erupted.  This suggests that the court, on its own volition, ordered the adjournment without date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The government contends that the trial was adjourned upon consent of defendant, but the record reflects no such consent.  To accept the government's position therefore requires us to infer from silence that defendant's consent was given.  This we cannot do.  What is apparent is that even assuming a trial date was set for October 7 and then continued by the court without objection, the grant of such a continuance--of which there is no contemporaneous written or oral record--fails to comply with the Act.  See Amended Speedy Trial Act Guidelines, Aug. 28, 1981, reprinted in Robert L. Misner, Speedy Trial Federal and State Practice, App.  B, at 775 (\"The fact that the defendant has requested the continuance or consents to it is not in itself sufficient to toll the operation of the time limits.\").  Whether time resulting from a continuance may toll the Act depends on whether the court abused its discretion by granting the continuance.  See Pringle, 751 F.2d at 432.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the court should not have adjourned the trial date in the manner that it did.  A trial court's discretion to invoke the ends of justice exception by granting a continuance is exceedingly \"narrow,\" and should not be done \"lightly or routinely.\"  United States v.

There is simply no record of the continuance.  Although we have held that there is no need to articulate the basic facts critical to a motion for a continuance when they are set forth in the motion papers, see Rush, 738 F.2d at 507, here, no one moved to continue the trial.  Consequently, we cannot say with any reasonable certainty that the continuance met the ends of justice standard, especially where the parties themselves have offered no explanation for why or when the trial date was adjourned.  The lack of findings is particularly troubling because of the open-ended nature of the continuance granted here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  A firm trial date was not set until the March 25, 1997 conference--more than five months after it was last continued.  For these reasons, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in granting (or sua sponte ordering) the continuance, and the resulting delay of 56 days must be counted against the speedy trial clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The Pringle Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to defeat the operation of the Act, the government argues that the entire period of time from October 7, 1996 onward must be excluded because Barnes waived her right to a speedy trial.  The government maintains that Barnes's June 6, 1996 waiver impermissibly lulled it and the district court to sleep.  We reject the government's theory of an unlimited waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants generally may not elect to waive the protections of the Act.  The reason is that the public has at least as great an interest as the defendant in an expeditious criminal trial.  See United States v.

In Pringle, defendants had sought to continue the trial, declaring that \"all defendants waive[d] their rights to a speedy trial.\"  751 F.2d at 433.   Defendants later moved to dismiss the indictment based on the delay that ensued in selecting a new trial date.  The district court denied the motion.  We affirmed, holding, inter alia, that although a defendant cannot waive the right to speedy trial, he or she cannot \"lull[ ] the court and prosecution into a false sense of security only to turn around later and use the waiver-induced leisurely pace of the case as grounds for dismissal.\"  Id. at 434.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government here asserts that defendants' June 6, 1996 waiver was indefinite in scope, tolling the clock up to and including the first date of trial in May 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Relying on Pringle, the government argues that the waiver provided by defendants caused the delay by misleading the government and the court into believing that any date would be acceptable to them.  While any waiver would technically be inoperative, if the government is correct about the nature of the waiver, the delay that resulted from the waiver would be excludable under Pringle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded that the Pringle exception applies to the extent suggested by the government.  While defendants' waiver definitely contributed to a delay until October 7, Barnes cannot be held responsible for the delay that occurred after trial was initially set for that date and then subsequently continued.  We reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, defendants did not offer an open-ended waiver.  Unlike the sweeping language contained in defendants' waiver in Pringle, the waiver at issue does not represent defendants' consent to an indefinite exclusion of time, but authorized time to be excluded only \"until the date set for the new trial in the fall of 1996.\"   By its terms, the document did not waive Barnes's speedy trial rights indefinitely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if there was any ambiguity as to the scope of the waiver, the extraneous evidence conclusively puts that doubt to rest in Barnes's favor.  The waiver closely followed and was inextricably bound up with Barnes's request for an adjournment until \"late September or early October.\"   Thus, read together with her motion to continue, the waiver put the district court and the government on notice that Barnes desired a trial by October 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, no one was \"lull[ed]\" to sleep by the waiver.  The \"joint motion for a status conference\" later drafted by the government proves this.  In the motion, the parties purportedly sought an exclusion of time \"from the date of an entry of an Order on defendant's pre-trial motions until such date as this Court sets for trial.\"  (A.37).  But if the government had truly believed that Barnes had already provided an open-ended waiver on June 6, 1996, such a broad and seemingly retroactive exclusion of time would have been unnecessary.  The government's own actions therefore suggest that the government itself believed that there might still be a speedy trial problem even after defendants signed the waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the trial court acted on defendants' motions (including the waiver) by continuing the trial only until October 7, 1996, showing that it, too, understood that Barnes wished to be tried by October 1996.  The date set by the court stood at the very end of the spectrum of Barnes's waiver.  At best, Barnes may be said to have consented to and caused the delay throughout the fall of 1996, tolling the clock under Pringle until early October, but certainly no later.  In other words, the limited waiver did not \"create the delay[ ]\" that transpired when the date was adjourned from October 7.  Id. at 434.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record even remotely suggests that Barnes strategically attempted to \"sandbag\" anyone.  Instead, the record shows that she made clear to the court and prosecution that she desired to be tried in the fall of 1996, at the latest by \"early October.\"   That did not happen.  The reasons for this delay have not been made clear by the guardians of the speedy trial clock:  the court, and to a lesser extent, the government.  Whether the continuance was justified and the court neglected to make the necessary ends of justice findings or the government simply lost track of the days makes no difference.  The unexplained delay occurred;  it must be accounted for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Barnes is guilty of anything during this crucial time frame, it is that she did not object earlier.  But her mere failure to object to a delay does not constitute \"work[ing] both sides of the street,\" Pringle, 751 F.2d at 434, and it does not excuse the trial court's failure to make explicit findings as to why a continuance best served the interests of justice.  To hold otherwise would be to permit the finding of a waiver whenever a defendant fails to object to a continuance.  Such a conclusion would turn the Act on its head by shifting the burden of enforcing the Act to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. Post-Violation Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Speedy Trial Act was violated as early as October 16, 1996, we press on with our analysis to discern the full extent of the unexcused trial delay.  Because the continuance was defective, the clock continued to run unabated until December 3, 1996, the date the government filed the \"joint motion\" seeking the scheduling of a conference for the purpose of setting a firm trial date and an exclusion of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for a status conference was considered to be under advisement on December 10, 1996, the date Barnes filed her opposition to the request to exclude time.  Hence, the 30-day period from December 11, 1996 through January 9, 1997 is excluded.  But the trial court did not act on this motion until March 7, 1997, long after this 30-day window had shut, and \"[w]e see no reason why the pretrial conference could not have been scheduled sooner than it was.\"  Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1048.   Accordingly, January 10, 1997 through March 24, 1997, the additional 74 days that accrued before the court actually resolved the motion, must count on the clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also contends that terms of the so-called joint motion for a status conference warrant excluding the time from December 3, 1996 onward.  The problem with this argument is that the court never actually excluded any time based on this motion.  It simply set a date for a conference months later, either ignoring or implicitly rejecting the request to exclude time.  Given the hotly-disputed nature of the request, including whether Barnes had given her consent to make it, we cannot say that the court erred by refusing to exclude time.  For this reason, the motion does not toll the Act for more than the 30 days during which it should have been decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving forward, we find that the 56 days between March 25, 1997 and May 19, 1997 must be excluded.  At the March 25 conference, Reynaldo Barnes moved to change his plea, and the court accepted his guilty plea at a hearing on May 15, 1997.  The intervening time is not counted, for \"all of the days between the date a codefendant files a motion for a change of plea and the date of the change of plea hearing itself are excludable from the [Act]'s seventy-day time limit.\"  Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 20.   Moreover, the overlapping adjournment sought by Barnes covers the period from April 4, 1997 until the first day of trial.  It goes without saying that the government's in limine motion filed May 16, 1997 also tolled the clock until the motion was resolved on the first day of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we find that 191 days of nonexcludable time elapsed between Barnes's first appearance before the magistrate judge in the District of Massachusetts and the first day of trial.  Forty-one days passed by the time of defendant's first conference before the district court;  20 days elapsed between February 1 and October 8, 1996;  56 days passed between the October 8, 1996 trial date and the filing of the joint motion requesting a conference on December 3, 1996;  and 74 days of unexcused time elapsed while the motion requesting a pretrial conference was pending (excluding the 30-day under-advisement period).  The 70-day limit was clearly exceeded.  The indictment should have been dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final inquiry is whether the indictment should now be dismissed with or without prejudice.  Our usual practice is to remand to the trial court to address this question, for it is best situated to assess the degree of the violation and its likely effect on the parties involved.  Nevertheless, we find that the only proper remedy in this case is to dismiss the indictment without prejudice.  For this reason, as well as for the sake of judicial economy, we make this determination in the first instance.  See United States v. McAfee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462587\"><a href=\"/opinion/462587/united-states-v-james-crawford-mcafee-lloyd-cowan-parker-william-bull/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 146 (1st Cir.1985) (deciding proper remedy on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis is guided by the following considerations:  (1) the seriousness of the offenses;  (2) the circumstances leading to the delay;  (3) the impact reprosecution would have on the administration of justice and the enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act;  and (4) any related miscellaneous factors, including whether the delay resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant.  See Hastings, 847 F.2d at 924;  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Seriousness of the Offenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the severity of the offenses, we find that this factor weighs strongly in favor of dismissal without prejudice.  We have often observed that \"the graver the crimes, the greater the insult to societal interests if the charges are dropped, once and for all, without a meaningful determination of guilt or innocence.\"  Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925.   The government charged Barnes with conspiracy to import 110 kilograms of cocaine into the United States in the type of drugs-for-profit scheme that Congress has deemed a serious felony.  See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195659\"><a href=\"/opinion/195659/united-states-v-delgado-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1239 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Conspiracy to distribute a large quantity of cocaine ... is a serious crime\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></span> (1995);  Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925 (\"By their very nature, drugs-for-profit offenses are extremely serious.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant attempts to minimize the gravity of the charges leveled against her by asserting that the actual importation of drugs never took place and by claiming that the evidence at trial suggests that no agreement was ever reached as to the criminal enterprise.  These arguments are easily rejected.  First, the mere fact that the criminal plan was never successfully carried out is immaterial to whether the charge of conspiracy constitutes a serious offense.  As noted before, there can be little doubt that it is.  Second, despite Barnes's characterization of the evidence of her intent to conspire as weak, the trial record, which we must view in the light most favorable to the government, shows otherwise:  a jury convicted Barnes of conspiring to import cocaine and that verdict necessarily included a finding that Barnes had agreed with others to traffic in drugs.  In short, that defendant was charged with and eventually convicted of a drug trafficking conspiracy involving a considerable amount of drugs thus militates heavily in favor of permitting reprosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Circumstances Leading to the Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the relative blame each side bears in producing the unexcused delay.  The portrait of delay is somewhat complex.  There is no question that the primary blame must be assigned to the court.  The district court should have articulated its reasons for indefinitely continuing the trial date from October 8, 1996 and should not have let several months slip by before scheduling a new conference, much less a firm date for trial.  Likewise, the prosecutor, who should already have been aware that, as of the fall of 1996, at least 61 nonexcludable days had elapsed, failed to monitor scrupulously the passing days and alert the court that the deadline fast approached.  \"Even though a prosecutor does not bear the burden of monitoring the court's compliance with the [Speedy Trial Act] in absence of an announced rule, district courts do look to prosecutors for assistance as officers of the court.\"  United States v. Ramirez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589647\"><a href=\"/opinion/589647/united-states-v-domingo-ramirez-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, however, there is no evidence that the delay was caused by bad faith conduct on the part of the prosecutor.  We do note, without so finding, that government's motion seeking a status conference and a broad exclusion of time could be viewed as causing some of the post-violation delay.  A plausible interpretation of the facts certainly is that as December 1996 drew near, the government's lawyer suddenly realized that there might be a speedy trial problem and hastily added a retroactive and open-ended exclusion in an attempt to remedy the perceived difficulty.  The language contained in the motion may have misled the court into believing that Barnes had no objection as to when she might be tried.  But we do not attach too much weight to this possibility, for even if the government's counsel mischaracterized the extent of defendant's consent for the December 3, 1996 motion, the speedy trial violation had already occurred.  Thus, the government's conduct did not actually bring about the violation.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that prosecutorial misconduct rather than administrative negligence caused the 70-day deadline to be exceeded in the first place.  Where, as here, the actual speedy trial violation resulted solely from neglect rather than intentional misconduct, that circumstance tips ever so slightly in favor of dismissal without prejudice.  See, e.g., Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925-26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains, of course, the possibility that the government's actions exacerbated the delay even if they were not directly responsible for producing the violation.  We think, however, that Barnes's prompt clarification on December 10, 1996 that she was not waiving her speedy trial rights but was ready for trial sufficed to minimize this danger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding reason to spread the blame, we note, too, that Barnes herself could have pushed the proceedings along at various crucial junctures but chose not to do so.  She did not behave like a defendant who wanted her day in court posthaste.   Instead, she requested several continuances in the spring of 1996.  Furthermore, she could have objected to the adjournment of the October 7, 1996 trial date or at least have voiced her preference for a specific trial date, but she failed to clearly and loudly demand a quick trial.  And rather than immediately asserting her speedy trial rights once the violation occurred, she consented to one additional lengthy continuance after the 70-day period had already run its course.  Defendant never raised the speedy trial claim until the last possible moment--when a trial was simply unavoidable.  Although Barnes was under no obligation to monitor the clock, we nevertheless find that her willingness to abide the unexcused delay of some 5 months and participate in further delay should be counted against her.  Cf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22 (weighing defendant's failure to demand speedy trial until eve of trial against him in assessing Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim);  McAfee, 780 F.2d at 146 (dismissing indictment without prejudice where defense counsel bore some blame for delay).  We have already determined that the indictment must be dismissed.  She should not be doubly rewarded for sitting silently as the delay mounted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>3. Effect of Reprosecution on Administration of Justice and</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Enforcement of the Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect that reprosecution would have on the administration of justice and enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act likewise does not call for barring reprosecution.  To be sure, the orderly administration of justice necessarily is hindered to some degree whenever the Act is violated.  Nevertheless, a retrial should not take more than one week (the first trial lasted four days), and there is no reason to believe that reprosecution would otherwise have a deleterious effect on the fair and efficient administration of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, enforcement of the Speedy Trial Act would not be unduly hampered by allowing Barnes to be retried.  There is little doubt that the harsh remedy of dismissal with prejudice has greater deterrence value than its counterpart.  But considerations of general deterrence are not dispositive or else dismissal with prejudice would impermissibly become the preferred tool.  See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 334, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span> (1988) (\"Congress did not intend any particular type of dismissal to serve as the presumptive remedy for a Speedy Trial Act violation.\").  Moreover, the fact that a retrial might be necessary at all is often deterrence enough.  We find that to be true here.  As the Supreme Court has observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>Dismissal without prejudice is not a toothless sanction:  it forces the Government to obtain a new indictment if it decides to reprosecute, and it exposes the prosecution to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.  Given the burdens borne by the prosecution and the effects of delay on the Government's ability to meet those burdens, substantial delay well may make reprosecution, even if permitted, unlikely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 342, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2413</span></a></span>.   Conversely, little would be gained in the case at bar by foreclosing the possibility of another trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>4. Miscellaneous Factors:  Length of Delay and Actual Prejudice</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two final closely related considerations merit discussion:  the length of delay and actual prejudice.  On its face, the length of delay in this case--more than twice the extent statutorily permissible--is troubling.  At first blush the sheer length of unexcused delay might suggest actual prejudice, but Barnes has never once claimed that the delay adversely affected her ability to prepare for trial, much less articulated any facts suggesting how she was actually prejudiced by the tardy trial date.  The absence of any consequential prejudice to defendant points toward permitting a new trial.  See Taylor, 487 U.S. at 341, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2413</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weighing all of these circumstances as a whole, we conclude that dismissal without prejudice is the appropriate remedy.  In fashioning the proper curative, we find dispositive that the crimes charged are grave, that there is no evidence of bad faith conduct on the part of the government, that the record reveals no actual prejudice to the defendant, and that defendant contributed to some of the delay by repeatedly seeking adjournments and by not asserting her rights as soon as the violation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court denying defendant's motion to dismiss is reversed, her conviction and sentence are hereby vacated, and the indictment is dismissed as to her without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Reynaldo Barnes's appeal is not before us.

See Henderson, 476 U.S. at 331, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Perhaps Mr. Homans, who was sick from pneumonia during this period and eventually died, informally moved for a continuance at some point.  Yet this scenario is unlikely.  The trial court's ambiguous allusion to his illness may have simply been to his earlier request for an adjournment on March 18, 1996.  In addition, the government itself later acknowledged to the trial court that Mr. Homans's health \"didn't create any problem\" and that his associate skillfully replaced him as early as August of 1996.  Finally, the government has not once argued on appeal that Mr. Homans's battle with pneumonia caused the October 8 trial to be adjourned.  Even if this explains why the court adjourned the trial, however, the reason should have been made explicit in the record</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> While open-ended continuances are not per se impermissible in this Circuit, we have often stated that \"it is generally preferable to limit a continuance to a definite period for the sake of clarity and certainty.\"  Rush, 738 F.2d at 508</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The government argues, implausibly, that \"the court could have scheduled the trial for a much later date, and still been within the terms of defendant's waiver;\" that \"[i]n light of this waiver, the defendant should not be allowed to use the period of delay prior to the setting of the new trial date in support of her request for dismissal.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
