TORRES AND IDA CLAUDIO,\r\n\n                 Plaintiffs, Appellees,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n              PUERTO RICO TOURISM COMPANY,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n   [Hon. Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n        Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJose R. Perez-Hernandez for appellant.\r\nErick Morales for appellees.\r\n\nApril 6, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  This lawsuit involves\r\nclaims brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\r\n42 U.S.C.   12101-12213, and several Puerto Rico statutes.  The\r\ndefendant-appellant, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (\"the Tourism\r\nCompany\"), claims that the district court erred in refusing to\r\ndismiss the case in light of the Eleventh Amendment, which protects\r\nstates from suit in federal court.  We conclude that, in the face\r\nof an explicit statutory provision abrogating Eleventh Amendment\r\nimmunity in ADA cases and the absence of a meaningful challenge to\r\nthe validity of that abrogation, the court's judgment on the ADA\r\nclaim should be affirmed.  We remand, however, for the district\r\ncourt to consider whether the pendent Puerto Rico claims benefit\r\nfrom a similar abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity. If not,\r\nthose claims must be dismissed.\r\n                     I. Discussion\r\nThe facts underlying plaintiffs' claims play no role in\r\nthis appeal, and we therefore note only in passing that the case\r\nconcerns an employee's contention that he suffered injury from\r\nexposure to second-hand cigarette smoke while working for the\r\nTourism Company as a casino inspector.  Our disposition instead\r\ninvolves  procedural aspects of the case, particularly defendant's\r\nfailure to address in a timely or meaningful manner the express\r\nabrogation of the Eleventh Amendment contained in the ADA.  We\r\nbegin by relating in some detail the travel of the case in the\r\ndistrict court, pause for a review of Eleventh Amendment\r\nprinciples, and then pick up the proceedings on appeal.\r\nA. The Litigation Starts.\r\nPlaintiffs filed their complaint in August 1995 and an\r\nanswer was filed in October of the same year.  No reference was\r\nmade in either document to the Eleventh Amendment, the ADA's\r\nexpress abrogation provision, or the power of Congress to abrogate\r\na state's immunity.  The only arguably relevant reference was the\r\ninclusion, in a list of ten \"affirmative defenses,\" of an item\r\nreading \"Lacks [sic] of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\r\nAbout two years after the time period for filing\r\ndispositive motions had passed, and apparently as a result of a\r\nchange of counsel, defendant in May 1998 filed a motion for summary\r\njudgment asserting, inter alia, that the complaint was barred by\r\nthe Eleventh Amendment, which prohibits suit by private parties\r\nagainst a state in federal court, without that state's consent. \r\nThe motion focused on the Tourism Company's status as an\r\n\"instrumentality\" of the state and its consequent entitlement to\r\nEleventh Amendment protection.\r\nPlaintiffs responded by arguing that the motion should be\r\ndenied as late.  The district court agreed and issued the following\r\norder:\r\nThis motion is ordered stricken from the\r\nrecord as untimely and because it constitutes\r\na violation of the Court's case management\r\norders.  Any further attempts to file untimely\r\ndispositive motions will be subject to\r\nsanctions.\r\n\nThe Tourism Company sought reconsideration, repeating its\r\nearlier Eleventh Amendment argument, and, in a response that was\r\nstyled as a motion for sanctions, the plaintiffs argued that the\r\nEleventh Amendment immunity was patently inapplicable based on the\r\nstatutory definition of employer in the ADA, which excluded the\r\nUnited States but not state governments.  The district court denied\r\nthe defendant's request for reconsideration without comment, and \r\ndenied the motion for sanctions without prejudice to renew once any\r\nappeal is decided.\r\n\nB. Eleventh Amendment Basics.\r\nAt this juncture, some basic tenets of Eleventh Amendment\r\njurisprudence need to be articulated to give context to the\r\nproceedings in both the district court and on appeal.  First, it is\r\nwell established that the principles of the Eleventh Amendment are\r\nfully applicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  See In re San\r\nJuan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 888 F.2d 940, 942 (lst\r\nCir. 1989).  The Eleventh Amendment immunity extends to any entity\r\nthat is an \"arm of the state,\" id., and this court has ruled that\r\nthe Tourism Company falls within that category, see id. at 943. \r\nOur starting place, therefore, is that   as the Tourism Company\r\nargued in its summary judgment motion   the Eleventh Amendment\r\nwould bar a suit by a private individual against the Tourism\r\nCompany, unless the Tourism Company agreed to be sued.  See id. at\r\n942; see also Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671-73 (1974). \r\nNeither party has argued that consent has been given in this case.\r\nCongress, however, has the power to abrogate the Eleventh\r\nAmendment's immunity if two conditions are met. Seminole Tribe of\r\nFlorida v. Florida, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 1123 (1996).  First, there\r\nmust be a \"clear legislative statement\" of Congress's intent to do\r\nso.  Id.  Second, its attempt to abrogate must have been done under\r\nproper constitutional authority, which only has been held to exist\r\nunder  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id.  at 1124-28.  See City\r\nof Boerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 2162-72 (1997) (clarifying\r\nCongress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment);\r\nKatzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 649-51 (1966) (describing test\r\nfor determining whether a statute is \"appropriate legislation\" to\r\nenforce the Equal Protection Clause).\r\nThe first half of the Seminole Tribe test is easy to\r\napply in the ADA context.  As we have noted, see supra at note 1,\r\nthe statute unquestionably includes a clear statement of intent.  \r\nThe second prong   Congress's power to abrogate   is the subject of\r\nsome debate, although all but one of the circuits that have decided\r\nthe issue have concluded that the ADA was properly enacted under\r\nCongress's Fourteenth Amendment enforcement powers.  Compare Kimelv. Florida Bd. of Regents, 139 F.3d 1426, 1428 n.1, 1433 (llth Cir.\r\n1998); Coolbaugh v. Louisiana, 136 F.3d 430, 438 (5th Cir. 1998);\r\nClark v. California, 123 F.3d 1267, 1269-70 (9th Cir. 1997);\r\nCrawford v. Indiana Dept. of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481, 487 (7th\r\nCir. 1997) with Brown v. North Carolina Div. of Motor Vehicles, 166\r\nF.3d 698 (4th Cir. 1999).\r\nSeveral district courts also have reached the contrary\r\nconclusion, however, see, e.g., Garrett v. Board of Trustees, 989\r\nF. Supp. 1409, 1410 (N.D. Ala. 1998); Nihiser v. Ohio E.P.A., 979\r\nF. Supp. 1168, 1176 (S.D. Ohio 1997), and the uncertainty on this\r\nissue is reflected in several other ways: the panels in Kimel,\r\nCoolbaugh and Brown were split, and an en banc rehearing in an\r\nEighth Circuit case ended with an evenly divided vote of the court,\r\nsee Autio v. AFSCME, Local 3139, 157 F.3d 1141 (8th Cir. 1998) (on\r\nrehearing of 140 F.3d 802 (8th Cir. 1998)).  Finally, the Supreme\r\nCourt has granted certiorari in Kimel.  See 119 S. Ct. 901, 902\r\n(1999).\r\nAlso of relevance here is that the traditional waiver\r\nrules do not always apply in Eleventh Amendment cases.  Because the\r\nAmendment deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain\r\nclaims against states, the immunity may be raised at any point in\r\na proceeding, including for the first time on appeal. See Pennhurst\r\nState Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99 n.8 (1983).  The\r\nTourism Company did not make reference to the Eleventh Amendment as\r\na defense in its answer to the complaint, and raised the issue\r\nbeyond the time period allotted for dispositive motions.  Because\r\nof the Amendment's jurisdictional reach, however, it trumped\r\nordinary procedural requirements.  When the immunity was raised in\r\nthe summary judgment motion, the district court should have\r\naddressed it.  Instead, it rejected the defense on timeliness\r\ngrounds.\r\nFailure to raise the Eleventh Amendment at the outset of\r\nthe case was not, however, the Tourism Company's only default. \r\nDespite the explicit statement of abrogation in the ADA and the\r\npercolating caselaw on Congress's authority to abrogate, neitherparty made reference to the abrogation provision in the district\r\ncourt.  As noted supra, the plaintiffs argued in their motion for\r\nsanctions that Eleventh Amendment immunity was inapplicable based\r\nsolely on the statute's definition of employer.  The neglect\r\ncontinued on appeal.\r\nC. The appellate proceedings.\r\nIn its opening brief to this court, appellant Tourism\r\nCompany recognized that Congress has the power to abrogate the\r\nEleventh Amendment immunity, but incorrectly stated that \"[t]here\r\nis no constitutional or statutory precept pertaining to a waiver of\r\nthe Eleventh Amendment immunity in cases pertaining to the ADA.\" \r\nIn a footnote, the Tourism Company asserted that \"[t]he courts that\r\nhave considered whether the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\r\nmay contain an implicit abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment\r\nimmunity have disfavored the contention.\"  (Emphasis added.)  There\r\nwas no acknowledgment that the ADA contained an explicit abrogation\r\nprovision and, obviously, no discussion of whether Congress had the\r\npower to enact it.\r\nThe provision was finally noted in the plaintiffs-\r\nappellees' six-page brief, where it was offered as a conclusive\r\nanswer to the defendant's belated assertion that the Eleventh\r\nAmendment required the lawsuit to be dismissed.  In short, up to\r\nthis time, the Eleventh Amendment theme had developed two threads:\r\nfirst, the defendant's theory that the Amendment operates to bar\r\nsuits against states and their instrumentalities, including the\r\nTourism Company, and, second, the plaintiffs' theory that the ADA\r\ncontains an explicit abrogation of the immunity, permitting the\r\nsuit to go forward against the Tourism Company.\r\nIn its reply brief, for the first time in the case, the\r\nTourism Company made direct reference to caselaw addressing whether \r\nCongress had the authority to enact the abrogation provision in the\r\nADA.  The \"discussion,\" however, consumed roughly one page and the\r\nthree district court cases on point that were cited all supported\r\ndefendant's assertion that \"[a]lready courts have held that\r\nCongress has no authority to create a special protection for\r\ndisabled individuals under ADA through the Fourteenth Amendment.\" \r\nThere was no reference to the nearly uniform line of circuit cases\r\nupholding the provision, no discussion of the differing views of\r\nthe divided courts, and no consideration of the recent Supreme\r\nCourt decision clarifying Congress's Fourteenth Amendment\r\nenforcement powers, City of Boerne, 117 S. Ct. at 2162-72.  At oral\r\nargument, counsel did finally acknowledge that the weight of\r\nauthority was against his client. \r\nIn sum, the Tourism Company did not mention the\r\nabrogation provision until its reply brief, and at no time did it\r\nprovide developed analysis of Congress's authority to abrogate.  We\r\nare therefore presented not with the issue of whether the Tourism\r\nCompany waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, but rather of\r\nwhether it waived its argument that the ADA's abrogation provision\r\nexceeded Congress's powers.  Although the Eleventh Amendment\r\ndefense itself cannot be waived, we decline in the circumstances of\r\nthis case to extend this exception from ordinary waiver rules to\r\nreach arguments that Congress lacked Fourteenth Amendment authority\r\nto abrogate the immunity.  We believe that, when comprehensive\r\ncivil rights legislation includes an explicit waiver and dominant\r\nprecedent almost uniformly upholds Congress's power to do so, the\r\nfailure to challenge that authority may be deemed consent to\r\nfederal jurisdiction.  While a state's later effort to withdraw\r\nconsent might in some circumstances prove compelling, we are\r\nparticularly unwilling to indulge eleventh-hour maneuvering when\r\nthis previously forsaken argument is raised without meaningful\r\nargumentation.\r\nIn sum, because the issue of the constitutionality of the\r\nADA's statutory abrogation was raised belatedly and inadequately,\r\nwe hold that it was doubly waived.  See Nichols v. Cadle Co., 139\r\nF.3d 59, 64 (lst Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he . . . objection . .. . has been\r\nwaived twice over, first by omitting to call it to the attention of\r\nthe district judge . . . and then by failing to include the point\r\nin the . . . opening brief in this court.\"); United States v.\r\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (lst Cir. 1990) (\"It is not enough merely\r\nto mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving\r\nthe court to do counsel's work . . . .\").\r\nD. Pendent Commonwealth Claims.  Neither party discusses\r\nin its briefs the relationship between the Eleventh Amendment and\r\nthe pendent Puerto Rico claims.  In Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 121, the\r\nSupreme Court stated that \"[a] federal court must examine each\r\nclaim in a case to see if the court's jurisdiction over that claim\r\nis barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\"  The Court explicitly held\r\nthat this principle applied to pendent state-law claims.\r\nAs noted earlier, the Tourism Company's invocation of the\r\nEleventh Amendment immunity in its motion for summary judgment\r\nshould not have been rejected as untimely by the district court. \r\nAlthough we have held that the ADA's explicit abrogation provision\r\nnegates that immunity for the ADA claim, that provision does not\r\ncover the Commonwealth claims.  Unless plaintiffs are able to\r\ndemonstrate abrogation of the immunity for those claims, the claims\r\nmust be dismissed without prejudice on Eleventh Amendment grounds. \r\nThat issue is best left to the district court in the first\r\ninstance, and, indeed, we leave to its determination as well\r\nwhether plaintiffs have waived any abrogation argument as to those\r\nclaims.\r\n                     II. Conclusion\r\nThe district court erroneously rejected the Tourism\r\nCompany's defense that the Eleventh Amendment barred plaintiffs'\r\nsuit on the ground that the argument was asserted too late. \r\nNonetheless, the court's judgment that the ADA claim may proceed is\r\nsustainable, as the Company failed in a timely or adequate way to\r\nchallenge the explicit statutory provision abrogating the Eleventh\r\nAmendment immunity.  No attention was given, however, to the\r\nplaintiffs' Puerto Rico claims, which may not proceed unless an\r\nequivalent abrogation provision exists or the Commonwealth consents\r\nto suit on those claims.  The Puerto Rico claims therefore must be\r\nremanded for either dismissal or action establishing their\r\nviability.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\ncourt is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is\r\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nAffirmed in part, vacated and remanded in part.  Each\r\nparty to bear its own costs.   Plaintiffs' motion requesting \r\ndamages and costs is denied.\n",

First, it is well established that the principles of the Eleventh Amendment are fully applicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 888 F.2d 940, 942 (lst Cir.1989).  The Eleventh Amendment immunity extends to any entity that is an \"arm of the state,\" id., and this court has ruled that the Tourism Company falls within that category, see id. at 943.   Our starting place, therefore, is that--as the Tourism Company argued in its summary judgment motion--the Eleventh Amendment would bar a suit by a private individual against the Tourism Company, unless the Tourism Company agreed to be sued.  See id. at 942;  see also Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671-73, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).

Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 1123, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996).  First, there must be a \"clear legislative statement\" of Congress's intent to do so.  Id. Second, its attempt to abrogate must have been done under proper constitutional authority, which only has been held to exist under &#167; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 1124-28.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 2162-72, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997) (clarifying Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment);  Katzenbach v.

As we have noted, see supra at note 1, the statute unquestionably includes a clear statement of intent.  The second prong--Congress's power to abrogate--is the subject of some debate, although all but one of the circuits that have decided the issue have concluded that the ADA was properly enacted under Congress's Fourteenth Amendment enforcement powers.

The Tourism Company did not make reference to the Eleventh Amendment as a defense in its answer to the complaint, and raised the issue beyond the time period allotted for dispositive motions.  Because of the Amendment's jurisdictional reach, however, it trumped ordinary procedural requirements.  When the immunity was raised in the summary judgment motion, the district court should have addressed it.  Instead, it rejected the defense on timeliness grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to raise the Eleventh Amendment at the outset of the case was not, however, the Tourism Company's only default.  Despite the explicit statement of abrogation in the ADA and the percolating caselaw on Congress's authority to abrogate, neither party made reference to the abrogation provision in the district court.  As noted supra, the plaintiffs argued in their motion for sanctions that Eleventh Amendment immunity was inapplicable based solely on the statute's definition of employer.  The neglect continued on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The appellate proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opening brief to this court, appellant Tourism Company recognized that Congress has the power to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity, but incorrectly stated that \"[t]here is no constitutional or statutory precept pertaining to a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment immunity in cases pertaining to the ADA.\"  In a footnote, the Tourism Company asserted that \"[t]he courts that have considered whether the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may contain an implicit abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment immunity have disfavored the contention.\"  (Emphasis added.)   There was no acknowledgment that the ADA contained an explicit abrogation provision and, obviously, no discussion of whether Congress had the power to enact it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision was finally noted in the plaintiffs-appellees' six-page brief, where it was offered as a conclusive answer to the defendant's belated assertion that the Eleventh Amendment required the lawsuit to be dismissed.  In short, up to this time, the Eleventh Amendment theme had developed two threads:  first, the defendant's theory that the Amendment operates to bar suits against states and their instrumentalities, including the Tourism Company, and, second, the plaintiffs' theory that the ADA contains an explicit abrogation of the immunity, permitting the suit to go forward against the Tourism Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its reply brief, for the first time in the case, the Tourism Company made direct reference to caselaw addressing whether Congress had the authority to enact the abrogation provision in the ADA.  The \"discussion,\" however, consumed roughly one page and the three district court cases on point that were cited all supported defendant's assertion that \"[a]lready courts have held that Congress has no authority to create a special protection for disabled individuals under ADA through the Fourteenth Amendment.\"   There was no reference to the nearly uniform line of circuit cases upholding the provision, no discussion of the differing views of the divided courts, and no consideration of the recent Supreme Court decision clarifying Congress's Fourteenth Amendment enforcement powers, City of Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2162-72.   At oral argument, counsel did finally acknowledge that the weight of authority was against his client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Tourism Company did not mention the abrogation provision until its reply brief, and at no time did it provide developed analysis of Congress's authority to abrogate.  We are therefore presented not with the issue of whether the Tourism Company waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, but rather of whether it waived its argument that the ADA's abrogation provision exceeded Congress's powers.  Although the Eleventh Amendment defense itself cannot be waived, we decline in the circumstances of this case to extend this exception from ordinary waiver rules to reach arguments that Congress lacked Fourteenth Amendment authority to abrogate the immunity.  We believe that, when comprehensive civil rights legislation includes an explicit waiver and dominant precedent almost uniformly upholds Congress's power to do so, the failure to challenge that authority may be deemed consent to federal jurisdiction.  While a state's later effort to withdraw consent might in some circumstances prove compelling, we are particularly unwilling to indulge eleventh-hour maneuvering when this previously forsaken argument is raised without meaningful argumentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, because the issue of the constitutionality of the ADA's statutory abrogation was raised belatedly and inadequately, we hold that it was doubly waived.  See Nichols v. Cadle Co., 139 F.3d 59, 64 (lst Cir.1998) ( \"[T]he ... objection .... has been waived twice over, first by omitting to call it to the attention of the district judge ... and then by failing to include the point in the ... opening brief in this court.\");  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (lst Cir.1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work....\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Pendent Commonwealth Claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party discusses in its briefs the relationship between the Eleventh Amendment and the pendent Puerto Rico claims.  In Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 121, the Supreme Court stated that \"[a] federal court must examine each claim in a case to see if the court's jurisdiction over that claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\"   The Court explicitly held that this principle applied to pendent state-law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, the Tourism Company's invocation of the Eleventh Amendment immunity in its motion for summary judgment should not have been rejected as untimely by the district court.  Although we have held that the ADA's explicit abrogation provision negates that immunity for the ADA claim, that provision does not cover the Commonwealth claims.  Unless plaintiffs are able to demonstrate abrogation of the immunity for those claims, the claims must be dismissed without prejudice on Eleventh Amendment grounds.  That issue is best left to the district court in the first instance, and, indeed, we leave to its determination as well whether plaintiffs have waived any abrogation argument as to those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erroneously rejected the Tourism Company's defense that the Eleventh Amendment barred plaintiffs' suit on the ground that the argument was asserted too late.  Nonetheless, the court's judgment that the ADA claim may proceed is sustainable, as the Company failed in a timely or adequate way to challenge the explicit statutory provision abrogating the Eleventh Amendment immunity.  No attention was given, however, to the plaintiffs' Puerto Rico claims, which may not proceed unless an equivalent abrogation provision exists or the Commonwealth consents to suit on those claims.  The Puerto Rico claims therefore must be remanded for either dismissal or action establishing their viability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, vacated and remanded in part.

In Yeskey, the issue decided was whether the ADA covers inmates in state prisons.  The Court ruled that it did, allowing suit to proceed against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and several department officials.  The defendants apparently did not, however, directly challenge Congress's authority to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment for purposes of the ADA, but rather posed a more particular constitutional challenge to Congress's application of the ADA to state prisons.  See Yeskey v.

The defendant-appellant, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (\"the Tourism Company\"), claims that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the case in light of the Eleventh Amendment, which protects states from suit in federal court.  We conclude that, in the face of an explicit statutory provision abrogating Eleventh Amendment immunity in ADA cases and the absence of a meaningful challenge to the validity of that abrogation, the court's judgment on the ADA claim should be affirmed.  We remand, however, for the district court to consider whether the pendent Puerto Rico claims benefit from a similar abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  If not, those claims must be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts underlying plaintiffs' claims play no role in this appeal, and we therefore note only in passing that the case concerns an employee's contention that he suffered injury from exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke while working for the Tourism Company as a casino inspector.  Our disposition instead involves procedural aspects of the case, particularly defendant's failure to address in a timely or meaningful manner the express abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment contained in the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We begin by relating in some detail the travel of the case in the district court, pause for a review of Eleventh Amendment principles, and then pick up the proceedings on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Litigation Starts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed their complaint in August 1995 and an answer was filed in October of the same year.  No reference was made in either document to the Eleventh Amendment, the ADA's express abrogation provision, or the power of Congress to abrogate a state's immunity.  The only arguably relevant reference was the inclusion, in a list of ten \"affirmative defenses,\" of an item reading \"Lacks [sic] of subject matter jurisdiction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About two years after the time period for filing dispositive motions had passed, and apparently as a result of a change of counsel, defendant in May 1998 filed a motion for summary judgment asserting, inter alia, that the complaint was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, which prohibits suit by private parties against a state in federal court, without that state's consent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The motion focused on the Tourism Company's status as an \"instrumentality\" of the state and its consequent entitlement to Eleventh Amendment protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs responded by arguing that the motion should be denied as late.  The district court agreed and issued the following order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>This motion is ordered stricken from the record as untimely and because it constitutes a violation of the Court's case management orders.  Any further attempts to file untimely dispositive motions will be subject to sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tourism Company sought reconsideration, repeating its earlier Eleventh Amendment argument, and, in a response that was styled as a motion for sanctions, the plaintiffs argued that the Eleventh Amendment immunity was patently inapplicable based on the statutory definition of employer in the ADA, which excluded the United States but not state governments.  The district court denied the defendant's request for reconsideration without comment, and denied the motion for sanctions without prejudice to renew once any appeal is decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Eleventh Amendment Basics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this juncture, some basic tenets of Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence need to be articulated to give context to the proceedings in both the district court and on appeal.  First, it is well established that the principles of the Eleventh Amendment are fully applicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531331\"><a href=\"/opinion/531331/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-plaintiffs-steering/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span>, 942 (lst Cir.1989).  The Eleventh Amendment immunity extends to any entity that is an \"arm of the state,\" id., and this court has ruled that the Tourism Company falls within that category, see id. at 943.   Our starting place, therefore, is that--as the Tourism Company argued in its summary judgment motion--the Eleventh Amendment would bar a suit by a private individual against the Tourism Company, unless the Tourism Company agreed to be sued.  See id. at 942;  see also Edelman v. Jordan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 671-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the Amendment deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain claims against states, the immunity may be raised at any point in a proceeding, including for the first time on appeal.  See Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 99 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Tourism Company did not make reference to the Eleventh Amendment as a defense in its answer to the complaint, and raised the issue beyond the time period allotted for dispositive motions.  Because of the Amendment's jurisdictional reach, however, it trumped ordinary procedural requirements.  When the immunity was raised in the summary judgment motion, the district court should have addressed it.  Instead, it rejected the defense on timeliness grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to raise the Eleventh Amendment at the outset of the case was not, however, the Tourism Company's only default.  Despite the explicit statement of abrogation in the ADA and the percolating caselaw on Congress's authority to abrogate, neither party made reference to the abrogation provision in the district court.  As noted supra, the plaintiffs argued in their motion for sanctions that Eleventh Amendment immunity was inapplicable based solely on the statute's definition of employer.  The neglect continued on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The appellate proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opening brief to this court, appellant Tourism Company recognized that Congress has the power to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity, but incorrectly stated that \"[t]here is no constitutional or statutory precept pertaining to a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment immunity in cases pertaining to the ADA.\"  In a footnote, the Tourism Company asserted that \"[t]he courts that have considered whether the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may contain an implicit abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment immunity have disfavored the contention.\"  (Emphasis added.)   There was no acknowledgment that the ADA contained an explicit abrogation provision and, obviously, no discussion of whether Congress had the power to enact it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision was finally noted in the plaintiffs-appellees' six-page brief, where it was offered as a conclusive answer to the defendant's belated assertion that the Eleventh Amendment required the lawsuit to be dismissed.  In short, up to this time, the Eleventh Amendment theme had developed two threads:  first, the defendant's theory that the Amendment operates to bar suits against states and their instrumentalities, including the Tourism Company, and, second, the plaintiffs' theory that the ADA contains an explicit abrogation of the immunity, permitting the suit to go forward against the Tourism Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its reply brief, for the first time in the case, the Tourism Company made direct reference to caselaw addressing whether Congress had the authority to enact the abrogation provision in the ADA.  The \"discussion,\" however, consumed roughly one page and the three district court cases on point that were cited all supported defendant's assertion that \"[a]lready courts have held that Congress has no authority to create a special protection for disabled individuals under ADA through the Fourteenth Amendment.\"   There was no reference to the nearly uniform line of circuit cases upholding the provision, no discussion of the differing views of the divided courts, and no consideration of the recent Supreme Court decision clarifying Congress's Fourteenth Amendment enforcement powers, City of Boerne, 117 S.Ct. at 2162-72.   At oral argument, counsel did finally acknowledge that the weight of authority was against his client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Tourism Company did not mention the abrogation provision until its reply brief, and at no time did it provide developed analysis of Congress's authority to abrogate.  We are therefore presented not with the issue of whether the Tourism Company waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, but rather of whether it waived its argument that the ADA's abrogation provision exceeded Congress's powers.  Although the Eleventh Amendment defense itself cannot be waived, we decline in the circumstances of this case to extend this exception from ordinary waiver rules to reach arguments that Congress lacked Fourteenth Amendment authority to abrogate the immunity.  We believe that, when comprehensive civil rights legislation includes an explicit waiver and dominant precedent almost uniformly upholds Congress's power to do so, the failure to challenge that authority may be deemed consent to federal jurisdiction.  While a state's later effort to withdraw consent might in some circumstances prove compelling, we are particularly unwilling to indulge eleventh-hour maneuvering when this previously forsaken argument is raised without meaningful argumentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, because the issue of the constitutionality of the ADA's statutory abrogation was raised belatedly and inadequately, we hold that it was doubly waived.  See Nichols v. Cadle Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752409\"><a href=\"/opinion/752409/sargent-d-nichols-individually-and-as-he-is-trustee-of-andover-northway/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 64 (lst Cir.1998) ( \"[T]he ... objection .... has been waived twice over, first by omitting to call it to the attention of the district judge ... and then by failing to include the point in the ... opening brief in this court.\");  United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (lst Cir.1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work....\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Pendent Commonwealth Claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party discusses in its briefs the relationship between the Eleventh Amendment and the pendent Puerto Rico claims.  In Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 121, the Supreme Court stated that \"[a] federal court must examine each claim in a case to see if the court's jurisdiction over that claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\"   The Court explicitly held that this principle applied to pendent state-law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, the Tourism Company's invocation of the Eleventh Amendment immunity in its motion for summary judgment should not have been rejected as untimely by the district court.  Although we have held that the ADA's explicit abrogation provision negates that immunity for the ADA claim, that provision does not cover the Commonwealth claims.  Unless plaintiffs are able to demonstrate abrogation of the immunity for those claims, the claims must be dismissed without prejudice on Eleventh Amendment grounds.  That issue is best left to the district court in the first instance, and, indeed, we leave to its determination as well whether plaintiffs have waived any abrogation argument as to those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erroneously rejected the Tourism Company's defense that the Eleventh Amendment barred plaintiffs' suit on the ground that the argument was asserted too late.  Nonetheless, the court's judgment that the ADA claim may proceed is sustainable, as the Company failed in a timely or adequate way to challenge the explicit statutory provision abrogating the Eleventh Amendment immunity.  No attention was given, however, to the plaintiffs' Puerto Rico claims, which may not proceed unless an equivalent abrogation provision exists or the Commonwealth consents to suit on those claims.  The Puerto Rico claims therefore must be remanded for either dismissal or action establishing their viability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, vacated and remanded in part.
