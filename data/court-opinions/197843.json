Appellant P.F. McHenry appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's dismissal of her complaint under Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 12(b)(1).  We affirm.  For the reasons given by the district\r\ncourt in its order dated July 18, 1997, appellant's statutory\r\nproperty claim was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \r\nNor did appellant adequately assert a claim for intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress since she failed to allege\r\nthat appellee's conduct caused severe emotional distress, a\r\nnecessary element of that cause of action under Massachusetts\r\nlaw.  See Tetrault v. Mahoney, Hawkes &amp; Goldings, 425 Mass.\r\n456, 466, 681 N.E.2d 1189, 1197 (1997).  Consequently,\r\ndismissal of her complaint was proper.  See Doyle v. Hasbro,\r\nInc., 103 F.3d 186, 195 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming dismissal of\r\nclaim of intentional infliction of emotional distress under\r\nMassachusetts law in part because plaintiff never even\r\nattempted to plead severe distress); see Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n12(b)(6).\r\n         Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
