McKenna,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   Petitioner  Alfred K.  Brown appeals  the\r                            \r\n\ndenial by the district court of his motion for habeas relief,\r\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2254.  We affirm.1\r                                                     1\r\n\n     Brown  first  claims that  he  received constitutionally\r\n\nineffective  assistance of  counsel  in the  state trial  and\r\n\nappellate courts.   The  state contends that  the ineffective\r\n\nassistance  claim is  insulated  from  federal habeas  review\r\n\nbecause  the  state court  found  it  procedurally defaulted.\r\n\nBrown  responds in  turn that  the default should  be excused\r\n\nbecause it was caused  by ineffective assistance of appellate\r\n\ncounsel.   The claim  of ineffective assistance  of appellate\r\n\ncounsel  is  based  solely  on  counsel's  failure  to  argue\r\n\nineffective assistance of trial  counsel.  Since the question\r\n\nof  whether cause  has been  shown is  inextricably entangled\r\n\nwith  the merits, we find it easier to address directly those\r\n\nmerits.\r\n\n     We  find the  claim of  ineffective assistance  of trial\r\n\ncounsel to be without foundation, essentially for the reasons\r\n\ngiven by the district court.  We add only the following.\r\n\n     Insofar  as Brown's  claim  rests  on counsel's  alleged\r\n\nfailure to  investigate adequately  the defense  of insanity,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1The  \"Antiterrorism  and Effective  Death Penalty  Act of\r               1\r\n1996\"  (Pub. L. 104-32) was signed into law while this appeal\r\nwas pending.  We need not determine to  what extent the Act's\r\namendments  govern  this  case  since, even  under  the  more\r\nexpansive  scope of  review prior  to the  Act, Brown  is not\r\nentitled to relief.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthe  record  indicates  no  such  deficiency.    We  note  in\r\n\nparticular that the information provided in the affidavits of\r\n\nDrs. Yudowitz  and Profit  is essentially cumulative  of what\r\n\nwas presented at trial.   Hence, the failure to  present such\r\n\ninformation does  not  constitute ineffective  assistance  of\r\n\ncounsel.   See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 935 F.2d 832,\r                                                          \r\n\n846  (7th Cir. 1991) (counsel  not ineffective for failing to\r\n\npresent cumulative evidence).  \r\n\n     Brown may be correct  in his claim that the  trial judge\r\n\nerred in informing the jury as to the sentencing consequences\r\n\nof the verdicts of first and second degree murder, other than\r\n\nthat  of not guilty.  See Commonwealth v. Ferreira, 373 Mass.\r                                                              \r\n\n116, 123-38, 364 N.E.2d 1264, 1269-72 (1977) (error to charge\r\n\njury that verdict of  guilty of murder in first  degree would\r\n\ncarry sentence of  life imprisonment without parole,  whereas\r\n\nverdict of guilty of murder in second degree would carry same\r\n\nsentence with  eligibility for parole  after fifteen  years).\r\n\nHowever, it  would have been  reasonable for counsel  to have\r\n\nmade a \"deliberate tactical  decision\" not to object  to that\r\n\ncharge based on the reasoning \"that informing the jury of the\r\n\nsentencing   outcomes   associated  with   possible  verdicts\r\n\nimproved his client's chances of avoiding a verdict of guilty\r\n\nof murder in the first degree.\"  Commonwealth v. Burnett, 371\r                                                                    \r\n\nMass.  13, 16-17,  353 N.E.2d  665, 667  (1976).   A decision\r\n\nconsistent with a reasonable  trial strategy cannot support a\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nclaim of  ineffective assistance  of counsel.

United States,\r                                                                        \r\n\n987 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n     Finally, we agree  with finding of  the state trial  and\r\n\nappellate  courts that  the  record  indicates  that  Brown's\r\n\nstatements to the  police on  the night of  the murders  were\r\n\nvoluntary.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
