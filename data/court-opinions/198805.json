Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJesus R. Rabell Mendez and Rossello, Rabell &amp; Salicrup on\r\nbrief for appellants.\r\nLuis N. Blanco Matos on brief for appellees.\r\n\nJanuary 31, 2000\r\n\nPer Curiam. Plaintiffs appeal from the district court's denial\r\nof Rule 60(b) relief from a judgment dismissing plaintiff's\r\nemployment discrimination claim \"without prejudice\" for failure to\r\nprosecute, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).  At the time that\r\nplaintiffs filed their Rule 60(b) motion, they had refiled their\r\nfederal claims in a second suit before the district court, and a\r\nmotion to dismiss the claims as untimely was pending. \r\nSubsequently, the district court did dismiss plaintiffs' second\r\ncomplaint on the grounds that the statute of limitations on the\r\nfederal claims had already run when the first complaint was\r\ndismissed and that the filing of the first complaint had not tolled\r\nthe limitations period.\r\n\"Although our case law gives the district court broad\r\ndiscretion to dismiss a case to further its case management\r\nresponsibilities, disposition on the merits is favored and we\r\nrepeatedly have held that a case should not be dismissed with\r\nprejudice except 'when a plaintiff's misconduct is especially\r\negregious or extreme.'\" Ortiz-Anglada v. Ortiz-Perez, 183 F.3d 65,\r\n66 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation omitted).  Here, the district court\r\ndismissed without prejudice and, in refusing to reinstate two weeks\r\nlater, gave as one of its two reasons the fact that the dismissal\r\nwas without prejudice, i.e., that the dismissal allowed plaintiffs\r\nto refile.  Yet later, when it was brought to the court's attention\r\nthat the running of the statute of limitations could effectively\r\nconvert the dismissal without prejudice to one with prejudice, the\r\ncourt denied Rule 60(b) relief without further explanation.\r\n\"Our review of the denial of a motion under Rule 60(b) is for\r\nabuse of discretion.  Our review is limited to the denial of the\r\n60(b) motion, not the merits of the underlying judgment.  We will\r\nfind an abuse of discretion only when we are left with a definite\r\nand firm conviction that the lower court committed a clear error of\r\njudgment in the conclusion it reached when weighing all the\r\nrelevant factors.\" Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 891 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).\r\nThe district court failed to set forth its reasons for denying\r\nthe Rule 60(b) motion, stating only that the motion was \"denied.\" \r\nThis failure hampers our review of the district court's denial in\r\nthese circumstances, where the reasons for denial are less than\r\nobvious.  Instead of this court second guessing the reasons for the\r\ndistrict court's refusal to vacate the dismissal of plaintiffs'\r\ncomplaint, it is preferable that the district court articulate its\r\nreasons.  \"A district court, which has direct and continuous\r\ncontact with attorneys, is best able to judge in the first instance\r\nwhether an attorney's misconduct is sufficiently egregious to\r\nwarrant the 'death knell' of a lawsuit, or whether some lesser\r\nsanction would be more appropriate.\" Estate of Solis-Rivera v.\r\nUnited States, 993 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993); cf. Velazquez-Rivera\r\nv. Sea-Land Service, Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1079 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n(explaining benefits of district court's setting forth in writing\r\nits reasons for invoking the severest sanction of dismissal).\r\nWhere a dismissal without prejudice is effectively converted\r\nto a dismissal with prejudice, as it was in this case by the\r\nrunning of the statute of limitations, this court has indicated\r\nthat it may be appropriate for the district court to revisit the\r\nissue.  See Estate of Solis-Rivera, 993 F.2d at 3 (remanding to\r\ndistrict judge \"to allow him to decide whether, given the surfacing\r\nof the statute of limitations problem, he wishes to give plaintiffs\r\na further chance by allowing the present action to proceed\");\r\nHilton International Co. v. Union de Trabajadores de la Industria\r\nGastronomica de Puerto Rico, 833 F.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir. 1987)\r\n(indicating that where district court's intent to dismiss complaint\r\nwithout prejudice was thwarted by running of statute of\r\nlimitations, \"plaintiff's remedy was to go back for a revision\").\r\nThere was no ruling on the statute of limitations issue at the\r\ntime that the district court denied plaintiffs' Rule 60(b) motion. \r\nNow that the ruling on the statute of limitations issue has\r\nconverted the district court's dismissal without prejudice into a\r\ndismissal with prejudice, the district court should have an\r\nopportunity to revisit the request for Rule 60(b) relief in light\r\nof the changed circumstances.  In ruling on the motion, whether\r\ngranting it or confirming its denial, the district court should\r\narticulate the reasons for its action.\r\nThe district court's endorsed order dated October 20, 1997,\r\ndenying plaintiffs' Rule 60(b) motion is vacated and the case is\r\nremanded for further proceedings in accordance herewith.\r\n",
