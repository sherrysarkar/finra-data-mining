(\"SMI\") in  Humacao, Puerto  Rico.\r\n\nSome two years  after his employment  was terminated under  a\r\n\nseverance program,  Rivera, who  wore a prosthetic  device in\r\n\nplace  of his  lower  left leg,  sued  SMI and  its  insurer,\r\n\nPrudential   Insurance  Co.,   under   the   Americans   with\r\n\nDisabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),  42 U.S.C.    12101  et seq.,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"),  29 U.S.C.\r\n\n   1001 et seq., and other federal and Puerto Rico employment\r                           \r\n\nstatutes.  The  employer countered with a waiver  and release\r\n\nwhich Rivera had executed  when his employment terminated and\r\n\nfor  which he  received certain  benefits.   Rivera responded\r\n\nthat the release  was invalid.  On  cross-motions for summary\r\n\njudgment, the district court entered summary judgment for the\r\n\ndefendants.   Rivera appeals.   This case raises  an issue of\r\n\nfirst    impression   in   this    circuit   concerning   the\r\n\nenforceability  under  the ADA  of  waivers  and releases  of\r\n\nclaims by employees.\r\n\n          We hold that the  general principles for evaluating\r\n\nsuch  waivers  and releases,  enunciated  by  this court  for\r\n\nclaims arising under other  employment statutes, apply to the\r\n\nADA as  well:  ADA  waivers and releases must  be knowing and\r\n\nvoluntary, as evidenced by the totality of the circumstances.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Whatever  the  merits  of  any  claims  Rivera  had\r\n\narising  out of  his employment,1  he presented  no competent\r\n\nevidence  that created a genuine issue of material fact as to\r\n\nwhether his waiver and release were voluntarily and knowingly\r\n\ngiven,  and  whether  he had  the  capacity  to  give such  a\r\n\nrelease.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Rivera was  born  in 1953  and  has a  high  school\r\n\neducation.  He  began working  for SMI in  June 1984;  before\r\n\nthat he worked as  a police officer for ten  years.  Rivera's\r\n\nleft leg had been amputated below the knee after a motorcycle\r\n\naccident  he suffered in 1982  when he was  a police officer.\r\n\nHis  work  assignments  at  SMI,  despite  his  requests  for\r\n\naccommodation (which were partially met), caused his stump to\r\n\nbecome irritated  and bleed.   In pain,  he began  exhibiting\r\n\nsymptoms  of, and eventually received  a letter from a doctor\r\n\ndiagnosing him  with, post-traumatic stress  disorder and  an\r\n\nanxiety disorder.\r\n\n          Rivera  left  work  due to  disability  in December\r\n\n1992.  In the spring  of 1993, he received a letter  inviting\r\n\nhim to participate in a voluntary separation plan.  He sent a\r\n\nletter accepting this invitation.  He also applied for  long-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  There is no indication in the record that plaintiff first\r\npresented  his  claim  to  the  Equal Employment  Opportunity\r\nCommission (\"EEOC\"), which is a prerequisite to bringing suit\r\nunder the ADA.  Defendants never raised this issue and it was\r\nnot argued before us.  We decline to address the matter.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nterm disability benefits  available through the employer  and\r\n\nsubmitted   a  statement  in   support  from   his  attending\r\n\nphysician.   The  insurer  denied the  request for  long-term\r\n\ndisability   benefits;   Rivera  sought   reconsideration  in\r\n\nSeptember of 1993 and  submitted further documentation to the\r\n\ninsurer.   Rivera pursued his claims  for disability benefits\r\n\nthroughout 1993 and thereafter.2\r\n\n          In  the fall of  1993, faced  with the  shutdown of\r\n\ncertain  of  its  operations,   SMI  sent  Rivera  and  other\r\n\nemployees a  letter of  dismissal stating that  all employees\r\n\nwho wished  to receive  voluntary separation benefits  had to\r\n\nsign a waiver agreement.   Under the terms of  the Separation\r\n\nAgreement and  General Release Form (the  \"Agreement\"), dated\r\n\nOctober 18, 1993, the  employee agreed that he would  make no\r\n\nlegal  claims  against  the  company  or  its  insurer.3   He\r\n\nreceived,  in  turn, certain  benefits  beyond  those he  was\r\n\notherwise entitled to receive.  The Agreement stated that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  In  response to  his claim  for disability  benefits, the\r\nSocial Security Administration  found in September  1994 that\r\nRivera was disabled  and suffered  from pain,  post-traumatic\r\nstress disorder and dysthymic disorder.\r\n\n3.  The Agreement provided in relevant part that the employee\r\nagreed that \"he shall file no action against the Company, nor\r\nagainst  any entity  or  person associated  with the  Company\r\n. . . before any  agency or administrative  instrument, board\r\nor  court,  federal  or local,  which  might  be  directly or\r\nindirectly related to his employment with the Company or with\r\nthe  termination of  the  same.\"   The Agreement  encompassed\r\ncauses of action including but not limited to the \"'Americans\r\nwith  Disabilities  Act,'  or  the  local  legislation   that\r\nprotects persons with physical and/or mental impairments.\"\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nsignatory  acknowledged  that he  was  signing  the Agreement\r\n\nvoluntarily, that he fully  understood the Agreement, that he\r\n\nhad been advised to consult  with a legal representative, and\r\n\nthat he had seven days to revoke his consent.  On December 1,\r\n\n1993, Rivera  executed the Agreement.   He never  revoked his\r\n\nconsent.  He now  claims that he signed the  Agreement, which\r\n\nhe did  not read at the  time, under duress and  while he was\r\n\nsuffering under a psychiatric disability.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Rivera challenges  the validity of  the release  on\r\n\nthree  grounds:   that enforcement  of  the release  would be\r\n\ncontrary to the policies animating the ADA, that the evidence\r\n\nraised a dispute as  to whether the execution of  the release\r\n\nwas  knowing and  voluntary,  and that  he  should have  been\r\n\npermitted to take additional discovery.  The first two issues\r\n\nare intertwined.\r\n\n          Courts   have,  in  the   employment  law  context,\r\n\ncommonly upheld  releases given  in  exchange for  additional\r\n\nbenefits.    Such  releases  provide  a  means  of  voluntary\r\n\nresolution of  potential and actual legal  disputes, and mete\r\n\nout a type  of industrial  justice.  Thus,  releases of  past\r\n\nclaims have been honored under the laws prohibiting race  and\r\n\ngender  discrimination.   Warnebold v.  Union Pac.  R.R., 963\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  222, 223-24 (8th Cir. 1992);  cf. Alexander v.

Such releases have also\r                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nbeen   honored   under   the   ADEA,  which   prohibits   age\r\n\ndiscrimination in  employment, e.g., Pierce v.  Atchison T. &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nS.F. Ry. Co., -- F.3d -- (7th Cir. Mar. 27, 1997), as well as\r                        \r\n\nunder ERISA, e.g., Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability\r                                                                         \r\n\nPlan, 70  F.3d 173, 181  (1st Cir. 1995);  Rodriguez-Abreu v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nChase  Manhattan Bank,  N.A.,  986 F.2d  580,  587 (1st  Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1993).\r\n\n          Where  Congress  has  wanted  to  insure particular\r\n\nprotections for the employees in the procedures for obtaining\r\n\nreleases,  it has done so,  for example in  the Older Workers\r\n\nBenefits  Protection Act amendments  to the ADEA.   29 U.S.C.\r\n\n  626(f).   No such special  procedures are set  forth in the\r\n\nADA.\r\n\n          The   protection  Congress  wished   to  afford  to\r\n\ndisabled workers is  consistent, we believe, with  permitting\r\n\nthose workers to  resolve their claims by executing a release\r\n\nin exchange  for benefits  they would not  otherwise receive.\r\n\nThe ADA clearly  encourages private resolution  of employment\r\n\ndisputes, such as by requiring that employers attempt to make\r\n\nreasonable  accommodations and  that the  EEOC try  to settle\r\n\ndisputes informally.    See, e.g., Hodges,  Mediation and the\r                                                                         \r\n\nAmericans with  Disabilities Act,  30  Ga. L.  Rev. 431,  437\r                                            \r\n\n(1996).  The ADA also expressly provides that its enforcement\r\n\nprocedures  shall  be the  same as  those  for Title  VII, 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   12117(a),  and releases  have long been  accepted in\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthat  context.    In  addition,  although  claims  concerning\r\n\nemployment arise under Title  I of the ADA, it  is noteworthy\r\n\nthat  the EEOC Regulations under Title III of the ADA (public\r\n\naccommodations) expressly provide for settlement of disputes.\r\n\n28 C.F.R.   36.506.\r\n\n          Certainly there  is nothing in the  ADA prohibiting\r\n\nsuch releases.   Indeed, as the  district court pointed  out,\r\n\nthe  report of the conference committee on the ADA evinces an\r\n\nintent to  permit individuals to settle or waive claims under\r\n\nthe  ADA by express, voluntary agreement.  H.R. Rep. No. 101-\r\n\n596  (1990),  reprinted   in  1990  U.S.C.C.A.N.   267,  598.\r                                        \r\n\nProhibiting  such waivers  under  the ADA  on policy  grounds\r\n\narguably would display the  same stereotyping and patronizing\r\n\nattitudes toward the disabled  which Congress hoped to remedy\r\n\nin  enacting the  ADA.   We conclude  that such  releases are\r\n\npermissible under the ADA, and turn to whether the release at\r\n\nissue here was valid.\r\n\n          Waiver  and  release  are affirmative  defenses  on\r\n\nwhich  the employer bears the burden.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c);\r\n\nsee Long v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., 105 F.3d 1529, 1543 (3d Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1997).  At  a minimum,  judicial review of  such waivers  and\r\n\nreleases has  been designed to ensure that  they are \"knowing\r\n\nand  voluntary.\"   Smart,  70 F.3d  at  181.   That  analysis\r                                    \r\n\nnecessitates some  focus on the  rights being waived  and the\r\n\ncongressional intention  to protect such rights.   This court\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nhas  endorsed  a  \"totality  of  circumstances\"  approach  to\r\n\ndetermining the validity of the  waiver.  Id.  We  have found\r                                                         \r\n\nhelpful, but not  exclusive, a set of  six factors identified\r\n\nby the Second Circuit in Finz v. Schlesinger, 957 F.2d 78, 82\r                                                        \r\n\n(2d Cir. 1992).4\r\n\n          And yet, a challenge  to a release by a  person who\r\n\nasserted to the employer that he was disabled at the time  of\r\n\nexecution of  the release  may, on particular  facts, warrant\r\n\nheightened  judicial   scrutiny.5    While   certain  claimed\r\n\ndisabilities may  inherently raise a  question about  whether\r\n\nthe employee has the capacity to give a knowing and voluntary\r\n\nwaiver, that is not the case  here.  It is not enough for  an\r\n\nemployee simply to assert that he was disabled at the time he\r\n\nexecuted  the  release  and  the   employer  knew  it.    The\r\n\ndefinition   in   the  ADA   of  \"disability\"   covers  three\r\n\ncategories, including  the  mere perception  that someone  is\r\n\ndisabled.    42 U.S.C.    12102(2);  Soileau  v.

The  six  factors  are:  (1)  plaintiff's  education  and\r\nbusiness sophistication; (2) the respective roles of employer\r\nand employee in determining the provisions of the waiver; (3)\r\nthe clarity of the  agreement; (4) the time plaintiff  had to\r\nstudy the  agreement; (5)  whether plaintiff  had independent\r\nadvice, such as  that of counsel;  and (6) the  consideration\r\nfor the waiver.

Unlike waiver of pension  benefits under ERISA, waiver of\r\nwelfare benefits such  as those at  issue here are not,  as a\r\ngeneral matter,  subject to heightened  scrutiny.  Rodriguez-\r                                                                         \r\nAbreu, 986 F.2d at 587.\r                 \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nenough  to  assert  that the  nature  of  the disability  was\r\n\npsychiatric.   Not all  disabilities and not  all psychiatric\r\n\ndisabilities inherently involve a question about capacity  to\r                                   \r\n\nact  knowingly  and  voluntarily.     Cf.  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSchneider, -- F.3d -- (1st Cir. Apr. 15, 1997).\r                     \r\n\n          Thus, the operative question  is whether there is a\r\n\ngenuine issue  as  to  whether Rivera  had  the  capacity  to\r\n\nexecute  the  release  knowingly  and voluntarily.    Summary\r\n\njudgment  is appropriate  where \"the  pleadings, depositions,\r\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,  together\r\n\nwith  the affidavits, if any,  show that there  is no genuine\r\n\nissue as  to any material  fact and that the  moving party is\r\n\nentitled to  judgment as a matter  of law.\"  Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56(c).    Here,  the  only  sworn  evidence  as  to  Rivera's\r\n\ncondition  and  its  effects  is  the  statement  in his  own\r\n\naffidavit: \"I was  very depressed because  I could no  longer\r\n\nwork;  anxious   and  confused  and   was  under  psychiatric\r\n\ntreatment.\"   Rivera failed to  submit an affidavit  from his\r\n\ntreating psychiatrist or from any other medical expert.6  The\r\n\ncourt  was left with  no competent medical  evidence going to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Rivera did submit a case summary prepared by his treating\r\npsychiatrist.   However, as  defendants pointed out  in their\r\nreply  memorandum  in support  of  their  motion for  summary\r\njudgment, this document constituted inadmissible hearsay.  It\r\nwas not  supported by  an accompanying affidavit.   Plaintiff\r\nfailed to remedy this evidentiary infirmity even after it was\r\nbrought to his attention in this manner.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nhis capacity to  execute the  release.  Cf.  Garside v.  Osco\r                                                                         \r\n\nDrug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                      \r\n\n          Rivera   did    submit   the   decision    of   the\r\n\nadministrative law  judge who  presided  over his  collateral\r\n\naction seeking  disability benefits under the Social Security\r\n\nAct. The administrative law  judge found that Rivera suffered\r\n\nfrom  dysthymia as  well as  post-traumatic stress  disorder.\r\n\nEven giving  these findings some evidentiary  weight they are\r\n\ninsufficient, without more, to create a genuine issue of fact\r\n\nas to Rivera's mental capacity.   Mere evidence of diagnostic\r\n\nlabels without content  tying them to capacity to  give valid\r\n\nconsent  is  inadequate   to  create  an  issue   as  to  the\r\n\nconsequences of the disorders  on an individual's capacity to\r\n\ngive valid consent.\r\n\n          Rivera  never  states  in  his affidavit  that  his\r\n\ncondition  was  such that  he  could not  give  voluntary and\r\n\nknowing consent.   The social security  judge's decision says\r\n\nnothing  on these  points.   And,  as we  said, there  was no\r\n\naffidavit  from  any  doctor.     Furthermore,  despite   his\r\n\ndiagnosed  dysthymia  and  post-traumatic   stress  disorder,\r\n\nduring this  period he  was actively pursuing  his disability\r\n\nclaim and did  not tell his employer and its  insurer that he\r\n\nlacked the  capacity to do so.   On this record,  there is no\r\n\nevidence  sufficient  to  establish  lack of  capacity.    In\r\n\nreaching this conclusion, we say nothing about the outcome in\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\na  case involving similar facts in which the plaintiff put on\r\n\ncompetent medical evidence.\r\n\n          We  consider the  remaining circumstances.   Rivera\r\n\nhad  42 days  to  examine  the  Agreement,7 discuss  it  with\r\n\nwhomever  he chose  and ask  questions before  he signed  it.\r\n\nRivera attempts  to raise a  dispute about  when he  actually\r\n\nreceived the Agreement.  However, the employer filed with its\r\n\nsummary judgment papers a receipt for the release executed by\r\n\nRivera.  Rivera has not  fairly met this evidence.  At  most,\r\n\nhis  affidavit says that he did not recall if he received the\r\n\nrelease then.  That is insufficient to create a genuine issue\r\n\nof fact.  See Ayer v. United States, 902 F.2d 1038, 1045 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1990);  cf. Perez de la Cruz v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 807 F.2d 1084, 1086-87 (1st Cir. 1986).\r               \r\n\n          The   district   court  sensitively   analyzed  the\r\n\ntotality  of the circumstances  here, commenting  on Rivera's\r\n\nlack of business sophistication.  The court noted that Rivera\r\n\nwas  given the Agreement and  release along with  a letter of\r\n\ntermination,  which  suggested  there  was  little  room  for\r\n\nnegotiation.  However, as the district court pointed out, the\r\n\nlanguage  of the  release  is clear  and  unmistakable:   the\r\n\nwaiver clause expressly mentions the ADA and states that  all\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  Agreement  was  internally inconsistent  in  that it\r\nprovided  for  at least  a  45-day period  for  examining the\r\ndocument but apparently expired 44 days after the date it was\r\nissued.   We need not reach this issue, however, as plaintiff\r\nnever claimed that the Agreement was invalid for this reason.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nclaims  for  disability are  released.    The district  court\r\n\nconcluded that Rivera's sense that he was treated unjustly in\r\n\nthis situation does  not mean that his  signing the Agreement\r\n\nwas not voluntary or knowing.\r\n\n          Rivera argues  that the district court was required\r\n\nto rule first on  the merits of his liability  claims against\r\n\nthe  employer  before reaching  the  issue of  waiver.   This\r\n\nargument  has the matter  exactly backwards.   Even if Rivera\r\n\nhad valid claims under  the ADA and other statutes,  he could\r\n\nhave  waived those claims.  It was both logical and efficient\r\n\nto take up first the matter of waiver.\r\n\n          As  for   Rivera's  argument  that  he  was  denied\r\n\ndiscovery, it is too little and too late.  Our  review of the\r\n\ndistrict court's discovery-related decisions  is for abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion,  and \"[w]e  will intervene  in such  matters only\r\n\nupon a clear showing  of manifest injustice.\"  Mack  v. Great\r                                                                         \r\n\nAtl.  &amp;  Pac.

R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 56(f).   Indeed, he filed a cross-motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment.   Under these circumstances, there was  no abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          For these reasons, to  the extent (if at  all) that\r\n\nRivera's  remaining non-ADA claims  have been  preserved, the\r\n\nwaiver and release are valid as to them.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n",

(\"SMI\") in  Humacao, Puerto  Rico.\r\n\nSome two years  after his employment  was terminated under  a\r\n\nseverance program,  Rivera, who  wore a prosthetic  device in\r\n\nplace  of his  lower  left leg,  sued  SMI and  its  insurer,\r\n\nPrudential   Insurance  Co.,   under   the   Americans   with\r\n\nDisabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),  42 U.S.C.    12101  et seq.,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"),  29 U.S.C.\r\n\n   1001 et seq., and other federal and Puerto Rico employment\r                           \r\n\nstatutes.  The  employer countered with a waiver  and release\r\n\nwhich Rivera had executed  when his employment terminated and\r\n\nfor  which he  received certain  benefits.   Rivera responded\r\n\nthat the release  was invalid.  On  cross-motions for summary\r\n\njudgment, the district court entered summary judgment for the\r\n\ndefendants.   Rivera appeals.   This case raises  an issue of\r\n\nfirst    impression   in   this    circuit   concerning   the\r\n\nenforceability  under  the ADA  of  waivers  and releases  of\r\n\nclaims by employees.\r\n\n          We hold that the  general principles for evaluating\r\n\nsuch  waivers  and releases,  enunciated  by  this court  for\r\n\nclaims arising under other  employment statutes, apply to the\r\n\nADA as  well:  ADA  waivers and releases must  be knowing and\r\n\nvoluntary, as evidenced by the totality of the circumstances.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Whatever  the  merits  of  any  claims  Rivera  had\r\n\narising  out of  his employment,1  he presented  no competent\r\n\nevidence  that created a genuine issue of material fact as to\r\n\nwhether his waiver and release were voluntarily and knowingly\r\n\ngiven,  and  whether  he had  the  capacity  to  give such  a\r\n\nrelease.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Rivera was  born  in 1953  and  has a  high  school\r\n\neducation.  He  began working  for SMI in  June 1984;  before\r\n\nthat he worked as  a police officer for ten  years.  Rivera's\r\n\nleft leg had been amputated below the knee after a motorcycle\r\n\naccident  he suffered in 1982  when he was  a police officer.\r\n\nHis  work  assignments  at  SMI,  despite  his  requests  for\r\n\naccommodation (which were partially met), caused his stump to\r\n\nbecome irritated  and bleed.   In pain,  he began  exhibiting\r\n\nsymptoms  of, and eventually received  a letter from a doctor\r\n\ndiagnosing him  with, post-traumatic stress  disorder and  an\r\n\nanxiety disorder.\r\n\n          Rivera  left  work  due to  disability  in December\r\n\n1992.  In the spring  of 1993, he received a letter  inviting\r\n\nhim to participate in a voluntary separation plan.  He sent a\r\n\nletter accepting this invitation.  He also applied for  long-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  There is no indication in the record that plaintiff first\r\npresented  his  claim  to  the  Equal Employment  Opportunity\r\nCommission (\"EEOC\"), which is a prerequisite to bringing suit\r\nunder the ADA.  Defendants never raised this issue and it was\r\nnot argued before us.  We decline to address the matter.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nterm disability benefits  available through the employer  and\r\n\nsubmitted   a  statement  in   support  from   his  attending\r\n\nphysician.   The  insurer  denied the  request for  long-term\r\n\ndisability   benefits;   Rivera  sought   reconsideration  in\r\n\nSeptember of 1993 and  submitted further documentation to the\r\n\ninsurer.   Rivera pursued his claims  for disability benefits\r\n\nthroughout 1993 and thereafter.2\r\n\n          In  the fall of  1993, faced  with the  shutdown of\r\n\ncertain  of  its  operations,   SMI  sent  Rivera  and  other\r\n\nemployees a  letter of  dismissal stating that  all employees\r\n\nwho wished  to receive  voluntary separation benefits  had to\r\n\nsign a waiver agreement.   Under the terms of  the Separation\r\n\nAgreement and  General Release Form (the  \"Agreement\"), dated\r\n\nOctober 18, 1993, the  employee agreed that he would  make no\r\n\nlegal  claims  against  the  company  or  its  insurer.3   He\r\n\nreceived,  in  turn, certain  benefits  beyond  those he  was\r\n\notherwise entitled to receive.

In  response to  his claim  for disability  benefits, the\r\nSocial Security Administration  found in September  1994 that\r\nRivera was disabled  and suffered  from pain,  post-traumatic\r\nstress disorder and dysthymic disorder.\r\n\n3.  The Agreement provided in relevant part that the employee\r\nagreed that \"he shall file no action against the Company, nor\r\nagainst  any entity  or  person associated  with the  Company\r\n. . . before any  agency or administrative  instrument, board\r\nor  court,  federal  or local,  which  might  be  directly or\r\nindirectly related to his employment with the Company or with\r\nthe  termination of  the  same.\"   The Agreement  encompassed\r\ncauses of action including but not limited to the \"'Americans\r\nwith  Disabilities  Act,'  or  the  local  legislation   that\r\nprotects persons with physical and/or mental impairments.\"\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nsignatory  acknowledged  that he  was  signing  the Agreement\r\n\nvoluntarily, that he fully  understood the Agreement, that he\r\n\nhad been advised to consult  with a legal representative, and\r\n\nthat he had seven days to revoke his consent.  On December 1,\r\n\n1993, Rivera  executed the Agreement.   He never  revoked his\r\n\nconsent.  He now  claims that he signed the  Agreement, which\r\n\nhe did  not read at the  time, under duress and  while he was\r\n\nsuffering under a psychiatric disability.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Rivera challenges  the validity of  the release  on\r\n\nthree  grounds:   that enforcement  of  the release  would be\r\n\ncontrary to the policies animating the ADA, that the evidence\r\n\nraised a dispute as  to whether the execution of  the release\r\n\nwas  knowing and  voluntary,  and that  he  should have  been\r\n\npermitted to take additional discovery.  The first two issues\r\n\nare intertwined.\r\n\n          Courts   have,  in  the   employment  law  context,\r\n\ncommonly upheld  releases given  in  exchange for  additional\r\n\nbenefits.    Such  releases  provide  a  means  of  voluntary\r\n\nresolution of  potential and actual legal  disputes, and mete\r\n\nout a type  of industrial  justice.  Thus,  releases of  past\r\n\nclaims have been honored under the laws prohibiting race  and\r\n\ngender  discrimination.   Warnebold v.  Union Pac.

No such special  procedures are set  forth in the\r\n\nADA.\r\n\n          The   protection  Congress  wished   to  afford  to\r\n\ndisabled workers is  consistent, we believe, with  permitting\r\n\nthose workers to  resolve their claims by executing a release\r\n\nin exchange  for benefits  they would not  otherwise receive.\r\n\nThe ADA clearly  encourages private resolution  of employment\r\n\ndisputes, such as by requiring that employers attempt to make\r\n\nreasonable  accommodations and  that the  EEOC try  to settle\r\n\ndisputes informally.

Indeed, as the  district court pointed  out,\r\n\nthe  report of the conference committee on the ADA evinces an\r\n\nintent to  permit individuals to settle or waive claims under\r\n\nthe  ADA by express, voluntary agreement.

We conclude  that such  releases are\r\n\npermissible under the ADA, and turn to whether the release at\r\n\nissue here was valid.\r\n\n          Waiver  and  release  are affirmative  defenses  on\r\n\nwhich  the employer bears the burden.

It is not enough for  an\r\n\nemployee simply to assert that he was disabled at the time he\r\n\nexecuted  the  release  and  the   employer  knew  it.

Unlike waiver of pension  benefits under ERISA, waiver of\r\nwelfare benefits such  as those at  issue here are not,  as a\r\ngeneral matter,  subject to heightened  scrutiny.

Not all  disabilities and not  all psychiatric\r\n\ndisabilities inherently involve a question about capacity  to\r                                   \r\n\nact  knowingly  and  voluntarily.     Cf.

Summary\r\n\njudgment  is appropriate  where \"the  pleadings, depositions,\r\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,  together\r\n\nwith  the affidavits, if any,  show that there  is no genuine\r\n\nissue as  to any material  fact and that the  moving party is\r\n\nentitled to  judgment as a matter  of law.\"  Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56(c).    Here,  the  only  sworn  evidence  as  to  Rivera's\r\n\ncondition  and  its  effects  is  the  statement  in his  own\r\n\naffidavit: \"I was  very depressed because  I could no  longer\r\n\nwork;  anxious   and  confused  and   was  under  psychiatric\r\n\ntreatment.\"   Rivera failed to  submit an affidavit  from his\r\n\ntreating psychiatrist or from any other medical expert.6  The\r\n\ncourt  was left with  no competent medical  evidence going to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Rivera did submit a case summary prepared by his treating\r\npsychiatrist.   However, as  defendants pointed out  in their\r\nreply  memorandum  in support  of  their  motion for  summary\r\njudgment, this document constituted inadmissible hearsay.  It\r\nwas not  supported by  an accompanying affidavit.

The administrative law  judge found that Rivera suffered\r\n\nfrom  dysthymia as  well as  post-traumatic stress  disorder.\r\n\nEven giving  these findings some evidentiary  weight they are\r\n\ninsufficient, without more, to create a genuine issue of fact\r\n\nas to Rivera's mental capacity.   Mere evidence of diagnostic\r\n\nlabels without content  tying them to capacity to  give valid\r\n\nconsent  is  inadequate   to  create  an  issue   as  to  the\r\n\nconsequences of the disorders  on an individual's capacity to\r\n\ngive valid consent.\r\n\n          Rivera  never  states  in  his affidavit  that  his\r\n\ncondition  was  such that  he  could not  give  voluntary and\r\n\nknowing consent.   The social security  judge's decision says\r\n\nnothing  on these  points.   And,  as we  said, there  was no\r\n\naffidavit  from  any  doctor.     Furthermore,  despite   his\r\n\ndiagnosed  dysthymia  and  post-traumatic   stress  disorder,\r\n\nduring this  period he  was actively pursuing  his disability\r\n\nclaim and did  not tell his employer and its  insurer that he\r\n\nlacked the  capacity to do so.   On this record,  there is no\r\n\nevidence  sufficient  to  establish  lack of  capacity.    In\r\n\nreaching this conclusion, we say nothing about the outcome in\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\na  case involving similar facts in which the plaintiff put on\r\n\ncompetent medical evidence.\r\n\n          We  consider the  remaining circumstances.   Rivera\r\n\nhad  42 days  to  examine  the  Agreement,7 discuss  it  with\r\n\nwhomever  he chose  and ask  questions before  he signed  it.\r\n\nRivera attempts  to raise a  dispute about  when he  actually\r\n\nreceived the Agreement.  However, the employer filed with its\r\n\nsummary judgment papers a receipt for the release executed by\r\n\nRivera.  Rivera has not  fairly met this evidence.  At  most,\r\n\nhis  affidavit says that he did not recall if he received the\r\n\nrelease then.  That is insufficient to create a genuine issue\r\n\nof fact.  See Ayer v.

The court noted that Rivera\r\n\nwas  given the Agreement and  release along with  a letter of\r\n\ntermination,  which  suggested  there  was  little  room  for\r\n\nnegotiation.  However, as the district court pointed out, the\r\n\nlanguage  of the  release  is clear  and  unmistakable:   the\r\n\nwaiver clause expressly mentions the ADA and states that  all\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  Agreement  was  internally inconsistent  in  that it\r\nprovided  for  at least  a  45-day period  for  examining the\r\ndocument but apparently expired 44 days after the date it was\r\nissued.   We need not reach this issue, however, as plaintiff\r\nnever claimed that the Agreement was invalid for this reason.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nclaims  for  disability are  released.    The district  court\r\n\nconcluded that Rivera's sense that he was treated unjustly in\r\n\nthis situation does  not mean that his  signing the Agreement\r\n\nwas not voluntary or knowing.\r\n\n          Rivera argues  that the district court was required\r\n\nto rule first on  the merits of his liability  claims against\r\n\nthe  employer  before reaching  the  issue of  waiver.   This\r\n\nargument  has the matter  exactly backwards.   Even if Rivera\r\n\nhad valid claims under  the ADA and other statutes,  he could\r\n\nhave  waived those claims.  It was both logical and efficient\r\n\nto take up first the matter of waiver.\r\n\n          As  for   Rivera's  argument  that  he  was  denied\r\n\ndiscovery, it is too little and too late.  Our  review of the\r\n\ndistrict court's discovery-related decisions  is for abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion,  and \"[w]e  will intervene  in such  matters only\r\n\nupon a clear showing  of manifest injustice.\"  Mack  v.

R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 56(f).   Indeed, he filed a cross-motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment.   Under these circumstances, there was  no abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          For these reasons, to  the extent (if at  all) that\r\n\nRivera's  remaining non-ADA claims  have been  preserved, the\r\n\nwaiver and release are valid as to them.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n</pre>",
