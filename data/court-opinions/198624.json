Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Stahl and Lipez,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Salvador Perez Mayol on brief for appellant Raul Antonio\r\nLopez-Cosme.\r\n   Ignacio Fernandez de Lahongrais on brief for appellant Andres\r\nCapellan-Perez.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E.

In these two companion cases, appellants\r\nchallenge their convictions and/or sentences imposed following\r\ntheir guilty pleas to conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  See 21\r\nU.S.C.  846.  We affirm.\r\n          I.  Appeal No. 98-1827.\r\n          Raul Antonio Lopez-Cosme challenges his sentence. \r\nContrary to his suggestion, the court's imposition of the five-\r\nyear statutory mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\r\n 841(b)(1)(B) did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment\r\nor violate a right to individualized sentencing under the\r\nEighth Amendment.  See Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957\r\n(1991) (holding that sentence of life imprisonment without\r\nparole for possessing 672 grams of cocaine did not violate the\r\nEighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause); United\r\nStates v. Campusano, 947 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"There is\r\nno constitutional right, in non-capital cases, to\r\nindividualized sentencing.\").  Lopez-Cosme has failed to\r\ndemonstrate that the district court erred in holding him\r\nresponsible for the amount of cocaine stipulated to in the plea\r\nagreement.  See generally United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124\r\nF.3d 342, 354 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Sanchez-Barreto,\r\n93 F.3d 17, 25 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1068\r\n(1997).  Finally, he concedes, and we agree, that he is\r\nineligible for relief under the \"safety valve\" provision of 18\r\nU.S.C.  3553(f) because of his criminal record. \r\n          Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.  See  Loc. R.\r\n27.1.\r\n          II.  Appeal No. 98-1828.\r\n          Counsel for Andres Capellan-Perez has submitted an\r\nAnders brief and motion to withdraw representation, asserting\r\nthat there are no meritorious issues to be raised on appeal. \r\nSee Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Loc. R.\r\n46.4(a)(4).  Counsel also moves to withdraw his statement of\r\nissues.  Capellan-Perez has filed an \"opposition\" to the Anders\r\nbrief in which he argues ineffective assistance of trial\r\ncounsel.  \r\n          We agree with counsel that there was no plain error\r\nin failing to apply the \"safety valve\" provision in 18 U.S.C.\r\n 3553(f).  We have carefully reviewed the record and have\r\nfound no non-frivolous issue.  Capellan-Perez's ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel argument is not properly raised on direct\r\nappeal.  See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).\r\n          Accordingly, the motion to withdraw representation is\r\ngranted, and the judgment is affirmed.  Counsel's motion to\r\nwithdraw his statement of issues is denied since we have\r\nconsidered the issue raised therein.  Our disposition of this\r\nappeal is without prejudice to Capellan-Perez raising his\r\nineffective assistance of counsel argument in a 28 U.S.C. \r\n2255 petition.  We express no opinion on the merits of any such\r\nargument should a timely  2255 petition be filed.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
