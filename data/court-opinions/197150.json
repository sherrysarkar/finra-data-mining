Plaintiff-appellee Joaquim  Conde\r                    CYR, Circuit Judge.\r                                      \r\n\nsustained a permanent injury to his left hand on August 13, 1988,\r\n\nwhile serving as first mate aboard the commercial  fishing vessel\r\n\nF/V  ALENTEJO  which was  navigating  in  rough  waters  east  of\r\n\nNantucket on the  Georges Bank.1   Two days  after the  accident,\r\n\nEdward Monteiro, an adjuster for the ALENTEJO's insurer, obtained\r\n\nan  oral statement from Conde  in Portuguese.   Since Conde could\r\n\nspeak little English and was unable to read it, Monteiro purport-\r\n\ned  to translate the written  English statement back  to Conde in\r\n\nPortuguese.    Unbeknownst  to  Conde, the  statement  he  signed\r\n\nindicated that  the ALENTEJO  had been  travelling at  slow speed\r\n\nwhen  the  accident occurred  and it  makes  no mention  of other\r\n\ncritical facts  about which  Conde had  informed Monteiro in  his\r\n\ninterview.  For instance, the written statement  omits any refer-\r\n\nence  to the captain's refusal  to slow the  vessel and lower the\r\n\nfishing net to  deck-level so  that Conde and  his fellow  worker\r\n\nwould not  have to stand  on the slippery deck,  from which tiles\r\n\nwere missing, while repairing the net.\r\n\n          In September 1990, Conde brought the present action for\r\n\nnegligence and  unseaworthiness  against appellant  Starlight  I,\r\n\nInc., owner  of the ALENTEJO.   See 46 U.S.C.    688 (Jones Act);\r                                             \r\n\nMiles  v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 29 (1990) (unseaworthi-\r                                     \r\n\nness).   At trial, the  defense relied heavily  upon the apparent\r\n\ndiscrepancies  between  Conde's trial  testimony and  the written\r\n\n                         \r                                   \r\n\n     1Almost  six  years  later,  Conde  obtained  a  nonmaritime\r\nfactory job at a reduced salary.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nstatement he unwittingly gave to Monteiro, the adjuster.   Conde,\r\n\non the other hand, contended that Starlight and Monteiro, antici-\r\n\npating  litigation,  had collaborated  to  misrepresent  the oral\r\n\nstatement Conde made to Monteiro.  \r\n\n          After the  jury awarded Conde $350,000  in damages, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  granted  a new  trial  due  to  improper closing\r\n\nargument  by Conde's  counsel.   The second  trial resulted  in a\r\n\n$968,500  award  to Conde:    $118,500  for  past economic  loss;\r\n\n$50,000 for pain and suffering;  and $800,000 for future economic\r\n\nloss.  The  district court denied  Starlight's second motion  for\r\n\nnew  trial, subject to Conde's agreement to remit all damages for\r\n\nfuture  economic loss  above $254,212.50.   On  appeal, Starlight\r\n\nchallenges both the denial of its second motion for new trial and\r\n\nthe amount of the remittitur.2  \r\n\nI.   Second Motion for New Trial\r          I.   Second Motion for New Trial\r                                          \r\n\n          Starlight  contends  that four  improper  statements by\r\n\nConde's  counsel in closing  argument warrant yet  a third trial.\r\n\nFirst,  counsel  observed,   without  evidentiary  support,  that\r\n\nMonteiro  and  defense  attorney  Thomas  Clinton,  Esquire, were\r\n\n\"friends\"  and  had \"been  working  together  for twenty  years.\"\r\n\nStarlight argues that the  veiled reference to possible collusion\r\n\nbetween Monteiro  and Clinton was wholly  immaterial and deliber-\r\n\nately inflammatory.   We find no abuse of  discretion.  See Ahern\r                                                                           \r\n                         \r                                   \r\n\n     2Since we deny Starlight's appeal, we need not reach Conde's\r\ncontingent  cross-appeal from the  district court  order granting\r\nStarlight's first motion  for new  trial.  We  assume that  Conde\r\nwould opt for a reduced total remittitur of $364,736, rather than\r\nreinstatement of the first jury award (i.e., $350,000).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nv. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 780 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r                   \r\n\n          Monteiro  testified  on  redirect  examination  that he\r\n\nasked  Conde  to sign  the August  15,  1988, statement  in three\r\n\nplaces for  Conde's own  \"protection,\" to prevent  its alteration\r\n\nafter  it left Monteiro's  possession.   Later in  his testimony,\r\n\nhowever, Monteiro admitted that  he himself had given the  state-\r\n\nment directly  to Thomas  Clinton, Esquire, Starlight's  counsel.\r\n\nWhen  asked whether  he had  known Clinton  well prior  to August\r\n\n1988,  Monteiro  acknowledged that  they  were  on a  \"first-name\r\n\nbasis,\" and had worked together previously.  \r\n\n          We normally presume that a jury follows instructions to\r\n\ndisregard improper argumentation.  See Greer v. Miller,  483 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n756, 766 n.8  (1987); Sweeney  v. Westvaco Co.,  926 F.2d 29,  36\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 502 U.S.  899 (1991).  So  it is here.\r                                   \r\n\nAfter  Clinton  objected  to the  remark  by  Conde's  counsel in\r\n\nclosing argument, the court promptly cautioned  the jury that the\r\n\nevidence did  not establish  a \"friendship\" between  Monteiro and\r\n\nClinton.  Moreover, Monteiro's business relationship with Clinton\r                                                              \r\n\nwas in evidence.   Finally, the Monteiro-Clinton relationship was\r\n\nat  least somewhat  probative of  the plausibility  of Monteiro's\r\n\ntestimony concerning  why he  considered it necessary  that Conde\r\n\nsign the August 15, 1988, statement in three places.  \r\n\n          Second,  Starlight relies  on a  closing remark  to the\r\n\neffect  that  the  captain's  consumption  of  several  alcoholic\r\n\nbeverages as late as the evening meal the day of the accident had\r\n\nimpaired his judgment, and likely explained his negligent refusal\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nto slow  the vessel  and lower the  net as  Conde had  requested.\r\n\nAlthough another fishing vessel  captain testified that no vessel\r\n\ncaptain should  consume alcohol while navigating  a vessel, Star-\r\n\nlight  insists that it was  necessary for Conde  to adduce expert\r\n\ntoxicological evidence as to how the particular  level of alcohol\r\n\nconsumption  established by  the evidence typically  would impair\r\n\nhuman judgment. \r\n\n          The authorities cited by Starlight simply stand for the\r\n\nthesis that expert toxicological testimony  may be used to estab-\r                                                         \r\n\nlish  the likely  effects of  alcohol.   See Armand  v. Louisiana\r                                                                           \r\n\nPower &amp; Light Co., 482 So.2d 802, 804 (Ct.

We do not\r\n\nagree.  \r\n\n          For  one thing,  Starlight  did not  object to  Conde's\r\n\nrepeated  references  to  Monteiro  as  an \"adjuster\"  throughout\r\n\neither the  first or second  trial.   Thus, the tardiness  of its\r\n\nobjection calls into serious  question whether the litigants, let\r\n\nalone the jury, inferred that Monteiro  was an \"insurance adjust-\r                                                                   \r\n\ner,\" cf., e.g., NLRB v.

(\"[T]he fact\r                              \r\n\nthat defendant's insurer employed  [a witness] was clearly admis-\r\n\nsible to show possible bias of that witness.\"), cert. denied, 434\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  856  (1977).     Starlight's  entire  defense  centered  on\r\n\nMonteiro's  credibility  in regard  to  the  authenticity of  his\r\n\n\"translation\" of Conde's August 15, 1988 statement.\r\n\n          Finally,  Starlight argues  that Conde's  attorney once\r\n\nagain  argued  facts not  in evidence,  and  invited the  jury to\r\n\nengage in rank speculation, by noting that the captain might have\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nbeen steaming the ALENTEJO full speed ahead in an attempt to flee\r\n\nCanadian waters before Canadian patrol boats detected the vessel.\r\n\nOn  the contrary, according to Starlight's own expert, based on a\r\n\nreverse extrapolation  of its known course  immediately after the\r\n\naccident,  the ALENTEJO probably had been on the Canadian side of\r\n\nthe Hague Line just  prior to the accident.   This circumstantial\r\n\nevidence  combined powerfully  with the  captain's  own testimony\r\n\nthat he previously  served aboard  a fishing vessel  seized by  a\r\n\nCanadian patrol boat and that he knew on August 13, 1988 that the\r\n\nsame  Canadian  patrol  boat  was  within  one-half  mile  of the\r\n\nALENTEJO.

As  Conde was injured  in mid-August,\r\n\n1988, however, the  jury reasonably could have looked  to Conde's\r\n\nhigher 1988  income projection as  a more accurate  reflection of\r\n\nhis  future  earning power  than the  1987  income.

Starlight\r\n\noffers no evidentiary  support for its contention  that a commer-\r\n\ncial fisherman  would not qualify as  a \"non-agricultural\" worker\r\n\n(i.e., one who does  not cultivate land) for purposes of the 1995\r               \r\n\nEconomic  Report of  the President,  which the  parties otherwise\r\n\nstipulated  as  a  source of  the  applicable  \"non-agricultural\"\r\n\ninflation rate.  Nor did Starlight  adduce any evidence as to how\r\n\nits suggested offset  to the stipulated inflation rate  should be\r\n\ncalculated.    We  therefore  conclude  that  it  has  failed  to\r\n\ndemonstrate any \"conscience-shocking\"  adjustment in  calculating\r\n\nan inflation rate.  See supra note 3. \r                                       \r\n\n          Finally, Starlight argues that the trial court used the\r\n\n$118,500  jury  award for  past  economic loss  to  calculate the\r\n                         \r                                   \r\n\n     4Although Conde earned $35,930  in gross income during 1987,\r\nhe  incurred extraordinary  unreimbursed work  expenses ($19,404)\r\nwhich effectively reduced his annual income to only $16,526.  See\r                                                                           \r\nJones &amp; Laughlin, 462 U.S. at 534 (recommending that unreimbursed\r                          \r\nwork expenses be deducted before estimating future lost stream of\r\nincome).

See infra note 7. \r                                                         \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nrelevant \"base year\" salary (i.e., Conde's lost income for  1995)\r                                           \r\n\nwith which  to extrapolate his future  (i.e., post-1995) economic\r                                                      \r\n\nloss, rather than predicating the base figure calculation direct-\r\n\nly on the trial  evidence.5  Although neither we  nor the parties\r\n\nhave been able to reconstruct the exact mathematical calculations\r\n\nutilized by  the district court,6  the trial evidence,  viewed in\r\n\nthe light most  favorable to  Conde, would  yield an  approximate\r\n\n                         \r                                   \r\n\n     5The court explained its methodology as follows: \r\n\n          In determining  the figure  to which to  remit the\r\n     award  for loss  of  future earning  capacity, I  shall\r\n     endeavor to arrive at the maximum figure which the jury\r\n     could have awarded using as a guide the amount the jury\r\n     awarded the plaintiff  for lost wages from  the date of\r\n     the  accident  to  the   date  of  the  verdict,  i.e.,\r\n     $118,500.   For this purpose, I shall  assume the jury,\r\n     in arriving at the  $118,500 figure, deducted an amount\r\n     for what  was earned  and what  could have  been earned\r\n     after the plaintiff reached  an end medical result.   I\r\n     shall also take into account the fact that the wages of\r\n     non-agricultural workers from 1988 to 1995 rose approx-\r\n     imately 3%  a year  or 20.25%  over the entire  period.\r\n     After  making  these  adjustments,  what  results is  a\r\n     figure of expected earnings for  1995 in the amount  of\r\n     $29,020.  I  shall then  apply a reduction  of 20%  for\r\n     taxes  and a 1% discount  rate to arrive  at the amount\r\n     the plaintiff would have earned over the 26 year period\r\n     of his work expectancy reduced to present value.  Using\r\n     this methodology,  the result is  $254,212.[50]. (Foot-\r\n     notes omitted.)\r\n\n     6As future loss calculations are multiplex, effective appel-\r\nlate review may be greatly inhibited by any lack of particularity\r\nin  the trial  court's methodology.   Given these  latent ambigu-\r\nities, we could remand  to the district court for  clarification,\r\nsee Jones &amp; Laughlin,  462 U.S. at 546, 552  (refusing invitation\r                              \r\nto adopt one calculation  methodology as \"the exclusive method\"),\r\nbut  for  reasons of  judicial economy  we  opt to  calculate the\r\nmaximum  future  economic loss  based  directly  on the  evidence\r\nbefore the jury.

For instance, the written statement omits any reference to the captain's refusal to slow the vessel and lower the fishing net to deck-level so that Conde and his fellow worker would not have to stand on the slippery deck, from which tiles were missing, while repairing the net.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, Conde brought the present action for negligence and unseaworthiness against appellant Starlight I, Inc., owner of the ALENTEJO.  See 46 U.S.C.App. &#167; 688 (Jones Act);  Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 29, 111 S.Ct. 317, 323-24, 112 L.Ed.2d 275 (1990) (unseaworthiness).  At trial, the defense relied heavily upon the apparent discrepancies between Conde's trial testimony and the written statement he unwittingly gave to Monteiro, the adjuster.  Conde, on the other hand, contended that Starlight and Monteiro, anticipating litigation, had collaborated to misrepresent the oral statement Conde made to Monteiro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury awarded Conde $350,000 in damages, the district court granted a new trial due to improper closing argument by Conde's counsel.  The second trial resulted in a $968,500 award to Conde:  $118,500 for past economic loss;  $50,000 for pain and suffering;  and $800,000 for future economic loss.  The district court denied Starlight's second motion for new trial, subject to Conde's agreement to remit all damages for future economic loss above $254,212.50.  On appeal, Starlight challenges both the denial of its second motion for new trial and the amount of the remittitur.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Second Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starlight contends that four improper statements by Conde's counsel in closing argument warrant yet a third trial.  First, counsel observed, without evidentiary support, that Monteiro and defense attorney Thomas Clinton, Esquire, were \"friends\" and had \"been working together for twenty years.\"   Starlight argues that the veiled reference to possible collusion between Monteiro and Clinton was wholly immaterial and deliberately inflammatory.  We find no abuse of discretion.  See Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 780 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monteiro testified on redirect examination that he asked Conde to sign the August 15, 1988, statement in three places for Conde's own \"protection,\" to prevent its alteration after it left Monteiro's possession.  Later in his testimony, however, Monteiro admitted that he himself had given the statement directly to Thomas Clinton, Esquire, Starlight's counsel.  When asked whether he had known Clinton well prior to August 1988, Monteiro acknowledged that they were on a \"first-name basis,\" and had worked together previously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We normally presume that a jury follows instructions to disregard improper argumentation.  See Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 767 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 3109 n. 8, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987);  Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., 926 F.2d 29, 36 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 899, 112 S.Ct. 274, 116 L.Ed.2d 226 (1991).  So it is here.  After Clinton objected to the remark by Conde's counsel in closing argument, the court promptly cautioned the jury that the evidence did not establish a \"friendship\" between Monteiro and Clinton.  Moreover, Monteiro's business relationship with Clinton was in evidence.  Finally, the Monteiro-Clinton relationship was at least somewhat probative of the plausibility of Monteiro's testimony concerning why he considered it necessary that Conde sign the August 15, 1988, statement in three places.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Starlight relies on a closing remark to the effect that the captain's consumption of several alcoholic beverages as late as the evening meal the day of the accident had impaired his judgment, and likely explained his negligent refusal to slow the vessel and lower the net as Conde had requested.  Although another fishing vessel captain testified that no vessel captain should consume alcohol while navigating a vessel, Starlight insists that it was necessary for Conde to adduce expert toxicological evidence as to how the particular level of alcohol consumption established by the evidence typically would impair human judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities cited by Starlight simply stand for the thesis that expert toxicological testimony may be used to establish the likely effects of alcohol.  See Armand v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., 482 So.2d 802, 804 (La.App.Ct.1986) (\"[A]ll experts agreed that .30% or .23% [blood alcohol] would impair the motor abilities and judgment of anyone.\");   see also People v. Modesto, 66 Cal.2d 695, 59 Cal.Rptr. 124, 126, 427 P.2d 788, 790, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1009, 88 S.Ct. 574, 19 L.Ed.2d 608 (1967), overruled on other grounds, Maine v. Superior Court, 68 Cal.2d 375, 66 Cal.Rptr. 724, 729 n. 8, 438 P.2d 372, 377 n. 8 (1968).  These authorities in no manner suggest that such testimony is invariably required.  Cf., e.g., United States v. Hillsberg, 812 F.2d 328, 333 (7th Cir.)  (\"The jury would likely have little knowledge of the effects of mental diseases and defects.  Laymen do have occasion, however, to learn the effects of alcohol.\"), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1041, 107 S.Ct. 1981, 95 L.Ed.2d 821 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Starlight contends that repeated references to Monteiro as an \"adjuster,\" during direct and redirect examination and in closing remarks by Conde's counsel, violated Federal Evidence Rule 411 (\"Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.\").  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, Starlight did not object to Conde's repeated references to Monteiro as an \"adjuster\" throughout either the first or second trial.  Thus, the tardiness of its objection calls into serious question whether the litigants, let alone the jury, inferred that Monteiro was an \"insurance adjuster,\" cf., e.g., NLRB v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local 340, 481 U.S. 573, 581, 107 S.Ct. 2002, 2008, 95 L.Ed.2d 557 (1987) (union's \"grievance adjuster or collective bargainer\");  Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 732, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 1032, 10 L.Ed.2d 93 (1963) (\"debt adjuster\"), let alone that Starlight carried liability insurance.  In all events, Rule 411 does permit mention of insurance coverage, not to prove negligence, but collaterally to show the possible \"bias or prejudice of a witness.\"   See Pinkham v. Burgess, 933 F.2d 1066, 1072 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Rule 411 itself contemplates that evidence that the defendant was insured may be admissible on issues other than negligence.\");  Charter v. Chleborad, 551 F.2d 246, 248 (8th Cir.)  (\"[T]he fact that defendant's insurer employed [a witness] was clearly admissible to show possible bias of that witness.\"), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 856, 98 S.Ct. 176, 54 L.Ed.2d 128 (1977).  Starlight's entire defense centered on Monteiro's credibility in regard to the authenticity of his \"translation\" of Conde's August 15, 1988 statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Starlight argues that Conde's attorney once again argued facts not in evidence, and invited the jury to engage in rank speculation, by noting that the captain might have been steaming the ALENTEJO full speed ahead in an attempt to flee Canadian waters before Canadian patrol boats detected the vessel.  On the contrary, according to Starlight's own expert, based on a reverse extrapolation of its known course immediately after the accident, the ALENTEJO probably had been on the Canadian side of the Hague Line just prior to the accident.  This circumstantial evidence combined powerfully with the captain's own testimony that he previously served aboard a fishing vessel seized by a Canadian patrol boat and that he knew on August 13, 1988 that the same Canadian patrol boat was within one-half mile of the ALENTEJO.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Remittitur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starlight claims that the trial court miscalculated the remittitur at $254,212.50.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Starlight first projects a total future economic loss as low as $27,199, by using Conde's 1987 income, rather than the higher 1988 income figure, for arriving at a base annual salary.  As Conde was injured in mid-August, 1988, however, the jury reasonably could have looked to Conde's higher 1988 income projection as a more accurate reflection of his future earning power than the 1987 income.  See Eastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 40 F.3d 492, 502 (1st Cir.1994) (in ruling on remittitur motion, court examines evidence \"in the light most favorable to the prevailing party\");  see also Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Pfeifer, 462 U.S. 523, 538, 103 S.Ct. 2541, 2551, 76 L.Ed.2d 768 (1983) (\"It is both easier and more precise to discount the entire lost stream of earnings back to the date of injury--the moment from which earning capacity was impaired.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starlight next argues that the 3% per annum adjustment for inflation in \"non-agricultural\" workers' wages from 1988 to 1995 (i.e., 20.25% in aggregate) was excessive because a commercial fisherman would not be classified as a \"non-agricultural worker\" and recent federal restrictions upon commercial fishing on Georges Bank have depressed fishermen's wages.  Starlight offers no evidentiary support for its contention that a commercial fisherman would not qualify as a \"non-agricultural\" worker (i.e., one who does not cultivate land) for purposes of the 1995 Economic Report of the President, which the parties otherwise stipulated as a source of the applicable \"non-agricultural\" inflation rate.  Nor did Starlight adduce any evidence as to how its suggested offset to the stipulated inflation rate should be calculated.  We therefore conclude that it has failed to demonstrate any \"conscienceshocking\" adjustment in calculating an inflation rate.  See supra note 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Starlight argues that the trial court used the $118,500 jury award for past economic loss to calculate the relevant \"base year\" salary (i.e., Conde's lost income for 1995) with which to extrapolate his future (i.e., post-1995) economic loss, rather than predicating the base figure calculation directly on the trial evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Although neither we nor the parties have been able to reconstruct the exact mathematical calculations utilized by the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the trial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Conde, would yield an approximate discounted future economic loss of $196,236.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unknowable and unquantifiable factors involved in calculating a future stream of lost income (e.g., future inflation rates;  actual work life), militate against \"a search for 'delusive exactness,' \" since \"[i]t is perfectly obvious that the most detailed inquiry can at best produce an approximate result.\"  Jones &amp; Laughlin, 462 U.S. at 546, 552, 103 S.Ct. at 2555, 2558.   Even viewing the trial evidence most generously to Conde, however, the $254,212.50 award for future economic loss effectively disregards a significant and practicably quantifiable factor:  the need to reduce future economic loss to present value, even if only by the most conservative discount figure (1%), see supra note 7, particularly since the parties stipulated below that some \"present value\" reduction would be appropriate, albeit reserving the precise discount rate (1% or 2%).  Cf. id. at 548, 103 S.Ct. at 2556 (noting that use of discount rate between 1% and 3% in Jones Act case would not be an abuse of discretion).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these somewhat less \"elusive\" circumstances, we conclude that the 30% discrepancy between the $254,212.50 and the $196,236 economic-loss figures is sufficiently quantifiable and substantial that it ought not stand.  Sanchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 724 (1st Cir.1994);  cf.  Jones &amp; Laughlin, 462 U.S. at 552, 103 S.Ct. at 2558 (noting that jury awards for pain and suffering are \"highly impressionistic\");  Ruiz v. Gonzalez Caraballo, 929 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir.1991) (\"After all, '[t]ranslating legal damage [viz., physical effects of post-traumatic stress syndrome] into money damages--especially in cases which involve few significant items of measurable economic loss--is a matter peculiarly within a jury's ken.' \")  (quoting Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 215 (1st Cir.1987)).  Accordingly, we direct a further remittitur.  See Kolb v. Goldring, Inc., 694 F.2d 869, 875 (1st Cir.1982) (appellate court may order a new trial, in the event claimant rejects further remittitur, where trial court error in calculating remittitur was clear and mere \"mechanical\" correction is required) (citing Stapleton v. Kawasaki Heavy Indus., 608 F.2d 571, 574 n. 7 (5th Cir.1979));  Everett v. S.H.

For this purpose, I shall assume the jury, in arriving at the $118,500 figure, deducted an amount for what was earned and what could have been earned after the plaintiff reached an end medical result.  I shall also take into account the fact that the wages of non-agricultural workers from 1988 to 1995 rose approximately 3% a year or 20.25% over the entire period.  After making these adjustments, what results is a figure of expected earnings for 1995 in the amount of $29,020.  I shall then apply a reduction of 20% for taxes and a 1% discount rate to arrive at the amount the plaintiff would have earned over the 26 year period of his work expectancy reduced to present value.

Since Conde could speak little English and was unable to read it, Monteiro purported to translate the written English statement back to Conde in Portuguese.  Unbeknownst to Conde, the statement he signed indicated that the ALENTEJO had been travelling at slow speed when the accident occurred and it makes no mention of other critical facts about which Conde had informed Monteiro in his interview.  For instance, the written statement omits any reference to the captain's refusal to slow the vessel and lower the fishing net to deck-level so that Conde and his fellow worker would not have to stand on the slippery deck, from which tiles were missing, while repairing the net.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, Conde brought the present action for negligence and unseaworthiness against appellant Starlight I, Inc., owner of the ALENTEJO.

At trial, the defense relied heavily upon the apparent discrepancies between Conde's trial testimony and the written statement he unwittingly gave to Monteiro, the adjuster.

The second trial resulted in a $968,500 award to Conde:  $118,500 for past economic loss;  $50,000 for pain and suffering;  and $800,000 for future economic loss.  The district court denied Starlight's second motion for new trial, subject to Conde's agreement to remit all damages for future economic loss above $254,212.50.

First, counsel observed, without evidentiary support, that Monteiro and defense attorney Thomas Clinton, Esquire, were \"friends\" and had \"been working together for twenty years.\"   Starlight argues that the veiled reference to possible collusion between Monteiro and Clinton was wholly immaterial and deliberately inflammatory.  We find no abuse of discretion.  See Ahern v.

Later in his testimony, however, Monteiro admitted that he himself had given the statement directly to Thomas Clinton, Esquire, Starlight's counsel.

After Clinton objected to the remark by Conde's counsel in closing argument, the court promptly cautioned the jury that the evidence did not establish a \"friendship\" between Monteiro and Clinton.  Moreover, Monteiro's business relationship with Clinton was in evidence.  Finally, the Monteiro-Clinton relationship was at least somewhat probative of the plausibility of Monteiro's testimony concerning why he considered it necessary that Conde sign the August 15, 1988, statement in three places.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Starlight relies on a closing remark to the effect that the captain's consumption of several alcoholic beverages as late as the evening meal the day of the accident had impaired his judgment, and likely explained his negligent refusal to slow the vessel and lower the net as Conde had requested.  Although another fishing vessel captain testified that no vessel captain should consume alcohol while navigating a vessel, Starlight insists that it was necessary for Conde to adduce expert toxicological evidence as to how the particular level of alcohol consumption established by the evidence typically would impair human judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities cited by Starlight simply stand for the thesis that expert toxicological testimony may be used to establish the likely effects of alcohol.

On the contrary, according to Starlight's own expert, based on a reverse extrapolation of its known course immediately after the accident, the ALENTEJO probably had been on the Canadian side of the Hague Line just prior to the accident.  This circumstantial evidence combined powerfully with the captain's own testimony that he previously served aboard a fishing vessel seized by a Canadian patrol boat and that he knew on August 13, 1988 that the same Canadian patrol boat was within one-half mile of the ALENTEJO.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

As Conde was injured in mid-August, 1988, however, the jury reasonably could have looked to Conde's higher 1988 income projection as a more accurate reflection of his future earning power than the 1987 income.

Starlight offers no evidentiary support for its contention that a commercial fisherman would not qualify as a \"non-agricultural\" worker (i.e., one who does not cultivate land) for purposes of the 1995 Economic Report of the President, which the parties otherwise stipulated as a source of the applicable \"non-agricultural\" inflation rate.  Nor did Starlight adduce any evidence as to how its suggested offset to the stipulated inflation rate should be calculated.  We therefore conclude that it has failed to demonstrate any \"conscienceshocking\" adjustment in calculating an inflation rate.

Even viewing the trial evidence most generously to Conde, however, the $254,212.50 award for future economic loss effectively disregards a significant and practicably quantifiable factor:  the need to reduce future economic loss to present value, even if only by the most conservative discount figure (1%), see supra note 7, particularly since the parties stipulated below that some \"present value\" reduction would be appropriate, albeit reserving the precise discount rate (1% or 2%).  Cf. id. at 548, 103 S.Ct. at 2556 (noting that use of discount rate between 1% and 3% in Jones Act case would not be an abuse of discretion).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

See Jones &amp; Laughlin, 462 U.S. at 534, 103 S.Ct. at 2549 (recommending that unreimbursed work expenses be deducted before estimating future lost stream of income).

For this purpose, I shall assume the jury, in arriving at the $118,500 figure, deducted an amount for what was earned and what could have been earned after the plaintiff reached an end medical result.  I shall also take into account the fact that the wages of non-agricultural workers from 1988 to 1995 rose approximately 3% a year or 20.25% over the entire period.  After making these adjustments, what results is a figure of expected earnings for 1995 in the amount of $29,020.  I shall then apply a reduction of 20% for taxes and a 1% discount rate to arrive at the amount the plaintiff would have earned over the 26 year period of his work expectancy reduced to present value.  Using this methodology, the result is $254,212.  .

See Jones &amp; Laughlin, 462 U.S. at 537 n. 20, 103 S.Ct. at 2550 n. 20 (\"present value\" reduction premised on plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages).  In an inflationary economy, however, a discount rate (or offset) below the \"market interest\" rate (e.g., 1 or 2%, instead of 6%) may be used, because even though Conde did not adduce specific evidence from which to forecast actual inflation rates in future years, it nonetheless may be presumed that anticipated future inflationary trends will tend to curtail investment returns at levels below the market rate.  Id. at 538-39, 103 S.Ct. at 2551-52.   Although the Supreme Court has declined to mandate a single \"present value\" reduction or a single discount methodology for use in all Jones Act damages calculations, see id. at 550, 103 S.Ct. at 2557, absent extraordinary circumstances the factfinder normally should essay some measure of \"present value\" reduction</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
