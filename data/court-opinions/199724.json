D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Campbell, Bownes and Cyr,\n                    Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     J. Hilary Billings and Billings & Silverstein on brief for\nappellant.\n     Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and F. Mark\nTerison, Senior Litigation Counsel, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       DECEMBER 6, 2001\n\f       Per Curiam.      The    appellant-defendant,            Robert Crosby\n\n(“Crosby”),      conditionally    pleaded       guilty   to    a   charge       of\n\npossession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2252(A)(a)(5)(B), reserving his right to challenge the validity\n\nof a search warrant used to seize evidence from his home.\n\nCrosby claims that the warrant application failed to establish\n\nprobable cause to search because the magistrate declined to\n\nexamine the three images made available by the affiant and the\n\ndescription of the images was “woefully inadequate.”                      Crosby\n\nalso    denies   that   the   good    faith     exception     to   the    Fourth\n\nAmendment’s exclusionary rule applies.\n\n       Probable cause determinations are reviewed de novo. Ornelas\n\nv. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996);                 United States v.\n\nBrunette, 256 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 2001).                    The appellate\n\ncourt’s task, like that of the lower court, “is simply to make\n\na   practical,    common-sense       decision    whether,     given      all   the\n\ncircumstances set forth in the affidavit[,] . . . there is a\n\nfair probability that contraband will be found in a particular\n\nplace.”    Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983); United\n\nStates v. Grant, 218 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir. 2000).                     The legal\n\ndetermination that a particular image is child pornography is\n\nalso reviewed de novo.        United States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28,\n\n\n                                       2\n\f32-33 (1st Cir. 1999).    Our review of the   Leon determination is\n\nde novo as well.   United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 666 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n    The assessment of probable cause focuses on the affidavit.\n\nIn the affidavit, the law enforcement officer averred that there\n\nwas probable cause to believe that there had been a violation of\n\nthe statutes that criminalize the possession and transportation\n\nof child pornography.    To support this allegation, the affidavit\n\nincluded verbatim recitations of at least 10 e-mail postings and\n\nfairly detailed descriptions of approximately 20 images.      Three\n\nphotographs were made available to the magistrate judge.        One\n\nimage was described as “a male who appeared to be prepubescent\n\nposed on a lawn on his stomach and faced away.        His legs are\n\nbent up and held by his hands.       His perineum and anal area are\n\ndepicted.”    In addition to the factual description of the\n\nimages, the affiant quoted an e-mail message in which Crosby\n\nreferenced the existence of more explicit pictures than the\n\nimages described in the affidavit.         Based on the affidavit\n\nalone, the magistrate judge determined that there was probable\n\ncause to issue a warrant.     The district court, after reviewing\n\nthe affidavit and examining the images, affirmed that probable\n\ncause existed and, alternatively, determined that the Leon good\n\nfaith exception applied.    We affirm.\n\n\n                                 3\n\f    Regardless   whether    the    affidavit      contains   sufficiently\n\ndetailed   descriptions    of    the     images   alleged    to   be   child\n\npornography, as well as other supporting data, to find probable\n\ncause, the Leon exception to the exclusionary rule clearly\n\napplies.   United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (1984).               In\n\nLeon the Supreme Court held that, with limited exception, the\n\nexclusionary   rule   should      not    apply    when   police    officers\n\nreasonably rely in good faith on a warrant that subsequently is\n\ndetermined to be invalid.       Id. at 923; United States v. Manning,\n\n79 F.3d 212, 221 (1st Cir. 1999).          We find that the affidavit\n\nhere had ample indicia of probable cause “to render official\n\nbelief in its existence” reasonable.          Leon, 468 U.S. at 923.\n\n    As already noted, to support her contention that Crosby had\n\nviolated   statutes   criminalizing         the   possession      of   child\n\npornography, the agent quoted ten e-mail postings, described in\n\ndetail approximately twenty images, and made three photographs\n\navailable to the magistrate.            This was more than adequate to\n\nallow the magistrate judge to make a considered judgment.                 An\n\nobjectively reasonable agent could have relied in good faith on\n\nthe warrant.   Crosby’s arguments to the contrary are without\n\nmerit.\n\n    The district court’s denial of Crosby’s motion to suppress\n\nis affirmed. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n                                    4\n\f",
