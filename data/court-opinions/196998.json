We affirm.\r\n\n          It  was  appropriate for  the  district court,  sua\r\n\nsponte, to issue  a show cause order  requiring Denchfield to\r\n\nexplain why his complaint should not be dismissed for lack of\r\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.   Cf. In re Recticel Foam Corp.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n859 F.2d 1000, 1002 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"It is too elementary to\r\n\nwarrant citation  of authority that a court has an obligation\r\n\nto inquire  sua sponte into its  subject matter jurisdiction,\r\n\nand to proceed no further if such jurisdiction is wanting.\").\r\n\nThe  facts alleged  in the  complaint do  not confer  federal\r\n\nquestion  jurisdiction.1   And,  although  Denchfield invoked\r                                   1\r\n\ndiversity jurisdiction and indicated on the civil cover sheet\r\n\nthat  he was seeking $400,000.00, the  complaint is devoid of\r\n\nany specific allegations supporting an amount  in controversy\r\n\nin excess of $50,000.00.  \r\n\n          Once   challenged,  a   party  seeking   to  invoke\r\n\ndiversity  jurisdiction  has  the  burden  of  alleging  with\r\n\nsufficient particularity the facts  indicating that it is not\r\n\na  legal certainty  that  the claim  involves  less than  the\r\n\njurisdictional amount.

Most notably, the\r\ndefendant is  a private citizen,  and the complaint  fails to\r\nallege facts from which it may be inferred that the defendant\r\nacted under \"color of law.\"  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nWorld  Boxing  Ass'n,  942  F.2d  84,  88  (1st  Cir.  1991).\r                                \r\n\nDenchfield's response to the show cause order was egregiously\r\n\nlate and, we think, failed to meet this burden.
