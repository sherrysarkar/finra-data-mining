Grant, Senior Legal  Counsel, Rhode Island  Department\r                             \r\nof Corrections,  on  Memorandum  in  Support  of  Motion  for  Summary\r\nDisposition, for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   Having carefully  examined the  record in\r                            \r\r\n\nthis  case,  we  affirm  the dismissal  of  appellant  Weems'\r\n\ncomplaint.  \r\n\n     First, since the Morris rules  are state law, an alleged\r\n\nviolation  of  them,  without   more,  is  not  a  sufficient\r\n\npredicate  to  sustain a  damage  action  under federal  law.\r\n\nComplaints  of such  violations should  be directed  to state\r\n\ncourt.  Furthermore, insofar  as  Weems  seeks injunctive  or\r\n\ndeclaratory  relief  for  these  alleged  violations,  he  is\r\n\nprecluded  by our  prior holding  that inmates may  not bring\r\n\nindividual  section 1983  actions  for injunctive  or  relief\r\n\nwhich  are based on consent decree violations.  See Martel v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFridovich, 14 F.3d 1, 3 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                     \r\n\n     Second, even  if we assume without  deciding that Weems'\r\n\ndisciplinary  hearings  deprived  him  of  a constitutionally\r\n\nprotected liberty interest, Weems  has still failed to allege\r\n\nsufficient facts to  sustain a  claim that his  right to  due\r\n\nprocess  has   been  violated.     Liberally  construed,  his\r\n\ncomplaint alleges:  (1) that  he was not  provided sufficient\r\n\nnotice  of the  charges prior  to the  disciplinary hearings;\r\n\nand (2) that the board's findings of guilt  were not based on\r\n\nsome evidence in the record.  As to the first, Weems concedes\r\n\nthat he received notice of the disciplinary reports at  least\r\n\n24  hours prior  to the  hearings and  this is  sufficient to\r\n\nsatisfy  due process.  See  Langton v. Berman,  667 F.2d 231,\r                                                         \r\n\n234 (1st Cir. 1981).  As to the second, the record shows that\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nin  each instance  the board  relied on  disciplinary reports\r\n\nwhich  contained eyewitness accounts  of the infractions with\r\n\nwhich Weems was charged.   Moreover, Weems never controverted\r\n\nthe essential  factual allegations on which  the board relied\r\n\nat  the disciplinary  hearing  nor  does  he  do  so  in  his\r\n\ncomplaint.   In these circumstances, the  board's reliance on\r\n\nthe  written reports was proper  and no due process violation\r\n\noccurred.  See  Forbes v.  Trigg, 976 F.2d  308, 318-19  (7th\r                                            \r\n\nCir.  1992)  (finding no  due  process  violation in  similar\r\n\ncircumstances), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 950 (1993).\r                                        \r\n\n     Third, as the Supreme Court has recently made clear, the\r\n\nright  of access  to  the courts  is  the \"right  to bring  a\r\n\ngrievance  that the  inmate wishe[s] to  present.\"   Lewis v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCasey, 1996 WL 340797, at *5 (U.S June 24, 1996).   It is not\r                 \r\n\na right \"to litigate effectively once in court.\"  Id.   Thus,\r                                                                \r\n\nin  order to  prevail on  his claim  that  his constitutional\r\n\nright  was violated, Weems  must show  an \"actual  injury\" by\r\n\n\"demonstrat[ing] that the alleged shortcomings in the library\r\n\nor legal assistance  hindered his efforts  to pursue a  legal\r\n\nclaim.\"   Id.   Not  only has  Weems alleged  no such  actual\r                        \r\n\ninjury but the record makes clear that he was able to present\r\n\nhis alleged  grievances to the  court and  that, as a  pro se\r                                                                         \r\n\nplaintiff, his complaint was liberally construed.  Thus, this\r\n\nclaim is meritless.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Finally,  essentially  for  the  reasons  given  by  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge  in  his report  and  recommendation,  dated\r\n\nSeptember  29, 1995,  Weems'  allegation that  the punishment\r\n\nassessed  him  violated  his  right to  equal  protection  is\r\n\nwithout merit.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
