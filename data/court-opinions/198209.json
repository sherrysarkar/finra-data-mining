Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n     Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nRobert J. Iacovelli for appellant.\r\nAlexandra Leake, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Sheila W. Sawyer,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                  November 19, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Defendant-appellant Benjamin Duarte seeks\r\nreversal of his criminal conviction for being a felon in possession\r\nof a firearm and ammunition, see 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1), based on an\r\nalleged violation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-\r\nincrimination.  He claims that the district court improperly\r\nadmitted into evidence his responses to employment questions asked\r\nwhen he was booked.  We find no error and therefore affirm.\r\nDuarte was arrested after the car he was driving was\r\nstopped by police officers, initially for traffic violations.  The\r\nofficers testified that they saw two objects that turned out to be\r\nfirearms thrown from the windows of the vehicle shortly before it\r\nstopped.  Duarte and his passenger were arrested and placed in\r\npatrol cars to be transported to the police station.  Mirandawarnings were read to Duarte twice: once after he was placed in\r\nthe police cruiser and again at the police station before he was\r\nasked a series of questions from a standard police booking form. \r\nThe questions included one asking his occupation and another asking\r\nhis employer.  Duarte responded that he was unemployed.\r\nDuarte later sought suppression of his responses to the\r\nbooking questions about his employment status, claiming that the\r\nbooking procedure created an \"inherently coercive environment\" that\r\nrendered his statements involuntary and, therefore, inadmissible. \r\nThe district court found no Fifth Amendment violation, concluding\r\nthat the employment status questions were not designed to elicit\r\nincriminating responses from Duarte and consequently fell within an\r\nexception to the Miranda rule for \"routine booking questions.\"  SeePennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U.S. 582, 600-602 (1990).  The court\r\nalso ruled that the New Bedford police had fully protected Duarte's\r\nFifth Amendment rights by giving Miranda warnings twice following\r\nhis arrest, including once shortly before posing the challenged\r\nquestions.\r\nWe have no difficulty in concluding that the district\r\ncourt properly found no constitutional violation.  The cases on\r\nwhich Duarte relies to demonstrate that standard booking questions\r\ncan trigger a Fifth Amendment claim all involve instances in which\r\nno Miranda warnings were given.  See Muniz, 496 U.S. at 600-02;\r\nUnited States v. Doe, 878 F.2d 1546, 1550-52 (lst Cir. 1989);\r\nUnited States v. Gill, 879 F. Supp. 149, 152 (D. Me. 1995).  Where,\r\nas here, the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation is\r\ndissipated by proper administration of the warnings, see Mirandav. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 469 (1966), a defendant challenging\r\nadmission of statements made subsequent to the warnings must point\r\nto evidence tending to show that his statements nonetheless were\r\n\"coerced, compelled or involuntary.\" United States v. Lawrence, 889\r\nF.2d 1187, 1189 (lst Cir. 1989); see, e.g., United States v.\r\nJackson, 918 F.2d 236, 241 (lst Cir. 1990) (totality of the\r\ncircumstances must be examined to determine voluntariness of an\r\nadmission).  Duarte offers no facts suggesting that the booking\r\nprocedure was other than routine or that the officers used unusual\r\npressure   or pressure of any sort, for that matter   to elicit\r\nresponses to the questions about his employment status.  Cf.Lawrence, 889 F.2d at 1190 (describing cases in which confessions\r\nwere found to be voluntary despite circumstances suggestive of\r\ncoercion); Bryant v. Vose, 785 F.2d 364, 368 &amp; n.4 (lst Cir. 1986)\r\n(noting cases in which promises of leniency or other sorts of\r\nmental pressure were found to undermine voluntariness of a\r\nconfession).  Defendant's claim of a Fifth Amendment violation is\r\ntherefore without merit.\r\nHaving determined that the Miranda procedures provided\r\nfull protection in this instance for Duarte's Fifth Amendment\r\nrights, we need not decide whether the challenged evidence also was\r\nadmissible because the employment questions fell within the\r\nexception to the Miranda rule for questioning that is designed to\r\nobtain only routine booking information.  See Muniz, 496 U.S. at\r\n601.  A quick review of the record and caselaw indicate, however,\r\nthat the exception would apply.  See United States v. Gotchis, 803\r\nF.2d 74, 78-79 (2d Cir. 1986) (routine questions about employment\r\ndo not require Miranda warnings).\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n",
