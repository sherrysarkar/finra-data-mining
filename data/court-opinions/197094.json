Amador Irizarry-Sanabria  requests a\r                                 \r\n\ncertificate of  appealability,  see 28  U.S.C.    2253(c)(2),\r                                               \r\n\nfrom  this court to appeal the district court's denial of his\r\n\nmotion filed  under 28 U.S.C.   2255.   We grant the request,\r\n\nbut  affirm  the  judgment  of the  district  court  for  the\r\n\nfollowing reasons.            With   respect  to   Irizarry's\r\n\ncontention   that  he   was   entitled  to   be  present   at\r\n\nresentencing,  we  conclude  that  the  error,  if  any,  was\r\n\nharmless.     Irizarry's  current   sentence  of  121  months\r\n\nimprisonment is  the lowest possible under  the guidelines as\r\n\nrecalculated  by the district  court; that is,  121 months is\r\n\nthe  bottom  of  the  sentencing  range  with  the  two-level\r\n\nincrease  in Irizarry's  base  offense level.   The  district\r\n\ncourt made this increase pursuant to U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(b)(1).\r\n\n          This section states  that \"[i]f a dangerous  weapon\r\n\n(including a  firearm) was possessed, increase  by 2 levels.\"\r\n\nThe  commentary clarifies  that  \"[t]he adjustment  should be\r                                                                      \r\n\napplied  if the  weapon  was present,  unless  it is  clearly\r                                                                         \r\n\nimprobable that  the weapon was connected  with the offense.\"\r                      \r\n\n  2D1.1 comment n.3  (emphasis added).  The facts  as recited\r\n\nin  our opinion on direct appeal establish that at the second\r\n\nmeeting of the conspiracy members, the confidential informant\r\n\ntold the group that he wanted a gun if  he was to go and pick\r\n\nup  the marijuana by himself.   United States  v. Andujar, 49\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1995).  Irizarry then left the house at\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nwhich the meeting was being held and returned soon thereafter\r\n\nwith the gun  in question,  which he gave  to the  informant.\r\n\nId.\r               \r\n\n          Irizarry does  not  dispute  these  facts  on  this\r\n\nappeal.  Given that he procured the gun at the request of the\r\n\nperson  responsible for  picking  up the  drugs so  that this\r\n\nperson could have  the gun for protection during the pick-up,\r\n\nthe  district   court  could  not  have   found  it  \"clearly\r\n\nimprobable\" that the gun was connected to the offense.  Thus,\r\n\nthe  court did  not  have  the  discretion  not  to  apply   \r                               \r\n\n2D1.1(b)(1) and  it could  not have sentenced  Irizarry to  a\r                                          \r\n\nterm  of  imprisonment  lower  than 121  months.    In  these\r\n\ncircumstances,  any error  in  failing to  hold a  sentencing\r\n\nhearing was harmless.\r\n\n          As for the two other grounds raised by  Irizarry in\r\n\nhis    2255 motion, we  affirm the district court's rejection\r\n\nof  them for  the reasons  stated in  its Opinion  and Order,\r\n\ndated April 26, 1996.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge (dissenting).
