Daniel R. Dominguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n                                          \r\n\nEdelmiro Salas Garcia on brief for appellants Pedro M.

As to appeal no. 97-2359, upon careful review\r\nof the briefs and record, we conclude that plaintiffs'\r\n\"jurisdictional\" argument regarding 28 U.S.C.  636(b)(1) is\r\ncompletely frivolous.  We reach this conclusion essentially for\r\nthe reasons stated by the district court in its order dated\r\nSeptember 25, 1997.  Plaintiffs have not developed any other\r\nargument, so we will not consider any other aspect of the\r\njudgment.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\r\nCir. 1990). \r\n    In light of our conclusion that plaintiffs and their\r\nattorney have prosecuted a frivolous appeal, we grantdefendants' motions for sanctions under Fed. R. App. P. 38. \r\nSee also 28 U.S.C.  1927.  We therefore direct plaintiffs,\r\njointly and severally, to pay double costs, and we direct\r\nplaintiffs' attorney personally to pay defendants' reasonable\r\nattorney's fees for appeal no. 97-2359.  See United States v.\r\nNesglo, Inc., 744 F.2d 887, 892 (1st Cir. 1984).  Defendants\r\nare directed to file with this court and serve upon plaintiffs,\r\nwithin 15 days after the date of this opinion, their bills of\r\ncosts and attorney's fees incurred for appeal no. 97-2359. \r\nWithin 10 days after such service upon them, plaintiffs may\r\nfile and serve any objections to those bills.  Thereafter we\r\nwill issue an order taxing the double costs and the reasonable\r\nattorney's fees.\r\n    As to appeal no. 97-2360, we conclude that the denial of\r\ndefendant's motion for sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)\r\nwas within the district court's considerable discretion.  On\r\nthe record before us, we must defer to the district court's\r\nfinding that plaintiffs' motions were based on mistake of law\r\nand not wrongful purposes.\r\n    Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc.\r\nR. 27.1.  The defendants' motions for Rule 38 sanctions are\r\ngranted as provided in this opinion.\n",
