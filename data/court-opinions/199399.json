Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\n\n                       Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Daniel A. Laufer for appellant.\n     Bryan M. Haynes with whom Nicholas T. Christakos and\nSutherland Asbill & Brennan, LLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 7, 2001\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.             The question on this appeal is\n\nwhether    a    New    Hampshire     statute,      regulating,   inter    alia,\n\nbusiness practices as between motor vehicle manufacturers and\n\ndealers,    should      be   read   to   protect     an   existing   franchisee\n\nalleging that the car maker unfairly denied it an additional\n\nfranchise.          The district court denied relief based on state\n\nprecedent, Roberts v. Gen. Motors. Corp., 643 A.2d 956 (N.H.\n\n1994).     We affirm.\n\n            Since 1974, Edward Casaccio has owned and operated\n\nRochester Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. (\"Rochester\"), a dealership in\n\nRochester, New Hampshire, with a franchise from Ford Motor\n\nCompany (\"Ford\") to sell and service Lincoln and Mercury cars.\n\nIn August 1995, Casaccio applied for a franchise to sell Fords\n\nin Rochester as \"Rochester Ford.\"               The incumbent franchisee had\n\ndied and Casaccio had contracted with the heirs to purchase the\n\nFord business, conditional on Ford's approval of Casaccio's\n\napplication.\n\n            Ford’s      regional    sales      manager    rejected   Casaccio's\n\napplication.        To explain his decision, the sales manager pointed\n\nto Rochester's \"historically unsatisfactory sales and market\n\nshare performance.\"          Claiming that his sales record was unfairly\n\ncompared       to    dealerships    in   more     affluent   areas,    Casaccio\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fappealed    to   higher-level    Ford      officials.     His     appeal   was\n\nunsuccessful.\n\n            In November 1999, Rochester filed a diversity suit in\n\nfederal    district   court,    28   U.S.C.   §   1332   (Supp.    II   1996),\n\nalleging that Ford’s \"arbitrary and/or . . . bad faith\" denial\n\nof Casaccio’s application violated New Hampshire's motor vehicle\n\nfranchise statute.      N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 357-C:3(I) (1995 &\n\nSupp. 2000).     Rochester claimed economic damages of $5 million.\n\nCiting Roberts, the district court granted Ford's motion to\n\ndismiss the complaint for lack of standing to sue under the\n\nstate statute.     Rochester now appeals.\n\n            The New Hampshire statute regulates \"business practices\n\nbetween motor vehicle manufacturers, distributors, and dealers.\"\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 357-C.              Section 357-C:3 (\"Prohibited\n\nConduct\") lists unlawful acts; and subsection I, invoked by\n\nRochester, states:      \"It shall be deemed an unfair method of\n\ncompetition and unfair and deceptive practice for any . . .\n\n[m]anufacturer . . . to engage in any action which is arbitrary,\n\nin bad faith, or unconscionable and which causes damage to any\n\n[\"motor vehicle dealer\"] or to the public.\"\n\n            Section 357-C:12(II) (\"Enforcement\") provides the cause\n\nof action for unlawful acts.         It states that\n\n            any person who is injured in his business or\n            property by a violation of this chapter . .\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          . may bring a civil action in the superior\n          court to enjoin further violations and to\n          recover the actual damages sustained by him\n          together with the costs of the suit,\n          including a reasonable attorney's fee.\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 357-C:12(II) (1995), currently codified\n\nat § 357-C:12(IX) (Supp. 2000).               In Roberts, the New Hampshire\n\nstate court looked to section 357-C:12(II) and held that an\n\nunsuccessful new applicant for a franchise lacked standing under\n\n\"this chapter\" ( i.e., 357-C) because he had not been \"injured in\n\nbusiness or property.\"           643 A.2d at 958-59.\n\n          In cases like this one, there is obviously standing in\n\nthe Article III sense: Rochester can prove, or at least might be\n\nable to prove, that it is economically worse off as a direct\n\nconsequence      of     Ford's    refusal      to    approve    the   franchise\n\napplication.         However, in Roberts, the New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt read subsection I as designed, so far as dealers were\n\nconcerned,      to    protect     existing     dealer   franchises     and   not\n\napplicants who were merely seeking franchises.                 643 A.2d at 959.\n\nIn turn, the district court here found that Rochester, so far as\n\nit was a new applicant, was not intended to be protected.\n\n          Rochester seeks to distinguish Roberts on the ground\n\nthat   Rochester is an existing franchisee and the applicant in\n\nRoberts   was    not.      But,    as   we    read   Roberts,   the   statute's\n\nprotection is for the existing franchise of the franchisee and\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fnot some new and different franchise sought by that person.               The\n\nusual argument for protecting existing franchisees by statute is\n\ntheir investment in the existing franchise, Roberts, 643 A.2d at\n\n960; but while Rochester invested in its franchise to sell\n\nLincolns and Mercuries, it had no investment in a franchise to\n\nsell Fords.\n\n          The    New    Hampshire    court     in   Roberts   stressed   the\n\nstatutory language that extends protection only to the \"business\n\nor property\" of the dealer.         643 A.2d at 958-59.       Another court\n\nmight have said that such language is vague and instead stressed\n\nlikely legislative policy--for it is highly unusual for statutes\n\nto impose some general obligation on businesses to begin new\n\nrelationships and much more common to protect existing ones.               If\n\nwe were construing the statute afresh, we would agree with the\n\nRoberts court, but our agreement is beside the point.              Reading\n\nRoberts as we do, that case is binding on the federal courts as\n\na definitive construction of New Hampshire law by the state's\n\nhighest court.    Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U.S. 447, 455 (1905).\n\n          Counterpart      decisions      in   other   jurisdictions     have\n\ndenied claims by current dealers against their car makers who\n\nrefused   to    grant    or   approve     transfer     requests   for    new\n\nfranchises.     E.g., Key v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 918 P.2d 350,\n\n359-60 (N.M. 1996); Pung v. Gen. Motors Corp., 573 N.W.2d 80,\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f81-82    (Mich.     Ct.    App.   1998).            Rochester      relies     on    Bertera\n\nChrysler Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 992 F. Supp. 64, 69-\n\n70 (D. Mass. 1998), as support for standing in such a case; but\n\nwhile    the      district    court       there       found     \"standing\"      (under       a\n\nMassachusetts statute), it concluded that \"the harm alleged . .\n\n. does not fall within the ambit of [the statute's] protection.\"\n\nId. at 68.        This is Roberts' result, differently phrased.\n\n             In    this     court     (although           not   in    its     complaint),\n\nRochester refers briefly to language, in subsection III(n) of\n\nthe     statute,          providing       that        the   car      maker     shall       not\n\nunreasonably        require       dealer        \"compliance          with      subjective\n\nstandards.\"        N.H. Rv. Stat. Ann. § 357-C:3(III)(n).                       Rochester\n\napparently seeks thus to describe the unfavorable judgment by\n\nFord's      regional      manager        of    Rochester's         past      performance.\n\nFailure to plead this violation in the complaint aside, the\n\nargument is scarcely developed in Rochester's brief and could be\n\nrejected on this account alone.                     Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover,\n\nInc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             In any event, subsection III(n) appears to be directed\n\nin all its provisions to the relationship between the car maker\n\nand   the    dealer       vis-a-vis      the        dealer's    existing       franchise.\n\nNothing in the provision suggests that the legislature aimed to\n\nregulate     the    decisions       of    the       car   maker,     whether       based    on\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\fsubjective standards or otherwise, in awarding or refusing to\n\naward a franchise to an applicant who did not already hold it.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that this statutory language would have\n\nchanged the mind or result of the Roberts court.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -7-\n\f",

His appeal was  unsuccessful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1999, Rochester filed a diversity suit in  federal district court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 (Supp. II 1996),  alleging that Ford's \"arbitrary and/or . . . bad faith\" denial  of Casaccio's application violated New Hampshire's motor vehicle  franchise statute.  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 357-C:3(I) (1995 &amp;  Supp. 2000).  Rochester claimed economic damages of $5 million. Citing Roberts, the district court granted Ford's motion to  dismiss the complaint for lack of standing to sue under the  state statute.  Rochester now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire statute regulates \"business practices  between motor vehicle manufacturers, distributors, and dealers.\" N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 357-C.  Section 357-C:3 (\"Prohibited  Conduct\") lists unlawful acts; and subsection I, invoked by  Rochester, states:  \"It shall be deemed an unfair method of  competition and unfair and deceptive practice for any . . .  [m]anufacturer . . . to engage in any action which is arbitrary,  in bad faith, or unconscionable and which causes damage to any  [\"motor vehicle dealer\"] or to the public.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 357-C:12(II) (\"Enforcement\") provides the cause  of action for unlawful acts.  It states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any person who is injured in his business or  property by a violation of this chapter . .  . may bring a civil action in the superior  court to enjoin further violations and to  recover the actual damages sustained by him  together with the costs of the suit,  including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 357-C:12(II) (1995), currently codified  at &#167; 357-C:12(IX) (Supp. 2000).  In Roberts, the New Hampshire  state court looked to section 357-C:12(II) and held that an  unsuccessful new applicant for a franchise lacked standing under  \"this chapter\" (i.e., 357-C) because he had not been \"injured in  business or property.\"  643 A.2d at 958-59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases like this one, there is obviously standing in  the Article III sense: Rochester can prove, or at least might be  able to prove, that it is economically worse off as a direct  consequence of Ford's refusal to approve the franchise  application.  However, in Roberts, the New Hampshire Supreme  Court read subsection I as designed, so far as dealers were  concerned, to protect existing dealer franchises and not  applicants who were merely seeking franchises.  643 A.2d at 959. In turn, the district court here found that Rochester, so far as  it was a new applicant, was not intended to be protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rochester seeks to distinguish Roberts on the ground  that  Rochester is an existing franchisee and the applicant in Roberts was not.  But, as we read Roberts, the statute's  protection is for the existing franchise of the franchisee and  not some new and different franchise sought by that person.  The  usual argument for protecting existing franchisees by statute is  their investment in the existing franchise, Roberts, 643 A.2d at  960; but while Rochester invested in its franchise to sell  Lincolns and Mercuries, it had no investment in a franchise to  sell Fords.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire court in Roberts stressed the  statutory language that extends protection only to the \"business  or property\" of the dealer.  643 A.2d at 958-59.Another court  might have said that such language is vague and instead stressed  likely legislative policy--for it is highly unusual for statutes  to impose some general obligation on businesses to begin new  relationships and much more common to protect existing ones.  If  we were construing the statute afresh, we would agree with the Roberts court, but our agreement is beside the point.  Reading Roberts as we do, that case is binding on the federal courts as  a definitive construction of New Hampshire law by the state's  highest court.  Smiley v. Kansas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96210\"><a href=\"/opinion/96210/smiley-v-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 455 (1905).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counterpart decisions in other jurisdictions have  denied claims by current dealers against their car makers who  refused to grant or approve transfer requests for new  franchises.  E.g., Key v. Chrysler Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span>, 359-60 (N.M. 1996); Pung v. Gen.

Ct. App. 1998).  Rochester relies on Bertera  Chrysler Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456745\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456745/bertera-chrysler-plymouth-inc-v-chrysler-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 69-70 (D. Mass. 1998), as support for standing in such a case; but  while the district court there found \"standing\" (under a  Massachusetts statute), it concluded that \"the harm alleged . .  . does not fall within the ambit of [the statute's] protection.\" Id. at 68.  This is Roberts' result, differently phrased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court (although not in its complaint), Rochester refers briefly to language, in subsection III(n) of  the statute,  providing that the car maker shall not  unreasonably require dealer \"compliance with subjective  standards.\"  N.H. Rv. Stat. Ann. &#167; 357-C:3(III)(n).  Rochester  apparently seeks thus to describe the unfavorable judgment by  Ford's regional manager of Rochester's past performance. Failure to plead this violation in the complaint aside, the  argument is scarcely developed in Rochester's brief and could be  rejected on this account alone.  Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover,  Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, subsection III(n) appears to be directed  in all its provisions to the relationship between the car maker  and the dealer vis-a-vis the dealer's existing franchise. Nothing in the provision suggests that the legislature aimed to  regulate the decisions of the car maker, whether based on  subjective standards or otherwise, in awarding or refusing to  award a franchise to an applicant who did not already hold it. It is hard to imagine that this statutory language would have  changed the mind or result of the Roberts court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
