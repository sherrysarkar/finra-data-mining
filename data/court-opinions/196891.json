This appeal concerns\r                      BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  \r                                                   \r\n\nthe  interpretation and enforceability  of an indemnification\r\n\nclause  in a  lease  between third-party  defendant-appellant\r\n\nRestoration Preservation Masonry, Inc. (\"RPM\") and defendant-\r\n\nappellee   Dunlop   Equipment   Company,   Inc.   (\"Dunlop\").\r\n\nPlaintiff-appellee  Charles MacGlashing  was injured  when an\r\n\nelevated  work platform  leased  by Dunlop  to RPM  collapsed\r\n\nwhile  he and another employee of RPM  were using it in their\r\n\nmasonry  work.   MacGlashing and  his wife, residents  of New\r\n\nHampshire, brought a diversity action in tort against Dunlop,\r\n\na   Massachusetts  corporation,  in  the  district  court  of\r\n\nMassachusetts.     Dunlop  sued   RPM,  invoking  the   lease\r\n\nindemnification  clause.   Prior to  trial the  MacGlashings,\r\n\nwith court approval, entered into a settlement agreement with\r\n\nDunlop.  The issue  on  appeal is  whether the  MacGlashings,\r\n\nstanding  in the shoes of  Dunlop, can collect  the amount of\r\n\nthe settlement  from RPM under the  indemnification clause of\r\n\nthe lease between RPM and Dunlop.  This issue was decided  in\r\n\nfavor  of the  MacGlashings and  Dunlop by  summary judgment.\r\n\nThere is no question that Massachusetts law applies.  \r\n\n          RPM maintains  that it has no  obligation under the\r\n\nlease agreement to indemnify  Dunlop for damages flowing from\r\n\nCharles  MacGlashing's  accident  because  Dunlop  materially\r\n\nbreached  the agreement.  It also challenges the scope of the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nindemnification clause.  Discerning  no error in the district\r\n\ncourt's summary judgment analysis, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          Viewed  in the  light  most favorable  to RPM,  the\r\n\nnonmoving   party,  the  facts  are  as   follows.    RPM,  a\r\n\nMassachusetts-based corporation, employed Charles MacGlashing\r\n\nas  a  brick  mason until  September  2,  1993,  when he  was\r\n\ninvolved in  a work-related  accident at The  Longwood Towers\r\n\nlocated in  Brookline, Massachusetts.  In  1993, the Longwood\r\n\nCorporation  (\"Longwood\"),  owner  of  The   Longwood  Towers\r\n\ncomplex, commissioned RPM to conduct phase II of a renovation\r\n\nproject at Longwood  Towers.   Like phase I,  which had  been\r\n\ncompleted  a year  earlier  by NER,  Inc.  (\"NER\"), phase  II\r\n\ninvolved removal  and replacement of  brick and stone  at the\r\n\ntop of  three eight-story  buildings located in  the complex.\r\n\nRPM was formed by former employees of  NER.  Several of them,\r\n\nincluding RPM's  president Paul Haven, had worked on phase I.\r\n\nDuring  both phase I and II,  mobile, elevated work platforms\r\n\nfitted with eight-foot outrigger  devices, which extended off\r\n\nthe  main platform  to expand  its width,  were utilized  for\r\n\nstone and brick removal and to make certain setback  portions\r\n\nof  the   buildings   accessible.     The   outriggers   were\r\n\nmodifications to the original platform design. \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          On September 2, 1993, MacGlashing  and a co-worker,\r\n\nJames  Proctor,  were removing  a  piece  of  stone from  the\r\n\nparapets of Building B when the work platform they were using\r\n\ncollapsed.   Both  men  fell  eight  stories to  the  ground.\r\n\nProctor died  from the  injuries he sustained.   MacGlashing,\r\n\nwho  was  thirty-nine at  the  time,  survived, but  suffered\r\n\ninjuries that hospitalized  him for six  months and left  him\r\n\npartially  paralyzed and  in constant  pain.   These injuries\r\n\nincluded, inter alia, broken bones, internal and neurological\r                                \r\n\ndamage,  a ruptured  aorta and  bladder, a  perforated colon,\r\n\nlung damage, and lacerations.  MacGlashing incurred more than\r\n\n$800,000.00 in medical fees  and expenses as a result  of the\r\n\naccident.   His  future medical costs  and net  economic loss\r\n\nhave been  projected between $600,000.00 to  $1.1 million and\r\n\n$1.1 million  to $1.3 million,  respectively.  At  trial, the\r\n\nparties  agreed that  the platform  involved in  the accident\r\n\ncollapsed  because it could not bear the weight placed on it,\r\n\nbut disagreed about whether the platform had been defectively\r\n\ndesigned,   used  negligently,  or  negligently  modified  by\r\n\nDunlop.   Dunlop, whose  business consists of  supplying work\r\n\nplatforms for sale or  lease, provided the platforms employed\r\n\nin  both phase  I and  II of  the Longwood  Towers renovation\r\n\nproject.   It  executed a  July 7,  1993, lease  agreement to\r\n\nprovide four platforms with  RPM's president, Paul Haven, who\r\n\nhad left NER to form RPM.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The lease agreement executed between RPM and Dunlop\r\n\nwas  a standard  form  contract and  contained the  following\r\n\nindemnification clause:\r\n\n            12.    THE LESSEE  HEREBY  ABSOLVES THE\r\n          LESSOR    OF   ANY    RESPONSIBILITY   OR\r\n          OBLIGATION  IN  THE  EVENT  OF  ACCIDENT,\r\n          REGARDLESS OF CAUSES OR CONSEQUENCES, AND\r\n          THAT   ANY   COSTS,   CLAIMS,  COURT   OR\r\n          ATTORNEY'S  FEES, OR  LIABILITY RESULTING\r\n          FROM  THE USE OF DESCRIBED EQUIPMENT WILL\r\n          BE INDEMNIFIED BY  THE LESSEE  REGARDLESS\r\n          AGAINST  WHOM  THE CLAIMANT  OR CLAIMANTS\r\n          INSTITUTE ACTION.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                      PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r                                  PROCEEDINGS BELOW\r                                                   \r\n\n          The  MacGlashings  brought   a  federal   diversity\r\n\njurisdiction suit,  see 28 U.S.C.    1332(a), against Dunlop,\r                                   \r\n\nseeking   recovery  on   theories   of  negligence,   product\r\n\nliability, and breach of warranty.   They charged Dunlop with\r\n\nnegligence  in  the  design  and  modification  of  the  work\r\n\nplatforms leased to RPM, negligence in failing to inspect the\r\n\nplatforms and  repair defects  and damage, and  negligence in\r\n\nfailing to  warn and instruct RPM employees in the use of the\r\n\nplatform.    They  also  asserted that  Dunlop  breached  the\r\n\nimplied warranty  that the work  platforms were  merchantable\r\n\nand fit  for  their intended  use.   The  MacGlashings  later\r\n\namended  their complaint  to assert  claims  against Longwood\r\n\nunder  Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 143,    51.   These  claims are not\r\n\nrelevant to this appeal.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Dunlop filed a  third-party complaint against  RPM,\r\n\nseeking  indemnification pursuant  to their  lease agreement.\r\n\nRPM   denied   any    indemnification   responsibility    and\r\n\ncounterclaimed,  alleging that Dunlop materially breached the\r\n\nlease  agreement  by  providing  defective  and  unreasonably\r\n\ndangerous equipment.  \r\n\n          Each of the parties  filed summary judgment motions\r\n\nbefore  the magistrate  judge.   Dunlop and  the MacGlashings\r\n\nmoved for summary judgment on Dunlop's third-party complaint.\r\n\nThey   maintained  that,  under  the  indemnification  clause\r\n\ncontained  in  the  lease  agreement, RPM  was  obligated  to\r\n\nindemnify Dunlop for any liability  resulting from the use of\r\n\nthe  leased  equipment and  that  Dunlop  did not  materially\r\n\nbreach its  obligations under that agreement.   RPM contested\r\n\nthis joint  motion  and  filed  its own  motion  for  summary\r\n\njudgment on Dunlop's third-party  claims.  In both instances,\r\n\nit  contested  the  enforceability  of  the  lease  agreement\r\n\nexecuted  with   Dunlop,  claiming  that   Dunlop  materially\r\n\nbreached   the  implied  warranties  of  merchantability  and\r\n\nfitness for  a particular purpose contained  in the agreement\r\n\nby  failing to  test the  load-bearing capacity  of the  work\r\n\nplatforms  and outriggers  prior to delivery  of them  to the\r\n\nproject site.\r\n\n          The case  was assigned to  a magistrate judge.   In\r\n\nher report  and recommendations,  she  first addressed  RPM's\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nsummary judgment  motion.  The magistrate  judge denied RPM's\r\n\nclaim  that  the  lease  agreement it  executed  with  Dunlop\r\n\nincluded  an implied  warranty  of fitness  for a  particular\r\n\npurpose, under Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 106,    2-315, but  agreed\r\n\nthat  it contained  an implied  warranty  of merchantability,\r\n\nunder Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 106,   2-314.  The  magistrate judge\r\n\nrecommended that RPM's motion  for summary judgment be denied\r\n\nbecause  she  found  that  genuine issues  of  material  fact\r\n\nexisted as to whether Dunlop breached its implied warranties.\r\n\n          Turning to the  joint motions for  summary judgment\r\n\nfiled by  Dunlop and  the MacGlashings, the  magistrate judge\r\n\nconcluded that the record, viewed in RPM's favor, precluded a\r\n\ndismissal with  prejudice, of RPM's counterclaim  for breach.\r\n\nShe recommended, however,  that Dunlop and the  MacGlashings'\r\n\njoint motion  for  summary judgment  on Dunlop's  third-party\r\n\ncomplaint  be  allowed.   The  magistrate  judge found  that,\r\n\nbarring a determination  that Dunlop materially  breached the\r\n\nlease agreement,  RPM was \"obligated to  indemnify Dunlop for\r\n\nany liability resulting from Charles MacGlashing's use of the\r\n\nleased  equipment.\"   She  concluded  that \"whether  Dunlop's\r\n\nconduct  amounted  to a  material  or serious  breach  of the\r\n\ncontract\"  was an issue  of fact for  the jury.   Each of the\r\n\nparties  filed timely  objections  to the  magistrate judge's\r\n\nreport.  \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          The district court  issued an  order accepting,  in\r\n\npart, and  modifying, in part, the  Report and Recommendation\r\n\nof  the magistrate judge.  The district court agreed with the\r\n\nmagistrate   judge's  determination  that  RPM's  motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment should be denied.  While it also agreed that\r\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Dunlop and the  MacGlashings was\r\n\nappropriate  on Dunlop's  third-party  complaint,  the  court\r\n\nrejected   the  magistrate  judge's   conclusion  that  RPM's\r\n\nobligation  to  indemnify  Dunlop  for  damages arising  from\r\n\nCharles  MacGlashing's  injuries  could  be  relieved  by   a\r\n\nmaterial  breach  by Dunlop.    The  court  held that,  under\r\n\nMassachusetts law,  a party's  breach of an  implied warranty\r\n\nwas   insufficient   to    invalidate   a   broadly    worded\r\n\nindemnification clause.  \r\n\n          The district  court scheduled  a jury trial  on the\r\n\nvarious claims  asserted by  the parties.   Before the  trial\r\n\ndate  arrived,  however,  the  MacGlashing's  entered  into a\r\n\nsettlement  agreement with Dunlop, subject to court approval.\r\n\nThe settlement contemplated satisfying the MacGlashings' suit\r\n\nfor damages against Dunlop with a $750,000.00 cash payment --\r\n\napproximately 75 percent of  the insurance coverage available\r\n\nto  Dunlop through  its  insurer  --  and the  assignment  of\r\n\nDunlop's claims against RPM and Longwood to the MacGlashings.\r\n\nUnder the  agreement,  judgment  was  to enter  in  favor  of\r\n\nCharles  MacGlashing in  the amount  of $4,560,000.00  and in\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nfavor  of  Sharlene   MacGlashing  for   $300,000.00.     The\r\n\nMacGlashings agreed  to seek no further  recovery from Dunlop\r\n\nin the event they could not recover from RPM or Longwood. \r\n\n          The  district  court held  a  hearing and  reviewed\r\n\nevidence  before approving  the settlement.   At  the hearing\r\n\nRPM's counsel stated, inter alia:\r                                            \r\n\n             I  don't  believe  that  RPM  has  any\r\n          objection   to   the  structure   of  the\r\n          settlement     under      the     current\r\n          circumstances .  . .  I believe that  the\r\n          settlement  is  fair and  equitable under\r\n          these circumstances.\r\n\n          The district  court approved  the settlement.   The\r\n\nclaims against Longwood were tried to a jury which returned a\r\n\nverdict  in favor of Longwood.   The district  court issued a\r\n\nfinal  judgment dismissing  the  action of  the  MacGlashings\r\n\nagainst  Longwood,  entering  judgment  against  Dunlop,  and\r\n\nordering  that Charles MacGlashing  recover $4,651,739.23 and\r\n\nhis wife,  $306,032.52 -- the  amount of the  settlement plus\r\n\npost-judgment interest  at the  rate  of 5.86%  -- from  RPM.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.        \r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review  the district  court's  grant of  summary\r\n\njudgment  de novo  and review  the record  in the  light most\r                             \r\n\nfavorable to  the nonmoving party, drawing  all inferences in\r\n\nthat  party's favor.

RPM avers  that  it is  not\r\n\nobligated,  under  Massachusetts  law,  to pay  the  judgment\r\n\nawarded the  MacGlashings because Dunlop  materially breached\r\n\nthe  lease  agreement,  relieving   RPM  of  the  promise  to\r\n\nindemnify  Dunlop  contained  in   the  agreement.    In  the\r\n\nalternative,  RPM  argues  that even  if  the indemnification\r\n\nclause  is valid, it should not be deemed responsible for the\r\n\nparticular claims  advanced by the MacGlashings  because they\r\n\nfall outside the contemplated scope of the agreement.   \r\n\n          Appellees contest  both  of these  arguments.

Gen. L. ch. 106,    2-314 (1990), and fitness for a\r               \r\n\nparticular purpose,  see  Mass.  Gen.

RPM asserts  that\r\n\nbecause, under Massachusetts law, the MacGlashings would  not\r\n\nhave  been entitled  to  any recovery  in  the absence  of  a\r\n\nfinding that the work  platform Dunlop provided was defective\r\n\nor unreasonably  dangerous, Dunlop, ipso facto,  breached the\r                                                          \r\n\nimplied  warranties  of  merchantability and  fitness  for  a\r\n\nparticular purpose.  \r\n\n          RPM,  in effect, attempts to  use the tort claim of\r\n\nthe MacGlashings against Dunlop as  a basis for its  argument\r\n\nthat Dunlop breached its implied warranty of merchantability.\r\n\nBut the contract between  RPM and Dunlop was for the lease of\r\n\nproperty.  RPM  cannot use  the indemnity clause  to turn  an\r\n\neconomic contract into one based on tort concepts.\r\n\n          Massachusetts   law    plainly   forecloses   RPM's\r\n\nargument.   It adopts the  majority view which  draws a clear\r\n\ndistinction  between tort  recovery  for physical  injury and\r\n\ncontract recovery for  economic loss.   See Jacobs v.

We  cannot,  as RPM  urges,  regard the  difference\r\n\nbetween  tort and  contract-based claims  as  \"irrelevant\" in\r\n\nthis  case.    RPM's  attempt  to  shift  the  obligation  to\r\n\ncompensate the MacGlashings back  to Dunlop fails because RPM\r\n\nalleges no direct damage  or injury to itself.   The argument\r\n\nthat  RPM  is  entitled  to   relief  from  the  contract  it\r\n\nnegotiated with Dunlop hinges entirely on the physical injury\r\n\nits   employee,  Charles  MacGlashing,  sustained.    Compare\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nGarweth,  415 Mass. at 307.  RPM  has not made the showing of\r                   \r\n\ninjury or damage to itself as Massachusetts law requires.\r\n\n          Moreover, appellant  has not convinced  us that the\r\n\nalleged  breach   of  the   lease   agreement  rendered   the\r\n\nindemnification  clause  invalid, as  if  it  had never  been\r\n\nexecuted.   The  one-page contract  executed between  RPM and\r\n\nDunlop  contains standard-form  language  and  clauses  which\r\n\nsuggest  that the  indemnity provision  is separate  from the\r\n\nunderlying  lease.  The face of the agreement sets out, inter\r                                                                         \r\n\nalia, the  type and cost  of the equipment  to be leased,  as\r                \r\n\nwell  as guidelines  for its installation  and transportation\r\n\naround the site, and expressly  incorporates a July 21, 1993,\r\n\nhandwritten note regarding delivery,  assembly, and pickup of\r\n\nthe work platforms by Paul Haven, RPM's president.   \r\n\n          The   reverse  side   of  the   agreement  contains\r\n\nseventeen numbered paragraphs  that outline lease  conditions\r\n\nand  are clearly separated by spacing.  Two of these reverse-\r\n\nside  clauses concern responsibility for damages flowing from\r\n\nthe use of equipment referred to in the lease agreement.  The\r\n\nfirst clause  provides that  RPM assumes  full responsibility\r\n\nunder  the agreement  for  damages,  injuries, and  accidents\r\n\ncaused by the use of Dunlop equipment and reads: \r\n\n          3.   Lessee     assumes      the     full\r\n          responsibility for  damages, injuries and\r\n          accidents  resulting  to any  property or\r\n          persons,  caused  by  the  use   of  said\r\n          equipment  while in the possession of the\r\n          lessee, from the  time of arrival at  the\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          above  named location, during the term of\r\n          lease, and until equipment is returned to\r\n          lessor.\r\n\nThe second  clause deals with  indemnification and is  one of\r\n\nsix written in boldfaced type. It provides that RPM  absolves\r\n\nDunlop of  any responsibility or  obligation in the  event of\r\n\naccidents  resulting from  the use  of the  leased equipment,\r\n\nregardless of cause or consequence and reads:\r\n\n          12.  THE   LESSEE  HEREBY   ABSOLVES  THE\r\n          LESSOR    OF   ANY    RESPONSIBILITY   OR\r\n          OBLIGATION  IN  THE  EVENT  OF  ACCIDENT,\r\n          REGARDLESS OF CAUSES OR CONSEQUENCES, AND\r\n          THAT   ANY   COSTS,   CLAIMS,  COURT   OR\r\n          ATTORNEY'S  FEES, OR  LIABILITY RESULTING\r\n          FROM THE USE OF DESCRIBED  EQUIPMENT WILL\r\n          BE INDEMNIFIED BY  THE LESSEE  REGARDLESS\r\n          AGAINST  WHOM  THE CLAIMANT  OR CLAIMANTS\r\n          INSTITUTE ACTION.\r\n\nThe standard form equipment sign-off sheets Paul Haven signed\r\n\non the 20th, 22nd, 23rd,  and 27th of July 1993, when  Dunlop\r\n\ndelivered  the  work  platforms  to the  work  site,  contain\r\n\nsimilar  language.    They  provide  that  RPM  agrees  that:\r\n\n\"Dunlop,  Inc.  is not  responsible  for any  damages  to the\r\n\nbuilding, or any injuries or accidents resulting to people or\r\n\nproperty caused from the use or misuse of this equipment.\"\r\n\n          Based on our  reading of the lease and the sign-off\r\n\nsheets, we do not think RPM and Dunlop intended the covenants\r\n\ncontained  in  the  lease agreement  and  the indemnification\r\n\nclause to be  dependent.

That the\r\n\nclause  also fails to mention  claims brought on  a theory of\r\n\nnegligence   undermines   the   force   of   RPM's   argument\r\n\nsignificantly  because  there  is   little  support  for  the\r\n\ncontention  that  the omission  of  a  specific reference  to\r\n\nnegligence  invalidates an  indemnity clause.

The\r\n\nlanguage contained  in the indemnity clause  read in relevant\r\n\npart:  \"You  hereby  agree  to indemnify  and  save  Polaroid\r\n\nharmless from  all liability  and loss arising  from services\r\n\nperformed by  you or your employees hereunder . . . .\"  After\r\n\nconcluding  that the  private indemnity  agreements  were not\r\n\nprohibited  by CERCLA, 42 U.S.C.   9607(e)(1), the court held\r\n\nthat the  clause was broad  enough to cover  strict liability\r\n\nfor hazardous waste damage imposed under CERCLA.  In reaching\r\n\nthis  conclusion, the  court found  that strict  liability in\r\n\ntort for  ultrahazardous activities existed  in Massachusetts\r\n\nat the  time the  parties entered  into their agreements  and\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nthat  there was no outward  manifestation on the  part of the\r\n\nindemnitor to  limit its  obligations under the  agreement to\r\n\nnegligence. \r\n\n          Moreover,  paragraph 14  of the lease  convinces us\r\n\nthat the  parties intended  the indemnity agreement  to cover\r\n\nall  liability  whether  grounded  in  negligence  or  strict\r\n\nliability.   Paragraph  14 provides,  in relevant  part, \"Our\r\n\ninsurance [Dunlop's]  does not  cover the equipment  while in\r\n\nyour possession [RPM's].\"  It can be reasonably inferred from\r\n\nthis that the  parties intended RPM  to procure insurance  to\r\n\ncover  the burden it assumed under the indemnity clause.

That RPM  carried  $5 million  in liability  insurance,\r\n\nwhereas  Dunlop   carried  only  $1  million   supports  this\r\n\ncontention.   See  Midland  Insurance, 530  F.

RPM gave\r\n\nno indication  that it  intended to indemnify  for negligence\r\n\nliability  only.    See  Polaroid,  416 Mass.  at  694  (\"[A]\r                                             \r\n\ncontracting party's objective intention  dictates and a party\r\n\nis bound by its outward manifestations to the other party.\").\r\n\nRPM cannot escape its obligations under the indemnity clause.\r\n\n          RPM's contention  that the indemnity  clause is not\r\n\nconspicuous   and  cannot   shift  liability   for  defective\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nequipment does not deserve  extended comment.

(\"RPM\") and defendant-appellee Dunlop Equipment Company, Inc.  (\"Dunlop\").  Plaintiff-appellee Charles MacGlashing was injured when an elevated work platform leased by Dunlop to RPM collapsed while he and another employee of RPM were using it in their masonry work.   MacGlashing and his wife, residents of New Hampshire, brought a diversity action in tort against Dunlop, a Massachusetts corporation, in the district court of Massachusetts.   Dunlop sued RPM, invoking the lease indemnification clause.   Prior to trial the MacGlashings, with court approval, entered into a settlement agreement with Dunlop.   The issue on appeal is whether the MacGlashings, standing in the shoes of Dunlop, can collect the amount of the settlement from RPM under the indemnification clause of the lease between RPM and Dunlop.   This issue was decided in favor of the MacGlashings and Dunlop by summary judgment.   There is no question that Massachusetts law applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RPM maintains that it has no obligation under the lease agreement to indemnify Dunlop for damages flowing from Charles MacGlashing's accident because Dunlop materially breached the agreement.   It also challenges the scope of the indemnification clause.   Discerning no error in the district court's summary judgment analysis, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in the light most favorable to RPM, the nonmoving party, the facts are as follows.   RPM, a Massachusetts-based corporation, employed Charles MacGlashing as a brick mason until September 2, 1993, when he was involved in a work-related accident at The Longwood Towers located in Brookline, Massachusetts.   In 1993, the Longwood Corporation (\"Longwood\"), owner of The Longwood Towers complex, commissioned RPM to conduct phase II of a renovation project at Longwood Towers.   Like phase I, which had been completed a year earlier by NER, Inc.  (\"NER\"), phase II involved removal and replacement of brick and stone at the top of three eight-story buildings located in the complex.   RPM was formed by former employees of NER.  Several of them, including RPM's president Paul Haven, had worked on phase I. During both phase I and II, mobile, elevated work platforms fitted with eight-foot outrigger devices, which extended off the main platform to expand its width, were utilized for stone and brick removal and to make certain setback portions of the buildings accessible.   The outriggers were modifications to the original platform design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 1993, MacGlashing and a co-worker, James Proctor, were removing a piece of stone from the parapets of Building B when the work platform they were using collapsed.   Both men fell eight stories to the ground.   Proctor died from the injuries he sustained.   MacGlashing, who was thirty-nine at the time, survived, but suffered injuries that hospitalized him for six months and left him partially paralyzed and in constant pain.   These injuries included, inter alia, broken bones, internal and neurological damage, a ruptured aorta and bladder, a perforated colon, lung damage, and lacerations.   MacGlashing incurred more than $800,000.00 in medical fees and expenses as a result of the accident.   His future medical costs and net economic loss have been projected between $600,000.00 to $1.1 million and $1.1 million to $1.3 million, respectively.   At trial, the parties agreed that the platform involved in the accident collapsed because it could not bear the weight placed on it, but disagreed about whether the platform had been defectively designed, used negligently, or negligently modified by Dunlop.   Dunlop, whose business consists of supplying work platforms for sale or lease, provided the platforms employed in both phase I and II of the Longwood Towers renovation project.   It executed a July 7, 1993, lease agreement to provide four platforms with RPM's president, Paul Haven, who had left NER to form RPM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lease agreement executed between RPM and Dunlop was a standard form contract and contained the following indemnification clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12.  THE LESSEE HEREBY ABSOLVES THE LESSOR OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR OBLIGATION IN THE EVENT OF ACCIDENT, REGARDLESS OF CAUSES OR CONSEQUENCES, AND THAT ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, COURT OR ATTORNEY'S FEES, OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF DESCRIBED EQUIPMENT WILL BE INDEMNIFIED BY THE LESSEE REGARDLESS AGAINST WHOM THE CLAIMANT OR CLAIMANTS INSTITUTE ACTION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MacGlashings brought a federal diversity jurisdiction suit, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), against Dunlop, seeking recovery on theories of negligence, product liability, and breach of warranty.   They charged Dunlop with negligence in the design and modification of the work platforms leased to RPM, negligence in failing to inspect the platforms and repair defects and damage, and negligence in failing to warn and instruct RPM employees in the use of the platform.   They also asserted that Dunlop breached the implied warranty that the work platforms were merchantable and fit for their intended use.   The MacGlashings later amended their complaint to assert claims against Longwood under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 143, &#167; 51.   These claims are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dunlop filed a third-party complaint against RPM, seeking indemnification pursuant to their lease agreement.   RPM denied any indemnification responsibility and counterclaimed, alleging that Dunlop materially breached the lease agreement by providing defective and unreasonably dangerous equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the parties filed summary judgment motions before the magistrate judge.   Dunlop and the MacGlashings moved for summary judgment on Dunlop's third-party complaint.   They maintained that, under the indemnification clause contained in the lease agreement, RPM was obligated to indemnify Dunlop for any liability resulting from the use of the leased equipment and that Dunlop did not materially breach its obligations under that agreement.   RPM contested this joint motion and filed its own motion for summary judgment on Dunlop's third-party claims.   In both instances, it contested the enforceability of the lease agreement executed with Dunlop, claiming that Dunlop materially breached the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose contained in the agreement by failing to test the load-bearing capacity of the work platforms and outriggers prior to delivery of them to the project site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was assigned to a magistrate judge.   In her report and recommendations, she first addressed RPM's summary judgment motion.   The magistrate judge denied RPM's claim that the lease agreement it executed with Dunlop included an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-315, but agreed that it contained an implied warranty of merchantability, under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-314.   The magistrate judge recommended that RPM's motion for summary judgment be denied because she found that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether Dunlop breached its implied warranties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the joint motions for summary judgment filed by Dunlop and the MacGlashings, the magistrate judge concluded that the record, viewed in RPM's favor, precluded a dismissal with prejudice, of RPM's counterclaim for breach.   She recommended, however, that Dunlop and the MacGlashings' joint motion for summary judgment on Dunlop's third-party complaint be allowed.   The magistrate judge found that, barring a determination that Dunlop materially breached the lease agreement, RPM was \"obligated to indemnify Dunlop for any liability resulting from Charles MacGlashing's use of the leased equipment.\"   She concluded that \"whether Dunlop's conduct amounted to a material or serious breach of the contract\" was an issue of fact for the jury.   Each of the parties filed timely objections to the magistrate judge's report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued an order accepting, in part, and modifying, in part, the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge.   The district court agreed with the magistrate judge's determination that RPM's motion for summary judgment should be denied. While it also agreed that summary judgment in favor of Dunlop and the MacGlashings was appropriate on Dunlop's third-party complaint, the court rejected the magistrate judge's conclusion that RPM's obligation to indemnify Dunlop for damages arising from Charles MacGlashing's injuries could be relieved by a material breach by Dunlop.   The court held that, under Massachusetts law, a party's breach of an implied warranty was insufficient to invalidate a broadly worded indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court scheduled a jury trial on the various claims asserted by the parties.   Before the trial date arrived, however, the MacGlashing's entered into a settlement agreement with Dunlop, subject to court approval.   The settlement contemplated satisfying the MacGlashings' suit for damages against Dunlop with a $750,000.00 cash payment--approximately 75 percent of the insurance coverage available to Dunlop through its insurer--and the assignment of Dunlop's claims against RPM and Longwood to the MacGlashings.   Under the agreement, judgment was to enter in favor of Charles MacGlashing in the amount of $4,560,000.00 and in favor of Sharlene MacGlashing for $300,000.00.   The MacGlashings agreed to seek no further recovery from Dunlop in the event they could not recover from RPM or Longwood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing and reviewed evidence before approving the settlement.   At the hearing RPM's counsel stated, inter alia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't believe that RPM has any objection to the structure of the settlement under the current circumstances ... I believe that the settlement is fair and equitable under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court approved the settlement.   The claims against Longwood were tried to a jury which returned a verdict in favor of Longwood.   The district court issued a final judgment dismissing the action of the MacGlashings against Longwood, entering judgment against Dunlop, and ordering that Charles MacGlashing recover $4,651,739.23 and his wife, $306,032.52--the amount of the settlement plus post-judgment interest at the rate of 5.86%--from RPM. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, drawing all inferences in that party's favor.  Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 75 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.1996);  EEOC v. Green, 76 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1996).  \"Our review is limited to the record as it stood before the district court at the time of its ruling.\"  J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1250 (1st Cir.1996).   Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allegations of a factual dispute \"will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;  the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.\"  Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1995)(quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).   Material facts are those that have the potential to affect the outcome of a suit.  J. Geils Band, 76 F.3d at 1250-51.   Disputes as to the existence of material facts are genuine if \" 'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.' \"  Morrissey, 54 F.3d at 30 (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510).   We must affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment \"[i]f the evidence [presented by RPM] is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative.\"  Id. We apply Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is whether the indemnification clause contained in the lease agreement RPM executed with Dunlop is enforceable and, if so, whether its scope includes liability for damages stemming from the injuries MacGlashing sustained as a result of the accident.   RPM avers that it is not obligated, under Massachusetts law, to pay the judgment awarded the MacGlashings because Dunlop materially breached the lease agreement, relieving RPM of the promise to indemnify Dunlop contained in the agreement.   In the alternative, RPM argues that even if the indemnification clause is valid, it should not be deemed responsible for the particular claims advanced by the MacGlashings because they fall outside the contemplated scope of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees contest both of these arguments.   We begin by addressing the enforceability of the lease agreement and then turn to a discussion of its scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Enforceability of the Lease Agreement's Indemnification Clause</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RPM challenges the enforceability of the indemnification clause by attacking the validity of the lease agreement it executed with Dunlop.   See Kelly v. Dimeo, Inc., 31 Mass.App.Ct. 626, 628, 581 N.E.2d 1316 (1991)(\"Under Massachusetts law, a contract-based right to indemnification exists only if there is a binding contract between indemnitor and indemnitee in which such right is expressed or from which it can be fairly implied.\"), review denied, 412 Mass. 1102, 588 N.E.2d 691 (1992).   RPM, using the Uniform Commercial Code as its launching pad, argues that the indemnification clause is unenforceable because Dunlop materially breached implied warranties of merchantability, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-314 (1990), and fitness for a particular purpose, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-315 (1990), by providing RPM with work platforms that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.   RPM asserts that because, under Massachusetts law, the MacGlashings would not have been entitled to any recovery in the absence of a finding that the work platform Dunlop provided was defective or unreasonably dangerous, Dunlop, ipso facto, breached the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RPM, in effect, attempts to use the tort claim of the MacGlashings against Dunlop as a basis for its argument that Dunlop breached its implied warranty of merchantability.   But the contract between RPM and Dunlop was for the lease of property.   RPM cannot use the indemnity clause to turn an economic contract into one based on tort concepts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law plainly forecloses RPM's argument.   It adopts the majority view which draws a clear distinction between tort recovery for physical injury and contract recovery for economic loss.   See Jacobs v. Yamaha Motor Corp., 420 Mass. 323, 329 n. 5, 649 N.E.2d 758 (1995);  Bay State-Spray &amp; Provincetown S.S., Inc. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 404 Mass. 103, 107, 533 N.E.2d 1350 (1989);  Colter v. Barber-Greene Co., 403 Mass. 50, 525 N.E.2d 1305 (1988);  Correia v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 388 Mass. 342, 356, 446 N.E.2d 1033 (1983);   Marcil v. John Deere Indus. Equip.  Co., 9 Mass.App.Ct. 625, 630, 403 N.E.2d 430 (1980);  see also Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Co., 973 F.2d 988, 996 (1st Cir.1992);  Reibold v. Simon Aerials, 859 F.Supp. 193, 198 (E.D.Va.1994).   The rule that the absence of a showing of personal injury, or of physical damage to property belonging to the contracting party forecloses recovery for economic losses stemming from tort-based strict liability or negligence is well established in Massachusetts.  Garweth Corp. v. Boston Edison Co., 415 Mass. 303, 305, 613 N.E.2d 92 (1993).   Attempts to circumvent this rule by \"[c]ouching the allegations in terms of breach of contract\" have been rejected routinely.   See, e.g., FMR Corp. v. Boston Edison Co., 415 Mass. 393, 394, 613 N.E.2d 902 (1993).   We cannot, as RPM urges, regard the difference between tort and contract-based claims as \"irrelevant\" in this case.   RPM's attempt to shift the obligation to compensate the MacGlashings back to Dunlop fails because RPM alleges no direct damage or injury to itself.   The argument that RPM is entitled to relief from the contract it negotiated with Dunlop hinges entirely on the physical injury its employee, Charles MacGlashing, sustained.   Compare Garweth, 415 Mass. at 307, 613 N.E.2d 92.   RPM has not made the showing of injury or damage to itself as Massachusetts law requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, appellant has not convinced us that the alleged breach of the lease agreement rendered the indemnification clause invalid, as if it had never been executed.   The one-page contract executed between RPM and Dunlop contains standard-form language and clauses which suggest that the indemnity provision is separate from the underlying lease.   The face of the agreement sets out, inter alia, the type and cost of the equipment to be leased, as well as guidelines for its installation and transportation around the site, and expressly incorporates a July 21, 1993, handwritten note regarding delivery, assembly, and pickup of the work platforms by Paul Haven, RPM's president.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reverse side of the agreement contains seventeen numbered paragraphs that outline lease conditions and are clearly separated by spacing.   Two of these reverse-side clauses concern responsibility for damages flowing from the use of equipment referred to in the lease agreement.   The first clause provides that RPM assumes full responsibility under the agreement for damages, injuries, and accidents caused by the use of Dunlop equipment and reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>3.  Lessee assumes the full responsibility for damages, injuries and accidents resulting to any property or persons, caused by the use of said equipment while in the possession of the lessee, from the time of arrival at the above named location, during the term of lease, and until equipment is returned to lessor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second clause deals with indemnification and is one of six written in boldfaced type.   It provides that RPM absolves Dunlop of any responsibility or obligation in the event of accidents resulting from the use of the leased equipment, regardless of cause or consequence and reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>12.  THE LESSEE HEREBY ABSOLVES THE LESSOR OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR OBLIGATION IN THE EVENT OF ACCIDENT, REGARDLESS OF CAUSES OR CONSEQUENCES, AND THAT ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, COURT OR ATTORNEY'S FEES, OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF DESCRIBED EQUIPMENT WILL BE INDEMNIFIED BY THE LESSEE REGARDLESS AGAINST WHOM THE CLAIMANT OR CLAIMANTS INSTITUTE ACTION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard form equipment sign-off sheets Paul Haven signed on the 20th, 22nd, 23rd, and 27th of July 1993, when Dunlop delivered the work platforms to the work site, contain similar language.   They provide that RPM agrees that:  \"Dunlop, Inc. is not responsible for any damages to the building, or any injuries or accidents resulting to people or property caused from the use or misuse of this equipment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our reading of the lease and the sign-off sheets, we do not think RPM and Dunlop intended the covenants contained in the lease agreement and the indemnification clause to be dependent.   See Connolly v. Haines-Ce Brook, Inc., 277 Mass. 423, 427, 178 N.E. 650 (1931)(\"[W]hether covenants are conditional is determined ... by the true intention of the parties as expressed by the language of the contract.\");   see also 41 Am.Jur.2d &#167; 17, at 358 (1995) (\"Where the language of the indemnity contract is neither technical nor ambiguous, the words are given their legal, natural, and ordinary meaning.\").   Because the right of action on the leased platforms accrues as soon as there is a breach of its terms,--i.e., failure to deliver the equipment in a timely fashion--the right of action under the indemnity agreement does not accrue until Dunlop makes payment to a third party or suffers the loss addressed by the agreement.   See 41 Am.Jur.2d &#167; 4, at 349 (1995);  42 C.J.S. &#167; 2, at 72-73 (1991);  see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 379, comment a. We agree with the district court that the better and more logical approach is to treat the indemnification clause as an independent provision of the lease.   See Chatlos Sys., Inc. v. Nat'l Cash Register Corp., 635 F.2d 1081, 1085 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is solid precedent for our decision to treat the indemnification clause as a separate agreement unaffected by any breach of the lease contract.   See, e.g., Hill Constr.  Corp. v. American Airlines, Inc., 996 F.2d 1315 (1st Cir.1993)(carrier cargo liability limitations survive breach of the agreement to carry cargo);  County of Middlesex v. Gevyn Constr.  Corp., 450 F.2d 53 (1st Cir.1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955, 92 S.Ct. 1176, 31 L.Ed.2d 232 (1972) (arbitration agreement valid despite construction contract breach).   The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts addressed the question of whether breach of a contract undermines a consensual allocation of risk in Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 406 Mass. 369, 548 N.E.2d 182 (1990).   That case involved electric utility companies which sought remedies for breach, under the UCC, for losses they allegedly incurred as the result of the failure of electric generator components supplied by Westinghouse Electric Corporation.   They sought to be relieved of the limits on indirect, special, incidental, and consequential damages imposed by the selling policies to which they agreed.  Id. at 371, 548 N.E.2d 182.   The Supreme Judicial Court held that the liability limitations were enforceable even though Westinghouse's efforts to cure the problems created by its generator components were unsuccessful.  Id. at 374-75, 548 N.E.2d 182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding persuades us that the course we adopt in this case would be followed by the Massachusetts courts.   Under Massachusetts law, the allocation of risk through contractual agreements neither conflicts with public policy, Canal Elec., 406 Mass. at 372, 548 N.E.2d 182;  Minassian v. Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., 400 Mass. 490, 493, 509 N.E.2d 1190 (1987), nor the Massachusetts workers' compensation statute prohibition against an employee receiving direct compensation for work-related injuries from its employer.   See Decker v. Black and Decker Mfg. Co., 389 Mass. 35, 38, 449 N.E.2d 641 (1983);   Whittle v. Pagani Bros. Constr.  Co., 383 Mass. 796, 800, 422 N.E.2d 779 (1981);  see also Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 152, &#167; 23 (1988);  Clarke v. Kentucky Fried Chicken of California, Inc., 57 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1995)(describing provisions of workers' compensation statute).   This is especially true where, as in this case, the parties to the agreement allocating risk are \"sophisticated business entities.\"  Canal Elec., 406 Mass. at 374, 548 N.E.2d 182;  Deerskin Trading Post, Inc. v. Spencer Press, Inc., 398 Mass. 118, 123, 495 N.E.2d 303 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Risk allocation agreements are common in the construction industry and are widely-regarded as a \"reasonable accommodation\" between parties to a commercial agreement.   See Canal Elec., 406 Mass. at 374, 548 N.E.2d 182;  Jones v. Vappi Co., 28 Mass.App.Ct. 77, 546 N.E.2d 379 (1989);  see also Debra A. Perelman, Risk Allocation Through Indemnity Obligations In Constr.   Contracts, 40 S.C. Law.  Rev. 989, 989-90 (1989).   They have the advantage of allowing owners, contractors, and subcontractors to shift the significant and, oftentimes, unforeseeable risks inherent in construction work.   Cf. Hill Constr., 996 F.2d at 1317;  Perelman, Risk Allocation, 40 S.C. Law.  Rev. at 989-90.   They also permit the equipment needed to complete construction jobs to be obtained at lower rates because the lessors of such equipment can exclude the cost of insuring against accident-related damages from the equipment price.   Cf. Hill Constr., 996 F.2d at 1317.   In Shea v. Bay State Gas Co., 383 Mass. 218, 224, 418 N.E.2d 597 (1981), the Supreme Judicial Court candidly recognized that \"realistically viewed, the shift of liability is a shift in the burden of providing adequate insurance coverage.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record suggests that Dunlop acted in bad faith, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 1-203 (1990), Hill Constr., 996 F.2d at 1317, or unfairly seeks to bind RPM to an indemnity clause which was hidden or buried deep in the contract.   Compare Mobil Chemical Co. v. Blount Bros. Corp., 809 F.2d 1175, 1182 (5th Cir.1987).   Paragraph 12 shifts liability to RPM in clear and unmistakable language.   Additionally, the record makes it clear that RPM's president, Paul Haven, a man with more than twenty years of experience in the construction industry, knew or should have known about the risk allocation provisions contained in the agreement.   He negotiated the lease agreement and represented, in signing it on RPM's behalf, that he had \"read and agree[d] to all terms stated on both sides of th[e] form.\"   By Haven's own acknowledgement indemnity clauses of the sort contained in the Dunlop lease agreement are standard in the construction industry. Cf. Perelman, Risk Allocation, 40 S.C. Law.  Rev. at 989-90 (Indemnity provisions in construction contracts should be interpreted by \"recognizing the intent of the parties entering into the agreement.\").   We, therefore, conclude that the indemnity clause contained in the lease agreement RPM executed with Dunlop is enforceable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Scope of the Indemnification Clause Under Massachusetts Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to attacking the enforceability of the indemnity clause, RPM attacks its scope.   It argues that, under Massachusetts law, the term \"use\" contained in paragraph 12 of the agreement cannot be read to include liability for claims brought on a theory of strict liability instead of negligence.   See Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., 8 F.3d 88, 88 n. 1 (1st Cir.1993) (\"Under Massachusetts law, the theory of breach of an implied warranty of merchantability is basically the same as strict liability theory in tort.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2133, 128 L.Ed.2d 863 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule that indemnity contracts are to be strictly construed against the indemnitee no longer obtains in Massachusetts.   See Whittle, 383 Mass. at 797, 422 N.E.2d 779.   The modern rule is that \" '[c]ontracts of indemnity are to be fairly and reasonably construed in order to ascertain the intention of the parties and to effectuate the purpose sought to be accomplished.' \"  Shea, 383 Mass. at 222, 418 N.E.2d 597 (quoting New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co. v. Walworth Co., 340 Mass. 1, 3, 162 N.E.2d 789 (1959)).   Courts are expected to give effect to the parties' intentions at the time of the agreement and to give them reasonable meaning.  Id.;  see also Cohen v. Steve's Franchise Co., Inc., 927 F.2d 26, 28 (1st Cir.1991);  Polaroid Corp. v. Rollins Environmental Services (NJ), Inc., 416 Mass. 684, 694, 624 N.E.2d 959 (1993);  Speers v. H.P. Hood, Inc., 22 Mass.App.Ct. 598, 495 N.E.2d 880 (1986), review denied, 398 Mass. 1105, 498 N.E.2d 125 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not impressed by RPM's argument that the indemnity clause's failure to specifically refer to strict liability claims omits such claims from its scope.   That the clause also fails to mention claims brought on a theory of negligence undermines the force of RPM's argument significantly because there is little support for the contention that the omission of a specific reference to negligence invalidates an indemnity clause.   Massachusetts cases such as Shea, 383 Mass. at 219-20, 418 N.E.2d 597, \"teac[h] that ... an indemnity provision may be read to cover situations of [an] indemnitee's negligence although there is no explicit statement to that effect.\"  Speers, 22 Mass.App.Ct. 598, 601, 495 N.E.2d 880.   Where the language is broad and the parties' intent relatively clear, responsibility for a risk not expressly mentioned in the indemnity clause may be properly placed with the indemnitor.   Cf. Shea, 383 Mass. at 224-25, 418 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have little doubt that the language contained in the indemnity clause is broad enough to encompass claims brought on a theory of either negligence or strict liability.   First, we do not agree with RPM that private agreements allocating the risk of strict liability for tort damages in the circumstances presented here thwart public policy.   Such agreements are reasonable accommodations in the construction industry context.   Second, the language contained in paragraph 12 of the lease agreement is broad and expansive.   It absolves Dunlop for \"any responsibility or obligation\" in the event of an accident, \"regardless of cause or consequences,\" stemming from the use of its equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar language has been found sufficient to encompass indemnification obligations on claims brought on a theory of strict liability.   See Beloit Power Sys., Inc. v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., 757 F.2d 1427, 1428 (3d Cir.1985) (\"agrees to indemnify and hold harmless seller from all claims by third parties which extend beyond the foregoing limitations on seller's liability\");  Midland Ins. Co. v. Delta Lines, Inc., 530 F.Supp. 190 (1982)(\"all loss lessor ... may sustain or suffer because of ... the use of the equipment.\");  Mid-America Sprayers, Inc. v. U.S. Fire Ins.

Steve's Franchise Co., Inc., 927 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir.1991), we interpreted a franchise agreement executed under Massachusetts law and held that the language contained in an indemnity clause was broad enough to cover both negligent and nonnegligent business decisions.   The clause required the franchisor to indemnify Steve's Ice Cream, Inc. \"for any liability arising 'by reason of an act or omission with respect to the business or operation of the STEVE'S ICE CREAM STORE....' \"  Id. at 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  Polaroid Corp. v. Rollins Envtl.  Serv. (NJ), Inc., 416 Mass. 684, 624 N.E.2d 959 (1993), the Supreme Judicial Court held that an indemnity clause encompassed claims for strict liability, even though it did not explicitly provide for it.  Polaroid involved an indemnity clause for liability and loss \"for release or a substantial threat of release of hazardous substances.\"  Id. at 686, 624 N.E.2d 959.   The plaintiffs in the case sought a determination that the hazardous waste transporter with whom they executed the contracts containing the indemnification clauses, Rollins Environmental Services (NJ), Inc., was obligated to indemnify them against claims arising from a spill at a hazardous waste storage facility.   The language contained in the indemnity clause read in relevant part:  \"You hereby agree to indemnify and save Polaroid harmless from all liability and loss arising from services performed by you or your employees hereunder....\"  After concluding that the private indemnity agreements were not prohibited by CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 9607(e)(1), the court held that the clause was broad enough to cover strict liability for hazardous waste damage imposed under CERCLA.   In reaching this conclusion, the court found that strict liability in tort for ultrahazardous activities existed in Massachusetts at the time the parties entered into their agreements and that there was no outward manifestation on the part of the indemnitor to limit its obligations under the agreement to negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, paragraph 14 of the lease convinces us that the parties intended the indemnity agreement to cover all liability whether grounded in negligence or strict liability.   Paragraph 14 provides, in relevant part, \"Our insurance [Dunlop's] does not cover the equipment while in your possession [RPM's].\" It can be reasonably inferred from this that the parties intended RPM to procure insurance to cover the burden it assumed under the indemnity clause.   Cf. Speers, 22 Mass.App.Ct. at 601, 495 N.E.2d 880;  see also Cohen, 927 F.2d at 29.   That RPM carried $5 million in liability insurance, whereas Dunlop carried only $1 million supports this contention.   See Midland Insurance, 530 F.Supp. at 194 (broad language of agreement and existence of increased insurance is evidence of obligation to indemnify).   RPM gave no indication that it intended to indemnify for negligence liability only.   See Polaroid, 416 Mass. at 694, 624 N.E.2d 959 (\"[A] contracting party's objective intention dictates and a party is bound by its outward manifestations to the other party.\").   RPM cannot escape its obligations under the indemnity clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RPM's contention that the indemnity clause is not conspicuous and cannot shift liability for defective equipment does not deserve extended comment.   The clause is printed in capital letters.   Its language is neither ambiguous nor confusing.   The president of RPM testified that he read it and understood it.   At oral argument counsel for RPM agreed that the lease was not a contract of adhesion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We end our analysis by noting that at the hearing on the proposed settlement between the MacGlashings and Dunlop, counsel for RPM expressly approved the structure of the settlement and stated that it was fair and equitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgments of the district court are affirmed.

(\"RPM\") and defendant-appellee Dunlop Equipment Company, Inc.  (\"Dunlop\").  Plaintiff-appellee Charles MacGlashing was injured when an elevated work platform leased by Dunlop to RPM collapsed while he and another employee of RPM were using it in their masonry work.   MacGlashing and his wife, residents of New Hampshire, brought a diversity action in tort against Dunlop, a Massachusetts corporation, in the district court of Massachusetts.   Dunlop sued RPM, invoking the lease indemnification clause.   Prior to trial the MacGlashings, with court approval, entered into a settlement agreement with Dunlop.   The issue on appeal is whether the MacGlashings, standing in the shoes of Dunlop, can collect the amount of the settlement from RPM under the indemnification clause of the lease between RPM and Dunlop.   This issue was decided in favor of the MacGlashings and Dunlop by summary judgment.   There is no question that Massachusetts law applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RPM maintains that it has no obligation under the lease agreement to indemnify Dunlop for damages flowing from Charles MacGlashing's accident because Dunlop materially breached the agreement.   It also challenges the scope of the indemnification clause.   Discerning no error in the district court's summary judgment analysis, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in the light most favorable to RPM, the nonmoving party, the facts are as follows.   RPM, a Massachusetts-based corporation, employed Charles MacGlashing as a brick mason until September 2, 1993, when he was involved in a work-related accident at The Longwood Towers located in Brookline, Massachusetts.   In 1993, the Longwood Corporation (\"Longwood\"), owner of The Longwood Towers complex, commissioned RPM to conduct phase II of a renovation project at Longwood Towers.   Like phase I, which had been completed a year earlier by NER, Inc.  (\"NER\"), phase II involved removal and replacement of brick and stone at the top of three eight-story buildings located in the complex.   RPM was formed by former employees of NER.  Several of them, including RPM's president Paul Haven, had worked on phase I. During both phase I and II, mobile, elevated work platforms fitted with eight-foot outrigger devices, which extended off the main platform to expand its width, were utilized for stone and brick removal and to make certain setback portions of the buildings accessible.   The outriggers were modifications to the original platform design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 1993, MacGlashing and a co-worker, James Proctor, were removing a piece of stone from the parapets of Building B when the work platform they were using collapsed.   Both men fell eight stories to the ground.   Proctor died from the injuries he sustained.   MacGlashing, who was thirty-nine at the time, survived, but suffered injuries that hospitalized him for six months and left him partially paralyzed and in constant pain.   These injuries included, inter alia, broken bones, internal and neurological damage, a ruptured aorta and bladder, a perforated colon, lung damage, and lacerations.   MacGlashing incurred more than $800,000.00 in medical fees and expenses as a result of the accident.   His future medical costs and net economic loss have been projected between $600,000.00 to $1.1 million and $1.1 million to $1.3 million, respectively.   At trial, the parties agreed that the platform involved in the accident collapsed because it could not bear the weight placed on it, but disagreed about whether the platform had been defectively designed, used negligently, or negligently modified by Dunlop.   Dunlop, whose business consists of supplying work platforms for sale or lease, provided the platforms employed in both phase I and II of the Longwood Towers renovation project.   It executed a July 7, 1993, lease agreement to provide four platforms with RPM's president, Paul Haven, who had left NER to form RPM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lease agreement executed between RPM and Dunlop was a standard form contract and contained the following indemnification clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12.  THE LESSEE HEREBY ABSOLVES THE LESSOR OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR OBLIGATION IN THE EVENT OF ACCIDENT, REGARDLESS OF CAUSES OR CONSEQUENCES, AND THAT ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, COURT OR ATTORNEY'S FEES, OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF DESCRIBED EQUIPMENT WILL BE INDEMNIFIED BY THE LESSEE REGARDLESS AGAINST WHOM THE CLAIMANT OR CLAIMANTS INSTITUTE ACTION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MacGlashings brought a federal diversity jurisdiction suit, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), against Dunlop, seeking recovery on theories of negligence, product liability, and breach of warranty.   They charged Dunlop with negligence in the design and modification of the work platforms leased to RPM, negligence in failing to inspect the platforms and repair defects and damage, and negligence in failing to warn and instruct RPM employees in the use of the platform.   They also asserted that Dunlop breached the implied warranty that the work platforms were merchantable and fit for their intended use.   The MacGlashings later amended their complaint to assert claims against Longwood under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 143, &#167; 51.   These claims are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dunlop filed a third-party complaint against RPM, seeking indemnification pursuant to their lease agreement.   RPM denied any indemnification responsibility and counterclaimed, alleging that Dunlop materially breached the lease agreement by providing defective and unreasonably dangerous equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the parties filed summary judgment motions before the magistrate judge.   Dunlop and the MacGlashings moved for summary judgment on Dunlop's third-party complaint.   They maintained that, under the indemnification clause contained in the lease agreement, RPM was obligated to indemnify Dunlop for any liability resulting from the use of the leased equipment and that Dunlop did not materially breach its obligations under that agreement.   RPM contested this joint motion and filed its own motion for summary judgment on Dunlop's third-party claims.   In both instances, it contested the enforceability of the lease agreement executed with Dunlop, claiming that Dunlop materially breached the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose contained in the agreement by failing to test the load-bearing capacity of the work platforms and outriggers prior to delivery of them to the project site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was assigned to a magistrate judge.   In her report and recommendations, she first addressed RPM's summary judgment motion.   The magistrate judge denied RPM's claim that the lease agreement it executed with Dunlop included an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-315, but agreed that it contained an implied warranty of merchantability, under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-314.   The magistrate judge recommended that RPM's motion for summary judgment be denied because she found that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether Dunlop breached its implied warranties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the joint motions for summary judgment filed by Dunlop and the MacGlashings, the magistrate judge concluded that the record, viewed in RPM's favor, precluded a dismissal with prejudice, of RPM's counterclaim for breach.   She recommended, however, that Dunlop and the MacGlashings' joint motion for summary judgment on Dunlop's third-party complaint be allowed.   The magistrate judge found that, barring a determination that Dunlop materially breached the lease agreement, RPM was \"obligated to indemnify Dunlop for any liability resulting from Charles MacGlashing's use of the leased equipment.\"   She concluded that \"whether Dunlop's conduct amounted to a material or serious breach of the contract\" was an issue of fact for the jury.   Each of the parties filed timely objections to the magistrate judge's report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued an order accepting, in part, and modifying, in part, the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge.   The district court agreed with the magistrate judge's determination that RPM's motion for summary judgment should be denied. While it also agreed that summary judgment in favor of Dunlop and the MacGlashings was appropriate on Dunlop's third-party complaint, the court rejected the magistrate judge's conclusion that RPM's obligation to indemnify Dunlop for damages arising from Charles MacGlashing's injuries could be relieved by a material breach by Dunlop.   The court held that, under Massachusetts law, a party's breach of an implied warranty was insufficient to invalidate a broadly worded indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court scheduled a jury trial on the various claims asserted by the parties.   Before the trial date arrived, however, the MacGlashing's entered into a settlement agreement with Dunlop, subject to court approval.   The settlement contemplated satisfying the MacGlashings' suit for damages against Dunlop with a $750,000.00 cash payment--approximately 75 percent of the insurance coverage available to Dunlop through its insurer--and the assignment of Dunlop's claims against RPM and Longwood to the MacGlashings.   Under the agreement, judgment was to enter in favor of Charles MacGlashing in the amount of $4,560,000.00 and in favor of Sharlene MacGlashing for $300,000.00.   The MacGlashings agreed to seek no further recovery from Dunlop in the event they could not recover from RPM or Longwood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing and reviewed evidence before approving the settlement.   At the hearing RPM's counsel stated, inter alia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't believe that RPM has any objection to the structure of the settlement under the current circumstances ...

The claims against Longwood were tried to a jury which returned a verdict in favor of Longwood.   The district court issued a final judgment dismissing the action of the MacGlashings against Longwood, entering judgment against Dunlop, and ordering that Charles MacGlashing recover $4,651,739.23 and his wife, $306,032.52--the amount of the settlement plus post-judgment interest at the rate of 5.86%--from RPM.

We apply Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is whether the indemnification clause contained in the lease agreement RPM executed with Dunlop is enforceable and, if so, whether its scope includes liability for damages stemming from the injuries MacGlashing sustained as a result of the accident.   RPM avers that it is not obligated, under Massachusetts law, to pay the judgment awarded the MacGlashings because Dunlop materially breached the lease agreement, relieving RPM of the promise to indemnify Dunlop contained in the agreement.   In the alternative, RPM argues that even if the indemnification clause is valid, it should not be deemed responsible for the particular claims advanced by the MacGlashings because they fall outside the contemplated scope of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees contest both of these arguments.

See Kelly v. Dimeo, Inc., 31 Mass.App.Ct. 626, 628, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2170894\"><a href=\"/opinion/2170894/kelly-v-dimeo-inc-waterproofing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1316</span></a></span> (1991)(\"Under Massachusetts law, a contract-based right to indemnification exists only if there is a binding contract between indemnitor and indemnitee in which such right is expressed or from which it can be fairly implied.\"), review denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></span> (1992).   RPM, using the Uniform Commercial Code as its launching pad, argues that the indemnification clause is unenforceable because Dunlop materially breached implied warranties of merchantability, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-314 (1990), and fitness for a particular purpose, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 2-315 (1990), by providing RPM with work platforms that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.   RPM asserts that because, under Massachusetts law, the MacGlashings would not have been entitled to any recovery in the absence of a finding that the work platform Dunlop provided was defective or unreasonably dangerous, Dunlop, ipso facto, breached the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RPM, in effect, attempts to use the tort claim of the MacGlashings against Dunlop as a basis for its argument that Dunlop breached its implied warranty of merchantability.   But the contract between RPM and Dunlop was for the lease of property.   RPM cannot use the indemnity clause to turn an economic contract into one based on tort concepts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law plainly forecloses RPM's argument.   It adopts the majority view which draws a clear distinction between tort recovery for physical injury and contract recovery for economic loss.   See Jacobs v.

The rule that the absence of a showing of personal injury, or of physical damage to property belonging to the contracting party forecloses recovery for economic losses stemming from tort-based strict liability or negligence is well established in Massachusetts.  Garweth Corp. v. Boston Edison Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2035654\"><a href=\"/opinion/2035654/garweth-corp-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 305, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2035654\"><a href=\"/opinion/2035654/garweth-corp-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span> (1993).   Attempts to circumvent this rule by \"[c]ouching the allegations in terms of breach of contract\" have been rejected routinely.   See, e.g., FMR Corp. v. Boston Edison Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2035758\"><a href=\"/opinion/2035758/fmr-corp-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 394, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2035758\"><a href=\"/opinion/2035758/fmr-corp-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span> (1993).   We cannot, as RPM urges, regard the difference between tort and contract-based claims as \"irrelevant\" in this case.   RPM's attempt to shift the obligation to compensate the MacGlashings back to Dunlop fails because RPM alleges no direct damage or injury to itself.   The argument that RPM is entitled to relief from the contract it negotiated with Dunlop hinges entirely on the physical injury its employee, Charles MacGlashing, sustained.   Compare Garweth, 415 Mass. at 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2035654\"><a href=\"/opinion/2035654/garweth-corp-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>.   RPM has not made the showing of injury or damage to itself as Massachusetts law requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, appellant has not convinced us that the alleged breach of the lease agreement rendered the indemnification clause invalid, as if it had never been executed.   The one-page contract executed between RPM and Dunlop contains standard-form language and clauses which suggest that the indemnity provision is separate from the underlying lease.   The face of the agreement sets out, inter alia, the type and cost of the equipment to be leased, as well as guidelines for its installation and transportation around the site, and expressly incorporates a July 21, 1993, handwritten note regarding delivery, assembly, and pickup of the work platforms by Paul Haven, RPM's president.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reverse side of the agreement contains seventeen numbered paragraphs that outline lease conditions and are clearly separated by spacing.   Two of these reverse-side clauses concern responsibility for damages flowing from the use of equipment referred to in the lease agreement.   The first clause provides that RPM assumes full responsibility under the agreement for damages, injuries, and accidents caused by the use of Dunlop equipment and reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>3.  Lessee assumes the full responsibility for damages, injuries and accidents resulting to any property or persons, caused by the use of said equipment while in the possession of the lessee, from the time of arrival at the above named location, during the term of lease, and until equipment is returned to lessor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second clause deals with indemnification and is one of six written in boldfaced type.   It provides that RPM absolves Dunlop of any responsibility or obligation in the event of accidents resulting from the use of the leased equipment, regardless of cause or consequence and reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>12.  THE LESSEE HEREBY ABSOLVES THE LESSOR OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR OBLIGATION IN THE EVENT OF ACCIDENT, REGARDLESS OF CAUSES OR CONSEQUENCES, AND THAT ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, COURT OR ATTORNEY'S FEES, OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF DESCRIBED EQUIPMENT WILL BE INDEMNIFIED BY THE LESSEE REGARDLESS AGAINST WHOM THE CLAIMANT OR CLAIMANTS INSTITUTE ACTION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard form equipment sign-off sheets Paul Haven signed on the 20th, 22nd, 23rd, and 27th of July 1993, when Dunlop delivered the work platforms to the work site, contain similar language.   They provide that RPM agrees that:  \"Dunlop, Inc. is not responsible for any damages to the building, or any injuries or accidents resulting to people or property caused from the use or misuse of this equipment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our reading of the lease and the sign-off sheets, we do not think RPM and Dunlop intended the covenants contained in the lease agreement and the indemnification clause to be dependent.   See Connolly v. Haines-Ce Brook, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></span>, 427, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></span> (1931)(\"[W]hether covenants are conditional is determined ... by the true intention of the parties as expressed by the language of the contract.\");   see also 41 Am.Jur.2d &#167; 17, at 358 (1995) (\"Where the language of the indemnity contract is neither technical nor ambiguous, the words are given their legal, natural, and ordinary meaning.\").   Because the right of action on the leased platforms accrues as soon as there is a breach of its terms,--i.e., failure to deliver the equipment in a timely fashion--the right of action under the indemnity agreement does not accrue until Dunlop makes payment to a third party or suffers the loss addressed by the agreement.   See 41 Am.Jur.2d &#167; 4, at 349 (1995);  42 C.J.S. &#167; 2, at 72-73 (1991);  see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 379, comment a.

That case involved electric utility companies which sought remedies for breach, under the UCC, for losses they allegedly incurred as the result of the failure of electric generator components supplied by Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

Paragraph 12 shifts liability to RPM in clear and unmistakable language.   Additionally, the record makes it clear that RPM's president, Paul Haven, a man with more than twenty years of experience in the construction industry, knew or should have known about the risk allocation provisions contained in the agreement.   He negotiated the lease agreement and represented, in signing it on RPM's behalf, that he had \"read and agree[d] to all terms stated on both sides of th[e] form.\"   By Haven's own acknowledgement indemnity clauses of the sort contained in the Dunlop lease agreement are standard in the construction industry. Cf. Perelman, Risk Allocation, 40 S.C. Law.

The plaintiffs in the case sought a determination that the hazardous waste transporter with whom they executed the contracts containing the indemnification clauses, Rollins Environmental Services (NJ), Inc., was obligated to indemnify them against claims arising from a spill at a hazardous waste storage facility.   The language contained in the indemnity clause read in relevant part:  \"You hereby agree to indemnify and save Polaroid harmless from all liability and loss arising from services performed by you or your employees hereunder....\"  After concluding that the private indemnity agreements were not prohibited by CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 9607(e)(1), the court held that the clause was broad enough to cover strict liability for hazardous waste damage imposed under CERCLA.   In reaching this conclusion, the court found that strict liability in tort for ultrahazardous activities existed in Massachusetts at the time the parties entered into their agreements and that there was no outward manifestation on the part of the indemnitor to limit its obligations under the agreement to negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, paragraph 14 of the lease convinces us that the parties intended the indemnity agreement to cover all liability whether grounded in negligence or strict liability.   Paragraph 14 provides, in relevant part, \"Our insurance [Dunlop's] does not cover the equipment while in your possession [RPM's].\" It can be reasonably inferred from this that the parties intended RPM to procure insurance to cover the burden it assumed under the indemnity clause.
