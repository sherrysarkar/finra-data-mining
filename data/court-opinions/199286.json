The appellants, Angel Nieves and\n\nhis eighteen-year-old daughter Rebecca, claim to be victims of\n\npolice brutality.       They waited a considerable period of time\n\nbefore bringing suit, however, and the district court turned\n\nthem away, partially on timeliness grounds and partially for\n\nfailure to proffer a federally-cognizable claim.          Their appeal\n\ncontends that the lower court misunderstood both the operation\n\nof the statute of limitations in civil conspiracy cases and the\n\ncircumstances under which 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a vehicle\n\nfor the maintenance of malicious prosecution claims.            Finding\n\nthese contentions unpersuasive, we affirm the district court's\n\nentry of summary judgment.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n           On the evening of May 12, 1994, a disturbance erupted\n\nat the appellants' home in Ayer, Massachusetts.             The police\n\nlearned of the tumult from Rebecca's mother (Angel's ex-wife),\n\nwho   telephoned   to   report   that   Angel   was   abusing   Rebecca.\n\nOfficers Terence McSweeney and Dana Beauvais responded to the\n\ncall.    Although the details of what transpired are murky, at\n\nleast two things are clear:      (1) a melee developed involving the\n\nappellants and the police officers; and (2) both appellants\n\nsustained injuries.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f             As the fracas ended, two more police officers, Bradley\n\nMadge and Leon Avery, arrived at the scene.            The appellants were\n\narrested without a warrant and taken to the police station.                The\n\nauthorities detained them for approximately two hours, at which\n\npoint Angel was released on a $25 bond and Rebecca was released\n\non her own recognizance.\n\n             The next day, Officer Edward Denmark, acting on reports\n\nfiled by McSweeney and Beauvais, swore out criminal complaints\n\nagainst the appellants.           One such complaint charged Angel with\n\nassault with intent to murder, assault and battery by dangerous\n\nweapon, assault and battery on a police officer (two counts),\n\nand being a disorderly person.             The second charged Rebecca with\n\ntwo counts of assault and battery on a police officer and one\n\ncount   of    being    a    disorderly   person.     The    appellants    were\n\npromptly arraigned and then released on their own recognizance.\n\n             Pretrial proceedings were unremarkable (although the\n\nappellants, from time to time, had to attend court sessions).\n\nEventually, the charge of assault with intent to murder was\n\nwithdrawn.         The remaining charges were tried to a jury.              On\n\nOctober      27,    1994,   the   jurors    found   Angel   guilty   on    the\n\ndisorderly person charge but acquitted the appellants on all\n\nother charges.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f              Nearly three years later, on October 9, 1997, the\n\nappellants brought suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe    District   of    Massachusetts        against     McSweeney,     Beauvais,\n\nMadge, Avery, Denmark, the chief of police, and the town of Ayer\n\n(the    Town).        The   gravamen      of    their     complaint     was   the\n\nmultifaceted allegation that the officers conspired to deprive\n\nthe appellants of their civil rights by using excessive force,\n\narresting      them    without   probable      cause,     initiating     baseless\n\ncharges, and maliciously prosecuting those charges.                     After an\n\nextensive period of pretrial discovery, the defendants sought\n\nsummary judgment.        In passing upon these motions, the district\n\ncourt proceeded in increments.               First, it segregated all the\n\nfederal-law claims that were based on the events of May 12, 1994\n\n(such as those rooted in excessive force and false arrest) and\n\nruled that they were time-barred.               Nieves v. McSweeney, 73 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 98, 102 (D. Mass. 1999).              Next, the court focused upon\n\nthe    lone    federal      claim   that       escaped     this   proscription:\n\nconspiracy to commit malicious prosecution.                   That claim, the\n\ncourt ascertained, did not allege a violation of a federally-\n\nprotected right.        Id. at 104.        Accordingly, the court granted\n\nthe    defendants'       motions    for      brevis      disposition,     without\n\nprejudice, however, to the appellants' pursuit of any state-law\n\nclaims in a state tribunal.          Id. at 106.         This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fII.    ANALYSIS\n\n           The appellants advance two principal theses in their\n\nendeavor to blunt the swing of the summary judgment ax.             First,\n\nthey posit that the entire panoply of events that began on the\n\nevening of the arrest and ended with the completion of their\n\ncriminal     trial   constituted    a     single,   ongoing   conspiracy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, they argue that the statute of\n\nlimitations did not begin to run until the commission of the\n\nlast overt act incident to that conspiracy — the officers'\n\nallegedly false testimony at the criminal trial.            Since that act\n\ntook    place     within   the   three-year    limitation     period,   the\n\nappellants assert that their claims are timely.             As a fallback,\n\nthe appellants argue that even if some of their claims are time-\n\nbarred, their malicious prosecution claim is not.              This claim,\n\nthey suggest, comprises a viable constitutional cause of action\n\ngrounded in the Fourth Amendment.\n\n           In the sections that follow, we parse the complaint and\n\nthen measure each of these theories against a familiar standard\n\nof review.      After all, summary judgment is appropriate only when\n\n\"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).    In applying this screen, we construe the\n\nrecord and all reasonable inferences from it in favor of the\n\nparty who lost below.     Grant's Dairy-Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me.\n\nDep't of Agric., Food & Rural Res., 232 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d\n\n178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).      In the process, we afford no special\n\ndeference to the lower court's views.             See Houlton Citizens'\n\nCoalition, 175 F.3d at 184 (explaining that the court of appeals\n\nreviews the entry of summary judgment de novo).\n\n\n\n\n                         A.    The Complaint.\n\n          We grapple with only two of the ten counts in the\n\ncomplaint:     counts 1 and 2.    These counts are both premised on\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.    They charge Officers McSweeney, Beauvais, and\n\nMadge   with   participating     in    a    conspiracy   to   violate   the\n\nappellants' civil rights.1     We briefly explain why the remaining\n\ncounts need not concern us.\n\n          Three counts — counts 3, 4, and 5 — allege supervisory\n\nliability against the police chief and municipal liability on\n\n\n\n    1We mention only McSweeney, Beauvais, and Madge because, in\nother rulings, the district court dismissed the action as it\npertained to Avery and Denmark. These unappealed rulings rested\non different premises and we do not discuss them further.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthe part of the Town.         The district court initially severed and\n\nstayed the prosecution of these counts, and eventually granted\n\nsummary judgment on them (along with counts 1 and 2).                    These\n\ncounts        require   proof,    inter     alia,     of   an   underlying\n\nconstitutional violation.         See Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033,\n\n1040 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying this principle in respect to\n\nmunicipal liability); Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 990 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (applying this principle in respect to supervisory\n\nliability).        The constitutional violations upon which these\n\ncounts are premised are those alleged in counts 1 and 2.                 Thus,\n\nif the district court appropriately jettisoned the first two\n\ncounts of the complaint, the next three also must fail.\n\n              By like token, counts 6, 7, and 8 charge violations of\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1985, which in pertinent part confers a private\n\nright    of    action   for   injuries   occasioned   when   \"two   or    more\n\npersons . . . conspire . . . for the purpose of depriving,\n\neither directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of\n\nthe equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and\n\nimmunities under the laws.\"              42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).        As the\n\ndistrict court noted, the appellants' section 1985(3) claims\n\nmirror their section 1983 claims.          Nieves, 73 F. Supp. 2d at 102\n\nn.4.     Inasmuch as the critical issues in this appeal — whether\n\nthe appellants sued in a timeous fashion and whether they were\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdeprived of a federally-protected right — are common to both\n\nsets of claims, it would serve no useful purpose to discuss the\n\nsection 1985(3) claims separately.             Those counts can stand only\n\nif, and to the same extent that, counts 1 and 2 can stand.\n\n            This    brings   us    to     counts    9   and   11    (oddly,   the\n\nappellants' complaint contains no count 10).                        These counts\n\nallege a common-law conspiracy to violate Massachusetts civil\n\nrights laws.       When the court below entered its summary judgment\n\norder, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\n\nthese counts.      Id. at 106.     The appellants have not attacked the\n\nlower court's determination that these counts should be aired in\n\na state forum.       Consequently, we need not discuss them in any\n\ndetail.\n\n                             B.     Conspiracy.\n\n            The appellants allege the existence of a single ongoing\n\nconspiracy that extended over a period of more than four months\n\n(May 12 through October 27, 1994) and encompassed the officers'\n\nexcessive    use    of   force,    the    false    arrest,    and   the   ensuing\n\nmalicious prosecution.            Because of the appellants' delay in\n\nbringing suit, we must determine when the limitation period\n\nbegan to run on this civil rights conspiracy claim.\n\n            Section 1983 does not contain a built-in statute of\n\nlimitations.       McIntosh v. Antonino, 71 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f1995).    Thus, a federal court called upon to adjudicate a\n\nsection 1983 claim ordinarily must borrow the forum state's\n\nlimitation period governing personal injury causes of action.\n\nWilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 276-80 (1985).            Massachusetts\n\nprescribes a three-year statute of limitations for personal\n\ninjury actions.    See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.           We have\n\nborrowed this prescriptive period for section 1983 cases arising\n\nin Massachusetts, e.g., McIntosh, 71 F.3d at 34, and the parties\n\nagree that the three-year period applies here.\n\n           The   parties   do   not   agree,   however,   on   when   the\n\nlimitation period began to run.          As said, the confrontation\n\nbetween the officers and the appellants occurred on May 12,\n\n1994, yet no suit was commenced until October 9, 1997.                The\n\nappellants asseverate that this elapsed time is not fatal:\n\nbecause they configured their claims as arising within the\n\ncontours of an ongoing conspiracy, the clock did not begin to\n\ntick until the conclusion of the criminal trial (October 27,\n\n1994), thus rendering their civil suit timely.            The appellees\n\nsay that this reasoning elevates form over substance.          Since the\n\ntriggering events occurred on May 12, 1994, they maintain that\n\nthe limitation period expired well before the appellants started\n\nsuit.    For the most part, the district court agreed with the\n\nappellees.   See Nieves, 73 F. Supp. 2d at 103-04.         So do we.\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f          This court determined more than two decades ago that,\n\nin the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate civil\n\nrights, the statute of limitations runs separately from the\n\noccurrence of each civil rights violation that causes actual\n\ndamage to the plaintiff (as long as the plaintiff knows or\n\nshould have known of the injury).      Hernandez Jimenez v. Calero\n\nToledo, 576 F.2d 402, 404 (1st Cir. 1978).         In so holding, we\n\nexplicitly   repudiated   the   notion,   loudly    bruited   by   the\n\nappellants in this case, that the statute of limitations for\n\ncivil conspiracy should run from the date of the last overt act\n\nthat causes damage to the plaintiff.      We stated:\n\n          We recognize that some courts have spoken of\n          the \"last overt act\" of a civil rights\n          conspiracy as the time from which the\n          statute begins to run, but do not believe\n          those courts meant to depart from the\n          traditional rule in civil conspiracies that\n          the mere fact of a conspiracy does not toll\n          the statute of limitations with respect to\n          earlier clear-cut violations of rights that\n          have not been concealed from the plaintiff.\n\nId. at 404 n.1 (citation omitted). 2      As the appellants do not\n\nsuggest that the violations that transpired in the course of\n\n\n     2The principal authority that the appellants cite in support\nof their \"last overt act\" theory is Buford v. Tremayne, 747 F.2d\n445, 448 (8th Cir. 1984) (opining that in a conspiracy action\n\"the statute of limitations begins to run from the occurrence of\nthe last overt act resulting in damage to the plaintiff\").\nAlthough   this   decision  postdates   Hernandez   Jimenez,   it\nnonetheless   falls   squarely   within   the  class   of   cases\ncontemplated by footnote 1 of the Hernandez Jimenez opinion.\n\n                                -11-\n\fthis alleged conspiracy (such as the excessive use of force and\n\nthe false arrest) were concealed from them, Hernandez Jimenez\n\ncontrols.      See United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (holding that in a multi-panel circuit, prior panel\n\ndecisions generally are binding upon newly-constituted panels).\n\n              The   appellants   attempt        to    withstand       this    blow   by\n\ncloaking themselves in the protective armor of Robinson v.\n\nMaruffi, 895 F.2d 649 (10th Cir. 1990).                     That armor does not\n\nfit.      The black-letter rule is that the statute of limitations\n\non    a   malicious    prosecution       claim       begins    to   run      upon    the\n\ntermination of the antecedent criminal proceedings.                           Heck v.\n\nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 489 (1994).                   Applying this rule, the\n\nRobinson court allowed a plaintiff to reach back to include\n\nclaims of false arrest and false imprisonment within a simple\n\ncivil conspiracy claim on a \"continuing violation\" theory, see\n\n895    F.2d   at    654-55,   but   it    did    so    on     facts    that    differ\n\nsignificantly from the case at bar.\n\n              The most important distinction between these two cases\n\nis that, in Robinson, the conspiratorial agreement arose before\n\nthe arrest; Robinson contended that the defendants formulated an\n\nelaborate plan to frame him for the murder of a police officer\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fand then arrested him in furtherance of that plan.3            Id. at 655.\n\nThis sequencing meant that the arrest was encompassed within the\n\nmalicious prosecution conspiracy, and the statute of limitations\n\ntherefore began to run on all acts (including the arrest) only\n\nwhen the criminal proceedings were terminated in Robinson's\n\nfavor.\n\n             Robinson is the unusual case in which the malicious\n\nprosecution conspiracy began before the victim's arrest and\n\nencompassed it.    The case at bar is vastly different.           Here, it\n\nis   undisputed   that   the    officers     and   the    appellants    were\n\nstrangers to each other until the date of the arrest.                  It is\n\nalso undisputed that the officers went to the appellants' abode\n\nin response to a third-party call.           Under the appellants' own\n\ntheory of the case, the malicious prosecution conspiracy did not\n\nantedate the arrest, but, rather, arose afterwards, sparked by\n\nthe officers' perceived need to cover up their unwarranted\n\nbrutality.\n\n          In   comparable      situations,    we   have    determined    the\n\nconspiracy to be distinct from the events that triggered the\n\nneed for it.    E.g., Landrigan v. City of Warwick, 628 F.2d 736,\n\n\n     3\n     Among other things, the plan involved surveilling\nRobinson's associates, apprehending them for petty crimes, and\nthreatening them with incarceration unless they implicated\nRobinson in the murder (for which he was then arrested and\nprosecuted). Robinson, 895 F.2d at 651-53.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f741 (1st Cir. 1980) (finding excessive force and a subsequent\n\ncoverup to be \"separate and distinct wrongs resting on different\n\nfactual bases\").        We reaffirm that view today and, accordingly,\n\nreject the appellants' theory of a single, unified conspiracy\n\nencompassing excessive use of force, false arrest, and malicious\n\nprosecution.      This means, of course, that the three-year statute\n\nof limitations runs from each civil rights violation identified\n\nin the complaint.        See Hernandez Jimenez, 576 F.2d at 404.\n\n              With these dynamics in mind, we proceed to analyze the\n\noperation of the statute of limitations in relation to each of\n\nthe component violations charged in the appellants' complaint.\n\nWe conduct this analysis mindful that the question of when a\n\ncause of action accrues in a civil rights case is a matter of\n\nfederal law.         Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349,\n\n353 (1st Cir. 1992); Street v. Vose, 936 F.2d 38, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (per curiam).          Consequently, a section 1983 claim accrues\n\nat the moment the plaintiff knows, or has reason to know, of the\n\ninjury   that    is    the   basis    for   the   claim.        Calero-Colon    v.\n\nBetancourt-Lebron, 68 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n              Following this scheme, it is pellucid that all claims\n\nbased    on    the    officers'      physical     abuse    or   arrest   of    the\n\nappellants accrued at the time that those events occurred — May\n\n12, 1994 — because the appellants had ample reason to know of\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fthe injury then and there.4              See Beck v. City of Muskogee Police\n\nDep't, 195 F.3d 553, 558 (10th Cir. 1999) (explaining that\n\nclaims arising from police action toward a criminal suspect,\n\nsuch as arrest and seizure, are presumed to accrue when the\n\nactions occur); Sneed v. Rybicki, 146 F.3d 478, 481 (7th Cir.\n\n1998) (observing that a section 1983 false arrest claim accrues\n\non the day of the arrest regardless of later proceedings);\n\nMcIntosh, 71 F.3d at 34 (determining that plaintiff's section\n\n1983 claims for assault and false arrest accrued on the date\n\nthat the events occurred); Singleton v. City of New York, 632\n\nF.2d       185,    191   (2d     Cir.   1980)    (similar).    The   statute   of\n\nlimitations on these claims expired three years later — months\n\nbefore the appellants filed suit.                  Accordingly, we uphold the\n\ndistrict          court's   conclusion     that    the   alleged   civil   rights\n\nviolations predicated on excessive force and false arrest are\n\ntime-barred.\n\n                            C.    Malicious Prosecution.\n\n              Although two of the appellants' claims have foundered\n\non the shoals of the statute of limitations, one claim escapes\n\n\n\n       4\n     We deal here with the mine-run, acknowledging, however,\nthat there may be rare and exotic circumstances in which a\nsection 1983 claim based on a warrantless arrest will not accrue\nat the time of the arrest.    See Calero-Colon, 68 F.3d at 4-5\n(Lynch, J., concurring).     We are not faced with any such\nsituation today.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fthis prohibition.        As we noted earlier, a cause of action for\n\nmalicious prosecution does not accrue until the termination of\n\nthe criminal proceedings.           See Heck, 512 U.S. at 489.             Since the\n\nappellants filed their civil suit within three years of the\n\nverdict that marked the end of the criminal case, this differing\n\naccrual rule enables them to board the lifeboat of a section\n\n1983 malicious prosecution claim and see how far that craft\n\ntakes them.\n\n            The     elements   of    a   common-law    cause    of    action      for\n\nmalicious prosecution are:           (1) the commencement or continuation\n\nof a criminal proceeding against the eventual plaintiff at the\n\nbehest of the eventual defendant; (2) the termination of the\n\nproceeding in favor of the accused; (3) an absence of probable\n\ncause for the charges; and (4) actual malice.                        Correllas v.\n\nViveiros,     572    N.E.2d    7,   10   (Mass.    1991).      We    assume,      for\n\nargument's sake, that the appellants made a sufficient showing\n\non these four points to avoid summary judgment.5                    Even so, more\n\nis   needed   to    transform       malicious     prosecution       into    a   claim\n\ncognizable under section 1983.             See Roche v. John Hancock Mut.\n\n\n      5\n      Of course, the jury convicted Angel Nieves on one count:\nbeing a disorderly person. The parties hotly dispute whether an\nacquittal on all counts but one is a termination of the criminal\nproceedings in Angel's favor (and, thus, satisfies the second\nprong of the four-part framework for malicious prosecution).\nGiven our ultimate conclusion that no constitutional deprivation\noccurred, however, we need not resolve this dispute.\n\n                                         -16-\n\fLife Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 256 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that\n\n\"a garden-variety claim of malicious prosecution garbed in the\n\nregalia of § 1983 must fail\").                To bridge the gap, the plaintiff\n\nalso must show a deprivation of a federally-protected right.\n\nMeehan v. Town of Plymouth, 167 F.3d 85, 88 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nRoche, 81 F.3d at 254.\n\n             The    fact    that    a    plaintiff     styles   her   claim    as   a\n\nconspiracy to prosecute her maliciously does not diminish her\n\nneed to show a constitutional deprivation.                      Singer v. Fulton\n\nCounty Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 1995).                      In order to\n\nmake   out    an    actionable          conspiracy    under     section    1983,    a\n\nplaintiff has to prove not only a conspiratorial agreement but\n\nalso   an    actual      abridgment      of    some   federally-secured       right.\n\nEarle v. Benoit, 850 F.2d 836, 844 (1st Cir. 1988); Landrigan,\n\n628 F.2d at 742.           Moreover, it is the plaintiff's burden to\n\nidentify     the    specific       constitutional      right    infringed.       See\n\nAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994).                    In the end, this\n\nrequirement scuttles the appellants' claim.\n\n             It is perfectly clear that the Due Process Clause\n\ncannot      serve   to     ground       the   appellants'     federal     malicious\n\nprosecution claim.         No procedural due process claim can flourish\n\nin this soil because Massachusetts provides an adequate remedy\n\nfor malicious prosecution.               See Roche, 81 F.3d at 256 (citing,\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\finter alia,      Beecy v. Pucciarelli, 441 N.E.2d 1035, 1038-39\n\n(Mass. 1982)).    Similarly, a plurality of the Supreme Court has\n\nconcluded that \"substantive due process may not furnish the\n\nconstitutional    peg    on    which     to    hang\"       a    federal   malicious\n\nprosecution tort.        Albright, 510 U.S. at 271 n.4.                       We have\n\nfollowed the Court's lead in this respect, see, e.g., Roche, 81\n\nF.3d at 256 (holding that there is no substantive due process\n\nright under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from malicious\n\nprosecution), and we hew to that line today.\n\n            The Fourth Amendment, however, provides potentially\n\nmore   fertile   soil.        It   is    an    open    question        whether    the\n\nConstitution permits the assertion of a section 1983 claim for\n\nmalicious    prosecution      on   the     basis      of       an   alleged    Fourth\n\nAmendment violation.      See Albright, 510 U.S. at 271-75; Britton\n\nv. Maloney, 196 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120\n\nS. Ct. 2198 (2000); Singer, 63 F.3d at 114.                         As in previous\n\ncases, e.g., Britton, 196 F.3d at 28; Roche, 81 F.3d at 256 n.5,\n\nwe will assume without deciding that malicious prosecution can,\n\nunder some circumstances, embody a violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment and thus ground a cause of action under section 1983.\n\nWe turn, then, to a consideration of whether the facts of this\n\ncase suffice to sustain such a claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f              The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the\n\npeople   to     be   secure     in    their      persons,    houses,    papers,   and\n\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\n\nbe violated . . . .\"                 U.S. Const. amend. IV.            For a public\n\nofficial      to     transgress       the     Fourth    Amendment      through    the\n\ninitiation and pursuit of criminal charges, the prosecution of\n\nthose    charges         must   at    a   bare     minimum    have     occasioned   a\n\ndeprivation of liberty consistent with the concept of a seizure.\n\nBritton, 196 F.2d at 28; Singer, 63 F.3d at 116.\n\n              The appellants assert that they were \"seized\" for\n\nFourth Amendment purposes from the time of their arrest through\n\nthe end of their criminal trial.                   But this assertion rests on a\n\nflawed premise.            The tort of malicious prosecution permits\n\ndamages for a deprivation of liberty — a seizure — pursuant to\n\nlegal process.           Heck, 512 U.S. at 484; Calero-Colon, 68 F.3d at\n\n3.   Generally, the offending legal process comes either in the\n\nform of an arrest warrant (in which case the arrest would\n\nconstitute the seizure) or a subsequent charging document (in\n\nwhich    case      the    sum   of    post-arraignment        deprivations    would\n\ncomprise the seizure).               Singer, 63 F.3d at 117.           The first of\n\nthese variations has no bearing here.                        The appellants were\n\narrested without a warrant and, thus, their arrests — which\n\nantedated any legal process — cannot be part of the Fourth\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fAmendment    seizure    upon    which   they    base   their     section    1983\n\nclaims.\n\n            Meehan   aptly     illustrates     this    point.      There,   the\n\nplaintiff attempted to base a section 1983 malicious prosecution\n\nclaim on his warrantless arrest.           167 F.3d at 89.        We rejected\n\nthis initiative, stating:\n\n            Meehan may not bring a malicious prosecution\n            claim based upon his arrest because his\n            arrest does not constitute the \"initiation\n            of proceedings\" against Meehan. . . .\n            Meehan's arrest was not made pursuant to an\n            arrest warrant.   Meehan cites no authority\n            for  the   proposition   that  a   malicious\n            prosecution cause of action may be based\n            upon a warrantless arrest.\n\nId. at 89-90 (internal citation and footnote omitted).                  Accord\n\nSinger, 63 F.3d at 117.\n\n            This leaves the appellants with the task of showing\n\nsome   post-arraignment deprivation of liberty, caused by the\n\napplication    of    legal     process,    that   approximates      a   Fourth\n\nAmendment    seizure.        Following     a   thoughtful       analysis,    the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the appellants could not vault\n\nthis hurdle.    Nieves, 73 F. Supp. 2d at 105.            We agree.\n\n            It is undisputed that the first time the appellants\n\nwere subject to legal process was on May 13, 1994 (when criminal\n\ncomplaints against them issued).               Taking the facts from the\n\nstandpoint most favorable to the appellants, as we must, see\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fHoulton Citizens' Coalition, 175 F.3d at 184, the following\n\nevents occurred after that time:       the appellants were released\n\non their own recognizance; they suffered the stress and anxiety\n\nof knowing not only that serious criminal charges were pending\n\nagainst them, but also that their reputations had been sullied;\n\nthey appeared before the criminal court a number of times in the\n\npretrial period; and they endured the trial.      The question thus\n\nbecomes:    do these strictures, in the aggregate, constitute a\n\nFourth Amendment seizure sufficient to ground a section 1983\n\nmalicious prosecution claim?\n\n            In the classic formulation, a Fourth Amendment seizure\n\noccurs \"[o]nly when the officer, by means of physical force or\n\nshow of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a\n\ncitizen.\"    Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968).    In this\n\ncase, there was no physical force during the post-arraignment\n\nperiod.     The appellants' position, by default, is that their\n\nliberty was restrained by a show of authority, manifested most\n\nclearly by a series of orders to appear before the court.        By\n\nobeying these orders, the appellants assert, they yielded to a\n\nshow of authority, completing the seizure.       Cf. California v.\n\nHodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991) (holding that a show of\n\nauthority by a government actor does not constitute a seizure\n\nunless the subject yields or submits to it).\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f            This proposition is counterintuitive.            The very idea\n\nof defining commonplace conditions of pretrial release as a\n\n\"seizure\" for Fourth Amendment purposes seems to stretch the\n\naccepted meaning of the term.        After all, a seizure under Fourth\n\nAmendment      jurisprudence    is     generally   a    discrete     event,\n\nquintessentially an arrest, see id. at 624, or at least a\n\nphysical detention, see Terry, 392 U.S. at 16-19.            Thus, seizure\n\njurisprudence     traditionally        has   centered   on    the   initial\n\ndeprivation of liberty that a seizure of the person entails.\n\nSince \"[a] seizure is a single act, and not a continuous fact,\"\n\nHodari D., 499 U.S. at 625 (quoting Thompson v. Whitman, 85 U.S.\n\n(18   Wall.)   457,   471   (1873)),    run-of-the-mill      conditions   of\n\npretrial release do not fit comfortably within the recognized\n\nparameters of the term.\n\n            Moreover, if the concept of a seizure is regarded as\n\nelastic enough to encompass standard conditions of pretrial\n\nrelease, virtually every criminal defendant will be deemed to be\n\nseized pending the resolution of the charges against him.              That\n\nwould mean, in turn, that nearly every malicious prosecution\n\nclaim could be brought before a federal court under the aegis of\n\nsection 1983.     We believe that this is much too ambitious a view\n\nof the law.     Cf. Roche, 81 F.3d at 256 (indicating that \"garden-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fvariety\" malicious prosecution claims are appropriately left to\n\nstate courts).\n\n               Despite these obvious conceptual problems, a concurring\n\nopinion in Albright fully supports the claim that the appellants\n\nwere \"seized\" within the purview of the Fourth Amendment based\n\non their compliance with the obligation to appear in court at\n\nthe   commonwealth's         command.       In    that    concurrence,      Justice\n\nGinsburg       advocated     the   position      that    an    individual    who   is\n\nreleased pending trial should be deemed \"seized\" because such a\n\nperson \"is scarcely at liberty; he remains apprehended, arrested\n\nin his movements, indeed 'seized' for trial, so long as he is\n\nbound     to   appear   in    court   and   answer       the   state's   charges.\"\n\nAlbright, 510 U.S. at 279 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).                       Justice\n\nGinsburg understands this seizure to last as long as the charges\n\nagainst the individual remain unadjudicated.6                    Id. at 280.\n\n               Notwithstanding the eminence of its sponsor, the view\n\nthat an obligation to appear in court to face criminal charges\n\nconstitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure is not the law.                      No other\n\nJustice joined Justice Ginsburg's opinion, and \"the question\n\nwhether the Fourth Amendment continues to provide individuals\n\n\n\n      6\n      Justice Ginsburg went to some lengths to make this point,\nas Albright itself involved a defendant who had been required to\npost bond and had been placed under travel restrictions.\nAlbright, 510 U.S. at 268.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fwith protection against the deliberate use of excessive physical\n\nforce    beyond     the    point   at    which    arrest    ends   and   pretrial\n\ndetention begins,\" Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 n.10\n\n(1989), remains unresolved by the Supreme Court.                   Moreover, two\n\nof     our   sister     circuits      have    explicitly     rejected     Justice\n\nGinsburg's theory.           See Riley v. Dorton, 115 F.3d 1159, 1162\n\n(4th Cir. 1997) (en banc);              Reed v. City of Chicago, 77 F.3d\n\n1049, 1052 n.3 (7th Cir. 1996).                  Another has expressed grave\n\nreservations concerning it.               See Whiting v. Traylor, 85 F.3d\n\n581, 584 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\n             This court, too, has declined to embrace the whole of\n\nJustice Ginsburg's view.           See Britton, 196 F.3d at 29-30.             In\n\nthat    case,   a     plaintiff    alleging       a   section    1983    malicious\n\nprosecution claim argued that he was seized for Fourth Amendment\n\npurposes because he had received a summons in the mail.                     Id. at\n\n29.    Although Justice Ginsburg clearly would have accepted this\n\ncontention,       see     Albright,     510   U.S.    at   279   (Ginsburg,    J.,\n\nconcurring) (observing that a defendant is \"seized\" when bound\n\nto appear for trial by a summons), we spurned it, writing:\n\n             Absent   any   evidence   that   Britton  was\n             arrested,    detained,  restricted    in  his\n             travel,    or   otherwise    subject   to   a\n             deprivation of his liberty before the\n             charges against him were dismissed, the fact\n             that he was given a date to appear in court\n             is insufficient to establish a seizure\n             within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fBritton, 196 F.3d at 30.            In making this determination, we\n\nrelied on cases such as Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593\n\n(1989), in which the Court held that \"[v]iolation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment    requires    an    intentional    acquisition      of    physical\n\ncontrol,\" id. at 596, and that a Fourth Amendment seizure occurs\n\n\"only when there is a governmental termination of freedom of\n\nmovement    through    means     intentionally     applied,\"   id.    at   597\n\n(emphasis omitted).       We were unable to reconcile the limited\n\ndemands that the summons imposed on Britton with concepts such\n\nas \"physical control\" and \"termination of freedom of movement.\"\n\n            The case before us, though somewhat stronger, bears a\n\nfairly resemblance to Britton.             Canvassing the relevant time\n\nframe, we find no evidence that the appellants were held after\n\nthe initiation of criminal proceedings, required to post a\n\nmonetary bond upon arraignment, subjected to restrictions on\n\ntheir   travel,     or   otherwise     exposed      to   any     significant\n\ndeprivation    of     liberty.      While    the    imposition      upon   the\n\nappellants here was marginally greater than the imposition upon\n\nBritton — they were required to appear several times at the\n\ncourt's behest (including an appearance for trial) — the fact\n\nremains that the conditions of pretrial release to which they\n\nwere subjected simply do not approach the level necessary to\n\nconstitute a Fourth Amendment seizure.\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f           In an effort to persuade us to a contrary conclusion,\n\nthe appellants point to three decisions that have given some\n\ndegree of traction to Justice Ginsburg's concurrence.              Their\n\nbellwether case is Evans v. Ball, 168 F.3d 856 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\nThere, the Fifth Circuit determined that the plaintiff in a\n\nBivens action had alleged a seizure within the meaning of the\n\nFourth Amendment based on the following:        (1) the plaintiff's\n\nreceipt of a summons to appear and answer to criminal charges;\n\n(2) his being fingerprinted, photographed, and forced to sign a\n\npersonal recognizance bond; and (3) his being required to report\n\nregularly to pretrial services, obtain permission before leaving\n\nthe state, and provide federal officers with financial and\n\nidentifying information.     Id. at 860-61.     The court concluded\n\nthat the restrictions imposed on the plaintiff diminished his\n\nliberty interest enough to render him seized under the Fourth\n\nAmendment.    Id. at 861.\n\n           The appellants' other two cases are cut from much the\n\nsame cloth.   In Gallo v. City of Philadelphia, 161 F.3d 217 (3d\n\nCir. 1998), the court, calling it a \"close question,\" decided\n\nthat   a   section   1983   plaintiff   had   been   seized   in    the\n\nconstitutional sense where he was required to post a $10,000\n\nbond, attend all court hearings including his trial, contact\n\npretrial services weekly, and refrain from traveling outside New\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fJersey and Pennsylvania.        Id. at 222.     So too Murphy v. Lynn,\n\n118 F.3d 938 (2d Cir. 1997), a two-to-one decision in which the\n\npanel determined that a plaintiff's obligation to attend court\n\nappointments, combined with a prohibition against leaving New\n\nYork, constituted a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.    Id. at 945.\n\n         We    need   not   comment   upon    the   soundness   of   these\n\ndecisions.    For present purposes, it suffices to say that they\n\nare materially distinguishable.          To mention the most glaring\n\ndifference, all three cases involved definitive restrictions on\n\nthe right to travel, and each of the courts in question placed\n\nheavy emphasis on the salience of such a restriction as a\n\nlinchpin of a seizure.      See Evans, 168 F.3d at 861-62; Gallo,\n\n161 F.3d at 224; Murphy, 118 F.3d at 945-46.             Conversely, no\n\nsuch restriction was in force vis-à-vis the appellants.                 For\n\nthis reason, and because the aggregate deprivations involved in\n\nEvans, Gallo, and       Murphy substantially exceeded the overall\n\ndeprivation imposed here, we regard the cases as inapposite.\n\n         That    ends    this   aspect   of   the   matter.     Given   the\n\nrelatively benign nature of the pretrial release conditions\n\ninvolved in this case, we hold that the appellants did not\n\nsuffer a post-arraignment seizure within the meaning of the\n\nFourth Amendment.     It follows inexorably that, in the absence of\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fan anchoring constitutional violation, the appellants' section\n\n1983 malicious prosecution claim topples.\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.7    A ripe civil rights suit was\n\nleft to rot.       Most of the appellants' claims are barred by the\n\noperation of the statute of limitations; those that are not fail\n\nfor lack of a constitutionally significant deprivation.            We\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\non the appellants' federal claims.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      The appellants also complain that the district court\nfrustrated their efforts during pretrial discovery to question\nMcSweeney about other incidents of police brutality. They claim\nthat they had a good-faith basis for the queries (a 1997\ninvestigatory report concluded that McSweeney had demonstrated\na pattern of needless provocation and excessive force in making\narrests) and that the information sought was relevant. But we\nhave concluded that the grant of summary judgment must be upheld\nbased on the statute of limitations (as to some claims) and the\nlack of a constitutional deprivation (as to the remaining\nclaims), see supra Part II, and no amount of discovery anent\nother incidents can alter this result. It is, therefore, a moot\npoint whether the discovery limitation was right or wrong.\n\n                                  -28-\n\f",

The appellants, Angel Nieves and\n\nhis eighteen-year-old daughter Rebecca, claim to be victims of\n\npolice brutality.       They waited a considerable period of time\n\nbefore bringing suit, however, and the district court turned\n\nthem away, partially on timeliness grounds and partially for\n\nfailure to proffer a federally-cognizable claim.          Their appeal\n\ncontends that the lower court misunderstood both the operation\n\nof the statute of limitations in civil conspiracy cases and the\n\ncircumstances under which 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a vehicle\n\nfor the maintenance of malicious prosecution claims.            Finding\n\nthese contentions unpersuasive, we affirm the district court's\n\nentry of summary judgment.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n           On the evening of May 12, 1994, a disturbance erupted\n\nat the appellants' home in Ayer, Massachusetts.             The police\n\nlearned of the tumult from Rebecca's mother (Angel's ex-wife),\n\nwho   telephoned   to   report   that   Angel   was   abusing   Rebecca.\n\nOfficers Terence McSweeney and Dana Beauvais responded to the\n\ncall.    Although the details of what transpired are murky, at\n\nleast two things are clear:      (1) a melee developed involving the\n\nappellants and the police officers; and (2) both appellants\n\nsustained injuries.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f             As the fracas ended, two more police officers, Bradley\n\nMadge and Leon Avery, arrived at the scene.            The appellants were\n\narrested without a warrant and taken to the police station.                The\n\nauthorities detained them for approximately two hours, at which\n\npoint Angel was released on a $25 bond and Rebecca was released\n\non her own recognizance.\n\n             The next day, Officer Edward Denmark, acting on reports\n\nfiled by McSweeney and Beauvais, swore out criminal complaints\n\nagainst the appellants.           One such complaint charged Angel with\n\nassault with intent to murder, assault and battery by dangerous\n\nweapon, assault and battery on a police officer (two counts),\n\nand being a disorderly person.             The second charged Rebecca with\n\ntwo counts of assault and battery on a police officer and one\n\ncount   of    being    a    disorderly   person.     The    appellants    were\n\npromptly arraigned and then released on their own recognizance.\n\n             Pretrial proceedings were unremarkable (although the\n\nappellants, from time to time, had to attend court sessions).\n\nEventually, the charge of assault with intent to murder was\n\nwithdrawn.         The remaining charges were tried to a jury.              On\n\nOctober      27,    1994,   the   jurors    found   Angel   guilty   on    the\n\ndisorderly person charge but acquitted the appellants on all\n\nother charges.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f              Nearly three years later, on October 9, 1997, the\n\nappellants brought suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe    District   of    Massachusetts        against     McSweeney,     Beauvais,\n\nMadge, Avery, Denmark, the chief of police, and the town of Ayer\n\n(the    Town).        The   gravamen      of    their     complaint     was   the\n\nmultifaceted allegation that the officers conspired to deprive\n\nthe appellants of their civil rights by using excessive force,\n\narresting      them    without   probable      cause,     initiating     baseless\n\ncharges, and maliciously prosecuting those charges.                     After an\n\nextensive period of pretrial discovery, the defendants sought\n\nsummary judgment.        In passing upon these motions, the district\n\ncourt proceeded in increments.               First, it segregated all the\n\nfederal-law claims that were based on the events of May 12, 1994\n\n(such as those rooted in excessive force and false arrest) and\n\nruled that they were time-barred.               Nieves v. McSweeney, 73 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 98, 102 (D. Mass. 1999).              Next, the court focused upon\n\nthe    lone    federal      claim   that       escaped     this   proscription:\n\nconspiracy to commit malicious prosecution.                   That claim, the\n\ncourt ascertained, did not allege a violation of a federally-\n\nprotected right.        Id. at 104.        Accordingly, the court granted\n\nthe    defendants'       motions    for      brevis      disposition,     without\n\nprejudice, however, to the appellants' pursuit of any state-law\n\nclaims in a state tribunal.          Id. at 106.         This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fII.    ANALYSIS\n\n           The appellants advance two principal theses in their\n\nendeavor to blunt the swing of the summary judgment ax.             First,\n\nthey posit that the entire panoply of events that began on the\n\nevening of the arrest and ended with the completion of their\n\ncriminal     trial   constituted    a     single,   ongoing   conspiracy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, they argue that the statute of\n\nlimitations did not begin to run until the commission of the\n\nlast overt act incident to that conspiracy — the officers'\n\nallegedly false testimony at the criminal trial.            Since that act\n\ntook    place     within   the   three-year    limitation     period,   the\n\nappellants assert that their claims are timely.             As a fallback,\n\nthe appellants argue that even if some of their claims are time-\n\nbarred, their malicious prosecution claim is not.              This claim,\n\nthey suggest, comprises a viable constitutional cause of action\n\ngrounded in the Fourth Amendment.\n\n           In the sections that follow, we parse the complaint and\n\nthen measure each of these theories against a familiar standard\n\nof review.      After all, summary judgment is appropriate only when\n\n\"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).    In applying this screen, we construe the\n\nrecord and all reasonable inferences from it in favor of the\n\nparty who lost below.     Grant's Dairy-Me., LLC v.

The Complaint.\n\n          We grapple with only two of the ten counts in the\n\ncomplaint:     counts 1 and 2.    These counts are both premised on\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.    They charge Officers McSweeney, Beauvais, and\n\nMadge   with   participating     in    a    conspiracy   to   violate   the\n\nappellants' civil rights.1     We briefly explain why the remaining\n\ncounts need not concern us.\n\n          Three counts — counts 3, 4, and 5 — allege supervisory\n\nliability against the police chief and municipal liability on\n\n\n\n    1We mention only McSweeney, Beauvais, and Madge because, in\nother rulings, the district court dismissed the action as it\npertained to Avery and Denmark. These unappealed rulings rested\non different premises and we do not discuss them further.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthe part of the Town.         The district court initially severed and\n\nstayed the prosecution of these counts, and eventually granted\n\nsummary judgment on them (along with counts 1 and 2).                    These\n\ncounts        require   proof,    inter     alia,     of   an   underlying\n\nconstitutional violation.         See Evans v. Avery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197095\"><a href=\"/opinion/197095/evans-v-avery/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1040 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying this principle in respect to\n\nmunicipal liability); Martinez v. Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696203\"><a href=\"/opinion/696203/wilfredo-martinez-aka-wilfredo-martinez-rodriguez-v-rafael-colon-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 990 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (applying this principle in respect to supervisory\n\nliability).        The constitutional violations upon which these\n\ncounts are premised are those alleged in counts 1 and 2.                 Thus,\n\nif the district court appropriately jettisoned the first two\n\ncounts of the complaint, the next three also must fail.\n\n              By like token, counts 6, 7, and 8 charge violations of\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1985, which in pertinent part confers a private\n\nright    of    action   for   injuries   occasioned   when   \"two   or    more\n\npersons . . . conspire . . . for the purpose of depriving,\n\neither directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of\n\nthe equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and\n\nimmunities under the laws.\"              42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).        As the\n\ndistrict court noted, the appellants' section 1985(3) claims\n\nmirror their section 1983 claims.          Nieves, 73 F. Supp. 2d at 102\n\nn.4.     Inasmuch as the critical issues in this appeal — whether\n\nthe appellants sued in a timeous fashion and whether they were\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdeprived of a federally-protected right — are common to both\n\nsets of claims, it would serve no useful purpose to discuss the\n\nsection 1985(3) claims separately.             Those counts can stand only\n\nif, and to the same extent that, counts 1 and 2 can stand.\n\n            This    brings   us    to     counts    9   and   11    (oddly,   the\n\nappellants' complaint contains no count 10).                        These counts\n\nallege a common-law conspiracy to violate Massachusetts civil\n\nrights laws.       When the court below entered its summary judgment\n\norder, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\n\nthese counts.      Id. at 106.     The appellants have not attacked the\n\nlower court's determination that these counts should be aired in\n\na state forum.       Consequently, we need not discuss them in any\n\ndetail.\n\n                             B.     Conspiracy.\n\n            The appellants allege the existence of a single ongoing\n\nconspiracy that extended over a period of more than four months\n\n(May 12 through October 27, 1994) and encompassed the officers'\n\nexcessive    use    of   force,    the    false    arrest,    and   the   ensuing\n\nmalicious prosecution.            Because of the appellants' delay in\n\nbringing suit, we must determine when the limitation period\n\nbegan to run on this civil rights conspiracy claim.\n\n            Section 1983 does not contain a built-in statute of\n\nlimitations.       McIntosh v. Antonino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196445\"><a href=\"/opinion/196445/mcintosh-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f1995).    Thus, a federal court called upon to adjudicate a\n\nsection 1983 claim ordinarily must borrow the forum state's\n\nlimitation period governing personal injury causes of action.\n\nWilson v. Garcia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111415\"><a href=\"/opinion/111415/wilson-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276-80 (1985).            Massachusetts\n\nprescribes a three-year statute of limitations for personal\n\ninjury actions.    See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.           We have\n\nborrowed this prescriptive period for section 1983 cases arising\n\nin Massachusetts, e.g., McIntosh, 71 F.3d at 34, and the parties\n\nagree that the three-year period applies here.\n\n           The   parties   do   not   agree,   however,   on   when   the\n\nlimitation period began to run.          As said, the confrontation\n\nbetween the officers and the appellants occurred on May 12,\n\n1994, yet no suit was commenced until October 9, 1997.                The\n\nappellants asseverate that this elapsed time is not fatal:\n\nbecause they configured their claims as arising within the\n\ncontours of an ongoing conspiracy, the clock did not begin to\n\ntick until the conclusion of the criminal trial (October 27,\n\n1994), thus rendering their civil suit timely.            The appellees\n\nsay that this reasoning elevates form over substance.          Since the\n\ntriggering events occurred on May 12, 1994, they maintain that\n\nthe limitation period expired well before the appellants started\n\nsuit.    For the most part, the district court agreed with the\n\nappellees.   See Nieves, 73 F. Supp. 2d at 103-04.         So do we.\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f          This court determined more than two decades ago that,\n\nin the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate civil\n\nrights, the statute of limitations runs separately from the\n\noccurrence of each civil rights violation that causes actual\n\ndamage to the plaintiff (as long as the plaintiff knows or\n\nshould have known of the injury).      Hernandez Jimenez v. Calero\n\nToledo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355910\"><a href=\"/opinion/355910/francisco-hernandez-jimenez-v-astol-calero-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (1st Cir. 1978).         In so holding, we\n\nexplicitly   repudiated   the   notion,   loudly    bruited   by   the\n\nappellants in this case, that the statute of limitations for\n\ncivil conspiracy should run from the date of the last overt act\n\nthat causes damage to the plaintiff.

Applying this rule, the\n\nRobinson court allowed a plaintiff to reach back to include\n\nclaims of false arrest and false imprisonment within a simple\n\ncivil conspiracy claim on a \"continuing violation\" theory, see\n\n895    F.2d   at    654-55,   but   it    did    so    on     facts    that    differ\n\nsignificantly from the case at bar.\n\n              The most important distinction between these two cases\n\nis that, in Robinson, the conspiratorial agreement arose before\n\nthe arrest; Robinson contended that the defendants formulated an\n\nelaborate plan to frame him for the murder of a police officer\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fand then arrested him in furtherance of that plan.3            Id. at 655.\n\nThis sequencing meant that the arrest was encompassed within the\n\nmalicious prosecution conspiracy, and the statute of limitations\n\ntherefore began to run on all acts (including the arrest) only\n\nwhen the criminal proceedings were terminated in Robinson's\n\nfavor.\n\n             Robinson is the unusual case in which the malicious\n\nprosecution conspiracy began before the victim's arrest and\n\nencompassed it.    The case at bar is vastly different.           Here, it\n\nis   undisputed   that   the    officers     and   the    appellants    were\n\nstrangers to each other until the date of the arrest.                  It is\n\nalso undisputed that the officers went to the appellants' abode\n\nin response to a third-party call.           Under the appellants' own\n\ntheory of the case, the malicious prosecution conspiracy did not\n\nantedate the arrest, but, rather, arose afterwards, sparked by\n\nthe officers' perceived need to cover up their unwarranted\n\nbrutality.\n\n          In   comparable      situations,    we   have    determined    the\n\nconspiracy to be distinct from the events that triggered the\n\nneed for it.

We reaffirm that view today and, accordingly,\n\nreject the appellants' theory of a single, unified conspiracy\n\nencompassing excessive use of force, false arrest, and malicious\n\nprosecution.      This means, of course, that the three-year statute\n\nof limitations runs from each civil rights violation identified\n\nin the complaint.        See Hernandez Jimenez, 576 F.2d at 404.\n\n              With these dynamics in mind, we proceed to analyze the\n\noperation of the statute of limitations in relation to each of\n\nthe component violations charged in the appellants' complaint.\n\nWe conduct this analysis mindful that the question of when a\n\ncause of action accrues in a civil rights case is a matter of\n\nfederal law.

But this assertion rests on a\n\nflawed premise.            The tort of malicious prosecution permits\n\ndamages for a deprivation of liberty — a seizure — pursuant to\n\nlegal process.           Heck, 512 U.S. at 484; Calero-Colon, 68 F.3d at\n\n3.   Generally, the offending legal process comes either in the\n\nform of an arrest warrant (in which case the arrest would\n\nconstitute the seizure) or a subsequent charging document (in\n\nwhich    case      the    sum   of    post-arraignment        deprivations    would\n\ncomprise the seizure).               Singer, 63 F.3d at 117.           The first of\n\nthese variations has no bearing here.

There,   the\n\nplaintiff attempted to base a section 1983 malicious prosecution\n\nclaim on his warrantless arrest.           167 F.3d at 89.        We rejected\n\nthis initiative, stating:\n\n            Meehan may not bring a malicious prosecution\n            claim based upon his arrest because his\n            arrest does not constitute the \"initiation\n            of proceedings\" against Meehan. . . .\n            Meehan's arrest was not made pursuant to an\n            arrest warrant.

We agree.\n\n            It is undisputed that the first time the appellants\n\nwere subject to legal process was on May 13, 1994 (when criminal\n\ncomplaints against them issued).               Taking the facts from the\n\nstandpoint most favorable to the appellants, as we must, see\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fHoulton Citizens' Coalition, 175 F.3d at 184, the following\n\nevents occurred after that time:       the appellants were released\n\non their own recognizance; they suffered the stress and anxiety\n\nof knowing not only that serious criminal charges were pending\n\nagainst them, but also that their reputations had been sullied;\n\nthey appeared before the criminal court a number of times in the\n\npretrial period; and they endured the trial.      The question thus\n\nbecomes:    do these strictures, in the aggregate, constitute a\n\nFourth Amendment seizure sufficient to ground a section 1983\n\nmalicious prosecution claim?\n\n            In the classic formulation, a Fourth Amendment seizure\n\noccurs \"[o]nly when the officer, by means of physical force or\n\nshow of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a\n\ncitizen.\"    Terry v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 n.16 (1968).    In this\n\ncase, there was no physical force during the post-arraignment\n\nperiod.     The appellants' position, by default, is that their\n\nliberty was restrained by a show of authority, manifested most\n\nclearly by a series of orders to appear before the court.        By\n\nobeying these orders, the appellants assert, they yielded to a\n\nshow of authority, completing the seizure.       Cf. California v.\n\nHodari D., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (1991) (holding that a show of\n\nauthority by a government actor does not constitute a seizure\n\nunless the subject yields or submits to it).\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f            This proposition is counterintuitive.            The very idea\n\nof defining commonplace conditions of pretrial release as a\n\n\"seizure\" for Fourth Amendment purposes seems to stretch the\n\naccepted meaning of the term.        After all, a seizure under Fourth\n\nAmendment      jurisprudence    is     generally   a    discrete     event,\n\nquintessentially an arrest, see id. at 624, or at least a\n\nphysical detention, see Terry, 392 U.S. at 16-19.            Thus, seizure\n\njurisprudence     traditionally        has   centered   on    the   initial\n\ndeprivation of liberty that a seizure of the person entails.\n\nSince \"[a] seizure is a single act, and not a continuous fact,\"\n\nHodari D., 499 U.S. at 625 (quoting Thompson v. Whitman, 85 U.S.\n\n(18   Wall.)   457,   471   (1873)),    run-of-the-mill      conditions   of\n\npretrial release do not fit comfortably within the recognized\n\nparameters of the term.\n\n            Moreover, if the concept of a seizure is regarded as\n\nelastic enough to encompass standard conditions of pretrial\n\nrelease, virtually every criminal defendant will be deemed to be\n\nseized pending the resolution of the charges against him.              That\n\nwould mean, in turn, that nearly every malicious prosecution\n\nclaim could be brought before a federal court under the aegis of\n\nsection 1983.     We believe that this is much too ambitious a view\n\nof the law.     Cf. Roche, 81 F.3d at 256 (indicating that \"garden-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fvariety\" malicious prosecution claims are appropriately left to\n\nstate courts).\n\n               Despite these obvious conceptual problems, a concurring\n\nopinion in Albright fully supports the claim that the appellants\n\nwere \"seized\" within the purview of the Fourth Amendment based\n\non their compliance with the obligation to appear in court at\n\nthe   commonwealth's         command.       In    that    concurrence,      Justice\n\nGinsburg       advocated     the   position      that    an    individual    who   is\n\nreleased pending trial should be deemed \"seized\" because such a\n\nperson \"is scarcely at liberty; he remains apprehended, arrested\n\nin his movements, indeed 'seized' for trial, so long as he is\n\nbound     to   appear   in    court   and   answer       the   state's   charges.\"\n\nAlbright, 510 U.S. at 279 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).                       Justice\n\nGinsburg understands this seizure to last as long as the charges\n\nagainst the individual remain unadjudicated.6                    Id. at 280.\n\n               Notwithstanding the eminence of its sponsor, the view\n\nthat an obligation to appear in court to face criminal charges\n\nconstitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure is not the law.                      No other\n\nJustice joined Justice Ginsburg's opinion, and \"the question\n\nwhether the Fourth Amendment continues to provide individuals\n\n\n\n      6\n      Justice Ginsburg went to some lengths to make this point,\nas Albright itself involved a defendant who had been required to\npost bond and had been placed under travel restrictions.\nAlbright, 510 U.S. at 268.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fwith protection against the deliberate use of excessive physical\n\nforce    beyond     the    point   at    which    arrest    ends   and   pretrial\n\ndetention begins,\" Graham v.

See Britton, 196 F.3d at 29-30.             In\n\nthat    case,   a     plaintiff    alleging       a   section    1983    malicious\n\nprosecution claim argued that he was seized for Fourth Amendment\n\npurposes because he had received a summons in the mail.                     Id. at\n\n29.    Although Justice Ginsburg clearly would have accepted this\n\ncontention,       see     Albright,     510   U.S.    at   279   (Ginsburg,    J.,\n\nconcurring) (observing that a defendant is \"seized\" when bound\n\nto appear for trial by a summons), we spurned it, writing:\n\n             Absent   any   evidence   that   Britton  was\n             arrested,    detained,  restricted    in  his\n             travel,    or   otherwise    subject   to   a\n             deprivation of his liberty before the\n             charges against him were dismissed, the fact\n             that he was given a date to appear in court\n             is insufficient to establish a seizure\n             within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fBritton, 196 F.3d at 30.

We were unable to reconcile the limited\n\ndemands that the summons imposed on Britton with concepts such\n\nas \"physical control\" and \"termination of freedom of movement.\"\n\n            The case before us, though somewhat stronger, bears a\n\nfairly resemblance to Britton.             Canvassing the relevant time\n\nframe, we find no evidence that the appellants were held after\n\nthe initiation of criminal proceedings, required to post a\n\nmonetary bond upon arraignment, subjected to restrictions on\n\ntheir   travel,     or   otherwise     exposed      to   any     significant\n\ndeprivation    of     liberty.      While    the    imposition      upon   the\n\nappellants here was marginally greater than the imposition upon\n\nBritton — they were required to appear several times at the\n\ncourt's behest (including an appearance for trial) — the fact\n\nremains that the conditions of pretrial release to which they\n\nwere subjected simply do not approach the level necessary to\n\nconstitute a Fourth Amendment seizure.\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f           In an effort to persuade us to a contrary conclusion,\n\nthe appellants point to three decisions that have given some\n\ndegree of traction to Justice Ginsburg's concurrence.              Their\n\nbellwether case is Evans v. Ball, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"16995\"><a href=\"/opinion/16995/evans-v-ball/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1999).\n\nThere, the Fifth Circuit determined that the plaintiff in a\n\nBivens action had alleged a seizure within the meaning of the\n\nFourth Amendment based on the following:        (1) the plaintiff's\n\nreceipt of a summons to appear and answer to criminal charges;\n\n(2) his being fingerprinted, photographed, and forced to sign a\n\npersonal recognizance bond; and (3) his being required to report\n\nregularly to pretrial services, obtain permission before leaving\n\nthe state, and provide federal officers with financial and\n\nidentifying information.     Id. at 860-61.     The court concluded\n\nthat the restrictions imposed on the plaintiff diminished his\n\nliberty interest enough to render him seized under the Fourth\n\nAmendment.    Id. at 861.\n\n           The appellants' other two cases are cut from much the\n\nsame cloth.   In Gallo v. City of Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759473\"><a href=\"/opinion/759473/james-j-gallo-jr-rose-maria-gallo-v-city-of-philadelphia-renald/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\n\nCir. 1998), the court, calling it a \"close question,\" decided\n\nthat   a   section   1983   plaintiff   had   been   seized   in    the\n\nconstitutional sense where he was required to post a $10,000\n\nbond, attend all court hearings including his trial, contact\n\npretrial services weekly, and refrain from traveling outside New\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fJersey and Pennsylvania.        Id. at 222.     So too Murphy v. Lynn,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743587\"><a href=\"/opinion/743587/ernesto-murphy-v-john-lynn-individually-and-as-a-town-of-clarkstown/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1997), a two-to-one decision in which the\n\npanel determined that a plaintiff's obligation to attend court\n\nappointments, combined with a prohibition against leaving New\n\nYork, constituted a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.    Id. at 945.\n\n         We    need   not   comment   upon    the   soundness   of   these\n\ndecisions.    For present purposes, it suffices to say that they\n\nare materially distinguishable.          To mention the most glaring\n\ndifference, all three cases involved definitive restrictions on\n\nthe right to travel, and each of the courts in question placed\n\nheavy emphasis on the salience of such a restriction as a\n\nlinchpin of a seizure.      See Evans, 168 F.3d at 861-62; Gallo,\n\n161 F.3d at 224; Murphy, 118 F.3d at 945-46.             Conversely, no\n\nsuch restriction was in force vis-à-vis the appellants.                 For\n\nthis reason, and because the aggregate deprivations involved in\n\nEvans, Gallo, and       Murphy substantially exceeded the overall\n\ndeprivation imposed here, we regard the cases as inapposite.\n\n         That    ends    this   aspect   of   the   matter.     Given   the\n\nrelatively benign nature of the pretrial release conditions\n\ninvolved in this case, we hold that the appellants did not\n\nsuffer a post-arraignment seizure within the meaning of the\n\nFourth Amendment.     It follows inexorably that, in the absence of\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fan anchoring constitutional violation, the appellants' section\n\n1983 malicious prosecution claim topples.\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.7    A ripe civil rights suit was\n\nleft to rot.       Most of the appellants' claims are barred by the\n\noperation of the statute of limitations; those that are not fail\n\nfor lack of a constitutionally significant deprivation.            We\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\non the appellants' federal claims.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      The appellants also complain that the district court\nfrustrated their efforts during pretrial discovery to question\nMcSweeney about other incidents of police brutality. They claim\nthat they had a good-faith basis for the queries (a 1997\ninvestigatory report concluded that McSweeney had demonstrated\na pattern of needless provocation and excessive force in making\narrests) and that the information sought was relevant. But we\nhave concluded that the grant of summary judgment must be upheld\nbased on the statute of limitations (as to some claims) and the\nlack of a constitutional deprivation (as to the remaining\nclaims), see supra Part II, and no amount of discovery anent\nother incidents can alter this result. It is, therefore, a moot\npoint whether the discovery limitation was right or wrong.\n\n                                  -28-\n\f</pre>",
